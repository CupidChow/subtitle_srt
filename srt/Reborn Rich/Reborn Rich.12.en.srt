(Reborn Rich)

2
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,960
What? Chairman Jin did?

3
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,700
Okay, I'll be there soon.

4
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,870
Did something happen to my husband?

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,709
No, ma'am.

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,608
Another chairman in the VIP ward...

7
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,409
is looking for me urgently.

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,709
Excuse me.

9
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,780
Isn't Director Jung behaving strangely?

10
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,989
I think...

11
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,390
your father is awake, that's why.

12
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,959
Mother, why are you saying that?

13
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,859
You're scaring me.

14
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,969
If he actually did,

15
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,670
Director Jung would tell us first thing.

16
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,109
Everyone is waiting for that news.

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,739
My gut feeling is definitely right.

18
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,209
It's delirium.

19
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,950
Your brain function deteriorates,

20
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,189
which is accompanied by a decline of attention and cognition,

21
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,319
delusion, and movement disorder.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,659
Is this the aftermath of the accident?

23
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,089
He didn't have any issue even when he was admitted.

24
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,099
So why suddenly...

25
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,458
The most critical thing...

26
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,799
for his brain arteriovenous malformation is...

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,099
physical and external shock.

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,139
Due to the accident,

29
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,569
a small amount of bleeding occurred in his head today.

30
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,379
He is showing symptoms of delirium because of that.

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,750
Can you treat him?

32
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,080
I can't be certain.

33
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,789
The most important thing for treating delirium is...

34
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,258
getting rid of the illness that causes it.

35
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,489
But for him, his brain arteriovenous malformation...

36
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,289
is placed deep inside the frontal lobe,

37
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,800
and in the current state where the blood vessel is swollen,

38
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,300
it's already a miracle that the vessel did not burst.

39
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:42,969
Director Jung, hold on.

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,469
What about using injections or medication?

41
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:48,669
I mean...

42
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,139
Is there absolutely no method to lessen the symptoms of delirium?

43
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,849
Stimulants used to make people snap out of delirium...

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,680
normally increases your blood pressure or heart rate.

45
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,620
So it might be critical for patients like Chairman Jin...

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,719
who has a high risk of a brain hemorrhage.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,830
Can he attend...

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,069
the board meeting tomorrow?

49
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,979
Why do you look like you saw a ghost?

50
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,150
It's almost nine.

51
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,349
It'll be terrible if we get stuck in a traffic jam.

52
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,360
Do Jun, what are you doing? Get ready.

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,430
Gosh, Chairman Jin.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Why don't you take a rest today?

55
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,009
Are you saying that...

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,610
because you don't know what today's board meeting means to me?

57
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,679
I'll attend the board meeting alone, Grandfather.

58
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,150
Just rest here.

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,919
I'm not sick.

60
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,060
The members of the board only listen to me.

61
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,659
I'll get the financial holding company setup approved...

62
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,959
and recommend you as the CEO candidate.

63
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,479
- Grandfather. - Let's go.

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Sir.

65
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,149
- Sir, please. - What?

66
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,720
You're going to a board meeting...

67
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,290
at nine o'clock at night?

68
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,470
Dressed like that?

69
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,500
Grandfather.

70
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,810
It's just a light aftermath of the accident.

71
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,209
Don't worry about anything and take a rest.

72
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,519
You'll get better soon enough.

73
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,689
I'm going.

74
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,660
I have to go.

75
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,860
Bring me medicine.

76
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,699
If medicine will cure me, I'll take medication.

77
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,869
If cutting open my head will cure me,

78
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,138
- I'll cut my head open, then go! - Sir!

79
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,949
Mr. Lee, call Director Jung in quickly.

80
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,410
Oh, dear.

81
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,189
What are you doing? Go call Director Jung in quickly!

82
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,720
You jerk!

83
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,889
Tell Director Jung to come in.

84
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,459
Tell Director Jung to come in!

85
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,028
Do Jun, there's no way you can do it.

86
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:35,800
The members of the board only listen to me, Jin Yang Cheol!

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,970
I am Jin Yang Cheol!

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,579
Let's go.

89
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm going.

90
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,289
- Sir. - Let me go.

91
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,458
- Please, sir. - Let me go, you punk!

92
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,529
Grandfather!

93
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,300
If your delirium kicks in during the board meeting,

94
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,870
the financial holding company will be the least of your worries.

95
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,379
The management right of Soonyang Corporation, no.

96
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,680
You'll have to step down as the chairman too.

97
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,660
Do you really want that?

98
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,939
(List of Board Members for Founding Soonyang Financial Holding Company)

99
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,449
Please answer me, Mr. Oh.

100
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,049
How can we get the board to approve...

101
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,449
the founding of the financial holding company without Grandfather?

102
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,089
Does that make sense?

103
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,318
That's like going to the World Cup without a striker.

104
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,490
Who is going to score?

105
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,660
All our training and planning are focused on the striker, and now...

106
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:11,800
Did something happen?

107
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,199
The match hasn't started yet.

108
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,769
Majority of 15 board members is 8 votes.

109
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,240
We need to find a new way for me to get their votes...

110
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,610
- from now on... - There's none.

111
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,410
Was his name Jin Seong Jun?

112
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,579
The CEO of Soonyang Venture Investment.

113
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,048
He moved aggressively...

114
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,548
and already secured the majority of negative votes.

115
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,320
Young expat, there is no way you will win the votes by number.

116
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,899
So I can't win from the vote, right?

117
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,349
You want me to cast a vote...

118
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,750
for the founding of the financial holding company...

119
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,690
during tomorrow's board meeting?

120
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
Why should I?

121
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,129
Because Grandfather is watching.

122
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,610
Haven't you thought it was strange?

123
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,980
For other patients in coma in the ICU,

124
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,610
they let the family see them over the glass window...

125
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,620
to check whether they're alive or not, at least.

126
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,289
So why was Grandfather not allowed a visit...

127
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,059
from anyone, including family members?

128
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,799
Because Grandfather is...

129
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,870
not in a coma.

130
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,100
He is healthier...

131
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,669
than ever, both his mind and body.

132
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,049
You expect me to trust you?

133
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,519
Since the accident until now,

134
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,388
I was by Grandfather's side.

135
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,490
Then why? Why?

136
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:21,059
Why is he making a mockery of his family with such a lie?

137
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,730
Do you know that reason as well?

138
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,100
It wasn't a car accident.

139
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,669
It was an instigated murder attempt.

140
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,980
Someone...

141
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,250
faked a car accident...

142
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,429
and tried to kill Grandfather and me.

143
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,199
To prevent the founding...

144
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,529
of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

145
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,870
Grandfather will attend...

146
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,139
tomorrow's board meeting.

147
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,148
He thinks...

148
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,378
the culprit is among those who try to make the founding...

149
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,649
of the financial holding company fall through...

150
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,049
during...

151
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,259
tomorrow's board meeting.

152
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:43,639
A lot of people must be against it, so why did you come to me?

153
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,980
Because I have a conclusive clue...

154
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,080
of the instigation of murder.

155
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,450
Are you saying I'm the culprit?

156
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,830
I guess I'll find out...

157
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,230
at the board meeting tomorrow.

(Board Meeting for Founding Soonyang Financial Holding Company)

160
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,508
I'm CEO Oh Se Hyeon of Soonyang Investment,

161
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,479
the host company of the board meeting.

162
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,889
I will conduct the board meeting as the temporary chairperson today.

163
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,018
The first agenda is the vote for the establishment...

164
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,690
of the financial holding company.

165
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,559
And if that agenda passes,

166
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,200
we will continue with the vote for the CEO of the company.

167

The weather is great today, sir.

168
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,240
You've always liked...

169
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,139
sunny days like this.

170
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,940
You should get well soon...

171
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,940
and enjoy this weather.

172
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,309
Right, sir?

173
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,009
All right. The first agenda.

174
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,548
Let's vote for the establishment of the financial holding company...

175
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,018
by raising your hands.

176
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,149
(Jin Seong Jun, Jin Dong Ki)

177
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:06,289
If you are in favor of the agenda, please raise your hands.

178
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,199
(Jin Dong Ki)

179
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,499
(Jin Young Ki)

180
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,370
(Board Meeting for Founding Soonyang Financial Holding Company)

181
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,289
(Jin Young Ki)

182
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,558
Since the majority is in favor with ten votes,

183
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,799
the founding of Soonyang Financial Holding Company is passed.

184
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,339
You moved Seong Jun?

185
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,740
We will have a ten-minute break.

186
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,038
- Then we will vote for the CEO... - How?

187
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,679
of the financial holding company.

188
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,590
You passed the agenda for the financial holding company?

189
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,919
You don't realize what you did, do you?

190
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,658
You made it easy for Do Jun...

191
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,259
to take over Soonyang with your own hands, you hear me?

192
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,429
As the eldest grandson of the family,

193
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:24,200
I just made the choice that is best for Soonyang's future.

194
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,779
Being a pushover is your family's thing, isn't it?

195
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:35,980
Sure, Seong Jun. Continue your family's tradition.

196
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,450
Darn it.

197
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,919
I don't understand.

198
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,928
He's not dumb.

199
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,259
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

200
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,428
He must know that whoever becomes the CEO...

201
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,668
of the financial holding company...

202
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:55,798
will become the official successor...

203
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,999
of Soonyang internally and externally.

204
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,299
Especially when Father is bedridden like now.

205
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,409
Does Do Jun...

206
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,279
have something on him?

207
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,019
Next, the voting for the candidates for the CEO position will commence.

208
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,720
These two are the candidates recommended to the board.

209
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,990
(Board Meeting for Founding Soonyang Financial Holding Company)

210
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,689
Managing Director Lee Hang Jae...

211
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,360
recommended by the company board.

212
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,329
And Director Jin Do Jun of Miracle Investment...

213
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,629
recommended by Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

214
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,370
A board meeting? A vote?

215
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,639
After putting up a perfect second fiddle like Mr. Lee?

216
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:41,409
It's over.

217
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,449
The moment you let the agenda for the founding pass,

218
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,450
everything ended.

219
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,950
If you don't have any more candidates to recommend,

220
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,189
- vote... - I recommend a candidate.

221
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,120
(Jin Do Jun, Jin Hwa Young)

222
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,830
What are you doing?

223
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,960
You told me...

224
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,070
to look out for myself.

225
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,470
May I?

226
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,669
Yes, CEO Jin Seong Jun. Go ahead.

227
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,740
(Jin Hwa Young)

228
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,450
(Jin Do Jun)

229
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,460
Soonyang must become young.

230
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,789
Director Jin Do Jun who reformed capitalism...

231
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,659
via Buy Miracle Fund, dollar cost averaging fund.

232
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,169
And Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's recommendation.

233
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes, I respect that.

234
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,408
If Director Jin Do Jun becomes the CEO...

235
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,110
of Soonyang Financial Holding Company,

236
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,940
Soonyang will definitely become younger.

237
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,279
Because young CEOs and employees will be employed...

238
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,980
for the affiliates of the company to match him.

239
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,289
Is there your place...

240
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,389
in that young Soonyang?

241
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,240
Soonyang Financial Holding Company that is taking its first step...

242
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,368
needs your experience and wisdom you built...

243
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,410
from sacrificing your youth.

244
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,949
So I recommend someone that knows the value...

245
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,579
of your experience and wisdom more than anyone else.

246
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,679
I recommend Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki...

247
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,750
as the first CEO of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

248
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,568
The reason he was in favor...

249
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,009
of founding the financial holding company...

250
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,450
was for this?

251
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,509
He made all of us play second fiddle...

252
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,819
and prepared a feast for his father.

253
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,859
We'll vote for the candidate selection...

254
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,029
with a show of hands as well.

255
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,579
Should we vote for it?

256
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,450
What he said...

257
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,720
He'll find out when the board meeting is held?

258
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:39,258
The person who makes the founding of the financial holding company...

259
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,690
fall through and drags you down from the CEO position is...

260
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,000
the person who instigated murder?

261
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:51,399
I agreed to the formation of a holding company,

262
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,440
yet I dragged you down from the CEO's position.

263
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,240
Does this make me the culprit or not?

264
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm worried.

265
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,579
Grandfather better like the board meeting result.

266
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,059
By the way, Do Jun.

267
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,029
Can we really call Grandfather...

268
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,900
the same Chairman Jin Yang Cheol?

269
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:30,970
Do you think it's okay...

270
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:36,980
to let him manage Soonyang when he's not sane?

271
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,059
Whether it's a car accident or a murder instigation,

272
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,599
I want to make it clear...

273
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,069
that my gallery has nothing to do...

274
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,569
with this painting's illegal trade, Prosecutor Seo.

275
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,009
It didn't belong to my gallery.

276
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,879
It's too much to call it a statement,

277
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,250
but are you going back on your word?

278
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,618
Last time, you said it was...

279
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:16,720
It was fake.

280
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,889
A replica...

281
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,930
that copied the bird and flower painting in my gallery.

282
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,899
According to the number of votes,

283
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,400
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki of Soonyang Corporation...

284
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:34,169
and Director Lee Hang Jae were...

285
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,139
selected as the CEO candidates...

286
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
for Soonyang Financial Holding Company with nine and three votes.

287
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,210
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol...

288
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,779
will be here soon.

289
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:49,190
- What? - What are you saying, Mr. Lee?

290
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,220
He's in the hospital. How can he come?

291
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,160
Chairman Jin is coming to the board meeting.

292
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,730
Right now.

293
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,909
You're Korea's opinion leaders.

294
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,369
But don't you read the newspaper or watch the news?

295
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,909
Haven't you heard that I, Jin Yang Cheol,

296
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,410
didn't get hurt at all...

297
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,219
thanks to Soonyang Motors' outstanding safety technology?

298
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,619
The official press release must've been released.

299
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,390
What?

300
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,429
Does the rumor say...

301
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,798
the mean old man is in critical condition?

302
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,900
- No, sir. - No.

303
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,209
I got sick of pretending to be sick,

304
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,140
so I decided to come.

305
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:24,149
Mr. Oh, please continue.

306
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,980
Don't mind me.

307
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,219
More than the majority agreed...

308
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,920
to the establishment of the financial holding company.

309
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,160
Then...

310
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:39,859
is it time to vote for the CEO candidates?

311
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,470
Yes, sir.

312
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,440
I...

313
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,039
recommended...

314
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,440
Jin Do Jun for a candidate.

315
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,119
What do the board members think?

316
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,630
Mr. Oh, what are you doing?

317
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,970
Hurry up and ask for the board members' opinion.

318
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,640
I'll proceed.

319
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,069
For Soonyang Financial Holding Company's CEO candidate,

320
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,380
if you think Director Jin Do Jun is appropriate for that position,

321
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:29,710
please raise your hand.

322
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,029
Director Jung. What's going on?

323
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,139
You said my husband was in the ICU,

324
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,439
but apparently, he's in the board meeting right now.

325
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,838
Is that true?

326
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,809
Well...

327
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,578
You should've told me first...

328
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:37,579
if Chairman Jin woke up.

329
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,650
You made me come all the way here and check?

330
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:44,249
You know how worried I was!

331
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,589
I'm sorry, ma'am.

332
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:49,959
Chairman Jin insisted he'll tell his family himself.

333
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,028
You couldn't even wear an old man down...

334
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,230
when you're a hospital director?

335
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,328
Only if I'd known.

336
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,568
A board meeting on a cold day like this?

337
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:01,470
That is impossible.

338
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,409
From now on, give me a call first...

339
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,380
regarding his condition, not his secretary.

340
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,990
I made myself clear.

341
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,869
Director Jung.

342
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,299
Can you give me...

343
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,809
two hours?

344
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm not asking you to save me.

345
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,119
I'm not asking you to fix my brain.

346
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,059
Two hours.

347
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,670
Just for two hours,

348
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:07,440
let me live...

349
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,109
as myself, as Jin Yang Cheol.

350
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,449
There is a medication...

351
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,950
to keep you awake...

352
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,150
and prevent signs of delirium.

353
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,390
- Is that so? - But...

354
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,930
for patients with cerebrovascular diseases like you,

355
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:32,200
it can be life-threatening.

356
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,829
Would you still risk it...

357
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,470
for two hours?

358
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,890
You must've gone through a lot to fill in for me while I was gone.

359
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,660
I only did what I had to, sir.

360
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,660
Now, you can relax.

361
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,029
Your father is back.

362
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,569
The day you returned,

363
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,809
the agenda for the establishment of the holding company also passed.

364
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,609
We have two occasions to celebrate.

365
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,619
Is that what kids these days say?

366
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,920
Call a matter of course a celebration?

367
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,619
Oh, Father.

368
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,059
I was worried about you, Father.

369
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,129
I thought something had happened to you.

370
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,230
It's okay.

371
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,329
How are you feeling?

372
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,140
As good as new.

373
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,180
I've returned to Soonyang Venture Investment.

374
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,509
I will not let you down.

375
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,109
It's not a small company.

376
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,049
It could change the market flow.

377
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,819
My dear boy.

378
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:10,789
Make a storm.

379
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:16,298
Like you who established Soonyang Corporation...

380
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,499
with an aggressive overseas investment...

381
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,700
during the second oil crisis?

382
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,068
Did you see that?

383
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:24,539
He's my eldest grandson. Yes.

384
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,980
- Grandfather. - Yes?

385
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,410
When did the second oil crisis occur exactly?

386
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,980
I always get it mixed up with the first oil crisis.

387
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,689
You'd remember it vividly.

388
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,049
What a curious boy.

389
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,690
It was 197...

390
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,000
It was 197...

391
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:15,630
It was 197...

392
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,599
The 70s...

393
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,779
It was 1979, right?

394
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:44,190
You taught me last time.

395
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,959
Mr. Lee. He seems tired.

396
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,059
I'll take him home.

397
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,500
Yes.

398
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,240
Oh, can you organize the luncheon, Father?

399
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,309
Come with me, Grandfather.

400
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,869
Do Jun must be in a rush.

401
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,140
You arrogant boy.

402
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,909
The first oil shock from 1973 to 1974.

403
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,679
The second oil shock from 1979 to 1980.

404
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,720
I know that.

405
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,289
I remember it clearly.

406
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,389
How dare you show off when you couldn't even dominate...

407
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,630
the board meeting and failed to seize the opportunity?

408
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,058
I dare you to come after me!

409
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,430
I founded Soonyang!

410
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,970
I, Jin Yang Cheol, am the owner...

411
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,539
of the global corporation Soonyang!

412
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:55,619
Stop it, Grandfather!

413
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,119
If you can't trust me, stay healthy for a long time.

414
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,989
So you can be the owner of your favorite Soonyang...

415
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,460
for a long, long time!

416
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,650
I'm sorry, ma'am.

417
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:32,059
I got my grandfather's temper.

418
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:38,900
I'll do it.

419
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,470
It's okay.

420
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,000
So, when did Father recover?

421
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,068
How can he be so healthy...

422
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,710
when he woke up from a coma just this morning?

423
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,109
He was never in a coma.

424
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,079
What?

425
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,220
He thinks the car accident...

426
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,150
was an instigated murder.

427
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:37,920
An instigated murder?

428
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,858
Then he should call the police.

429
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:43,289
Why did he lie?

430
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,529
Seong Jun. How did you know?

431
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,430
Do Jun told me.

432
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,339
That Grandfather put a trap that he was in coma and waited.

433
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,939
That anyone who tries to founder...

434
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,180
the establishment of the holding company is the culprit.

435
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:09,619
What?

436
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,119
Me?

437
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,019
But... Yes.

438
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,959
It was you...

439
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,760
who tried to pull Do Jun down from the CEO position.

440
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:27,000
Did you do it?

441
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,809
I'm regretting it.

442
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,179
Young Ki.

443
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,920
If...

444
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,420
I had the guts to do that,

445
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,359
I wouldn't have let Father control my whole life...

446
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,199
and come this far.

447
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,699
We're all the same.

448
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,570
That's what...

449
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,980
the three of us mean...

450
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,949
to Father.

451
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:13,380
All we think about...

452
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,489
is stealing his pocket,

453
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,420
and in the end,

454
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,389
we put a knife to his throat.

455
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,510
(Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong)

456
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,980
This bird and flower painting was made before the 1900s.

457
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,460
I can feel...

458
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:57,159
the trace of time from that painting.

459
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,460
That's why it's fake.

460
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,000
I called the professional conservators last year...

461
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,368
and restored the bird and flower paintings...

462
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,699
in my gallery.

463
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,539
Antiques have a lot of replicas.

464
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,880
More than contemporary arts.

465
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,150
Because it's hard to distinguish fake from real.

466
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,250
That must involve a lot of money.

467
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,879
Some galleries probably became famous...

468
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,949
by distributing replicas only.

469
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,960

I heard this was bought from here. Is it true?

476
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,070
To me, all the paintings look alike.

477
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,400
You should come back...

478
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,510
when my boss is here.

479
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,980
Can I meet her now?

480
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,909
What's the matter?

481
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:23,809
I need a gift urgently.

482
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,380
I want to buy this painting.

483
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,150
Please.

484
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,889
This is her number. You should call her.

485
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,300
Thank you.

486
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,928
What is this called?

487
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,969
- A seal. - A seal?

488
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,039
It can either have your name or a pen name.

489
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:50,909
Anyway, artists use it to leave a sign that it was drawn by them.

490
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,739
Like this.

491
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,079
I see. I'll contact the CEO.

Yes, Mr. Woo?

00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,900
I found the owner of this memo.

498
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,889
It's me, Chairman Jin.

499

So it's true.

500

Gosh. Thank you, dear Almighty.

Goodness.

00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,960
Was it...

504
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,000
really you?

505
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:37,739
If so,

506
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,250
were you trying...

507
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,550
to have me killed?

508
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,619
Why can't you answer me?

509
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,599
I'm sorry.

510
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,570
I was out of my mind.

511
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:13,340
I will do everything you tell me to.

512
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:15,809
So forgive me. Please?

513
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,750
You know, don't you?

514
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,219
All my life,

515
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:26,489
I did my very best for you.

516
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,530
But you were going to hand over...

517
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:34,500
Soonyang to Yoon Ki's young son.

518
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,928
The absurdity and unfairness over the years...

519
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,969
are a part of my misfortunes.

520
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:44,669
But I will not see my children...

521
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,738
nearing 60 standing behind Yoon Ki and his son...

522
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,409
like a wall.

523
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,719
It is my fault for giving birth...

524
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,150
to those foolish kids you are not pleased with.

525
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,619
But please...

526
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,659
overlook this incident, not for me but for the kids.

527
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,599
Chairman Jin.

528
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,070
Consider it paying me for using me for 50 years...

529
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,639
and raising the kids.

530
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,059
I'm hungry.

531
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,130
Are you trying to starve your husband to death?

532
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,030
Go ahead and check.

533
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:48,139
There's nothing to eat in the kitchen.

534
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,869
Are you taking care of the house or not?

535
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:58,409
Or are you exerting power over me for giving birth to one son?

536
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
Stop sitting there and chatting away.

537
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,389
Go to the market and get me a row of eggs.

538
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:11,829
I want fried eggs.

539
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,549
What do you mean there is someone to control access...

540
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,118
to your grandfather's room?

541
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,250
Who is it?

542
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:41,820
I'll tell you after we talk to Grandfather, Father.

543
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,760
- Grandmother. - Mother.

544
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,670
Your father was throwing a tantrum to move to our house.

545
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:53,738
He's not even in a coma.

546
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,840
There's no reason to feed him hospital food.

547
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,570
Don't you agree, Do Jun?

548
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,010
Yes, Grandmother.

549
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,908
But Grandmother, the discharge procedure...

550
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:07,019
They're going to take care of it.

551
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:14,559
Let's go to Jeongsimjae, Chairman Jin.

552
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,760
Our house.

553
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,360
Grandmother.

554
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,038
Father, please see them off.

555
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,070
Sure.

556
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,409
Doctor, what happened? What is this about the discharge procedure?

557
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,150
Ms. Lee knew everything when she came.

558
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:42,149
What's more, living in an environment...

559
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,649
Chairman Jin is used to, his house in this case,

560
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,559
might help him with his delirium more.

561
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,199
It's almost time for your husbands to come home.

562
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:00,069
Is setting the table all we have to do now?

563
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,570
Are you that happy Father is back?

564
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:05,469
You're talking as if you're singing, Mother.

565
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,880
Yes, I'm that happy. Do you want me to sing a song for you?

566
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:13,519
Let's see.

567
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,949
Gosh, why didn't you boil it for longer?

568
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,488
Young Ki likes it when the meat is soft...

569
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:24,260
to the point it just slides off the bone.

570
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,860
Because of your deep love for him,

571
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:31,030
he became an overly soft-hearted man.

572
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,669
He's an absolute softie,

573
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,539
unable to talk back to Father once.

574
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,479
Why don't you try to raise your husband to your liking?

575
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,809
I doubt you can.

576
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,550
But if you can, I'll call you Mother.

577
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,250
- Keep up the good work. - Okay.

578
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:55,789
Jeong Rae.

579
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,559
Did your husband tell you anything?

580
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,099
About tonight's dinner.

581
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,900
Isn't it to celebrate Father's discharge?

582
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,369
Or is there another reason?

583
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:09,070
Mother called everyone home except for Do Jun's family.

584
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:10,710
Isn't it obvious?

585
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,250
I asked the kids to come over.

586
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,719
To have dinner with everyone.

587
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,780
It's a relief, isn't it?

588
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:52,409
Without knowing what a terrible thing...

589
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,489
I had done to you for the rest of your life,

590
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:59,889
you'll live happily and leave this world peacefully.

591
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,730
But even if you had known about it,

592
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,530
nobody in this world...

593
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,670
would believe your words.

594
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,780
I'm going to tell everyone about it during dinner.

595
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,679
Your condition.

596
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,250
Only then...

597
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,019
can they fulfill their duties as our kids.

598
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:44,599
You've finally become my true husband.

599
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,070
My dear chairman.

600
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,400
What about Father?

601
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:25,570
Where's the star of tonight's discharge celebration party?

602
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,749
Is Father unwell?

603
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,380
Hey, didn't you hear it during the day?

604
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,749
Father called himself a fake patient.

605
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,920
That was why Mother brought him home.

606
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,050
What is it, Mother?

607
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:41,519
What did you want to tell us about Father's health?

608
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,900
Don't...

609
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,829
be so shocked.

610
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,010
Your father...

611
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,920
Ma'am, Do Jun is here.

612
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:14,590
Good evening.

613
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,659
I'm here, Grandmother.

614
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,199
What brings you here?

615
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,329
I don't recall calling you over for dinner.

616
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,469
Here.

617
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,170
I couldn't keep it to myself.

618
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:53,199
(Medical Report, Sim Gallery)

619
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,150
What is it, Mother? What does it say?

620
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,420
It's Grandfather's medical report.

621
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,719
I thought Grandmother would need it.

622
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,559
It seems like I shouldn't be here.

623
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,269
Grandmother.

624
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,139
I'll be in your studio.

625
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,039
Enjoy your dinner.

626
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,578
What medical report?

627
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:46,919
Didn't you have something to tell us...

628
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,320
regarding Father's health before Do Jun came?

629
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,219
Is Father really sick?

630
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,690
Like how?

631
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,460
- Tell us. - Please say something.

632
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,429
Your father...

633
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,840
He's healthy without any after-effects...

634
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,110
from the car accident.

635
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,749
That's great news.

636
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,650
And yet, you didn't call Do Jun's family to dinner?

637
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,550
You have more to say, don't you?

638
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:26,590
About an important matter within our family or something.

639
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,018
In our family, nothing is more important...

640
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,030
than your father's health.

641
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,670
(Diagnosis)

642
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:41,400
You're right. Our father is healthy.

643
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,569
But isn't this the biggest problem?

644
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,638
How could you say such...

645
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,979
Mother, our father accuses us...

646
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,609
of being despicable and immoral kids...

647
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,848
who would incite a car crash to gain his wealth.

648
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:54,480
This is the least I can say about him.

649
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,288
Enough. Your nephew and niece are here too.

650
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:00,119
He should've caught a fatal disease.

651
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,059
I would blame that for his clouded judgment.

652
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,699
Then...

653
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,199
I wouldn't feel this betrayed.

654
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,969
Please excuse me.

655
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:26,010
Let's dig in.

656
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,309
What is it that you want to say?

657
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,679
What couldn't you keep to yourself?

658
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,119
This white camellia...

659
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:38,989
you leave as a seal on your paintings.

660
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:42,260
I looked into what it meant.

661
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,190
A secret love.

662
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,230
The parent's love towards their child.

663
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,230
Something along those lines.

664
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:04,480
Oh, right. Are there such feelings...

665
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:07,349
in here too?

666
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,460
(Seoul 27, G 3395)

667
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:48,289
I will keep your secret, Grandmother.

668
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:50,889
So you should keep...

669
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,900
Grandfather's secret, Grandmother.

670
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,269
Nobody who comes and goes Jeongsimjae,

671
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,139
especially our family members,

672
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,570
must know about Grandfather's delirium...

673
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:07,940
until the board meeting ends.

674
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,550
How dare you...

675
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,179
threaten an old lady like me.

676
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,949
I thought it was a deal, Grandmother.

677
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:25,590
Threatening you...

678
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,400
starts now.

679
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:34,469
If anyone in our family...

680
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:37,639
finds out about Grandfather's delirium,

681
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,579
I will not keep your secret anymore.

682
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,849
Everything from the memo abetting the murder...

683
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:53,989
to the counterfeit painting as the price.

684
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,329
I'll submit them to the prosecution as evidence to prove your charges.

685
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:06,840
It was because of you.

686
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,340
If only you hadn't appeared...

687
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,710
If only you hadn't dared desire Soonyang,

688
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,719
this would not have happened.

689
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,219
That day. On Grandfather's 60th birthday party.

690
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:32,059
The one who invited my family after years of going no contact...

691
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,460
was you, Grandmother.

692
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,940
Do whatever it takes to protect Grandfather.

693
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,650
In doing so, you'll protect yourself.

694
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:54,340
How long have you been standing there?

695
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:58,079
I got here right before you called me.

696
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,849
Director Jung was right.

697
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:08,389
He said you'd feel much better back at Jeongsimjae.

698
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,489
The effect is more positive than I thought.

699
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:13,960
Even I don't know...

700
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,099
what's going on inside my own head.

701
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,099
How could Director Jung know?

702
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:26,409
I came to see how you're feeling.

703
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,210
I'll go home now. Get some rest, Grandfather.

704
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,349
Do Jun.

705
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:35,280
Yes, Grandfather?

706
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,119
Why won't you tell me?

707
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,760
Mr. Woo must've reported to you.

708
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,300
Who did he say instigated the accident?

709
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:52,469
Who is it?

710
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,739
Who tried to kill me?

711
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,349
We're still looking.

712
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,159
The bird and flower painting. It didn't belong to Ms. Mo.

713
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,230
I'll tell you as soon as we find out.

714
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,030
Don't worry.

715
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,599
- You will? - Yes.

716
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,239
Let me ask you one thing.

717
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:41,880
All my other kids wanted to impress me...

718
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,619
and try to inherit Soonyang.

719
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:52,159
Why did you say you'd buy Soonyang?

720
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,199
You want something else, don't you?

721
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:06,110
What is that?

722
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:16,989
Tell me.

723
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:29,559
What? Is it a secret?

724
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,869
Did you get what you wanted?

725
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:41,780
No, not yet.

726
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,420
I hope...

727
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,489
you get it.

728
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:05,329
I will, Grandfather.

729
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,570
I will.

730
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,820
Hello.

731
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,460
How did things go at Sim Gallery?

732
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:36,059
Did you find any leads?

733
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:38,630
Did you find out who traded the painting?

734
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,099
It must be upsetting.

735
01:01:46,139 --> 01:01:47,780
You asked so many questions,

736
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,480
and I only have one answer.

737
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,079
I didn't find anything.

738
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,590
You said you had to see me today,

739
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:02,420
so I thought you'd found something.

740
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,698
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

741
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:10,199
I heard Sim Gallery sells forgeries,

742
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:12,300
so I looked into their accounts...

743
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,739
to see if money was laundered.

744
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:18,639
I followed the money flow to some borrowed name accounts...

745
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,639
and came across a name you'd know. Take a look.

746
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,760
Min Yeong.

747
01:02:40,829 --> 01:02:44,130
The accident Grandfather and I were in. We decided to...

748
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,840
wrap it up as the police did...

749
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:51,039
and call it a random accident.

750
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,809
I put you through a great deal.

751
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,480
I won't bother you again.

752
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,619
I asked to see you to say that, even though it was late.

753
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:21,340
You have an idea...

754
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,210
what the name is that I found.

755
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:29,309
You did find a lead at the gallery.

756
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,780
You also know who traded that painting.

757
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,050
That's why...

758
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:38,619
you feel uncomfortable that I, that my office is investigating.

759
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,119
The board meeting is over anyway,

760
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,960
and you don't doubt you'll be voted as CEO of the holding company...

761
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,099
at the shareholder meeting.

762
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:53,940
Yes. That's it.

763
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:03,909
Right.

764
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,949
Just when I forget, you remind me.

765
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,019
That decision is true to your identity as an heir.

766
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:17,690
Now I must make a decision that's true to mine.

767
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:24,230
Goodbye.

768
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,489
What do you think?

769
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:55,630
What if the one who planned that dangerous a thing...

770
01:04:56,929 --> 01:04:59,500
with a forged painting is a member of your family?

771
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:04,610
Does anyone come to mind?

772
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,739
Anyone could've done it, and it wouldn't seem strange.

773
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,050
You suspected me too,

774
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,480
for the attempted murder of my grandfather and Do Jun.

775
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,619
I just got flustered as soon as I saw the painting.

776
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,659
I didn't suspect you.

777
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,659
Do you still want to know...

778
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:31,769
who I gave the real painting...

779
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,000
from your gallery to?

780
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,599
It doesn't matter.

781
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:39,139
I trust you.

782
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:45,980
Would you like some wine?

783
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,460
You've changed a lot.

784
01:06:03,099 --> 01:06:04,199
Life here...

785
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,480
must've been rough.

786
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:23,920
You don't have to try so hard around me.

787
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,760
I told you.

788
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,559
You're bearable...

789
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:34,659
only when you don't care at all...

790
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,929
what others think.

791
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:42,739
Don't act like you're clueless.

792
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:45,539
There are many such women out there.

793
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:59,989
Thanks for recommending wine.

794
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,920
It just doesn't taste as good at home.

795
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:42,900
It's our first ever drink together, isn't it, Father?

796
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,599
Yes, it is. I should've invited you sooner, sir.

797
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:49,940
I married your daughter a while ago,

798
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:52,969
and you still can't relax around me.

799

I know that...

800
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:59,650
you rushed the wedding to gain my grandfather's connections...

801
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,550
more than a son-in-law.

802
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,449
Why would you say that?

803
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:05,989
Did my daughter do anything insulting?

804
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:09,320
Don't worry about my wife.

805
01:08:09,889 --> 01:08:11,090
She has me.

806
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:19,829
From now on, I'd like you to be not Chairman Jin's in-law...

838
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:36,500
Is that true?

839
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,239
People can be so silly.

840
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,550
We're no longer ruled by a monarchy.

841
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,449
In this age of capitalism, if we can't protect our shareholders,

842
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:52,949
then of course we'll lose management rights.

843
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,630
You always talked about the global standard.

844
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,629
Politicians are going crazy,

845
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,769
demanding you agree to a hearing.

846
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,840
They're jabbing fingers in the air and yelling.

847
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,340
It paints a pretty pre-election picture.

848
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,510
Let's try to weather the storm for now.

849
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,679
You can point and yell at the sky...

850
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,810
because there's thunder and lightning,

851
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,380
but you'll only get wet.

852
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,590
Right?

853
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:30,420
Half and half.

854
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:34,398
The market's view of the likelihood the Prince's Rebellion will work.

855
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:37,059
However charismatic Jin Yang Cheol may be,

856
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,500
It won't be easy this time.

857
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:41,569
Soonyang Motors owes four billion dollars.

858
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,908
Soonyang Empire's princes didn't target Soonyang Motors...

859
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:46,710
because of the chairman.

860
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:48,909
It's because of you, young expat.

861
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,809
Soonyang Motors' incredible operating loss.

862
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:54,420
How will they cover that? Through the financial affiliates.

863
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,749
Jin Yang Cheol wants to use...

864
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,648
the financial affiliates as his personal wallet...

865
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,859
which is why he recommended his youngest grandson...

866
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,889
as the holding company CEO.

867
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:07,590
That's why the others must ensure you do not win the vote.

868
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:11,169
Well... That is very convincing.

869
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,470
The timing is even better.

870
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:14,568
The shareholder meeting is in June,

871
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:16,170
and the new car release is in May.

872
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,609
If that car Apollo is a flop,

873
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:21,038
stock prices will plummet.

874
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:24,339
The vote will happen when the shareholders are furious.

875
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,149
Even I'd want to vote against Jin Yang Cheol.

876
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,590
Mr. Oh.

877
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:36,760
When is the shareholder meeting?

878
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:37,960
In June.

879
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:40,390
June...

880
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,439
June.

881
01:12:58,409 --> 01:12:59,510
June...

882
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,250
- Go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

883
01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:08,760
- Go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

884
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,229
- Go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

885
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:25,840
(Reborn Rich)

886
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,478
Will you delegate me all rights and authority to Apollo?

887
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:06,850
It's for the better, sir.

888
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,189
If Apollo flops, Do Jun will have to shoulder the blame.

889
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,090
Min Yeong. That investigation... Can't you just drop it?

890
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,720
That's why prosecutors exist.

891
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:19,988
No matter how much money or power they have,

892
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:21,500
there should be things you can't do.

893
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,728
I should revise my written will.

894
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:27,399
Yoon Ki's mom. You must have...

895
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,470
resented me a great deal.

896
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,979
I'm thinking of living more like your grandmother.

897
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,079
Chairman Jin!

898
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,850
Grandfather.

899
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:14,109
