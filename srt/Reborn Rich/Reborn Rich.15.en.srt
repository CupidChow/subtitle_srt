00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,159
After a long discussion,

4
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,100
Miracle Investment decided...

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,499
(Yoo Se Woong, Oh Hyo Nam, Jung Min Ok)

6
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,598
(Jin Do Jun, Oh Se Hyeon)

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,340
not to take over Soonyang Card.

8
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,468
Did you know that?

9
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,579
This is making a fool out of the creditors.

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,579
You can't do this now.

11
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:18,180
I've looked into Miracle Investment.

12
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,590
The third-generation heir is a majority shareholder, I heard.

13
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,259
I guess Soonyang wants to play tug of war with Cheongwadae...

14
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,230
and the creditors.

15
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,760
I'll take it.

16
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,359
I'll order a suspension of business of Soonyang Card.

17
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,430
You can't do that.

18
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,768
Suspension of business means bankruptcy.

19
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,640
How can we banks get back the bad debt?

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,539
Is Cheongwadae going to take responsibility?

21
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,208
The financial supervisory authority must take responsibility.

22
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,279
This happened because you issued credit cards to people...

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,848
who cannot even pay the money back.

24
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,378
How is that our fault?

25
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,249
It's the previous government's fault for blindly removing regulations...

26
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,519
saying we need to boost domestic demand to overcome the IMF crisis.

27
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,188
Since the power was handed over,

28
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,030
the current government must take responsibility.

29
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,499
Why would Cheongwadae be responsible for it?

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,230
You guys overissued credit cards for your own benefit!

(Creditors' Council for Soonyang Card's Normalization)

32
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:13,770
Miracle Investment will take responsibility.

33
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,110
Under just one condition.

34
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,210
What is that condition?

35
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,179
Fifty-one percent of people who became delinquents...

36
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,879
because they couldn't pay back the money...

37
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,949
is entrepreneurs in their 50s and unemployed.

38
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,590
They say Korea got over the IMF crisis early,

39
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,490
but for these people, the IMF crisis is still ongoing.

40
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,360
They need a second chance.

41
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,569
If they can't stand on the same starting line,

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,240
they at least need that much for the game to be fair.

43
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,780
Please introduce the personal workout rule.

44
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,979
So that delinquents can pay back their debts...

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,849
and start anew.

46
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,620
This is Miracle Investment's condition.

47
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,789
We will not allow the pardoning of credit card debts.

48
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,419
That's the principle of the President.

49
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,219
It's not pardoning.

50
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:06,959
I'm going to make them take responsibility...

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
for this card issue.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Taking responsibility is not something to shoulder morally...

53
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,228
but paying back the debt.

54
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,259
That's right.

55
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,098
If Cheongwadae and the creditors take responsibility...

56
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,530
of the workout,

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,840
Miracle Investment will take responsibility too.

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,138
How about Miracle Investment take over Soonyang Card...

59
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,409
and Daeyoung Card...

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,680
and retrieve all the bad debt?

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,620
Daeyoung Card too?

62
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,650
If Cheongwadae...

63
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,020
dampens the spirits of the two conglomerates,

64
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,129
Soonyang and Daeyoung, who are known for not following orders,

65
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,930
and solve the credit card issue,

66
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,199

You didn't tell me about Daeyoug Card before.

72
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,779
I thought they would agree to the personal workout policy...

73
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,680
only when the creditors changed their minds.

74
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,288

75

and run for President next time?

It's me, your eldest son.

102
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,069
For the last one year, I felt your empty spot...

and realized how lacking I was every single day.

who couldn't say anything he didn't mean.

113

without changing his expression...

115

I will now...

119

I'm so worried about you.

126
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,599
Why are you so proud...

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,029
of your infamous loan shark family of Myeong-dong?

128

He earns stinky money from markets...

129

and makes others shed tears.

130

Aren't you embarrassed at that age?

131
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,350
We used that dirty money...

132
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,519
to buy out all of Soonyang Corporation shares...

133

to turn my husband into the chairman.

134

Embarrassed? Me?

Is the bankruptcy announcement of Soonyang Card tomorrow?

138

Yes, Chairman Jin.

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,578
As soon as we receive two percent of the Corporation,

140
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,750
I'll contact Fair Trade Commission...

141
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,519
and start the process of making you the chairman of Soonyang.

143

144
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:44,199
Grandfather always said...

145
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,800
The group will be succeeded...

146

to the eldest son once again.

147
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,639
- Instead of who owns it... - My father, me,

148
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,709
and my son.

149
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,250
I always keep that in mind, Grandfather.

150
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,089
I kept my word.

151
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,220
- I will always do my best... - Boast about it...

152
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,060
only after you become...

153
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,959
the chairman, okay?

give a speech as the representative of the family.

156
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,059
Yes. As you said,

157
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,570
it's the speech...

158
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:53,799
of Soonyang's chairman that costs 1.6 billion dollars.

159
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,038
I just got a call that the creditors of Soonyang Card...

160
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,110
finished their last meeting.

161
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,809
They say Soonyang Card will be normalized soon.

162
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:07,548
- What? - The company...

163
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,919
that took over Soonyang Card...

164
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,019
must be strong financially.

165
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,590
They already paid back...

166
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,059
the tremendous amount of debt.

167
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,529
They paid back the debt?

168
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,529
Yes.

169
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,700
Then what about...

170
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,169
my shares of Soonyang Corporation?

171
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,309
I respect Young Ki...

172
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,710
- I'm the most handsome one, right? - and treat him as my elder.

173
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,309
I'm living just for Soonyang.

174
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,149
We fill the gaps of each other...

175
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,820
and work towards a better Soonyang.

176
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,590
Two percent of Soonyang Corporation shares was bait.

177
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,389
It was bait to get both Young Ki and me...

178
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,159
with Soonyang Card.

179
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:59,139
I thought Young Ki was going to win in a decision.

180
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
So?

181
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,909
Who is it?

182
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,909
The largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation?

183
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,679
For the past year,

184
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,418
the shares of Soonyang Corporation...

185
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,350
under Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki increased quite a lot.

186
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,090
Was that your work?

187
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,929
For CEO Jin Seong Jun's Soonyang Venture Investment...

188
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,959
which was unlisted,

189
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,700
you made it go public and earned seed money for him.

190
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,539
The shares of Soonyang Electronics kept increasing in capital.

191
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,610
I guess CEO Jin Seong Jun started the preparation...

192
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,240
for succession as well.

193
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:44,750
I learned everything from you.

194
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,519
Don't work too hard.

195
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,789
In the end,

196
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,619
you'll just become like me.

197
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,159
No way.

198
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,329
I don't covet the owner's position.

199
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,700
Because your owner is...

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,730
not the owner of Soonyang.

201
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,899
(1 Year Memorial Service of Deceased Chairman Jin Yang Cheol)

202
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,610
Because it is I, who designed the succession plan of Soonyang.

203
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,779
When I delivered bread,

204
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,549
I got quite a bit of breadcrumbs on my hands.

205
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:25,089
I passed my shares of Soonyang Corporation...

206
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,559
under borrowed names to the new owner that I chose.

207
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,090
- What are you... - That owner will become...

208
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,759
the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation.

209
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,570
So who is it?

210
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,370
Who is the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation?

211
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,179
It's me, Uncle.

212
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,279
What?

213
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,149
The person who took over Soonyang Card...

214
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,750
and the person who paid off the debt right after.

215
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,418
And the person who prevented the security of the two percent...

216
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,960
of Soonyang Corporation shares from falling into your hands.

217
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,129
It's all me.

218
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,899
You punk.

219
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,799
Were you planning this from the start?

220
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,840
You went between Dong Ki and me...

221
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,210
with the debt of 800 million dollars of the card company...

222
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,110
and made double the profit!

223
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,779
Twice, at that!

224
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,720
Yes. I needed money.

225
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,889
To take over the shares of Soonyang Corporation under borrowed names.

226
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,330
The largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation...

227
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,539
is me.

228
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,480
Welcome back.

229
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,620
Seong Jun.

230
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,190
What happened that he looks...

231
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,629
so gloomy?

232
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:12,960
Nothing happened.

233
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,200
He gave the speech for Grandfather's one-year memorial service.

234
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,100
I'm sure he feels empty.

235
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,110
He had a very strong sense of filial duty as a son.

236
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,739
Mother. Don't worry about Father.

237
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,178
Take an early rest today.

238
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,249
You must be very tired from the event.

239
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,710
- Go check on your father. - Okay.

240
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,190
Gosh, you're awake.

241
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,549
Hello.

242
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,570
You punk. Where are your manners?

243
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:55,210
- Do I look like a pushover? - Yes.

244
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,139
Yes!

245
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,049
For the past 30 years, I tried so hard...

246
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,149
not to think of you as a pushover.

247
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,549
My gaze, words, and habitual actions.

248
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:10,719
In case any of them would show my honest thoughts...

249
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,490
of looking down on you,

250
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,889
I behaved very carefully.

251
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,460
Because I couldn't let Grandfather find out.

252
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,898
- What? - "I cannot succeed Soonyang..."

253
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,570
"to a father whom even his own son looks down on."

254
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,039
You could never imagine how afraid I was...

255
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,240
at the thought...

256
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,240
of Grandfather suddenly announcing that.

257
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,518
That's why you are relaxed enough to drink liquor...

258
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,720
even after Do Jun became...

259
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,219
the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation...

260
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,659
and enjoy the feeling of being a loser.

261
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,090
Even if Do Jun is now the largest shareholder,

262
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,460
nothing changes.

263
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,759
What can he do?

264
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,299
As long as I have the management rights,

265
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,970
he can't even move the board of directors as he likes.

266
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,970
The world has changed, Father.

267
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,908
The world where corporate existed...

268
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:04,879
to earn money for the owner is over.

269
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,808
It's a world...

270
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,980
where darn stakeholders' rights and profit are more important.

271
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,819
Do Jun will try to exercise all rights he has...

272
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,149
as the largest shareholder.

273
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,888
- Do Jun. - Mr. Oh.

274
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,700
Why are you back in the office? Did something happen?

275
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,830
Are you guys getting off work now?

276
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,230
We should get off work before 12am for the 1st time in 2 months.

277
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,940
My family came to visit from the US.

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
I see.

279
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,539
What's that in your hand?

280
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,110
Champagne?

281
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,549
It's a day worth celebrating.

282
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,480
I became the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation.

283
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,450
I'm fine.

284
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,259
Don't mind me and go home.

285
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,559
- Young expat. - Yes.

286
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:57,490
- So you knew how to celebrate. - Sorry?

287
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:59,558
I thought you lived each day...

288
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,969
as if you were catching up on homework.

289
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,029
I see.

290
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,398
Let's have a party...

291
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,470
after you get the management rights of Soonyang Corporation.

292
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,570
Let's do it then.

293
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,409
Sure thing. Goodbye.

294
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,009
Don't tell me you're going to stay in the office like this.

295
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,949
- Sorry? - Don't do that. Call her.

296
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,789
"It's a special day, so I want to drink champagne with you."

297
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,360
There's someone you want to meet on a day like this, right?

298
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,888
I'll be off first.

299
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,200
- You can do it. - Thank you.

300
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,600
- Bye. - Bye.

(Soonyang Group)

302
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,440
It feels better...

303
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,970
to be alone.

304
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,489
- Here you go. - Thank you.

305

You're back now?

309

It's late.

310
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,719
You were still awake?

311
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,818
I couldn't see you halfway...

312
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,889
through your grandfather's memorial service,

313
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,230
so I was worried that you left in a hurry because of work.

314
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,460
I thought you might be hungry, so I waited to cook for you.

315

Go wash quickly.

I'm sorry, Mother.

You should go sleep now. I'm good at cleaning up too.

318
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,980
Goodness. I know you're neat,

319
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,788
but sometimes I wondered...

320

whether I was raising a son or a boarder.

I pray every day.

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
What?

335
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,440
I met someone...

336
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,049
like that.

337
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,420
- He's here! - That's him.

338
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,219
Did the presidential candidate himself demand the funds?

339
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,889
Did he promise something in return?

340
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,788
Do you admit to threatening companies to...

341
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,058
Prosecutors subpoenaed Sinmin Party's...

342
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,758
legal advisor lawyer Kang Sin Woo...

343
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,299
who collected illegal campaign funds...

344
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,099
from companies for the opposition.

345
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,068
The times are telling us...

346
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:42,409
to sever the unhealthy ties between politics and business...

347
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,868
to become more transparent...

348
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,109
and make a leap toward becoming a mature democracy.

349
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,250
The Ministry of Justice and the Prosecutors' Office...

350
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,278
promise the public we'll give our all to investigate...

351
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,049
the illegal campaign funds.

352
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,349
There is no political division when it comes to this matter.

353
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,460
There will be no sacred ground either.

354
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,029
All that there will be is the fair...

355
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,930
and just fight for the truth.

356
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,400
Minister of Justice Choi Chang Je invoked his authority...

357
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,729
and expanded the illegal campaign fund investigation...

358
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,639
to include not just opposition,

359
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,210
but most notable persons in politics and finance.

360
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,479
Minister Choi voiced his determination...

361
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,078
to sever the ties of politics...

362
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,979
and eliminate corruption...

363
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,609
through a stern investigation without limits.

364
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,078
Politicians and businessmen alike...

365
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,549
strongly oppose the investigation.

366
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,348
It's to be seen whether Minister Choi...

367
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,690
can and will get his way.

368
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,289
Goodness, Chang Je.

369
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,630
You came all this way at this time of day.

370
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,269
To think we got to bother someone high up and busy.

371
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,740
We're so spoiled.

372
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:50,568
I'm always at the beck and call of the people here.

373
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,640
It was like that for 30 years.

374
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,848
Uncle. We need to prepare to deal with the prosecutors.

375
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,818
End it with a simple investigation behind closed doors.

376
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,379
Shouldn't you do that much for us?

377
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,690
You should read the papers.

378
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,558
I told prosecution to investigate thoroughly,

379
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,930
and that there is to be no sacred ground.

380
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,059
If I let your family off,

381
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,599
it's as good as an admission that prosecutors are not impartial.

382
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,709
You won't have to worry much.

383
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,639
Even if we find something that suggests you paid someone,

384
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,578
if you can make it look like an insurance policy...

385
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,980
without an incentive,

386
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:29,849
you can avoid any sentences.

387
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,389
Oh, what the prosecutors will focus on...

388
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,819
is where the funds came from.

389
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,490
How the funds were procured and whether it was illegal.

390
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,229
But no one hides that better than the Soonyang family.

391
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,730
You're all experts at that.

392
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,170
Chang Je.

393
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,009
Wait.

394
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,109
I need to speak with you urgently.

395
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,578
If it's about the investigation,

396
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,750
what I just told you is all I can say.

397
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,089
Come on now, Chang Je.

398
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,589
Listen.

399
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,460
It's not about me, you see.

400
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,759
I have this huge sense of guilt.

401
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,970
As an uncle, I introduced my nephew...

402
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,039
to a very bad person.

403
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,940
The opposing party's legal advisor Kang Sin Woo...

404
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,139
received 15 million dollars in cash from a large company...

405
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,608
during the presidential campaign and passed it to...

406
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,650
We're from the Central Investigation Division.

407
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,049
Are you Jin Do Jun?

408
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,619
Yes. What can I do for you?

409
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,789
You're under emergency arrest for the illegal handover...

410
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,660
of political funds to Kang Sin Woo.

411
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,130
Can I have a look?

412
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,470
It's not a subpoena for an investigation...

413
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,929
but an arrest warrant?

414
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,940
The prosecutor issued one as you could destroy evidence...

415
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,710
or attempt to flee abroad.

416
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,309
(Central Investigation Bureau)

417
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:14,018
(Interrogation Room)

418
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,089
Mr. Jin?

419
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,190
I'm Seo Min Yeong with the Central Investigation Bureau.

420
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:20,789
Take a seat.

421
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,569
We meet again like this,

422
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,309
as a prosecutor and a suspect.

423
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,078
His arrest under exigent circumstances...

424
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,549
is a good sign for us.

425
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,920
The investigation will keep Do Jun occupied for a while.

426
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,490
It would be even better for us if he's found guilty and sentenced.

427
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,858
The person who gave ten million dollars in funds...

428
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,829
to the opposition's likely winner.

429
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,500
Was it you, Jin Do Jun?

430
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,369
You arrested me without a warrant.

431
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:10,639
Doesn't that mean you already have proof I can't deny or refute?

432
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,609
I had you arrested under exigent circumstances...

433
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:14,480
was because you'd likely...

434
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,210
destroy evidence or flee the country.

435
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,379
You helped a likely suspect who abetted murder...

436
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,480
go abroad once before.

437
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,890
That's Sinmin Party's legal advisor Kang Sin Woo's statement.

438
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,170
Through Miracle Investment's Director Jin Do Jun's...

439
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,869
personal assistant Ha In Seok,

440
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,299
he received ten million dollars in cash.

441
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:43,740
We found Ha's number in Kang's call history.

442
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,879
In the Yeouido apartment basement level parking lot...

443
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,180
that Kang used as a rendezvous spot,

444
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,079
we spotted Ha's car.

445
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,250
He was subpoenaed and is being questioned...

446
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,059
as a witness as we speak.

447
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,200
Are you Miracle Investment's Assistant Manager Ha In Seok?

448
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,569
Yes.

449
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,299
You're here to give a statement as a witness.

450
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,069
I understand.

451
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,769
Do you know Director Jin Do Jun?

452
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,379
- Yes, I do. - Did he...

453
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,278
instruct you to pass to Kang...

454
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,348
- any political funds? - Assistant Manager Ha.

455
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:27,519
He will do anything you say.

456
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,519
Isn't this...

457
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,460
proof that you can't deny or refute?

458
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,059
Did Mr. Ha say...

459
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,730
I told him to give Kang...

460
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,740
political funds?

461
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,009
The people are raving about the investigation.

462
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:59,579
If the prosecution finds Do Jun guilty,

463
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,950
Miracle's plan to steal...

464
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,750
Soonyang's management rights will go bust.

465
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,919
Would you be okay with that?

466
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,230
Would I be okay?

467
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,529
That's why I rushed over. Out of regret and guilt.

468
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,900
Soonyang Corporation's board.

469
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,569
This is an X-File of sorts on them.

470
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,039
Use this to replace them...

471
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,910
with people who are friendly to you.

472
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,779
Can Soonyang Corporation find out...

473
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,279
you gave such a thing to me?

474
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,450
That's what I want.

475
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,318
I want rumors to spread that the Soonyang brothers are fighting.

476
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,829
That way, Soonyang Corporation's stock price will skyrocket.

477
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:45,460
Daeyoung Group's chairman's sons also fought,

478
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,700
and when their stock price rose, in just one month,

479
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,028
they made 300 million dollars.

480
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,099
Do the math.

481
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:55,269
How much more do you think we could make through Soonyang?

482
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,109
- "We?" - That profit.

483
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,779
You and I...

484
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,150
can split it.

485
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,919
You make a nice profit...

486
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,420
and with that, I'll buy Soonyang Corporation's shares.

487
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,660
You really are as good at math as I heard.

488
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,599
In the end, money is what makes the world turn.

489
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,730
I think so too.

490
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:25,799
Okay! We should meet more often. You and I, real grown-ups.

491
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,309
Goodbye.

492
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,940
When I first met Do Jun seven years ago,

493
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:37,279
the young man who was still in his teens said he'd buy Soonyang.

494
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,150
I should tell you why I risked my whole career...

495
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,319
to move to Korea based on...

496
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:46,259
that absurd statement.

497
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:50,789
On the New York Stock Exchange, if companies are at a similar level,

498
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:54,028
and one is Korean, it goes for a lower price.

499
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:56,669
I know that much. It's called the Korea Discount.

500
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,838
Then you must also know the reason...

501
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,740
for the Korea Discount is that companies are handed down.

502
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:04,140
It's like selecting a national team athlete...

503
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:07,079
based on the sole fact of whether their parents were medalists,

504
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,309
regardless of how competitive they are...

505
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,479
in the international market.

506
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,179
What is it you want to say?

507
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,749
Management ability isn't improved by keeping it in the family.

508
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,519
Korea needs to see that.

509
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:23,029
Do Jun and us, in Miracle's name...

510
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,430
No.

511
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,529
With Miracle's money, we are striving to prove it.

512
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,869
Because what keeps the world turning...

513
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,368
is money in the end.

514
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:34,539
I wonder...

515
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,509
if you'll still have this swagger when Do Jun is sentenced.

516
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,880
The Minister of Justice controls the Prosecutors' Office.

517
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,619
That same Minister of Justice...

518
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,150
is under the control of this finger.

519
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:52,690
My finger.

520
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,900
This is so humiliating!

521
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,869
Didn't I warn you?

522
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,098
That the risk of disgrace is high today...

523
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,500
and you should watch what you say.

524
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,339
This is all your fault.

525
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,308
If I had ignored you and not bought Soonyang Card,

526
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:15,309
would I be humiliated by a guy from who knows where?

527
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:20,180
Your soul and divinity aren't as clear as they used to be.

528
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,750
Shouldn't you find a spring deep in some mountain...

529
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,559
and reconnect with the spirits?

530
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,890
The fund you invested in as I suggested...

531
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,029
made the highest profit of its kind.

532
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,329
Darn it.

533
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:34,160
I get why...

534
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,599
you trusted Mr. Baek so much, Dad.

535
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,700
And why the fortunes you tell are so accurate.

536
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:46,709
Your average rate of return is 200 percent.

537
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,808
- What? - To ensure that profit,

538
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:50,579
you've been embezzling.

539
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,519
(Proof of Baek Dong Min's Embezzlement)

540
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,259
Sir, will you let me explain first?

541
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,059
Mr. Baek.

542
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,930
How about you foretell your own future now?

543
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,140
Do you think I'll fire you or not?

544
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,380
I understand your point very well.

545
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,750
You won't be able to avoid the legal repercussions.

546
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:24,380
Keep that in mind.

547
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,359
Here's one last piece of advice, sir.

548
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,358
This month's fortune shows betrayal and scorn from a government office.

549
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,630
Beware the people around you and always be cautious.

550
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:42,630
Scorn? Betrayal?

551
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,900
I should believe that?

552
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,700
I'm just a messenger.

553
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,240
You are the one who eventually determines your fate.

554
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,339
Whether you believe me or not is utterly up to you.

555
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,180
(Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki)

556
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,680
My goodness.

557
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:05,959
The Prosecutors' Office has never been...

558
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,959
so loved or supported...

559
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,289
by the public in all its history.

560
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,959
As Minister of Justice and a one-time prosecutor,

561
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,929
I am extremely proud.

562
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,098
I owe it to you all.

563
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,868
This is our opportunity.

564
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:21,798
If we're to build up on it,

565
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,639
we need something to show for.

566
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,679
Something that'll convince the people...

567
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,808
that the Central Investigation Bureau really did...

568
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,750
take the plunge and investigate thoroughly.

569
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,618
You're investigating Soonyang's late chairman's grandson?

570
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:35,819
Yes, sir.

571
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,058
If you want to get a warrant issued within the 48 hours you have him...

572
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,130
Gosh, you need to hurry, then.

573
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:46,599
Hang on.

574
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,568
Drink this and speed up the investigation.

575
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:53,768
Don't you complain I put your junior over you...

576
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:56,970
because I offered her a beverage first.

577
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,979
And if you feel pressure because your suspect is...

578
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,480
related to me by marriage, don't.

579
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,379
I understand.

580
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,988
I want you to investigate thoroughly so that...

581
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,348
there can be no suspicions.

582
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,260
Dig deep into anyone who's involved.

583
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,359
If anyone refuses to come in,

584
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,500
call me immediately, okay?

585
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,659
Yes, sir.

586
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,368
I need to know...

587
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:26,570
where Ha In Seok went before and after that day.

588
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,768
Get me a detailed timeline of who he met.

589
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:30,840
Okay.

590
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,039
So I can pinpoint who instructed the funds be transferred.

591
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,610
"Who instructed the transfer?"

592
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,749
That means you think...

593
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,780
Jin Do Jun is not guilty.

594
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,019
He's not the type to end up being investigated so easily.

595
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,789
I get the idea he could've been set up.

596
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,239
I found it.

597
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,979
The person who instructed Ha In Seok.

598
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,380
(Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong)

599
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:15,718
This is security footage from Miracle Investment's basement.

600
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,649
The boxes of cash Kang Sin Woo received.

601
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,389
We got the face of the man who passed them to Ha In Seok.

602
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,760
Find this person...

603
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,860
and bring him in.

604
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:51,619
Hello?

605
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,789
What? I understand.

606
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,329
Ms. Seo. You should go to the interrogation room.

607
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,328
He said he'll confess.

608
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:04,670
That he told Ha In Seok to pass on the funds.

609
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,469
He wants to confess.

610
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,480
Why does he want to confess now?

611
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,710
He said he'll confess to everything.

612
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:16,679
In return for leniency.

613
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,389
You'll confess to telling Ha In Seok to pass on...

614
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:27,519
the illegal funds?

615
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,098
To pass the ten million dollars...

616
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:36,230
to Sinmin Party's advisor Kang Sin Woo.

617
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:38,599
It was my request.

618
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,969
Was it your intention...

619
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,968
to pass on the funds?

620
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:43,969
Of course not.

621
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,039
I obeyed my employer,

622
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,110
Soonyang Group's Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki,

623
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,480
and did as was told.

624
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,019
I don't get it.

625
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,948
Instead of Soonyang's numerous employees,

626
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,018
you got Miracle's Director Jin's assistant to do the job?

627
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:04,130
Ha In Seok was an informant the vice-chairman...

628
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,900
had sent to spy on Director Jin Do Jun.

629
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,530
Since he started at Miracle and until now,

630
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,839
whenever Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki called,

631
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,699
he would come to the office.

632
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,809
Check the visitor log.

633
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,109
It should show when he came by.

634
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:24,010
Then the ten million dollars Ha passed on...

635
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,250
wasn't Jin Do Jun's money?

636
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,849
Was it a slush fund Jin Dong Ki had stashed away?

637
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,860
This shows...

638
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,570
where the money came from.

639
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:46,969
It's all as he said.

640
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,408
Ha In Seok worked for Jin Dong Ki...

641
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:52,110
for five years as outsourced help.

642
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,578
There are also records of him visiting Jin Dong Ki...

643
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,250
late at night after being called.

644
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,579
It's as you said.

645
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,179
How did you know?

646
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,288
That Jin Do Jun was set up.

647
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:05,888
That he wouldn't have been brought in easily.

648
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:09,329
You said you thought he was framed.

649
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,190
He was set up,

650
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,699
but I don't know by whom.

651
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,449
He's denying all the charges?

652
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,489
He's just repeating what his lawyer said.

653
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,860
Like a broken record.

654
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,399
The situation is slightly different...

655
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,960
from the other businessmen we questioned.

656
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,070
Other people can get off by pleading...

657
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,840
they fear politicians and their power.

658
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,609
But we can prove he used Soonyang Investment...

659
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,078
and Insurance's clients' accounts to create the slush fund.

660
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,550
We even have a witness.

661
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,579
This guy...

662
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,178
can't avoid being sentenced.

663
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,889
How are the other companies different?

664
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:13,360
How can political funds not have any incentive?

665
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:17,289
Chairmen who give tens of millions don't want anything in return?

666
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,429
Isn't that the equivalent of blind love?

667
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,469
Love stories like that rarely exist nowadays.

668
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,440
I bet people don't even donate with that mindset.

669
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,039
You're on edge.

670
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:32,209
Is it because you're not making progress with the grandson...

671
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,440
of the late Chairman Jin?

672
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,239
When was he brought in?

673
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,590
Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki...

674
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,928
is stubbornly denying he had Ha In Seok...

675
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:55,460
pass on the funds.

676
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
But the circumstances Mr. Baek told us about...

677
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,969
were all proven true.

678
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,639
I did consider you were set up.

679
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:10,809
Ever since you stood before me as a suspect.

680
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:13,980
I'm surprised.

681
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:18,589
I thought you wouldn't believe me.

682
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,920
I didn't say I believed you.

683
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,789
That means I haven't yet concluded...

684
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,630
if you were set up or if you did the setting up.

685
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,369
My husband Dong Ki.

686
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,110
What if he ends up in prison?

687
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,768
You know what he's like.

688
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,280
He's too sensitive to survive that.

689
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,210
Prison cells these days are like hotel suites.

690
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,380
Because of stupid human rights,

691
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,190
our tax money is getting wasted.

692
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,319
Young Ki.

693
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,519
Thirty years ago, when life was hard and things were worse,

694
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:59,630
many people did time and survived just fine.

695
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:04,469
Dong Ki didn't put together those funds on his own.

696
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:09,808
Could you please give the President a call?

697
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,738
He knows and I know the opposing candidate got...

698
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,578
fives times more than what we gave him.

699
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:17,349
I don't dare ask for a favor.

700
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,980
Would you want to help us if you were him?

701
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,889
Tell Dong Ki that...

702
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,019
when the wind is harsh,

703
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:29,019
it helps to learn from the reeds on how to lie low.

704
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,960
I will tell him that.

705
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,599
That you have no intention of helping him.

706
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,150
Ji Na. You're worried about Dong Ki, aren't you?

707
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,659
I feel worse for you.

708
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,429
You never suffered a day in your life,

709
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,699
and now you must care for an inmate husband.

710
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,828
That's no easy feat.

711
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,229
I've done it myself,

712
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,268
and at least I was young at the time.

713
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:16,769
You're talking about that even before he stood trial?

714
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,509
Why?

715
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,940
You might as well pray he goes away!

716
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,420
My goodness...

717
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,289
That's a mental illness too.

718
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,559
Everyone suffers every now and then, and she acts like the sky fell.

719
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,630
Goodness.

720
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,099
You did the right thing, Father.

721
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,300
This investigation into what uncle did...

722
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,800
exposed all the slush funds he has.

723
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:48,138
Once he coughs it all up,

724
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:50,869
he won't dare to mess with you or try to steal your position again.

725
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,980
You should take him back under your wing then.

726
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,079
Don't worry about us.

727
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,289
We're fully prepared to deal with the prosecutors.

728
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:05,960
All right.

729
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,460
I can't get anything done without you, Seong Jun.

730
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,400
What? Learn from the wisdom of the reeds?

731
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:23,570
Darn it.

732
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,839
They want me out of this fight...

733
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,880
and are trying to use this as an opportunity to do just that.

734
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,578
You see, this... I'm telling you.

735
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:33,550
Seong Jun is coaching him.

736
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,019
What do you think the prosecutors are up to?

737
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,719
The Central Investigation Bureau and Cheongwadae are on the same page.

738
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,360
They need a trophy, so they want to reform the conglomerates.

739
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,130
Conglomerates such as...

740
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:45,460
Soonyang?

741
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,869
If they need a trophy...

742
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,440
The bigger, the better. Right?

743
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,409
Wouldn't you say Soonyang Corporation...

744
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:01,539
is the one that represents Soonyang Group?

745
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,820
Okay. Keep me updated.

746
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,928
I'm sorry to visit you so early in the morning, sir.

747
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:20,729
Something urgent has come up.

748
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,159
I just received a call.

749
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:23,629
The prosecution has launched search and seizure operations...

750
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,900
against Soonyang Corporation.

751
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,639
Prosecutors are acting a little too late.

752
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,980
Even if they raid the office,

753
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,480
they won't find anything.

754
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,379
- Right, Seong Jun? - Yes.

755
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,449
Not the Soonyang Corporation office.

756
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,780
They raided the loan sharks in Myeong-dong.

757
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,550
- Myeong-dong? - Yes, sir.

758
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:49,360
The loan sharks? Why?

759
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,529
I think the prosecutors obtained info on the accounts...

760
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,230
and shares you bought under borrowed names through them.

761
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,730
Looks like they also know you used the campaign fund to buy the bond.

762
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,399
The warrant was issued...

763
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,869
for the office owned by Ms. Son's family.

764
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,969
How did the prosecutors find out about them?

765
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,610
We used that dirty money...

766
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,750
to buy out all of Soonyang Corporation shares...

767
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,590
to turn my husband into the chairman.

768
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,360
I'm so sorry, Seong Jun.

769
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,460
This is all my fault.

770
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,999
The search and seizure operations...

771
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,629
have revealed that Soonyang Corporation...

772
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,070
used borrowed-name accounts set up through a loan shark...

773
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,710
Ji Na, how dare you?

774
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,070
How could you do this to your family?

775
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:41,710
Even if you do this, Soonyang will never become your husband's!

776
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,879
Earlier today, the prosecution...

777
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,719
- secured evidence that Soonyang... - Blood is thicker than water.

778
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:49,549
But I suppose money flows...

779
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,090
in the veins of these conglomerate families.

780
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:53,159
I mean, what is this? They're brothers.

781
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,888
But thanks to Jin Dong Ki's statement,

782
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:58,360
we could launch the investigation into their slush fund.

783
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,860
Why should we thank Jin Dong Ki?

784
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:02,559
It was all thanks to Jin Do Jun.

785
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:05,499
Because of his arrest, we were able...

786
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,300
to launch the investigation into Soonyang Group's slush fund.

787

("Soonyang Family Suspected of Setting Up Eight-Figure Slush Fund")

788
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:22,780
You look like you've reached a conclusion.

789
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,190
Was this all part of your plan from the get-go?

790
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,190
To make us investigate Jin Young Ki and Jin Dong Ki,

791
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,599
you deliberately fell into this trap.

792
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,800
The prosecution, media, and even Cheongwadae have got their back,

793
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,909
whereas I'm all I've got.

794
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,480
Do you really have to do all this to make Soonyang yours?

795
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:56,750
Min Yeong, I've never once forgotten...

796
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,820
the reason I was born into this family...

797
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,888
and how Jin Young Ki, Jin Dong Ki,

798
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:03,529
and Jin Seong Jun treated me.

799
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,860
So you have no choice since you were born into the family?

800
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,559
You'll do whatever it takes to make company yours?

801
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,098
You don't care if you're breaking or manipulating the law?

802
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,199
You're wrong.

803
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,539
I'll never be such a conglomerate CEO.

804
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:23,309
You told me...

805
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,619
that I'd become even more spiteful once Soonyang became mine.

806
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:32,820
That's why we broke up. Am I right?

807
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:37,730
Let's start over, Min Yeong.

808
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,500
I promise you I won't get worse.

809
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:57,050
The 48-hour period has now ended.

810
00:47:58,849 --> 00:47:59,980
So you don't believe me.

811
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:02,719
Fine.

812
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:05,519
Don't believe me, then.

813
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,559
Believe in luck instead.

we'll meet again.

00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,500
- Mr. Ha, are you all right? - Yes.

818
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,369
- This must've been stressful. - No.

819
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,570
This is my job. I get paid to do this, so don't worry.

820
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,340
- Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

Mr. Oh, you're here too.

This is the 21st century.

824
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,820
Sacrificing yourself to earn trust? Seriously?

825

We received an anonymous letter about Mr. Baek's embezzlement.

834
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,469
In the near future, I plan to report to the prosecution...

835
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,969
that Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki has been setting up...

836
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,500
an illegal slush fund, using dormant accounts...

837
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:05,110
at Soonyang Investment and Soonyang Insurance.

838
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:08,639
Then Soonyang will do what they've always done.

839

They'll make you take the fall for everything, Mr. Baek.

840
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:18,889
I'm giving you a chance to get out of it before they make a move.

841
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:26,829
Being Soonyang's largest shareholder doesn't mean we own it.

842
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:31,530
We need the management rights to truly own Soonyang.

843

("Prosecution Investigating Soonyang's Illegal Slush Fund")

They were investigating the illegal campaign fund.

Why are they suddenly after Soonyang's slush fund?

wondering where and how you contracted the disease...

851

I learned this at a summer Bible camp when I was young.

After praying that he would offer his own child as a sacrifice...

855

if the Lord was angered,

856
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:12,840
he killed a lamb instead.

The blood gushing out of its neck...

858
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,949
helped appease the Lord's anger.

859

The head of Soonyang shall stand in front of the cameras.

860

He shall be on his knees in front of the entire nation,

861
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,329
enduring all the humiliation and finger-pointing covered in blood,

862

gushing out of his body.

Yes.

As you're already aware, the prosecution will summon...

865
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:46,638
those in charge of finance as witnesses.

866
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:49,980
We should discuss it in advance so our story remains consistent.

867
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:52,050
Is that really necessary?

868
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,280
The Director of Finance should be held accountable.

869
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,380
Right, Mr. Kim?

870
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:00,558
Well, I'll be honored. It'll be like another star on my shoulder.

871
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,289
However, public opinion won't approve of it.

872
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,460
The slush fund was created for the succession plans.

873
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,170
Who'd believe that I called the shots?

874
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,239
Shouldn't calming public opinion be our priority at the moment?

875
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,610
We need to show that the company is taking responsibility.

876
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:19,570
Okay, so who should do it?

877
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,050
Mr. Jin. If you step in and get things sorted out,

878
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,289
the executives will no longer be shaken up by this situation.

Mr. Chairman, what are your thoughts on this?

00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,530
I can't do anything without you.

881

So if one of us had to stand before the people...

883
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,079
it should be you, Seong Jun.

It's a painting by Francisco Goya.

Impressive, isn't it?

888
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,940
The father in the painting heard a prophecy...

889
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:32,710
that predicted he would be overthrown by his son.

890
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:35,280
Of course, he didn't want to lose what he had.

Are you getting a kick out of seeing me in this mess? Are you satisfied?

Do you wish to display me in your gallery or something?

all you can see is the son getting eaten alive.

we'll meet again.

989
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,138
Nice. She can totally do this.

990
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:09,840
That's it. Now, the jerk.

991
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:12,649
Yes! She got it!

992
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,249
- She got it! - She did it!

993
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,519
- Yes! - She did it.

994
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,150
When she participates in the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics,

995
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,619
let's get married.

996
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,929
By the time she's participating in the London 2012 Summer Olympics...

997
01:00:30,469 --> 01:00:31,500
Yes.

998
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,440
We'd probably have a kid by then, right?

999
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,650
I want to stay right by your side like that, Min Yeong.

1000
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,920
Let's do that.

1001
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:05,269
It's time to meet, right?

1002
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,300
Yes.

1003
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,110
Just wait there, Min Yeong. I'm on my way.

1004
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:26,519
Should we go around it?

1005
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,829
Oh, I guess there's something wrong with the car.

1006
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,328
Let's wait a few moments.

1007
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:36,360
Yes, sir.

1008
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,530
The rule had no exceptions.

1009
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,099
Everything that happened in my previous life...

1010
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:15,670
happened again in this lifetime,

1011
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:19,570
without exception.

1012
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:24,980
And...

1013
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,489
the person who killed me...

1014
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,659
was none other than myself.

1015
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,440
(Reborn Rich)

1016
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:01,079
