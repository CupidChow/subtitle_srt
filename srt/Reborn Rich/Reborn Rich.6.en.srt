We'll manage.

Oh, dear.

6
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,458

Can I help you?

10

It's you, isn't it? Hyeon Woo's parents' restaurant.

11
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,340
You bought the building it's in.

You heard the news?

13

I don't think the family is ready to take visitors yet.

What happened?

15

Was it a heart attack again?

16

It wasn't an illness.

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,270
I heard Hyeon Woo's mom took her own life.

would never do that.

I'll make some gukbap with bean sprouts.

- It's not what you think. - Seriously...

I can finish it on my own in no time.

He kept asking which university I'd apply to.

56
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,509
So I said I'd apply.

57

He wouldn't stop bugging me.

00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,419
I asked them to find out what Gnaynoos does.

172
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,860
Oh, my...

173
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,500
They're amazingly loyal.

174
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,099
Gnaynoos' limited partner investors...

175
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,200
all used to be Soonyang's financial executives.

176
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,679
That means Gnaynoos is Soonyang's slush fund.

177
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:54,850
And with that money, they bought Soonyang Corporation's shares.

178
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:59,690
Because it's the mother company that governs all subsidiaries.

(Soonyang Corporation Share Distribution)

181
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,440
Gnaynoos successfully bought 4.9 percent of Corporation's shares.

182
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,109
You have all you need to ensure management...

183
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,279

184
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,019
That much of Soonyang Corporation.

185
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,489
How much is it in cash?

186
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,890
All 90 million dollars made from liquidating Soonyang Life Science.

187
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,259
It is a real big deal.

188
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,470
We made a profit.

189
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,140
It was the succession.

190
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,210
Rather than pay the inheritance tax to hand down the company,

191
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:55,879

(Big Deal, Company liquidation)

No. The public that invested in Soonyang Life Science...

194
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,420
were sacrificed.

195

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,859

00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,069
- Grandpa. - Hello.

198
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,170
What are you doing here?

199
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,410
You didn't even call.

200
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,769
I came to see you.

Good. Sit down.

You can't be here because you're out of pocket money.

203

So, what's this about?

204
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,960
So... Soonyang Life Science.

205
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,759
I heard it was liquidated.

206
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,539
I read about it in the news.

207
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,269
That it's Soonyang Group's major business.

208
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,009
That it'll lead us into the next generation.

What about it?

210
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,710
Well...

211
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:09,690
Our PR department wouldn't have spread lies.

212
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,460
That means you were convinced the business would do well.

213
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,259
So why was it suddenly sold off?

214
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,430
I wanted to find out.

215
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,140
Do you want an answer?

216
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,279
Yes.

217
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,690
The President was looking for any excuse to bring us down.

218
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,089
What else could I do?

219
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,559
What power do I have when I'm just an old man?

220
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,758
If the President wields a sword,

221
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,569
you lie low and feign death while other heads roll.

Those people...

226
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,230
did nothing wrong...

227
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,039
but just believed in our company.

228
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,039
Why would you care about...

Don't you go around saying that.

to inherit Soonyang?

No way.

240
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,099

about inheriting Soonyang, Grandpa.

00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,490
Politics?

338
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,670
Because of those politicians, I,

339
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,339
and Soonyang,

340
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,669
suffered so much yet again.

341
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,440
Does anyone here not know this?

342
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,640
I'm sorry, Father.

343
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,009
I didn't mean that.

344
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,650
- Prosecutor Choi. - Yes.

345
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,419
I heard you were going to run for mayor this time.

346
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,519
Is this true?

347
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,130
Well...

348
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,229
People around me kept insisting that I was the perfect fit.

349
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,130
What's great about you besides the fact that you're my son-in-law?

350
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:27,200
They're all trying to steal my money.

351
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:32,779
Chang Je is looked down on only in this house.

352
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:35,649
Outside, he's a just prosecutor...

353
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,309
who led the elimination of corruption.

354
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,018
All because you used him to get rid of others.

355
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:42,390
But you shouldn't bite off more than you can chew!

356
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,189
Prosecutor is the right place for him.

357
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,219
- Father. - Your just husband...

358
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,490
that the whole world knows!

359
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,129
If you want to get him kicked out jobless,

360
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,529
take this chance to remove his position as my son-in-law...

361
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,140
and start anew.

362
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,869
And see if anyone approaches him.

363
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:13,119
Why would you get up even before finishing your meal?

364
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,160
Young Ki.

365
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,259
Why did you stay silent?

366
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,230
You promised you would support Chang Je.

367
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,640
Father is not wrong.

368
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,640
Chang Je, don't feel upset.

369
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,910
Public Security and Special Unit.

370
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,509
You were able to work in these departments...

371
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,950
all thanks to Father. No?

372
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:48,690
Of course, Young Ki.

373
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:52,559
Chang Je, you don't show...

374
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:54,890
that you were raised poor.

375
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,659
Normally, those who were raised poor catch on quick.

376
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,598
You know how Father is.

377
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,230
So why would you admit it?

378
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,200
I'm sure he didn't know this conflict would happen.

379
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,769
What are you guys doing?

380
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:12,640
What's wrong?

381
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,240
I see.

382
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:18,278
Does Chang Je still look like a country bumpkin...

383
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,220
who comes to this house to earn his tuition fee?

384
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:26,859
Just you watch.

385
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,759
How far Chang Je can go as a politician.

386
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,700
I'll make sure to show you.

387
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,970
Let's go.

388
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,410
Well...

389
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,709
I'm sorry to make a scene on such a nice day.

390
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,750
Hurry up!

391
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,589
Let's eat.

392
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,849
He would need to bow and shake hands all the time.

393
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,220
Why does he want to get into politics?

394
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,250
Nowadays, money is power.

395
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,190
In the end, what moves money is authority.

396
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,029
If Grandfather hates politics,

397
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:42,470
it would mean politicians still hold a lot of authority.

398
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,170
Gosh, what are engineering students doing?

399
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,508
Can't they put the songs in these albums...

400
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,279
into a device that fits in one hand?

401
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,210
The size of an apple.

402
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,480
Apple?

403
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:01,950
Is that going too far?

404
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,259
Then melon. Melon sounds good.

405
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:11,130
Try making it. I'll invest in it.

406
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,629
- You're going to invest in it? - Yes.

407
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,700
It means it will work.

408
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,470
No.

409
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,368
You're not an artist...

410
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:23,140
if such chicken feed makes you waver.

411
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,710
I heard that you were talented in investing.

412
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,579
But why did you go to law school?

413
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,420
You don't seem to be uninterested in business either.

414
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,220
I'm uninterested in Soonyang's business, at least.

415
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,559
My dad is different from Uncle and Aunt.

416
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,598
I think Grandfather didn't make me work in the company...

417
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,029
because he didn't want me to.

418
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:53,369
I'm Grandfather's grandson, but my dad's son before that.

419
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,609
I don't start a fight...

420
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,009
that already has an ending.

421
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,549
Father.

422
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:06,079
Yes.

423
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,550
It's late. We should go home too.

424
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,619
Okay.

425
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,319
Seong Jun, congratulations again on your first day of work.

426
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,389
Thank you.

427
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,860
Uncle. I knew he got good grades,

428
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,960
but he's really smart.

429
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,030
Let's keep in touch.

430
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,639
Did something happen?

431
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,150
It's Chang Je who got scolded by Father.

432
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,280
So why do you look like you were wronged?

433
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,380
I do?

434
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,219
See this?

435
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,329
This middle-aged man who looks like he was wronged?

436
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,900
You're right.

437
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:56,469
I feel wronged.

438
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,969
So it's true.

439
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,639
I know very well what my son wants,

440
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,840
but as long as he's born as my son,

441
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,109
I have to tell him...

442
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,880
not to start anything that goes against Grandfather's wish.

443
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,590
That's my place.

444
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,420
I feel sorry...

445
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,860
for being this kind of a dad.

446
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,360
I'm sorry, Father.

447
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,869
Why, Hyeong Jun?

448
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:33,269
I actually passed the Seochon Music audition.

449
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,110
You noticed my talent from that short moment.

450
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,079
Talent isn't something you can hide.

451
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,210
I was foolish.

452
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:43,980
I guess this is the fate of a genius.

453
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,409
Audition?

454
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,050
Seochon Music?

455
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:50,150
I'm going to debut as a singer in the summer.

456
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,719
What?

457
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,590
You're really going to become a singer?

458
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,030
Didn't you already guess that?

459
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:02,369
- Weren't you just dressed that way? - What?

460
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,599
Do Jun.

461
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:11,170
So you're a good singer.

462
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:12,909
Yes.

463
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,960
Where is this, Grandfather?

464
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,789
This is...

465
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:32,230
the island of orchids and grass.

466
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,829
It has a pretty name too.

467
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,169
Nanji Island.

468
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,230
Nanji Island is...

469
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,170
the island that was used as a landfill...

470
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,479
They buried the trash piled up as high as a mountain down here.

471
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,279
Then the land beneath would be full of gas.

472
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,619
Here.

473
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,320
It might collapse.

474
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:06,230
Seong Jun, look carefully.

475
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,400
This is where New Seoul Town will be built.

476
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,110
Seoul World Cup Stadium will be built over there,

477
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,339
and a new city will be built next to that.

478
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,449
The budget is five billion dollars.

479
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:26,920
Once the election for the mayor of Seoul is over,

480
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,879
things will progress fast...

481
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,650
starting with the selection of the company in charge.

482
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,960
You give it a go.

483
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,289
- Sorry? - From bidding to construction.

484
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,599
Take charge of the project...

485
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,769
and build a new city here.

486
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,440
My eldest grandson.

487
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,408
Why do you keep insisting against it?

488
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,479
Miracle Investments won't invest in small businesses.

489
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,319
"Small businesses are the flowers of the new world."

490
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,849
Didn't you listen to the president's inauguration speech?

491
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,320
One billion dollars are out in the market.

492
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:10,629
- We should go flower viewing. - It's not late to invest...

493
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,260
after the flowers fall and bear fruits.

494
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:18,900
Goodness.

495
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,069
As NASDAQ Composition fell,

496
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,538
KOSDAQ Composition fell below 200.

497
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:29,279
The froth has come out of modern technology stocks.

498
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,178
There are many online companies...

499
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,879
that are facing a crisis.

500
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,690
Crises of online companies...

501
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,788
are caused by an excessive investment...

502
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:41,320
without a clear revenue model.

503
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,670
I said no.

Do you think Yeongdong, once a cheap area,

511
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,098
became one of the most expensive areas in Gangnam...

512
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,300
just because of wealthy housewives' property speculation?

513
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,469
It's because a highway was built.

Correct.

No, before that.

What was that about new businesses?

00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,360
They need new land,

Is it not my money they're waiting for?

646
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,368
They won't give the project to a different company...

647
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:20,840
after getting your money for their campaign, right?

648

Do you know why you must be careful when you spend someone else's money?

649
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,380
The money I gave them isn't the reason they must listen to me.

650

They have no choice but to do as I say...

651
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,179
because I have leverage over them since they received money from me.

00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:47,659
Oh...

668
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,360
I'm Oh Se Hyeon from Miracle Investment.

669
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,329
I'd like to sponsor your campaign, Mr. Choi.

00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,610
We cannot accept Miracle's support.

673
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,550
Besides, you want the New Seoul Town project,

674
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:18,849
which Soonyang Construction is after?

675
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,658
Mr. Oh, this is like declaring war...

676
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:24,860
on my father, Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

677
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,630
Never in my life have I seen anyone...

678
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,800
win against him.

679
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,030
All will be fine...

680
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:36,840
if Chairman Jin never finds out about this. Am I wrong?

681
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,440
I plan to take this...

682
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,380

So we're partners now.

We share a secret.

686
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,369
Then we must add on a little extra as hazard pay.

687
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,250
As for the amount, 10 million won't do. Make it 20 million dollars.

688
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,750
You sure take after your father.

689

But the thing is,

690
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,429
will the party nominate me?

691
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,530
Those at Cheongwadae are tight,

692
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:39,428
and people should know you...

693
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,400
if you want the spotlight at the confirmation hearing,

694
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,599

You reflect the spirit of the times, Prosecutor Choi.

696

It's a quality that a politician absolutely needs.

- Yes. - Yes?

700
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:58,349
Yes!

701

While investigating the family of Jaea Construction's owner...

702
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,000

the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office...

704

confirmed that CEO Kang Man Soo...

705
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,300
illegally siphoned off 36 million dollars overseas.

706
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,440
We've also requested an arrest warrant on Kim Jong Bok,

707
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,479
the Commissioner of the Korea Customs Service,

708
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,280
for deliberately concealing this.

709
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,509
This is clearly a corruption case caused by abuse of power.

710
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,718
We, at Prosecution Service, promise to investigate the case...

711
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,519
until the end without bowing to any kind of external pressure.

Was there any external pressure?

716
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:43,569
You also investigated the cases involving Ahjin and Hando Steel.

717

You're a member of the Soonyang family.

Did anyone try to bribe you?

719
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,468
Is there a reason you mainly handle corporate crime cases?

720

Have you experienced any external pressure?

But they aren't the ones who caused this pain.

that the powerless citizens are the only ones suffering?

to get Jaea Construction?

00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,619
and your son-in-law, I plan to tell the truth.

831
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,159
Do you think...

832
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:45,659
public opinion will side with you, Father?

833
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,219
They say...

834
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,449
you can never win against your children.

835
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,789
My son-in-law is my child too, after all.

836
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,099
How could I win against you?

837
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:31,309
Then I need you...

838
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,179
to promise me something.

839
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,130
My gosh.

840
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,340
Nephew, you were right.

841
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,369
I did exactly as you said, and he gave me the go-ahead.

842
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:04,570
Grandpa...

843
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,909
- Grandpa gave you the go-ahead? - Yes.

844
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,979
That's great. Congratulations, Uncle Chang Je.

845
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,010
Gosh, thanks.

846
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:12,980
- Best of luck. - Thanks.

847
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,679
- Hey, nephew. - Yes?

848
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,250
I didn't think you'd help me.

849
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,789
Why did you help me?

850
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,360
Well, the mayor of Seoul title suits you better...

851
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,530
than a mere son-in-law of the Soonyang family,

852
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:34,369
Uncle Chang Je.

853
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:54,590
Did you give him the go-ahead to run for mayor?

854
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,760
Will that be all right, sir?

855
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:01,929
What can I do?

856
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,730
I shall try to use the poultry knife...

857
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,239
to butcher a cow.

858
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,420
Someone's got...

859
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:23,650
Chang Je's back.

860
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:27,719
Hang Jae, I need you to find out...

861
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:29,920
who it is...

862
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,800
and why they're trying to make Chang Je the mayor of Seoul.

863
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:37,900
(Live Election Results)

864
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,199
Seoul, Choi Chang Je. 53.6 percent.

865
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,170
Yang Doo Yeong, 41.7 percent.

Six from the United Liberal Democrats.

868
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:48,308
Four from the Korea Party.

869
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:49,379
- Cheers. - Cheers.

870
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,409
Cheers.

871
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,348
Choi Chang Je from the New Democratic Korea Party...

872
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:54,780
has won the election.

873
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,189
Now that we have the mayor of Seoul on our side,

874
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,550
we just need Mayor Choi...

875
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,119
to give the New Seoul Town project to us,

876
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:03,760
Jaea Construction.

877
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:05,760
We can trust him, right?

878
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:08,329
I mean, we're dealing with Jin Yang Cheol here.

879
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,429
Mayor Choi is a softie. Would he be able to handle him?

880
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,469
My gosh. Congratulations, Chang Je.

881
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:18,710
But as you know,

882
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,710
you are and will always be my one and only son-in-law...

883
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:26,710
who I'm very proud of, no matter where you are or what you do.

884
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:29,049
Don't forget that.

885
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:31,649
Thank you. I'll never forget that.

886
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,359
- Choi Chang Je! - Hurrah!

887
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,820
- Hurrah! - Hurrah!

888
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:39,129
- Mayor of Seoul, Choi Chang Je! - Mayor of Seoul, Choi Chang Je!

889
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,929
- Yes! - Mayor Choi Chang Je!

890
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,179
As for the New Seoul Town project,

891
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,078
the bidding results should've been announced already.

892
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:02,150
But Seong Jun hasn't called yet, sir.

893
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,989
There he is.

894
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:14,960
So how did it go?

895
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:18,570
The New Seoul Town development project...

896
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,239
has gone to Jaea Construction.

897
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:27,809
Sir.

898
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:39,420
Tell Chang Je that I want to see him.

899
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,199
You're here.

900
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:41,320
I wanted to wait outside to welcome the new mayor.

901
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,119
Let's go inside.

902
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,260
Why don't we just talk here?

903
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:01,900
My new job is keeping me busy, Father.

904
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:09,980
Who is it?

905
01:05:12,449 --> 01:05:15,849
Who's got your back that you can be this arrogant?

906
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,718
You gave the New Seoul Town project...

907
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:23,619
to Jaea Construction.

908
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:26,590
Did that person put you up to it?

909
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,570
The person behind you.

910
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:39,710
Is it Miracle?

911
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,320
I guess you didn't know.

912
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,420
The ten thousand citizens of Seoul...

913
01:05:56,219 --> 01:05:57,690
have got my back.

914
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,500
What?

915
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:04,769
As the mayor of Seoul, I chose Jaea Construction...

916
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:07,098
over Soonyang according to the rules and procedures,

917
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:09,170
for the sake of Seoul's better future.

918
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,469
Should you have any additional questions,

919
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:17,510
I will see you in my office next time, Mr. Chairman.

920
01:06:49,909 --> 01:06:51,679
Jaea Construction...

921
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:53,949
got the New Seoul Town project?

922
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,989
It was Mr. Jin Seong Jun's first project.

923
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,119
He must be very disappointed.

924
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,590
And I guess he's preparing to go study abroad or something.

925
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,460
He frequents a language institute.

926
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,239
That's interesting.

927
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,679
Miracle Investment has control over Jaea Construction.

928
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,050
Miracle and Jin Do Jun's language institute are in the same building.

929
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:30,920
I believe in fate,

930
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,920
but not in coincidences.

931
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:37,118
We're from the prosecution.

932
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,559
We're here to conduct a search and seizure.

933
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,129
- Search the office. - Yes, sir.

934
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,559
- Start over there. - Over here.

935
01:07:45,969 --> 01:07:48,369
Excuse me. Who are you?

936
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,900
Is Mr. Oh Se Hyeon here?

937
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:51,909
What is this about?

938
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:54,940
We're from the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

939
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:58,209
We received a tip-off that you paid a large bribe...

940
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,609
to Mayor Choi Chang Je...

941
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:02,119
in order to land the New Seoul Town project.

942
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,300
(Standards of Judicial Administration)

943
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:40,119
My, Soonyang sure has a lot of power.

944
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,289
Even prosecutors are at their beck and call.

945
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:46,890
What do you want from me?

946
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,159
Chairman Jin wants to meet...

947
01:08:51,829 --> 01:08:53,270
the majority shareholder of Miracle.

948
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:56,239
The real owner of the company.

949
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,189
You know Miracle Investment, right?

950
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:54,430
Then...

951
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,729
do you also know who the company's real owner is?

952
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,739
You're talking like you know who it is.

953
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:04,039
Who is it?

954
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,090
I'm Miracle's majority shareholder,

955
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:02,890
Jin Do Jun.

(Reborn Rich)

957
01:12:47,569 --> 01:12:50,739
Why? Why did you do such a thing?

958
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,609
I'd like to buy...

959
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:54,810
Soonyang.

960
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:57,640
I'm worried.

961
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,408
He'll try to drag me down throughout my term.

962
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:03,479
Then soar high enough so he can't drag you down.

963
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:07,119
Be honest with me.

964
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:09,460
You're not 22, right?

965
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:12,189
You said partners must be honest to each other.

966
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,960
We'll be good partners.

967
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,329
It sure is a proposition...

968
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:19,869
I can't turn down.

969
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,399
We've got a problem.

970
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,339
They contacted us and said...

971
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,039
they'd cancel the plan to enter DMC altogether.

972
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:28,039
My eldest grandson,

973
01:13:28,979 --> 01:13:30,539
do you want to get your revenge?
