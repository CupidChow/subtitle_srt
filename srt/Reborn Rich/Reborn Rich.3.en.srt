(Reborn Rich)

9
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,329
You got the answer,

10
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,969
so you deserve the prize.

11
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,900
I don't need money.

12
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:09,670
Once I am old enough to use that money,

13
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,409
its monetary value would have dropped.

14
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,379
Is that so?

15
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,349
I'd like land.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,219
A place with lots of plants and trees.

17
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,560
I like this area, right here.

18
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,068
That land was used to make pottery. It's useless.

19
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,269
(Gyeonggi Province, Seongnam, Bundang-dong)

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,069
Do you want the land in Bundang that badly?

21
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,879
Let's see.

22
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,908
How does 160,000m² sound?

23
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,679
(Gyeonggi Province, Seongnam, Bundang-dong)

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,348
This small village will become a new city,

25
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,950
home to 390,000 people.

26
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,790
According to the government's New Town development plan,

27
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,589
on Seongnam's Bundang area,

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,429
about 105,000 medium to large apartment blocks will be built.

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,359
They will reduce the burden on Gangnam's housing demand...

30
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,829
by housing 420,000 people.

31
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,099
What an incredible change this place went through.

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,610
There was just one reservoir...

33
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,139
with fields and rice paddies reaching the horizons.

34
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,210
People say that Bundang...

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,949
is the next best place to live, second to paradise.

36
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,460
Did you know then...

37
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,789
that this place would become like this?

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,860
Do you simply have good discernment?

39
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,030
Or are you just lucky?

40
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,270
I owe it to a grandfather who gifted me 160,000m² of land.

41
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:52,139
Not anyone gets to be born your grandson.

42
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,449
Does that make me lucky?

43
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,419
From the land here,

44
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,919
do you know how much you made?

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,229
Welcome, sir.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,159
This way, please.

47
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,710
The 24 million dollars you asked for.

48
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,469
Good.

49
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,180
The compensation for the purchase of land was 14 million.

50
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,090
Ten million was from selling the nearby commercial land.

51
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,219
A total of 24 million dollars...

52
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,259
is what you earned.

53
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,229
Would you like to count it out?

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,750
How will you manage to spend all this?

55
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,889
If you buy books with it,

56
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,189
you'll never read them all in your lifetime.

57
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,989
If you spend it on tuition,

58
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,199
you'll have to get a hundred degrees.

59
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,199
If you're afraid, leave it with me.

60
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,399
I'll pay you more in interest than a bank does.

61
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,750
(Reborn Rich)

62
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,189
Do Jun is still a kid, isn't he?

63
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,860
It's only natural.

64
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,389
Where could he have seen such a huge amount?

65
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,660
Sir, Hangang Bank's Namdaemun Branch called.

66
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:56,430
Do Jun has exchanged the money in the account into dollars.

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,839
Shouldn't you ask him what it's for?

68
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,778
He may be clever,

69
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:11,019
but it's too much money for a 20-year-old.

70
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,920
Does money choose people depending on their age?

71
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,529
Let's find out if Do Jun...

72
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,160
is a fortunate boy,

73
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,430
or a boy with foresight.

74
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,329
It's just luck.

75
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,300
How else can you explain it?

76
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,669
What could a little boy know about real estate...

77
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,379
that he'd ask for land in Bundang?

78
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,750
No one can beat someone with great luck.

79
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,920
Doesn't that make him even scarier?

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,519
What does Father say almost every day?

81
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,518
You don't become rich by working hard.

82
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,860
It's up to the heavens.

83
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,128
Do Jun made 24 million dollars...

84
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,959
by just pointing at a map.

85
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:00,629
Father could think...

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,628
his youngest grandson is blessed.

87
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,670
Wait.

88
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,639
Is that why? Isn't it weird?

89
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,208
Dad gave that massive sum to a kid who just started college...

90
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,550
and let him manage it himself.

91
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:17,980
He's not that kind of person.

92
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,419
He never let us do anything like that.

93
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,319
Not even Seong Jun, his eldest grandson.

94
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,490
Right?

95
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,839
Seong Jun is the eldest heir,

96
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,539
and he was exiled in the name of study.

97
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,708
Why does Father play favourites with the youngest, Do Jun?

98
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:44,810
That money.

99
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,709
It's the price of our father's life.

100
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,779
If not for Do Jun,

101
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,189
when the plane exploded in mid air,

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,360
Father would've died in it.

103
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,629
Who cares if it's 24 million or 240 million?

104
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,699
It's too early for such a fuss.

105
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,069
Don't you feel ashamed?

106
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,639
You're jealous about a 20-year-old boy's allowance.

107
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,379
You're grown-up adults.

108
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,420
Do you really think so?

109
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,019
That it's allowance?

110
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,420
That it's a simple gift?

111
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,600
It could be a test.

112
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,699
Father could be testing the boy with plans on picking a successor.

113
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,018
What is it that I am

114
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:05,159
Trying to look for?

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,359
Where to is it that I am

116
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,029
Flowing so endlessly?

117
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,939
The upcoming New York Film Market.

118
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,810
Take me with you, Father.

119
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,339
To the Film Market?

120
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,679
I got into university,

121
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,079
but I have lots of time until the semester starts.

122
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,879
I'd like to travel,

123
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,850
and maybe do some advising on what films you should invest in.

124
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,049
You'll be an investment advisor?

125
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,759
You know I have a good eye.

126
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,789
I think I'm the one who got you this office.

127
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,269
I must release this movie on Christmas at all costs?

128
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,298
Do Jun.

129
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,269
You're still young and don't know about movies.

130
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,980
Christmas movies are for families.

131
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,109
Who'd want to watch a gloomy movie about a kid...

132
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,679
left alone at home while his family went travelling?

133
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,919
And you still...

134
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,590
want me to import this movie?

135
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:21,230
So you want to go to the New York Film Market?

136
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,840
Yes. Who knows?

137
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
This time, it might not be just an office.

138
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,340
Perhaps I could buy you a whole building.

139
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,378
There was no me anymore

140
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:39,119
We are still young We still have a nice future

141
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,789
Now wipe up your cold tears

142
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,590
Come back home

143
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,918
Let's go home now.

144
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,990
- You go ahead. - Come with me.

145
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm not Seo Tai Ji.

146
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,029
Oh, gosh...

147
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,669
- Hey, Do Jun. - What?

148
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,199
Just because you got into law top of the class,

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,798
don't get fancy and have dreams...

150
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,909
of passing the bar while you're still in college.

151
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,039
What?

152
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,009
Play. Have fun.

153
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:09,008
Go on group blind dates, regular blind dates, casual dates,

154
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,350
- and go out with someone. - Hang on.

155
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,179
Are they all different?

156
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,220
Are they the same, then? They have different terms.

157
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,960
Don't do that.

158
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,729
Don't make the face of a man who already lived a lifetime.

159
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,398
- What? - Don't do that either.

160
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,798
- I'll do it. - Go away.

161
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,429
Wait, what's that?

162
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,840
- No way. - What do we do now?

163
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,038
What is it?

164
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,209
Excuse me.

165
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,408
- They'd caused a fuss... - Excuse me.

166
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,739
- Coming through. - Sorry.

167
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,480
- They announced their retirement. - What is it?

168
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,148
As of today, January 31, 1996...

169
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,450
Are they disbanding or retiring?

170
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,549
They're retiring.

171
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,159
- Oh, no... - Jeez.

172
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,999
(Seo Min Yeong)

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,069
Why are they retiring?

174
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,299
My loves.

175
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,309
They're retiring because the pain of creating music is too much.

176
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,909
(Seo Min Yeong)

177
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,039
What's this?

178
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,309
This is a look I've never seen on your face.

179
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,350
I can't believe that's her face when she was 20.

180
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,450
Do you know her?

181
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,549
Did you meet her? When?

182
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,190
What?

183
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,620
Oh...

184
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,090
In 20 years' time.

185
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,159
"In 20 years' time."

186
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,028
He's at it again.

187
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,429
Move, mister.

188
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,099
- Move. - Okay.

189
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,470
- I can't see. - I'm not a mister.

190
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,509
Chang Je, are you getting old?

191
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,080
You shouldn't be up this early. What's going on?

192
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:27,019
Why are you coming to see me?

193
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,590
Take a look at this, Father.

194
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,259
(Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office)

195
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,268
(Report on Special Investigation into Hando Steel)

196
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:44,539
I don't think Hando Steel will last a month.

197
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,939
It's a great chance to buy it up cheap.

198
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,309
They took out too many loans to try to expand.

199
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,109
If you underwrite Hando Steel now,

200
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,109
wouldn't it help subsidiaries that use steel...

201
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,919
such as Soonyang Heavy Machinery, Motors, and Machinery?

202
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:03,690
How will they handle this much debt?

203
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,758
If the government vouches for us,

204
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,659
we can extend the repayment deadline to suit us.

205
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,929
Can we trust President YS?

206
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,569
If Hando Group were to break up now,

207
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,538
it would cause huge turmoil.

208
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,970
The President would want to prevent the worst.

209
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,610
Having a prosecutor son-in-law...

210
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:27,850
is so reassuring.

211
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,309
I thought I should give you...

212
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,220
one last gift while I still work there.

213
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,519
What?

214
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,220
Are you going to start a law firm?

215
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,689
Before the general election in April,

216
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,190
the President will recruit talent to join his party.

217
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,569
I'd love to join as a legal advisor and run for office.

218
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,830
The National Assembly is on an island.

219
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,840
It'll be very windy out there. Do you want to get into politics?

220
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,809
You can give me a sail.

221
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,710
I want to venture into bigger waters for Soonyang.

222
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,519
I'll see...

223
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,519
if my son-in-law's ship can survive the sea.

224
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,059
I'll do my best not to let you down, Father.

225
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,590
Something that dreamy would never happen.

226
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,230
One day, will a Korean movie ever beat Hollywood movies...

227
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,330
to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards?

228
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,500
That's something out of a sci-Fi cartoon that makes me emotional.

229
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,539
It won't be easy.

230
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,409
The Academy Awards tend to snuff non-English movies.

231
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,809
I'm too imaginative.

232
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,479
If that day comes,

233
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,879
a Korean song might even reach Billboard's Top 100.

234
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,048
I know.

235
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,788
What I'm saying is as likely as Team Korea...

236
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,789
reaching the semifinals of the FIFA World Cup.

237
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,429
Can't a man dream?

238
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,960
Don't you know dreams come true?

239
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,299
Darn you. Wait up, Dad.

240
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Yes.

241
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,440
Dreams do come true.

242
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,808
- Oh. - I'm sorry.

243
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,919
What the... This is just not fair.

244
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,480
Darn it.

245
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,690
Are you Korean?

246
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,429
Shoot.

247
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,729
If you mean nationality, no.

248
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,840
If you mean where I was born, yes.

249
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,239
We're halfway around the world.

250
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,740
You're not expecting a friendly hug, are you?

251
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,539
Look.

252
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:15,309
Because of you, I just became the investor...

253
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:18,980
with the most rotten luck in the whole of this market.

254
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,019
Oh, then...

255
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,849
I'm truly sorry.

256
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,990
I'll pay you for the donut.

257
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,190
- How much do you want? - Ten million dollars!

258
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,700
Ten million dollars?

259
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,469
What are you talking about?

260
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,639
One donut costs ten million dollars?

261
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,308
I always eat a donut before I decide what to invest in.

262
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:44,239
I've never broken it once.

263
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,308
It's a principle, routine, and jinx. Anyway,

264
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,949
it's my most important, necessary,

265
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,610
and sufficient condition of investing.

266
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
This donut is from a shop in Midtown that's 30 minutes from here.

267
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,190
And I have just ten minutes to decide what to invest in.

268
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,059
Without a donut,

269
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,460
in this market where ten million dollars will change hands,

270
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,990
because of clumsy you.

271
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,559
You'll pay me back?

272
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,869
This donut cost a dollar, but it's worth ten million to me.

273
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,769
How much will you pay me?

274
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,339
Never bet on things...

275
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,079
that you aren't sure about.

276
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,650
Do you get that?

277
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,190
That...

278
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,960
Do Jun! We're over here.

279
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,599
Okay. I'm coming.

280
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,869
What a weirdo.

281
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,180
"Titanic."

282
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,319
The "Titanic" fever is going strong.

283
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,190
Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, the most in Academy history,

284
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,659
at the 70th Academy Awards...

285
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,430
I should invest in "Titanic?"

286
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,690
Yes.

287
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,430
Not for import or distribution rights...

288
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:15,430
but the production?

289
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,029
Yes.

290
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,210
That way, you get a part of the massive profit.

291
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,838
It goes here.

292
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,368
There are three arches.

293
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,479
- Shall we bet? - Yes.

294
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,150
Do Jun. The reason you wanted to come here...

295
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,950
was because you had this movie in mind from the start?

296
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,490
Hey. Look, Father.

297
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,990
My gosh.

298
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,400
Wow. Nice.

299
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,670
Are you convinced it will be a hit?

300
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:54,099
Like "Home Alone" last time?

301
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,180
You know I have a good hunch.

302
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,549
Trust me again.

303
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
A hunch?

304
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,558
Father. I have a scientific...

305
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,288
and logical reason this movie will flop.

306
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,559
It'll shock you.

307
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,029
Blockbusters involving water...

308
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,328
are bound to flop.

309
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,400
Why?

310
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,109
Because the project sinks.

311
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,909
What?

312
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,680
"Cut throat Island," "Waterworld,"

313
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:39,618
and serial hit-maker James Cameron's only flop "The Abyss."

314
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:42,348
They're all about water, and they all tanked.

315
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,990
This is a science.

316
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,259
Boss, you need to think this over.

317
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,730
You have to think this over.

318
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:50,558
You would've never made this decision...

319
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,259
if you didn't drop that darn donut.

320
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,529
Ten million dollars into "Titanic?"

321
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,999
Why don't you take that ten million dollars...

322
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,139
and just throw it into the Atlantic Ocean?

323
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,338
Will you still invest in "Titanic?"

324
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,179
Come on. You didn't even watch "Waterworld."

325
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,210
I couldn't.

326
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,380
DiCaprio?

327
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,279
DiCaprio?

328
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,380
Who on earth will do the acting?

329
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:15,119
And the woman who looks like his aunt.

330
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:16,849
Do Koreans even know who she is?

331
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,160
Do you know her? I don't know her.

332
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,089
- No Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. - They're Korean.

333
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,329
A blockbuster with zero stars?

334
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,029
Do you really think this will work, boss?

335
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,869
"Titanic."

336
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,699
It's about a luxury cruise ship that's only for the rich...

337
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,538
sinking in a gruesome manner in the middle of nowhere.

338
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,169
It's about the rich losing out.

339
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,179
People have no choice but to flock to the cinemas.

340
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,210
Why? Because it'll never happen in reality.

341
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,049
Did you hear that?

342
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,950
She looks like DiCaprio's aunt?

343
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:49,220
She's the real reason I want to invest in this movie.

344
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,489
What?

345
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,018
In a recession like this,

346
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,858
the public care very little for cute, young starlets.

347
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,358
They prefer mature actresses with an intellectual air...

348
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,930
to be their heroine.

349
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,499
Kate Winslet has that face.

350
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,829
They spent an enormous amount of money to make the movie.

351
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,200
It won't be profitable unless it becomes an international hit.

352
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:09,169
Following Europe,

353
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,169
countries in East Asia are building multiplex theatres too.

354
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,639
The number of movie goers will increase exponentially.

355
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,880
And naturally, the profitability will go up as well.

356
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,720
You know what a low-price high-volume policy means, right?

357
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,420
Are you confident?

358
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,990
Can I guarantee that the movie will be a hit?

359
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,960
Then my answer is no. However,

360
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,028
if it's about recovering the investment...

361
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:31,190
and securing stable profitability... Yes.

362
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,200
- He's right. - I'm very rational now, Rachael.

363
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:39,140
I said I dropped the donut.

364
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,069
I never said I didn't eat it.

365
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,369
What?

366
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,750
"Based on scientific evidence..."

367
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,980
is what I'd say in a situation like this.

368
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,249
- Hey! - How's it going?

369
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,618
- I'm good. - Yes.

370
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,989
Are you going to invest in this?

371
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,919
- That's what I'm thinking about. - What about you?

372
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,429
- I'm investing... - Do you have anything in mind?

373
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,259
- Power Shares? - Yes, I have...

374
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,740
Mason Oh.

375
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:20,440
His Korean name is Oh Se Hyeon.

376
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,650
Power Shares.

377
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,119
The director and head of APAC at Power Shares.

378
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,130
Hi, good afternoon.

379
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,499
Hi, may I help you?

380
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,569
Yes. I'm Jin.

381
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,170
I'm here to see Mason Oh.

382
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,969
- I got twenty on Kasparov. - Fifty on Kasparov.

383
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,578
We're nuts for doing this.

384
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,980
I want to put... If you guys let me get in on...

385
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,818
I'm surprised to see you here. I thought...

386
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,950
you'd been in a business meeting somewhere.

387
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,589
Thanks to you,

388
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,700
I became the luckiest investor on Wall Street today.

389
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,259
Here's your delicious cheese pizza.

390
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,930
Enjoy your meal.

391
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:18,369
- Thank you. - Thank you.

392
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:32,779
What's that guy doing?

393
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,920
Is he crazy or something?

394
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,329
Maybe you should order something else.

395
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,130
Darn it. This is so good.

396
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
This is the best cheese I've ever had.

397
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,039
I should've bought some shares in this cheese company back then.

398
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,069
It's too late now.

399
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,109
Darn, it's so good.

400
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,650
Hey, you. I wanted to say something earlier.

401
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,079
I am working right now.

402
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,519
Leave me alone, will you? Don't disturb me.

403
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,159
Well, that's the right move, by the way.

404
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,459
- Oh. - Yes, that is the right move.

405
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,529
That was absolutely amazing.

406
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,730
The supercomputer Deep Blue...

407
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,670
versus Kasparov, the chess champion.

408
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,640
What a strange world we live in.

409
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,609
Even a computer has a name?

410
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,008
Hyeon Woo, what was it called?

411
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,980
You know, that computer. Blue... What was it?

412
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,880
Dad!

413
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,549
- Dad! - What is it, son?

414
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,618
- Wow. - Why? Who won?

415
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,759
My gosh. Unbelievable.

416
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,960
Who do you think will win?

417
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,099
The supercomputer Deep Blue?

418
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,039
Or Garry Kasparov, the chess champion?

419
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,809
Who?

420
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:04,769
Well...

421
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,778
Everyone says it's the game of the century...

422
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:08,349
between a human and a computer.

423
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,450
But that's not what you're interested in, right?

424
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,518
"What is the company value of IBM, the company that made Deep Blue?"

425
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:19,160
"When and how much should I buy in to maximize my profit?"

426
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,859
That's why you're so engrossed in the match. Am I right?

427
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,098
I'll tell you who will win.

428
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,829
In turn, spare me your time.

429
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,569
You can tell me who will win when the match is still going on?

430
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,180
Deep Blue will win.

431
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,349
Invest in IBM, before this round ends.

432
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:47,920
Can I have a piece?

433
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,190
Well, chances are... It's 50-50 anyway.

434
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,660
I guess you're relying on luck. Too bad.

435
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,969
Deep Blue hasn't overcome the limitations of AI.

436
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,400
Even the engineers and developers at IBM admitted it.

437
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:10,009
But you think Deep Blue will beat Kasparov, the genius player?

438
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,180
Deep Blue has less than a 20-percent chance to win.

439
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,710
That's what all experts say. Hey, young man.

440
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:22,589
Never bet on things that you aren't sure about.

441
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,690
I never rely on luck when it comes to my investments.

442
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,809
When the game ends,

443
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:46,680
you'll want to meet me.

444
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,650
I'm confident.

445
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,390
I'm 100 percent sure that Deep Blue will win.

446
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:56,789
Hey, go away.

447
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,730
Oh, my gosh!

448
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,099
- No problem! - Yes!

449
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,909
- I can't believe it. - Thank you, gentlemen. Sorry, man.

450
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,470
What? Deep Blue won?

451
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:21,680
A supercomputer beat a human for the first time in history?

452
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,640
That was a fluke, right?

453
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,079
How did you guess it?

454
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,719
None of the experts on Wall Street...

455
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,859
predicted that Deep Blue would win.

456
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,529
I trusted my instincts.

457
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,559
What?

458
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,900
Had Kasparov been a mere player,

459
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,769
Deep Blue wouldn't have stood a chance against him.

460
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:23,508
However, I bet Kasparov, the genius chess player...

461
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:25,680
who's kept the world champion title for the past 20 years,

462
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,650
wanted to make history.

463
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,249
"Fought against AI and won,"

464
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,349
"thus protecting the pride of mankind."

465
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,819
He probably wanted a title like that.

466
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,759
And greed...

467
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:43,589
always clouds your judgement.

468
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,730
Not bad.

469
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,170
I'd like to invest in companies in the US.

470
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:59,509
Relying on your instincts, knowing how risky that can be?

471
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,049
I have you.

472
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,920
Use numbers to help me prove that my instincts are on point.

473
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm a busy man, you see.

474
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:11,720
Enjoy the rest of your trip.

475
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,730
With accurate data, which is essential for investing.

476
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:20,299
And with cash.

477
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,868
Do you know that the minimum amount we require...

478
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:26,470
is 30,000 dollars?

479
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:29,009
I have a lot of money, Mr. Oh.

480
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:32,609
Save up as much as you can before you join the military.

481
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,410
Enjoy your trip. Bye.

482
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,519
(Jeongsimjae)

483
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,989
As for Hando Steel, we're estimating...

484
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,559
that it'd cost us about 500 million dollars.

485
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,369
So we'll go penniless after this deal.

486
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,239
Do they have something we could use to make money?

487
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,210
Hando Steel owns a warehouse in Busan.

488
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,210
If we make sure the creditors can't touch it...

489
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,039
and build an apartment complex in that lot,

490
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,250
we should be able to earn back the money fairly soon.

491
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,720
Sir, we've encountered an unexpected variable though.

492
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,690
Daeyoung Group is getting ready to bid on Hando Steel too.

493
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,890
The Secretary's Office informed me this morning.

494
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:22,430
Then it means Daeyoung will bid on it for sure.

495
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:25,730
Our Secretary's Office obtains Intel before the NSP does.

496
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,959
Right, Daeyoung makes cars, heavy equipment,

497
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,798
and even ships.

498
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,869
No wonder they want to buy a steel-producing company.

499
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,970
To beat Daeyoung,

500
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:38,879
we'd need at least 400 million dollars. Don't you think?

501
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,980
It's not even a lucrative deal.

502
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,679
Then should we forget about Hando Steel altogether?

503
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,079
I will not let Daeyoung acquire Hando Steel.

504
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,119
And the maximum amount we'll spend on this is 300 million.

505
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,460
We won't spend a penny more.

506
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,390
Then how...

507
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,170
Why are you asking me?

508
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,200
- Vice-Chairman. - Yes, sir.

509
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,939
Go make sure we can acquire Hando Steel.

510
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,039
Pardon?

511
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,309
Why? Are you not confident?

512
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,150
Then step down. Why are you sitting here?

513
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,549
What will you do?

514
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,690
My goodness. Thanks. This looks delicious.

515
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,329
Do Jun, you're such a perfect grandson.

516
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,129
You came all the way here...

517
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,440
to see your grandparents after your trip to the US.

518
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,939
Just like your father, you're handsome,

519
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,640
smart, and sweet.

520
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:47,880
Right, Jeong Rae?

521
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,009
I'd say he got his looks from his mother.

522
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,380
As for his brain... I don't know.

523
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:00,419
Use your smart brain to follow in your grandpa's footsteps...

524
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,359
and grow the company.

525
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,028
Why not study management?

526
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,400
Why would you suddenly want to go to law school?

527
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,538
He takes after his father,

528
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,809
so I guess he has no interest in running a business whatsoever.

529
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,269
Right, Do Jun?

530
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:21,940
If I study law,

531
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,049
I can be more helpful to Grandpa and his business.

532
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,849
Really?

533
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,019
My gosh. Is that why you decided to study law, Do Jun?

534
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,990
Grandma, I'm still in my first year.

535
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,400
At the moment, I just want to play and not think about anything.

536
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:43,368
Yes! Just play.

537
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:45,500
That's what you should do when you're in your first year.

538
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,298
Meet some girls too, okay?

539
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,538
The board meeting is over.

540
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,338
I see. You can go upstairs now, Do Jun.

541
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:51,369
Okay, Grandma.

542
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:53,779
- Thank you. - Just play!

543
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,450
Goodness, that old man is awfully stubborn.

544
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,018
Acquire Hando Steel, but don't spend money.

545
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:05,190
What are we supposed to do, then?

546
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:09,890
Right, Young Ki?

547
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,900
Do Jun, you're back!

548
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,380
You little rascal.

549
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,149
Did you see lots of cool things in the US?

550
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,349
- Did you eat lots of good food? - Yes, Grandpa.

551
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,150
Thanks to you...

552
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,490
I had a great trip.

553
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:36,650
Good.

554
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,190
What was your favourite out of all the dishes you tried there?

555
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,160
- Pardon me? - What was your favourite dish?

556
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Oh.

557
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,170
The donut.

558
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,250
That brat.

559
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,749
Does he think he's Lee Mi Ja or Cho Yong Pil...

560
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,550
who just returned from his concert tour in Southeast Asia?

561
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:09,789
Goodness.

562
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,159
I'm talking about Do Jun.

563
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,030
He was in New York for a few days with his dad.

564
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,429
And he showed up to report to Father that he's back.

565
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,569
Hey. He's just 20, and he's a guy.

566
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,369
Guys his age are rarely that attentive.

567
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,570
I bet he has an ulterior motive.

568
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:32,039
At age 20, he should know how to respect his elders.

569
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,579
He's better than his dad.

570
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,050
You're so understanding.

571
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,179
You're incredibly magnanimous.

572
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,489
But you see,

573
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,750
did you know that Do Jun...

574
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,359
exchanged the 24 billion won to US dollars before his trip?

575
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
The price of our father's life?

576
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,030
It wouldn't have been possible without Father's permission.

577
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,599
He's different from his dad.

578
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,799
Yoon Ki never had any interest in the company.

579
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,170
But that boy is different. Just look at his eyes.

580
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,309
We have to stay frosty, Young Ki.

581
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,380
That it's allowance? That it's a simple gift?

582
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,460
It could be a test.

583
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:22,889
Go make sure we can acquire Hando Steel.

584
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:27,360
Father could be testing the boy with plans on picking a successor.

585
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,969
Why? Are you not confident?

586
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,840
Then step down. Why are you sitting here?

587
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,209
(Jin Young Ki)

588
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,178
I told the Economic Research Institute...

589
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:47,019
to prepare a report to send to Hando Steel's creditors.

590
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,749
If we emphasize the number of jobs that will be created...

591
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,820
when we acquire Hando Steel and the positive synergy,

592
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:55,320
Cheongwadae will show interest too.

593
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,000
Risk management is crucial as the administration is nearing its end.

594
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,730
Please proceed accordingly, Mr. Lee.

595
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,599
Yes, sir.

596
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,380
Hang Jae.

597
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,659
My old man...

598
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,829
What does he want from me?

599
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,099
Acquiring Hando Steel?

600
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,070
Or...

601
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,739
is he just not happy with anything I do?

602
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,280
You know what he's thinking better than his own children do.

603
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,750
Mr. Chairman...

604
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:55,150
would like to pass Soonyang down to someone who is like him.

605
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,388
And it might not be his eldest son?

606
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:00,058
Young Ki, he is giving you a chance first...

607
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,190
because you're his eldest son.

608
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,199
Focus on acquiring Hando Steel.

609
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,170
He wants to see the fighting spirit and persistence in you.

610
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:18,610
To him, running a company...

611
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,880
was like a never-ending war,

612
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,679
where he had to kill first in order to survive.

613
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,150
Sir.

614
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,388
As you had predicted, Vice-Chairman Jin...

615
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:37,530
asked me what you were really thinking.

616
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,400
I told him that you were giving him a chance...

617
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,239
and that nothing would change...

618
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,340
if he did his best to acquire Hando Steel.

619
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,039
I assured him.

620
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:57,079
Hang Jae.

621
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,880
It's such a shame.

622
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,889
Pardon me?

623
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,690
Why were you born to your parents?

624
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,489
I wish you were my son.

625
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,099
Sir, didn't you know?

626
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,539
I think of you as my father.

627
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,309
I'll leave you to it.

628
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,780
You see, Do Jun...

629
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:39,920
His school is pretty far from where he lives.

630
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,590
Send him a car.

631
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,199
Yes, sir.

632
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,480
Hello, I'm Ha In Seok from the Secretary's Office.

633
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,239
Hello.

634
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,980
Mr. Chairman sent me.

635
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,479
He said your school was pretty far,

636
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,780
so it must be hard for you to commute.

637
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:12,389
I'll be your driver from now on.

638
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,039
Please just drop me off in front of the gate.

639
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:32,840
I'll walk from there.

640
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:35,440
No, I'll drop you off in front of the lecture hall.

641
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,809
Most people at school already know who I am.

642
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:43,489
I don't want to show up with a driver and attract attention.

643
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,320
It won't do Grandpa any good.

644
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,429
Right, I'll remember that.

645
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,559
(Seoul National University)

646
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,219
I got it. I don't want to turn into a spoiled brat.

647
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,920
Oh, right.

648
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,320
You're done for the day.

649
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:26,360
You're free to decide how to spend the rest of your day.

650
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,599
Bye.

651
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,098
- Hello! - Come and take one!

652
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,909
- Take a look at this. - Please join us!

653
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,979
- Come find us! - Join us!

654
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,079
- Hello, take one! - Welcome!

655
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:43,779
- Hello, welcome! - Are you a freshman?

656
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,049
- Would you be interested? - Hi.

657
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,820
Come find us!

658
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:48,519
You should join us.

659
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,929
Jin Do Jun, at the School of Law. Right?

660
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:09,099
I study law too. I'm Kim Tae Young.

661
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:11,408
He's Gang Nam from the Department of Journalism.

662
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:14,639
Come on, why is the introduction so bland? It's between us.

663
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,619
Tae Young's family owns Mirae Industry.

664
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,519
My family owns Bando Firm.

665
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,149
Ji Min's grandfather has been the Prime Minister since...

666
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,219
So?

667
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:31,789
Seong Jun must not have told you about our club, Prestigious Club.

668
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:35,159
I did hear about it. Prestigious Club.

669
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,300
You used to call me casually, but now you treat me as your senior.

670
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:41,369
It was the center of Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun's connection.

671
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:42,908
A secretive social gathering...

672
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:44,110
of the children of prestigious families.

673
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,110
You don't have to act so stiff. It's nothing much.

674
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:51,349
We're just inviting you to have a meal with those of your class.

675
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,780
People are so strange.

676
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,789
They feel a sense of incongruity because of people like us.

677
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,619
So what? Is that our fault?

678
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,630
It's their inferior complex.

679
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,929
Yes.

680
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,729
What do you think, newbie?

681
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,559
Enough with all the talking.

682
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,630
Your number.

683
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,840
Why? Do I need your grandfather's permission to get your number?

684
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,638
I'll text you the location and time of your welcoming dinner.

685
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,909
You know it's a must to bring a partner, right?

686
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,889
I must stick to the rule, right?

687
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,829
Nice!

688
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,900
(Music Listening Room)

689
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,630
We've met before, right?

690
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,969
You look familiar. I definitely met you before.

691
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:28,039
Where did we meet?

692
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,070
You definitely have a classical taste.

693
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:35,039
You could just invite me for a meal.

694
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,750
Isn't this tactic way too classic?

695
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,989
Hello, I'm not hitting on you.

696
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:45,949
Invite you for a meal?

697
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:47,789
- When did I... - Here it is.

698
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,630
This is what you're looking for, right?

699
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:11,050
Let's have a meal.

700
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:39,979
("'Hello, I'm Jin Do Jun,' An Interview With Jin Do Jun...")

701
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,440
("Who Entered Department of Law At the Top of His Class")

702
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:43,980
There was a reason.

703
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,550
Are you so confident and rude...

704
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,750
because of your grandfather?

705
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:52,449
No way.

706
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,518
What's so hard about having a meal...

707
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,929
with a peer in my department?

708
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,730
Do I have to use my grandfather's power to eat with you?

709
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,869
If you treat me to a nice meal,

710
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,169
I was going to tell you...

711
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,570
when Seo Tai Ji was making a comeback.

712
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,940
I thought you might be curious.

713
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,349
Is it fun to tease people?

714
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:23,150
It's true, right?

715
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,919
You said Soonyang's better than the CIA in getting information.

716
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,929
That's how you heard it, right?

717
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,860
I knew it. Is he really making a comeback?

718
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,829
When?

719
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,440
You're going to eat with me, right?

720
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,989
She's there. Please stop here.

721
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,230
Okay.

722
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,130
Do you normally always wear like this?

723
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,469
You're a bit different from the Seo Min Yeong I know.

724
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:51,670
This? You're wrong.

725
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,538
You must be thinking...

726
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:57,678
that I dolled up to meet you, but...

727
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:00,449
You look better now. They're nice clothes.

728
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,159
Tell me now. Is it true?

729
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,860
Is he really making a comeback?

730
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:14,429
Seo Tai Ji, I mean.

731
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,500
When is he coming back?

732
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:20,570
You...

733
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:23,710
Do you really know?

734
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,440
After 4 years. The summer of 2000.

735
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,980
He's coming back to celebrate the millennium, right?

736
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:32,780
Not as a group.

737
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,719
Seo Tai Ji continues as a soloist.

738
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,760
What's wrong?

739
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,300
Are you disappointed?

740
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,500
That's...

741
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,039
just like Seo Tai Ji.

742
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:57,110
You need new music for the new millennium.

743
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:03,949
I kept my word. Can we go eat now?

744
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:06,349
- Sure. - Okay. Let's go.

745
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,288
- Seriously... - Go.

746
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:12,349
- Hurry up. - Nice.

747
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,529
This is the last time, okay?

748
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,960
One more time.

749
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,840
Order.

750
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,909
Okay.

751
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,480
You're here, Jin Do Jun.

752
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,090
Gosh.

753
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:47,820
It's really nice to see you in Prestigious Club.

754
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,590
It's so nice to see you.

755
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,960
We made a bet.

756
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:55,030
Seong Jun said...

757
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,999
you were a boring bookworm,

758
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,469
so you would never join our club.

759
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,169
Prestigious Club?

760
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,069
She's Seo Min Yeong, also a freshman...

761
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,210
of the Department of Law.

762
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,510
Hold on.

763
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,719
You're obedient.

764
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,920
You only did this.

765
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,589
She's a guest difficult to invite.

766
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,860
Seo Min Yeong from Hanil Girls' High School.

767
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,329
Her father is working in Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

768
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,599
In the end, you're here.

769
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,369
As Do Jun's partner.

770
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:36,340
Anyway, welcome.

771
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,889
This is Ha In Seok. Jin Do Jun,

772
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,789
I mean, this is the route of 4-2.

773
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,099
You should have told me the truth from the beginning.

774
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,309
If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

775
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,110
Why did you bring me here?

776
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,480
- Because you're qualified. - What?

777
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,309
Seo Min Yeong, the only child of Seo Yoon Ho,

778
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,149
the deputy prosecutor...

779
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,820
of Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office Special Unit.

780
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,319
It's a social gathering that suits you.

781
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,489
This Prestigious Club.

782
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,289
It's a social gathering?

783
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:37,329
Friendship where you back each other up when you're in trouble...

784
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,500
once you each hold a position after graduating?

785
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:45,010
Close-knit friendship...

786
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,409
that ignores law and policies as if they're nothing?

787
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,849
A social gathering, you said?

788
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,880
Not a gathering of potential criminals?

789
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,320
Don't be mistaken, Jin Do Jun.

790
00:51:57,389 --> 00:52:00,619
What you can share here isn't deep friendship.

791
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,329
It's a strong privilege.

792
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:05,190
It doesn't suit me.

793
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:08,500
I never had such a privilege...

794
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,530
nor did I expect one.

795
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,969
You're the one who's mistaken, Seo Min Yeong.

796
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:22,440
So you think you're free from those privileges?

797
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,348
Because you entered the best university in Korea...

798
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:30,420
with the exam scores you worked hard to achieve with your smart brain.

799
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,558
The fact that you were able to focus solely on studying...

800
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,690
throughout the three years of high school.

801
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,860
And the fact that you can only focus...

802
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:44,829
on studying instead of worrying about making a living now.

803
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,268
Haven't you thought...

804
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:49,840
that it's thanks to your parents' financial and mental support?

805
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,678
The family of bench and bar for generations.

806
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,349
A healthy body and a smart brain.

807
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,250
Have you never thought...

808
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,889
that all of those were privileges given to you for free...

809
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,619
ever since you were born?

810
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:26,909
About Do Jun, sir.

811
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,678
He's adjusting well to his university life...

812
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,349
just like his peers.

813
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:37,920
- Is that so? - Now's the best time in life.

814
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,988
Even though he has 24 million dollars,

815
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,489
he's still young.

816
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:47,000
I wonder what he's thinking.

817
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,199
Oh, well.

818
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:53,099
You don't even know what your own son is thinking.

819
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,269
He is...

820
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:00,139
too distant of a family for me to know about him.

821
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:04,749
Hando Steel reported bankruptcy as they could not manage the debt...

822
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,820
from debt financing.

823
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:10,219
Hando Steel has a debt over four billion dollars in total.

824
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:14,659
Big social and economical impacts are expected.

825
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,459
The company that placed 1th in wealth ranking.

826
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,299
The company with the biggest debt of 4.2 billion dollars...

827
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,130
collapsed in vain.

828
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,729
Vice-Chairman Jin will attend the meeting...

829
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,800
with the creditors himself.

830
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,570
(Vice-Chairman's Office)

831
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,650
We have a problem, sir.

832
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:40,178
With the acquisition fund of 300 million dollars we prepared,

833
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:42,179
we might not be able to negotiate.

834
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,249
What are you saying now?

835
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,190
There's a company that offered 500 million dollars...

836
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:50,289
that the creditors demanded as the acquisition fund.

837
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,829
Is it Daeyoung?

838
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:52,929
Actually...

839
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:55,500
It's a foreign investment company.

840
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,839
Is there a special reason why a foreign company...

841
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,899
took over a big Korean company?

842
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,638
Are you going to take over Hando Steel?

843
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:05,609
Did you really offer 500 million dollars?

844
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,908
- Are you going to take over? - Please tell us!

845
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:09,178
- Why did you do it? - Did you take over the company...

846
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:10,408
at 500 million dollars?

847
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:11,409
Of course.

848
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,618
Power Shares is an investment company...

849
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,250
that focuses on the future value.

850
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:19,219
The 500 million dollars we offered is the future value of Hando Steel.

851
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:23,260
An American investment company, Power Shares.

852
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:25,928
Oh Se Hyeon, the representative of East Asia region.

853
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,030
(Detailed Profile)

854
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,759
He's an investment manager...

855
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,269
who invests in companies' future values.

856
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:33,328
He's a Korean-American who performs exceptionally well...

857
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,699
when it comes to company takeovers.

858
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:36,539
Future values?

859
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:39,170
Why would a foreign investment company...

860
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,110
that performed exceptionally well...

861
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,079
want to take over...

862
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,550
a weak and small company like Hando Steel?

863
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,820
Just why?

864
00:55:56,889 --> 00:56:00,429
It's a chess piece.

865
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,670
There must be the chess board's owner.

866
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:08,900
The owner?

867
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,610
Whoever...

868
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,650
can't stand to watch Soonyang take over Hando Steel.

869
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,750
That person is...

870
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:27,719
the owner of the chess board.

871
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:39,170
(Three Way Restaurant)

872
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:45,940
(Three Way Restaurant)

873
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:48,308
- Gosh! - My goodness.

874
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:51,879
Gosh, Gyeong Hui. You said your back isn't well.

875
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,550
Oh, dear.

876
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,718
- You'll hurt your back. - It's okay.

877
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:59,050
- Goodness. - I can't believe this.

878
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:01,389
Gosh.

879
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,530
- Be careful. - Okay.

880
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,090
Goodness!

881
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,900
You'll hurt yourself.

882
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:22,610
Did you say he was Oh Se Hyeon?

883
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:24,179
Yes.

884
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,579
Dig into him.

885
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,079
What he's thinking...

886
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:33,190
and who he's meeting.

887
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,190
Yes, sir.

888
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:03,550
I shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.

889
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,389
Because of you, I am breaking my first rule...

890
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:11,130
of investment for the first time.

891
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,969
The corporate value of Hando Steel is 500 million dollars?

892
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,099
No.

893
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:21,340
Nevertheless, the investor wants to invest in it? Yes.

894
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:23,369
Yes.

895
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:26,539
Tell me the reason, at least.

896
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,480
Why are you investing so recklessly?

897
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,780
Keep investors' secrets no matter what happens.

898
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,119
That's your investment rule, right?

899
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,760
I have to stop Hando Steel...

900
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:48,429
from falling into Vice-Chairman Jin's hands.

901
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,630
Vice-Chairman Jin?

902
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,599
He's your uncle. The successor of Soonyang.

903
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,440
You should be nice to your family, so why...

904
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,750
What you want...

905
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,880
isn't just Hando Steel?

906
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,650
In the end, what you want...

907
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:12,820
is Soonyang?

908
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,190
You want to become the owner of Soonyang?

909
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,969
(Soonyang Group)

910
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:56,929
(Reborn Rich)

911
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:28,729
Are you asking because you don't know,

912
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:29,860
or do you want to pretend that you don't know?

913
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,269
It's my present.

914
01:00:31,329 --> 01:00:32,828
Do Jun.

915
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,539
I prepared it to welcome you.

916
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:36,039
Darn it.

917
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,170
Don't give me another presumptuous advice.

918
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,979
You're going to take over Hando Steel?

919
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,309
You want to beat Daeyoung so bad.

920
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,980
If you ever let Daeyoung take Hando Steel...

921
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:50,219
The person who gave Daeyoung the money is someone from Soonyang.

922
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:53,960
The eldest son succeeding. This isn't Joseon Dynasty.

923
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,260
I'll show Father who I am.

924
01:00:57,889 --> 01:01:00,559
It's not over until it's over.

925
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:03,559
I never forgave those...

926
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:05,929
who went against me.

927
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,099
