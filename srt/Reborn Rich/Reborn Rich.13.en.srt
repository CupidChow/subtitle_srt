00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,159
(Reborn Rich)

2
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,439
Mr. Lee.

3
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,170
Yes, sir?

4
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,069
Was I wrong?

5
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Pardon?

6
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,680
I thought cars would become like electronics.

7
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,349
Was I wrong?

8
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,120
Why would you be wrong?

9
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,799
Then why...

10
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,900
When I say cars will be the future of Soonyang,

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,370
do people call it a delusion?

12
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:47,510
I'm convinced there's a chance,

13
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,480
and they call me arbitrary.

14
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,650
I'm so serious about it that I can't give it up,

15
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,390
and they call me obstinate.

16
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,930
What did I do wrong...

17
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,168
that the very people who applauded me...

18
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:14,210
are using the same hands...

19
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,740
to point at me in an accusatory manner?

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,379
I don't get it.

21
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,560
Why are my children at the forefront?

22
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,830
Do you know why, Hang Jae?

23
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,669
The answer to that.

24
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,699
May I explain it, Grandfather?

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,110
To be honest,

26
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,949
a Soonyang car isn't exactly desirable.

27
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,849
Performance, safety, competitive price, design.

28
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,319
And the name value which is all that put together.

29
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,659
The market is already...

30
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,759
full to the brim with better options.

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,099
Apollo is a compact car,

32
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,909
but from a customer's perspective, 5,000 dollars is a lot of money.

33
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,280
To make someone open their wallet to buy a Soonyang car,

34
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,979
we need something more appealing.

35
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,150
If I were you,

36
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,120
I'd sell that charm, not the car.

37
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,860
Will you delegate me all rights and authority to Apollo?

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,389
I'll see to it that...

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,030
no one says Soonyang Motors is a delusion,

40
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,830
that you're arbitrary,

41
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,240
or obstinate.

42
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,289
(Reborn Rich)

43
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,688
(Episode 13)

44
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,090
He delegated all rights?

45
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,689
Yes.

46
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,859
What does Do Jun know about cars?

47
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,929
He also allocated the biggest marketing budget...

48
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,870
for the release of a new car.

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
My goodness.

50
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,069
It's for the better, sir.

51
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,639
If Apollo flops,

52
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,279
Do Jun will have to shoulder the blame.

53
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,879
How do you guarantee...

54
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,980
Apollo will flop?

55
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,719
Soonyang Motors' future depends on Apollo, the new car.

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,919
(The birth of Apollo)

57
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,990
But this car...

58
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,430
is pretty much predicted to fail.

59
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,759
You profit from selling compact cars...

60
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,430
by selling many for cheap.

61
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,800
But Apollo...

62
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,740
is made with expensive parts and materials.

63
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,638
It can't be sold at a cheap price,

64
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,138
and the domestic compact car market...

65
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,379
is already saturated, so we can't sell many either.

66
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,379
So our plan...

67
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,579
is to not...

68
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:12,720
sell the car.

69
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,959
The product you and I must sell...

70
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,029
is this.

71
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,099
The FIFA World Cup?

72
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,959
What can we do with the World Cup?

73
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,198
Daeyoung Motors is the World Cup's official sponsor.

74
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,838
What does he think he can do by jumping in now?

75
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,898
Does he think we'll sell more as a host country?

76
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,809
Our team won't even make it through the group stage.

77
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,910
Will he give a few cars away? Say ten?

78
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,309
If and when our team scores their first win...

79
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,479
(100 cars)

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,550
We give out 100 cars.

81
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,379
If we reach the Round of 16, it'll go up to 400.

82
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,120
Reach the quarterfinals, and it's 500.

83
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,290
And if we reach the semifinals, which is a long-held dream...

84
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,959
(1,000 cars)

85
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:55,459
It'll be 1,000.

86
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,430
- As if. - No way.

87
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,528
The huge numbers...

88
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,169
will get us noticed in the early stages.

89
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,338
The higher up our team goes,

90
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,739
the more interest people will show in Apollo.

91
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,508
So the promotion is organized...

92
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,910
with the assumption our national soccer team...

93
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,410
reaches the semifinals?

94
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
- That's right. - What if we don't make it?

95
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,250
The semifinals? I say it's unlikely we'll even survive the group.

96
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,588
We can't even reach the Round of 16.

97
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,389
This is preposterous.

98
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,990
It is.

99
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,230
And then the public...

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,599
will equate the memories of desperate cheering...

101
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,300
and praying with our new car.

102
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,240
But if, and it's a huge if,

103
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,639
our team manages to reach the semis?

104
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,810
The public...

105
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,649
will equate Apollo...

106
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,980
with the overwhelming feel of victory.

107
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,648
We can't bring down the car's factory price,

108
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,689
but we can reduce the customers' burden of expenses.

109
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,800
I'd like to make an unprecedented 48-month installment plan.

110
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,529
Actually, a 60-month long-term plan.

111
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,399
And I'd like it to be done jointly with Soonyang Card.

112
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,470
Soonyang Motors will improve Apollo's price competitiveness,

113
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,639
and Soonyang Card can make more on installment interest and charges.

114
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,709
It's a win-win deal.

115
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,480
We had an internal discussion based on your official notice,

116
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,420
and we decided to reject Soonyang Motors' offer.

117
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,120
I have another appointment. Bye.

118
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,329
Sir. I'm really sorry.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,458
May I ask why you're rejecting the offer?

120
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,529
Soonyang Card also entered the market later on.

121
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,669
To gather more credit card members,

122
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,938
we concluded it would be better to cooperate with...

123
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,040
a better-known affiliate.

124
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,740
I apologize.

125
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,139
Wait.

126
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,350
Is that affiliate...

127
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,079
Soonyang Electronics?

128
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,250
Bye.

129
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,459
If it's Electronics,

130
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,629
is Jin Young Ki behind it?

131
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,329
This is an all-out war.

132
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,759
Then we should go all-out too.

133
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,029
You bet.

134
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,240
Miracle should take over Soonyang Card.

135
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
You bet.

136
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,670
We take over what?

137
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,310
We need management rights to a credit card company.

138
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,778
Apollo is a compact car...

139
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,779
and Soonyang Motors' brand power is minuscule.

140
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,220
If the public rejects it right away, there's no coming back.

141
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
To increase sales in the early stages,

142
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,889
we need a card company to provide a long-term plan.

143
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,289
Should we look for another partner?

144
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,058
The World Cup will be over by the time we negotiate...

145
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,399
the details and sign the papers.

146
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,370
Hello, Grandfather.

147
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,620
Grandfather.

148
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,960
I brought you some tea.

149
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,860
You should have it before it cools.

150
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,370
Don't go. Stay.

151
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,139
Stay until the song finishes.

152
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,870
I looked up the song you like...

153
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,240
and played it for you on purpose.

154
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,279
Stay until the song ends.

155
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,519
Don't worry about Yoon Ki.

156
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,299
I'm...

157
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,269
planning to leave Yoon Ki's son...

158
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,210
all of Soonyang Group.

159
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,149
Yoon Ki...

160
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,019
Yoon Ki's mom. You must have...

161
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,360
resented me a great deal.

162
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,100
Hello, Grandfather.

163
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,539
Hello.

164
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,149
- Grandfather. - Yes?

165
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,460
I have something to report. Shall we go to your study?

166
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,600
Let's go. Give me this.

167
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,610
Okay. Call me once you've scheduled his next appointment, Director Jung.

168
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,580
Bye.

169
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,450
I must've caused trouble. Did I?

170
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,519
Don't worry. You haven't.

171
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,740
Hyeon Min.

172
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:50,379
I'll bring the chairman his tea.

173
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,250
You can focus on the other stuff.

174
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,389
- Yes, Grandmother. - Okay.

175
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,120
Hyeon Min.

176
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,629
Yes?

177
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,960
Did the chairman...

178
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,129
say anything else to you?

179
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,299
No, he didn't.

180
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,970
He just listened to the music.

181
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:20,480
I see. You can go downstairs, then.

182
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,889
Grandfather, you had something to say to me?

183
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,289
The event...

184
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,629
you're planning for Apollo's release.

185
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:40,970
Yes.

186
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,370
Let's forget all about it.

187
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,808
Are you serious?

188
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,879
Why?

189
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,649
Do you think your grandfather is out of his mind?

190
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:57,980
Shall I recite the times table?

191
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,750
No.

192
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,289
I'm back, sir.

193
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,388
- Mr. Lee. - Yes.

194
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:10,190
I called Do Jun so he'd arrive when you did.

195
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,929
Mr. Lee. What's going on?

196
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,669
Well...

197
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,039
Soonyang Motors.

198
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,509
I'm going to sell it.

199
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,178
I heard there are some Indian...

200
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,149
and Chinese companies showing interest.

201
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,350
When someone is interested,

202
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,460
I should sell it and get as most as I can.

203
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,528
If we begin negotiations now, he thinks...

204
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,459
the media and shareholders will have no reason to reject you...

205
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,299
as CEO of the financial holding company.

206
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,769
He told me a few days ago to find prospective buyers.

207
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,870
I just rushed back from a meeting.

208
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,210
Then the world will remember Soonyang Motors...

209
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,309
as Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's...

210
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,620
terrible mistake.

211
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,629
Grandfather.

212
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,840
If this is about the public sentiment,

213
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,809
once Apollo is released...

214
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,350
and the World Cup Semifinal Event ends,

215
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,610
the public sentiment will shift.

216
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,779
The time comes soon.

217
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,659
You said that cars are electronics.

218
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,419
The day will come...

219
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,129
when the world will accept your foresight.

220
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,730
Don't you want to see it too?

221
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,399
Have you seen it?

222
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,710
You speak as confidently as if you saw it happen.

223
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,110
The World Cup semifinals?

224
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,548
They barely won a match,

225
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:13,178
let alone reach the Round of 16,

226
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,289
and they'll reach the semifinals?

227
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,788
Do you want me to believe...

228
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:20,620
something that sounds like it came out of a dream?

229
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,229
- Mr. Lee. - Yes?

230
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,570
Do you think this makes sense?

231
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,840
How about a wager, then?

232
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,709
If the Korean soccer team doesn't reach the semifinals,

233
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,850
you can sell Soonyang Motors right away.

234
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:46,620
But if...

235
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,720
our team reaches the semifinals,

236
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,690
then do as I say and never sell Soonyang Motors.

237
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,000
Are you up for the wager?

238
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,090
There.

239
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,019
He's not the type to make silly jokes.

240
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,259
Do Jun...

241
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,570
pities me.

242
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,110
Of all my children and grandchildren,

243
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,740
the only one who cares about me...

244
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,509
is Do Jun.

245
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,250
Hang Jae. This won't do.

246
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,759
I should revise my written will.

247
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,730
Your written will?

248
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,339
The 2002 Korea-Japan FIFA World Cup.

249
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,670
I announce the games open.

250
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,349
(Apollo, Soonyang Motors)

251
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,239
(We congratulate Team Korea on their first ever World Cup win!)

252
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,700
Make the call right now.

253
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,970
Have all the Soonyang Motor banners and posters taken down.

254
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,309
Make sure every single one is taken down right...

255
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:57,150
There's a typo!

256
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,220
(First ever World Cup win!)

257
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,160
(Congratulations on the first ever World Cup win!)

258
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,199
Our team's first match is against Poland,

259
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,099
and it happens this evening.

260
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,499
It shouldn't say "congratulations."

261
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,039
It should say "we wish" or something like that.

262
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:24,480
I know.

263
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,680
- What? - It's to make people...

264
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,779
do a double take.

265
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,380
Oh, no, it's not.

266
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,220
It's to cheer on our team so they really do win.

267
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,390
It wasn't a typo?

268
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,118
Are you conning the whole country?

269
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,189
Since when did you want to become...

270
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,429
a scoundrel who lies to the nation?

271
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,029
Don't worry, Hyeong Jun. We'll win today.

272
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,630
We'll win? How?

273
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,039
How can we win with a coach like Five-Zero?

274
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,068
You can't call the coach that.

275
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:56,740
Should I call him "Mr. Hiddink"?

276
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,209
That guy Five-Zero doesn't know our team at all.

277
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,249
Instead of Asia's greatest striker, the eagle Choi Yong Soo,

278
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,048
how could he pick Ahn Jung Hwan?

279
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,889
Does he think good looks help you win?

280
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,750
He brought a load of people we've never heard of.

281
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:10,920
Park Ji Sung?

282
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,758
Who on earth is Park Ji Sung?

283
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,390
Hyeong Jun, don't you dare...

284
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,200
- It's Ji Sung Park. - "Ji Sung Park?"

285
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,328
Is he from overseas?

286
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,900
- Why do I even bother? - Unbelievable.

287
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,068
At this rate, you'll end up saying...

288
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,970
he'll play in the Premier League.

289
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,440
(Korea's first World Cup win)

290
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,180
What did I say? I said we'd win!

291
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,519
I said this would be our first win!

292
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,919
I heard you say "Five-Zero."

293
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,058
And something about playing with good looks.

294
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,389
I did too.

295
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,129
Good looks help you win soccer.

296
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,689
Face-reading is a science.

297
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,399
Look at Park Ji Sung. It's all over his face.

298
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,969

299
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,368

It's the kick-off, and the whistle was blown.

- Park Ji Sung! - Park Ji Sung! He does it!

307

- We got there eventually. - Park Ji Sung did it.

336
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,119
How do you think the next match will go?

337
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,730
Well...

338
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,329
You can see my reply in the next Soonyang Motors' ad.

339
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,069
Dreams come true.

340
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,268
Team Korea attempts the impossible.

341
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,680
We congratulate them on the win in the quarterfinals.

342
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,480
As you run toward your dreams,

343
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,150
Apollo will run with you.

344
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,750
Apollo, Soonyang Motors.

345
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,829
Do Jun has lots of talents.

346
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,160
It won't last.

347
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,660
He used the World Cup fever...

348
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,569
to carry the Apollo name.

349
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,500
It's not enough...

350
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,539
to say he landed safely in the market.

351
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,319
What is the matter with you?

352
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,519
I apologize, sir.

353
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,758
What? Apollo will flop?

354
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,759
The compact car market is saturated?

355
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,470
If you have eyes, look, and if you have ears, listen.

356
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,599
Use that stupid mouth of yours and speak up.

357
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:48,809
That Apollo will be Soonyang Motors'...

358
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:51,609
greatest failure!

359
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,640
(Apollo Sales Count)

360
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,379
(Guinness Book of Records)

361
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,549
(Most compact car sales in shortest time)

362
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,019
Everyone!

363
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,119
Apollo is now mentioned in the Guinness Book of Records!

364
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,558
Congratulations.

365
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,930
Thank you.

366
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:16,700
Apollo is now the compact car...

367
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,469
to sell the most in the shortest time,

368
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,798
and even if you buy one now,

369
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,609
you might not even get it next spring.

370
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,410
I owe all this to your hard work.

371
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,420
You all did great. Thank you.

372
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,250
If we beat Spain today, it means we reach the semifinals.

373
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,058
Will the next Apollo ad...

374
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,429
predict our team will reach the final?

375
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,129
- It should. - Why not?

376
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,098
- No. - Let's go all the way.

377
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,329
The Apollo ad...

378
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,700
will end with the semifinals.

379
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,499
- Why? - Too bad.

380
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,399
Are you saying you think...

381
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,240
our team won't make it to the final?

382
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,410
There's no other reason for that.

383
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,579
The World Cup Event's purpose...

384
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,980
was to improve brand recognition and popularity.

385
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,319
We went way over our goal.

386
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,018
What a pity.

387
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,049
In other words,

388
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,259
I used up all the marketing funds my grandfather gave me.

389
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,789
I see.

390
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:21,329
When my grandfather sees this,

391
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,400
I bet he'll say it was money well spent.

392
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:26,239
I'll go and show this off.

393
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,839
- Enjoy your feast. - Okay!

394
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,880
Do Jun is quite the entrepreneur.

395
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,509
He brags way too much.

396
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,750
We're up against Spain.

397
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,519
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.

398
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,258
How are we to beat soccer powerhouse Spain...

399
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,818
to reach the semifinals?

400
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,130
That borders on a miracle.

401
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,659
It does.

402
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,960
Hang Jae, you tell me.

403
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,029
Do you think our team stands a chance?

404
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,869
I agree with you, sir.

405
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Do you?

406
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,319
You do too, don't you? We won't reach the semifinals.

407
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,599
Even if you lose the wager,

408
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,700
I also wish that a miracle will visit...

409
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,109
Soonyang Motors and our soccer team.

410
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,210
Since it's a special match, why don't you watch it...

411
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:43,579
in private with Do Jun?

412
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,079
I'd like to watch the game with my family too.

413
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,650
Yes.

414
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,890
I agree with you.

415
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,329
Oh, dear.

416
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:20,480
My grandmother is so attentive.

417
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,690
She won't even let you bring him tea.

418
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,390
She won't let anyone else bring him his medicine either.

419
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,559
What is that medicine anyway?

420
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,039
Don't you want to know?

421
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,789
Grandfather.

422
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,460
Grandmother said it's time you take your medicine.

423
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,759
I'll get it for you.

424
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,759
Just tell me where it is.

425
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,200
It's over there.

426
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,769
Where it's always kept.

427
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,259
- Welcome home. - Thanks.

428
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,690
Give me that.

429
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,630
I don't want to believe my grandson married...

430
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:19,099
someone who lays her hand on an elder's item without permission.

431
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,269
Now.

432
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,309
You asked me...

433
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,750
if Grandfather said anything to me.

434
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:39,890
Now I remember.

435
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,930
Yoon Ki's...

436
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,730
mom.

437
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,670
He said he'll give Soonyang to Yoon Ki's son.

438
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:02,279
You and I are in the same boat.

439
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,650
So I'll tell you.

440
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:08,890
Sim Gallery...

441
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,619
has a lot of replicas.

442
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,789
If you ever need a painting,

443
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,500
you should tell me next time.

444
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:24,869
Okay.

445
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,440
Thank you.

446
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,509
Chairman... Chairman Jin.

447
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,180
Chairman Jin.

448
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,880
Chairman... Chairman Jin.

449
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,789
Oh, my.

450
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:24,829
Grandfather.

451
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:26,829
Grandfather.

452
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,470
- Grandfather. - What's wrong?

453
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,130
Grandfather.

454
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,729
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol of Soonyang Group...

455
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,059
passed away at the age of 76.

456
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,699
Chairman Jin led Soonyang Group for 32 years.

457
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,529
With his spirit to challenge and constant will to innovate,

458
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,639
he turned Soonyang...

459
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,940
into a global brand that is recognized worldwide.

460
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,239
Politics and financial world say...

461
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,739
he is the man who led...

462
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,548
Korea's shining economical development...

463
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:18,880
and the big figure in contemporary history.

464
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,548
Meanwhile, the family of the deceased said...

465
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,490
in the message to the public...

466
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,889
they'll respect the deceased's wish for a harmonious family...

467
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,230
and righteous management,

468
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,999
Soonyang Group will become...

469
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,559
a company that returns the favor to the nation.

470
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,629
As Chairman Jin Yang Cheol passed away,

471
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,139
the financial world is paying attention...

472
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,210
to who will become Soonyang Group's next chairman.

473
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,750
It must've been troublesome, CEO Jin.

474
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,420
Not at all. I enjoyed it.

475
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,960
I ended up missing my grandfather's funeral.

476
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,529
His only granddaughter is causing trouble to the end.

477
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,669
I'll take you to Jeongsimjae.

478
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,339
You should say hello to your mother first.

479
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,609
I guess I'm in Seoul now.

480
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:18,039
Listening to Jeongsimjae gives me a headache.

481
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,910
Give it to me. I'll carry it.

482
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,009
The younger one should do it.

483
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,779
Ye Jun is here.

484
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,649
- Long time no see, Ye Jun. - Hi, Auntie.

485
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,960
Oh, sweetie.

486
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,160
I'm sorry, Grandma. I'm too late.

487
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,799
I'm sure your grandfather would understand.

488
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,298
I heard the earthquake was so big...

489
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,598
that the airport was closed and all the flights were canceled.

490
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,368
It's a natural disaster.

491
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:49,209
No human can stop it.

492
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,410
You should take her passport away.

493
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,709
What's the point...

494
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,180
if she's the icon of noblesse oblige that represents Soonyang?

495
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,220
What's the point if UN chose her as the next female leader?

496
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,589
She's ruining her health and making elders worry.

497
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,489
She's right, Ye Jun.

498
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,258
You should let your underlings do overseas volunteer work...

499
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,258
and take care of the charity.

500
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,058
The labor doesn't cost much.

501
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,900
The UV rays are terrible to your skin.

502
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,028
My goodness. You got freckles.

503
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,400
Even makeup couldn't cover it.

504
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:22,609
You and auntie haven't changed.

505
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,380
The rumor said Jeongsimjae had a big change...

506
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,450
because of Grandfather's will.

507
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,819
Did he have to backstab his children again with his will?

508
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,890
He's just amazing.

509
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,569
You don't know either?

510
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,579
I only followed Chairman Jin's orders.

511
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,480
Chairman Jin said he'd change his will,

512
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,949
and I only followed the procedure.

513
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Hang Jae.

514
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,519
A farmer...

515
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,030
can't be a landowner just because he's good at farming.

516
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,629
The son who inherits the land...

517
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,130
becomes the landowner.

518
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,199
In the past ten years, you're the one...

519
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,239
who planned Soonyang's succession structure...

520
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,280
next to my father.

521
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,609
And you're saying...

522
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,250
you don't know why my father changed his will?

523
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,050
You think that makes sense?

524
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,820
If you want to avoid the storm...

525
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,920
under the tip of Soonyang's roof for the rest of your life,

526
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:50,460
answer me.

527
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,230
Why did my father...

528
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,070
change his will?

529
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:02,710
Chairman Jin said...

530
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,579
it was his last choice for Soonyang.

531
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,848
I will begin now.

532
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:17,749
(5 days ago)

533
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,789
The will you're about to see today...

534
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:24,889
was changed on May 30, 2002...

535
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,460
as Chairman Jin ordered.

536
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,769
The edited version has been notarized already.

537
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:34,669
Lawyer Park, shall we start?

538
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,670
Yes.

539
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:50,690
(Soonyang Medical Center)

540
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,829
This will is in effect...

541
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,039
upon Chairman Jin's death.

542
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,509
For his eldest grandson,

543
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,480
CEO Jin Seong Jun of Soonyang Venture Investment,

544
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,179
three percent of Soonyang Insurance shares.

545
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,479
To his wife, CEO Mo Hyeon Min,

546
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,448
he left the CEO position of Soonyang Cultural Foundation...

547
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,150
which has 0.3 percent of Soonyang Insurance shares.

548
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,218
To CEO Jin Ye Jun of Soonyang Culture Exchange Foundation...

549
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,359
who is currently absent,

550
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,559
he left two percent of Soonyang Insurance shares.

551
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:34,158
And to Jin Hyeong Jun,

552
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,368
he inherited 82,645m² land...

553
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,670
near Unjung-dong, West Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province.

554
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,769
Lastly,

555
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,269
to his youngest grandson, Jin Do Jun,

556
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,610
he left nothing.

557
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,400
About Father...

558
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,500
When he said he'd make Do Jun the CEO of the holding company,

559
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,469
he planned to give Soonyang to Do Jun.

560
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:22,510
Then he would've given him Soonyang Insurance shares too.

561
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,809
Don't you think?

562
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,190
I think...

563
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:33,519
Father is...

564
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,590
giving us a chance.

565
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,300
One last time.

566
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,769
Only if the will is everything there is.

567
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,309
What if he left inheritance...

568
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,949
to Do Jun...

569
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,380
without leaving it in his will?

570
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:03,219
The night the will was revealed,

571
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,119
Do Jun visited your grandfather.

572
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,309
The only person who saw him dead...

573
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,039
was Do Jun.

574
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,780
You know all about Do Jun.

575
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,219
You should get a degree for that.

576
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,288
If you have something to say, be straightforward.

577
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:41,960
Don't be sarcastic or twist my words.

578
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:47,760
I'm the only one on your side in this world.

579
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,329
Are you sure...

580
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,500
you're on my side?

581
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:59,539
We got married. How else can I prove it?

582
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,789
I'm thinking of living more like your grandmother.

583
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,059
My grandmother?

584
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,329
You'll be a devoted wife?

585
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:26,900
Is that why you brought up Do Jun?

586
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,639
No one knows...

587
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,010
what happened in the hospital that night.

588
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,519
The will was revealed when your grandfather was alive.

589
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,960
Did you make objection?

590
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,989
Or file a lawsuit for your portion?

591
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,260
- I've never thought about it. - Why not?

592
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,259
Because it's your grandfather's inheritance?

593
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,368
Is it a family issue now?

594
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,328
- Mr. Oh. - This is a business...

595
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,440
between you, me and Rachael here.

596
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,768
Due to your grandfather's will,

597
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:05,780
we just lost 2.6 billion dollars.

598
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,079
Is there a hidden agreement...

599
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,149
aside from the will?

600
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,509
- Mr. Oh! - Then how else...

601
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,880
do you expect me to understand?

602
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,249
He didn't leave anything to his favorite grandson.

603
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,349
I don't know. I don't know why he did that!

604
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,090
Why didn't he?

605
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,820
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol... No.

606
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,130
I can never guess what that mean old man was thinking.

607
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,729
I've thought about it every day.

608
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,828
I thought about it a million times over and over again.

609
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,098
But I have no idea.

610
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,340
Why did he say he'd give me Soonyang?

611
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:35,669
Was he lying?

612
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,909
If he wasn't, why did he change his will?

613
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,980
How are you supposed to understand this situation?

614
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,489
That's what I want to ask.

615
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,750
What on earth...

616
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,090
was I to Grandfather?

617
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,690
If possible,

618
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,469
the person who wants to chase him to purgatory and get the answer...

619
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,739
is me, not you.

620
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:19,380
Do Jun.

621
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,889
Do you think...

622
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,619
I trust you?

623
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:31,090
Do you want to be in charge?

624
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,130
Soonyang Financial Group.

625
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,469
I plan to give it to you.

626
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,500
I hope...

627
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,409
you get it.

628
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,289
We won the soccer game.

629
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:08,090
I told you we'd beat Spain...

630
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:10,960
and make it to the semifinals.

631
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,429
I...

632
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:20,539
won the bet.

633
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,649
The publishing company said...

634
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,719
they need a reference for Chairman Jin's biography.

635
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:45,150
So we decided to include his calligraphy.

636
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:47,659
Chairman Jin would say...

637
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:51,190
Soonyang will be enough...

638
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:54,460
for his trace in this world.

639
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:58,299
It wasn't my idea to publish the book.

640
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,940
You'll have to deal with all the nagging.

641
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,239
It'll be a meaningful gift to those who respect him.

642
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,079
Oh, dear.

643
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,848
He was such a wonderful man outside,

644
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:16,550
but he couldn't be meaner to his children to the end.

645
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,250
He should've given all the holding company shares...

646
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,059
to one of his children.

647
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,489
That way, we can defend the management rights.

648
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:31,869
If they ever fight for shares or management rights...

649
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:38,070
Hyeon Min.

650
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,709
- Yes. - Do you have...

651
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,380
Chairman Jin's calligraphy ready yet?

652
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,678
His bold writing for his biography,

653
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,150
and slender writing for his critical biography will be better.

654
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:51,150
I separated them into two. Well, then.

655
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:05,730
You must be worried.

656
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:08,340
I shouldn't stop there.

657
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:10,840
I should play my role as a mother.

658
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:14,539
I plan to...

659
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,119
help my children, Mr. Lee.

660
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:23,750
Does that mean...

661
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:28,260
Practice makes perfect.

662
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:33,400
Times I spent as a wife of Soonyang...

663
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,300
taught me.

664
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,598
I'm not sure if we were alike because we were married...

665
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:42,500
or became alike after gossiping about him.

666
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,980
I never thought I'd act like your father.

667
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,610
But this day has come.

668
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:55,149
I gossiped about him so much for lining up his children...

669
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,320
with some money he had.

670
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,690
So what, then? Will you do the same now?

671
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,230
Go ahead and show us.

672
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,829
Mr. Lee told me that you'd be able to...

673
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,530
safely assume control

674
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,699
of the holding company if I were to help out.

675
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,380
The 17 percent of the Soonyang Insurance shares.

676
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,949
I own them.

677
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:32,989
You own the shares? How come none of us knew?

678
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,689
Mom, don't tell us you have your own slush fund.

679
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,289
You've been collecting kickbacks?

680
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,699
You're just like Father.

681
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,029
Look at you blindsiding your own children, just like Father.

682
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,099
That money...

683
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,670
I've been putting it aside for myself as a reward...

684
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,769
for putting up with your father for 50 years.

685
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,409
Then who is number one on your list?

686
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:57,679
First come, first served?

687
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,118
The one who can and will...

688
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,650
take good care of the family will get the money.

689
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,489
Don't be calculating because it'll get you nowhere.

690
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,190
Stay out of trouble and wait patiently.

691
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,869
I'll trust...

692
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,639
that I got my message across.

693
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,379
Whether that 17 percent goes to Young Ki or comes to me,

694
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,550
it'll be hard for Do Jun to make the company his.

695
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,489
Who do you think Mother will choose? Young Ki or me?

696
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,420
What about me?

697
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,419
Am I not her child?

698
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,059
Hey, you are...

699
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:47,598
Even if you get all of Mom's shares, you won't have 30 percent.

700
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,699
Hey, you'd better stay out of this.

701
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,170
Just figure out how you can walk away with a handsome tip.

702
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,369
Okay, fine.

703
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,710
Then I shall go figure out which cards to sell.

704
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,340
Hey.

705
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,980
Unlike Grandfather,

706
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,579
Grandma always believed that the eldest son should get everything.

707
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,550
Today, she went on about taking good care of the family.

708
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,260
Isn't that something people normally say to the eldest son?

709
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:16,928
Should I come to Jeongsimjae every day starting tomorrow?

710
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:19,459
Jeong Rae is with Mother 24-7.

711
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,929
It makes me feel so anxious.

712
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,000
Of course, Mother is on your side.

713
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,308
She always trusted and complimented you in front of Father.

714
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,440
That's...

715
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,079
That's because I'm her ugly duckling.

716
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,780
Goodness.

717
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,718
I suppose Grandmother really doesn't want the holding company...

718
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,650
to end up in Do Jun's hands.

719
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,389
This family feud began...

720
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,658
when Father broke...

721
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:49,090
the rule of primogeniture because of Do Jun.

722
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:54,599
Sorry?

723
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:58,229
All the Soonyang Insurance shares that I own.

724
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,840
I'll hand them over to Do Jun.

725
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:03,609
In turn, I want that brat to return the department store shares...

726
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,969
that he took from me.

727
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:13,280
I'll ask Do Jun and let you know what he says.

728
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,179
I guess you can afford to wait.

729
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,489
I thought you'd bite it right away.

730
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,230
Aren't you using Do Jun...

731
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,760
so you can play a retired king at Soonyang?

732
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,699
Then you certainly don't have time to wait.

733
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,940
Father, have some coffee.

734
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,849
How many shares of the holding company...

735
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,320
do you think you can gather before the shareholders' meeting?

736
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:55,860
It's not going to be easy.

737
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:58,860
Do Jun.

738
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:03,730
The footage from the camera in your grandfather's hospital room.

739
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,530
Let's go public with it.

740
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:10,710
A will written when someone is having cognitive impairment...

741
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,840
can be annulled.

742
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:16,480
I'll file a suit to claim the return of the legal reserve of inheritance.

743
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:21,279
Then you'll be able to retrieve the shares in the holding company.

744
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,949
- Father. - At this rate,

745
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:27,219
you'll never beat your uncles in this war.

746
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,760
Your aunt visited me.

747
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:38,730
She offered her shares in Soonyang Insurance...

748
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,639
in return for the stake in the department store.

749
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:45,269
Your uncles will get the shares your grandma owns under a borrowed name,

750
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,909
so your aunt said you'd have no choice but to agree to this deal.

751
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,349
Shares Grandma owns under a borrowed name? What do you mean?

752
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,750
From what I've heard, she owns 17 percent of Soonyang Insurance.

753
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,590
We have no other option.

754
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:17,010
I could never dream of such a thing as I was born out of wedlock,

755
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:19,639
but you're different.

756
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,880
You are the rightful heir that your grandfather chose.

757
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,079
A fraudulent will must be corrected.

758
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,559
My father...

759
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:39,860
Your grandfather worked hard all his life to grow Soonyang.

760
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,899
Your uncles and aunt do not have what it takes to run the company.

761
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
Why must we let them take it from us again?

762
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,570
We must do this to protect your grandfather's honor.

763
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,139
Do Jun.

764
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,079
The footage.

765
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:01,079
Let's go public with it.

766
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,340
Hello, Mr. Lee. It's me, Do Jun.

767
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,079
About the footage from the hospital room.

768
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:38,650
Is it still at Soonyang Medical Center?

769
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,159
I see.

770
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,659
Then I can do what I want with it, right?

771
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:54,300
Please delete the footage.

772
00:53:57,769 --> 00:54:01,639
Please go ahead and delete all footage from the room.

773
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:09,349
Do Jun, did you not understand what I said?

774
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,050
You said we should go public...

775
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:17,130
with such embarrassing footage to protect Grandfather's honor.

776
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:20,130
Does that make sense to you?

777
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:28,800
Father.

778
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,909
I always thought you weren't cut out to be part of the Jin family.

779
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,250
Turns out, I was wrong.

780
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,079
You will eventually...

781
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,349
regret this choice.

782
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,860
Hey, don't touch that! My goodness.

783
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,800
- Hey. - What is all this?

784
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,629
I say this all the time. Be as thorough as possible.

785
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,768
- Move it. - Hold on. Why are you...

786
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:01,199
Stay out of it. You could be charged with obstruction of justice.

787
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,110
- You can leave them here. - Yes, sir.

788
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,280
They were all seized from Sim Gallery.

789
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:14,050
They probably made money by selling forged artworks...

790
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:16,420
and used two sets of books and borrowed-name accounts...

791
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,349
to create an illegal fund.

792
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,089
We must find out where the money came from...

793
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:23,019
and how the slush fund was used.

794
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,090
Please check everything thoroughly.

795
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:31,328
(Text Message)

796
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:32,968
(Prosecutors raided Sim Gallery to conduct a search and seizure.)

797
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:35,300
(They are investigating how the slush fund was created.)

798
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:52,190
(Young expat)

799
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:53,589
Getting the 17 percent...

800
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:56,829
from your grandmother will put your uncles at 30 percent,

801
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,230
which means they can safely protect their management rights.

802
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,400
This is a fight we can't win.

803
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,340
It won't happen,

804
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,038
but even if Grandmother decides to give us all her shares,

805
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,440
we'll only have 27.

806
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,538
We won't have 30 percent.

807
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,780
No. Then we can do this.

808
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:19,480
If you're appointed CEO at the shareholders' meeting,

809
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,479
seven percent of the public enterprises' shares...

810
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,218
will come to us.

811
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,149
(Young expat)

812
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,320
That puts us at 34 percent.

813
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:28,860
It means we'll safely obtain the management rights.

814
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,230
More so than Jin Young Ki and Jin Dong Ki would.

815
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,110
If the prosecutors...

816
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,619
compare the accounting records on the hard drive...

817
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,119
with the books that contain the actual transaction records,

818
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,419
they will find out who is behind the borrowed-name accounts...

819
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,059
and the slush fund, ma'am.

820
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,259
The carrot or the stick, I don't care what you have to do.

821
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,300
Stop them at once!

822
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,969
Stop the investigation!

823
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:31,079
Ma'am. Prosecutor Seo, are you all right?

824
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,449
Mr. Jin Do Jun sent me.

825
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:14,119
This is out of line.

826
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:16,929
Why didn't you tell me?

827
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,190
If I told you...

828
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,860
Would you have believed me?

829
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,369
You would've thought a grandson of Soonyang's chairman...

830
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,800
was making empty threats...

831
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:33,739
to force you to stop investigating the case.

832
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,980
I heard the prosecution conducted a search and seizure of Sim Gallery.

833
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,889
You're after their slush fund in a borrowed-name account?

834
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,690
Min Yeong.

835
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,090
That investigation...

836
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,130
Can't you just drop it?

837
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:58,000
You see, those people...

838
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,340
aren't even afraid to hurt me or my grandfather.

839
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,909
That's why prosecutors exist.

840
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,380
No matter how much money or power they have,

841
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,739
there should be some things that they can't do.

842
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,550
You can't always get your way with everything.

843
01:00:13,449 --> 01:00:14,518
I should teach them.

844
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:16,380
Why should you be the one teaching them that lesson?

845
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,849
What if you end up...

846
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:24,788
I mean, are you the only prosecutor in the country?

847
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:27,529
No. There are many prosecutors who are more righteous than I am.

848
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,130
So many of them are more competent than I am.

849
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:30,800
However,

850
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,769
none of them would take this fight to the end.

851
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,969
Min Yeong.

852
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,150
Do you know why I'm after...

853
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:49,820
Sim Gallery's borrowed-name account and slush fund?

854
01:00:53,389 --> 01:00:54,820
I must take it to the end to find out...

855
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,159
the person behind your accident...

856
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:59,630
No.

857
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,769
Only then can we find out who instigated the attempted murder.

858
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,639
I'm doing this because...

859
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,780
I really don't want you to get hurt again.

860
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,989
That is why I cannot drop this case.

861
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,348
Grandmother, you know Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong...

862
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:01,260
at the Central District Office, right?

863
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,929
I heard she ordered a search and seizure of Sim Gallery.

864
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:09,230
Were you worried?

865
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,468
That everyone would find out...

866
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:13,500
about your slush fund you created through the gallery?

867
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,269
Because of the Soonyang Insurance shares you own in a borrowed name?

868
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:21,780
Why?

869
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:25,179
Do you want to claim your shares?

870
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:28,579
Is that why you're here?

871
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:30,789
Not a chance.

872
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:35,388
Even if I have to turn all my shares into cash...

873
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:38,230
and feed it to the fish in the Han River,

874
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:42,659
I will not give you anything. Not even a single share.

875
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,300
I know that.

876
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,739
From what I know, Prosecutor Seo...

877
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:52,268
isn't interested in your slush fund at all.

878
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,239
Then tell her to follow her interests.

879
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,949
But she's investigating the attempted murder.

880
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:02,178
Someone staged the car accident to kill me and Grandfather.

881
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:05,250
She's investigating that accident at the moment.

882
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,920
You see,

883
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:12,130
if she asks me about that accident,

884
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:14,030
then you'll have a problem...

885
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,929
because I have solid evidence.

886
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:26,670
So, Grandmother...

887
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,480
Don't even try to hurt Prosecutor Seo.

888
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:38,119
For your own sake, that is.

889
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,389
The tea is cold.

890
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,510
Ma'am.

891
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,339
(Forged Artwork Sales Ledger)

892
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,109
This is Sim Gallery's forged artwork sales ledger,

893
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,719
which we couldn't find at the gallery.

894
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,888
Sim Gallery sent us this?

895
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,558
Yes. They know they can't avoid punishment.

896
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,329
I'm guessing they're offering a plea deal.

897
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,059
They want this to be a mitigating factor.

898
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,030
All of a sudden?

899
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:28,239
This is it.

01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:54,030
(Bird and flower painting)

902
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,030
(Lee Pil Ok)

903
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,439
She told me.

904
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,840
- My goodness. - I was like, "Why?"

905
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:07,009
Oh, please.

906
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,339
She did that.

907
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:10,539
Grandmother, someone's calling you.

908
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,449
Okay, thanks.

909
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:15,619
- Hey, what was that? - Hello?

910
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,348
This is Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong...

911
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:18,719
from Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

912
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,689
Finish the rest.

913
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:21,789
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

914
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:26,460
You purchased a bird and flower painting from Sim Gallery.

915
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,630
Yes. What about it?

916
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:35,038
We have evidence to believe that the money from the transaction...

917
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,239
was given to the suspects in an attempted murder case.

918
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:41,639
We'd like to interview you as a witness.

919
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,300
I got a call from the Prosecutors' Office.

920
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:13,369
Tell me. What should I do?

921
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:18,510
So?

922
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,650
After all,

923
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:24,920
my shares are what you want?

924
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:58,889
Is it true that you gave the shares to Do Jun?

925
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:02,689
I can't believe this.

926
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,860
Not Young Ki or me? You handed them over to Do Jun?

927
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,530
Why, all of a sudden?

928
01:07:08,329 --> 01:07:09,699
I knew it.

929
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,428
Do Jun declined my offer to swap shares.

930
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,940
- He got Mom's shares? - Hey!

931
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,969
- How could you think that now? - Whatever!

932
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,909
Mom.

933
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,539
Say something.

934
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,949
Your children are in utter shock right now.

935
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,179
Will you not even say anything?

936
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,650
Mother!

937
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,360
What do you mean?

938
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:39,659
I know.

939
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,800
The reason...

940
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,400
Grandmother had no choice but to hand over the shares to Do Jun.

941
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,119
You know, Grandmother...

942
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:07,760
I'm sure she didn't want to hand them over to Do Jun.

943
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:11,659
It was the only way to get the situation sorted out.

944
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,360
So she had to hand over the shares.

945
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,569
Remember Grandfather's accident?

946
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,770
You know it wasn't an accident. Someone ordered the hit on him.

947
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:25,939
- Okay, so? - The person who ordered the hit...

948
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:31,279
It was Grandmother.

949
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,310
Mother.

950
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:01,979
Is it true?

951
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:05,149
Are you going to ask me about Do Jun too?

952
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,119
I told you...

953
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,489
that I'd give my shares to a child of mine...

954
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:15,020
who would take good care of the family.

955
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:17,630
Young Ki, you know...

956
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,659
how I've been treating Yoon Ki all his life.

957
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:26,270
Is that why you tried...

958
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,039
to kill Do Jun and Father together?

959
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,109
For the sake of the family?

960
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,609
Who do you think it was for?

961
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,449
For whom did I do such a thing?

962
01:09:44,989 --> 01:09:46,189
Was I supposed to...

963
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:50,689
just stand by and let it happen?

964
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,659
What mother would just stand by and watch...

965
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,999
when someone else's child tries to steal...

966
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
what rightfully belongs to her own child?

967
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:09,609
You, of all people,

968
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,079
must understand.

969
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:18,590
Young Ki. You, of all people, should understand me.

970
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:24,060
Yes. Now, I understand...

971
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,329
how you must've felt.

972
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:32,329
You probably can't forgive Father for wanting Do Jun...

973
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,729
to be his successor.

974
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,699
I feel the same way.

975
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:39,840
My son.

976
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:44,079
Soonyang should have rightfully been Seong Jun's.

977
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:47,979
But you handed the company over to Do Jun, Mother.

978
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:51,750
For that, I cannot forgive you.

979
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,359
It's time to right the wrong.

980
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:39,630
For the sake of my parents, I believe it is...

981
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,710
the right thing to do as their son.

982
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:49,710
Do you think we'd be able to secure evidence...

983
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,279
that someone indeed ordered the hit on them?

984
01:11:52,949 --> 01:11:54,050
As for evidence,

985
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:58,050
I heard my nephew was in possession of it.

986
01:11:59,689 --> 01:12:01,060
My youngest nephew.

987
01:12:02,789 --> 01:12:04,859
Jin Do Jun of Miracle.

988
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,800
Mr. Song.

989
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,930
We will summon Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's wife...

990
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,499
to question her as a suspect in the attempted murder case.

991
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,539
Please get ready.

992
01:12:15,869 --> 01:12:18,209
You mean, Soonyang's Chairman Jin?

993
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,670
Yes, we received a tip from a credible source.

994
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:23,909
We've also tracked down some physical evidence to prove it.

995
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:26,310
Then I'll go ahead and summon her.

996
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,409
Okay.

997
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,420
(Jin Do Jun)

998
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,359
You'll become even more spiteful.

999
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,328
Because you'd want to keep what you have.

1000
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:49,499
I know...

1001
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,670
he wouldn't hesitate to sell me...

1002
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:54,670
if he could buy Soonyang.

1003
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,938
Would Chairman Jin Yang Cheol have told me...

1004
01:13:56,939 --> 01:13:59,339
to delete the security footage?

1005
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,278
So after all,

1006
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:03,840
we're the owners of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

1007
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,649
Right, as long as one of us doesn't betray the other.

1008
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,648
If I want to go independent as Soonyang Financial Group,

1009
01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:12,389
I need a cash cow that will earn me money...

1010
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:13,750
until the separation is complete.

1011
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:15,488
Soonyang Card.

1012
01:14:15,489 --> 01:14:17,220
It's time...

1013
01:14:17,789 --> 01:14:18,829
we sell Soonyang Card.

1014
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:20,988
You bought Soonyang Group's chairman position.

1015
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,858
You'll be the next chairman and Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's successor.

1016
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,630
You can't put a price on such a position.

1017
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,770
It's Chairman Jin's legacy he left for you, Do Jun.

1018
01:15:00,069 --> 01:15:03,140
