00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,159
(Reborn Rich)

2
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,529
Hyeon Min, you look absolutely stunning today.

3
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,829
Yes, she really does.

4
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,070
Of course, you'd expect nothing less from the Soonyang family.

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,500
That must be well over one carat.

6
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,670
- What about your honeymoon? - Here comes the groom-to-be!

7
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,279
- Here comes the groom-to-be! - Here comes the groom-to-be!

8
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,938
- Here comes the groom-to-be! - Oh, my.

9
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,078
Stop. Don't go any further.

10
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,608
- We'll stop here. - Oh, dear. I'm thirsty.

11
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,419
- Come in and have a drink. - No, we should...

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,290
- Feed us first. - Come on, guys.

13
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,589
- Hurry up. - Let's just go.

14
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,488
- Gosh, hold on. - Keep it down!

15
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,759
- The thing is... - Come on. Let's go.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,829
- Let's go. - Okay.

17
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,010
Father, Seong Jun and his friends delivered all the wedding gifts.

18
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,980
They're having a feast at his in-laws' place...

19
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,250
When did you get here?

20
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,060
I was on my way home after playing golf.

21
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,189
But I was starving, so I thought I should stop by.

22
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,429
Your son is getting married.

23
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,329
You must be so happy that you don't even have to eat.

24
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,829
Oh, Father.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,469
Have you prepared a wedding gift for your eldest grandson?

26
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,009
Will you give him shares in Soonyang Corporation?

27
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,819
How many?

28
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,849
I'm sure Father will just take care of it.

29
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:29,889
Why are you worried about it?

30
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,030
Well, I'm Seong Jun's uncle.

31
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,459
If my gift is too little compared to his grandfather's,

32
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,159
I'll be embarrassed.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Right, Father?

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,770
The radish kimchi is perfectly ripe.

35
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,780
Looks like we're ready to welcome the new member of the family.

36
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,849
Father.

37
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,659
Can I have more water?

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
I got it.

39
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,729
What is it?

40
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,900
Seong Jun...

41
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,210
is now backed by his in-laws, who are influential people.

42
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,810
So you need not worry about him.

43
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,210
Father...

44
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,750
will start working on grooming Seong Jun as his successor.

45
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,389
After all, that is the family's rule.

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,789
Primogeniture.

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,969
We found...

48
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,839
a brain arteriovenous malformation, sir.

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,909
(AVM and subarachnoid hemorrhage)

50
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,939
The location is quite risky...

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,949
if we were to perform surgery.

52
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,219
(Medical Diagnosis)

53
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,319
Yes, Mr. Oh.

54
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:46,660
Let's just give up.

55
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,459
I was wrong about DMC.

56
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,568
Like HBO and CNN, I thought cable channels...

57
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,399
would soon beat the national networks.

58
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,568
But it can only happen in large countries with a population...

59
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:00,669
of 100 million, like the US.

60
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,769
No, you're wrong.

61
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,709
It may take some time, but that day will come soon.

62
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,050
The day when cable networks and various other channels...

63
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:09,109
would produce content...

64
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,849
that would put national TV to shame. I know it.

65
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,789
You don't have time to give such an absurd spiel like a prophet.

66
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,289
We must be objective and face our reality.

67
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,649
Objectively speaking, our reality is that...

68
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:18,958
Jin Seong Jun will be next in line...

69
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,730
for the throne at Soonyang the moment we give up on DMC.

70
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,028
Then our plan to own Soonyang...

71
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,759
will be nothing but a foolish delusion.

72
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,569
I refuse to give up on DMC.

73
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,169
Buy and Sell Home Shopping, the only profitable cable channel,

74
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,939
decided today that they'd sell off the company.

75
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,980
Do you still not understand what it means?

76
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,619
Hey, you don't need a lot of stuff.

77
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,449
Hey, shopping isn't about buying things you need.

78
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,790
It's all about buying things you want.

79
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,199
It means the channel needs a new owner.

80
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,670
And it's time...

81
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,439
for us to decide who it should be.

82
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,540
Mason, you never disappoint.

83
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,980
What's with him?

84
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,610
- Where are you going? Hey! - Come with me!

85
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,389
Are you sure we can meet him here?

86
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,789
According to his official schedule, he's abroad on a business trip now.

87
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,689
I bet he doesn't want anyone to know...

88
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,230
that he's staying here.

89
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,899
(Soonyang Hospital)

90
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
If it's top secret,

91
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,910
how did you find out?

92
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,009
(Power of Attorney, Jin Yoon Ki)

00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,389
(Soonyang Hospital VIP Patient List)

94
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,160
What I thought was my grandfather's warning...

95
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,269
turned out to be a lottery ticket.

96
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,699
And...

97
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,370
an unscratched one, at that.

98
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,438
Let's go.

99
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,579
(Soonyang Hospital)

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,050
Allow me to introduce myself, sir.

101
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,910
I am Jin Do Jun.

102
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,490
Chairman Jin's youngest grandson?

103
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,759
Yes, I thought you looked familiar.

104
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,560
I heard you went to Seoul National University School of Law.

105
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,898
I told them over and over...

106
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,829
not to let anyone in.

107
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,439
How did you get in?

108
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:48,610
Hey! Anybody outside?

109
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,278
Those fools...

110
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,379
Your security team did nothing wrong, sir.

111
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:04,790
I struck a deal with them.

112
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,730
I told them I'd send out a press release...

113
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,029
if they didn't let me see you.

114
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,768
Ju Yeong Il, the chairman of Daeyoung Group,

115
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,740
is undergoing heart valve surgery,

116
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,110
but he chose...

117
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,610
Soonyang Medical Center, not Daeyoung Medical Center.

118
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,519
There is no better way to prove that Soonyang has...

119
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,419
the best cardiothoracic surgery department in the country.

120
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,559
Chairman Jin, that old snake.

121
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,190
He promised me that it'd be kept confidential.

122
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,600
How dare he blindside me like this? Darn it.

123
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,909
My grandfather doesn't know that I'm here, sir.

124
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,679
And...

125
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,450
it should stay that way,

126
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,720
because I'm here to tell you how Daeyoung Distribution...

127
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,659
can beat Soonyang Transportation and become number one...

128
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,259

You took time out of your busy schedule to join us today.

- Thanks, Chang Je. - It's my pleasure.

137
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,529
I see that the groom's father is very excited.

138
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,128
Is it because your son is getting married?

139
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,559
Or is it because of Father's wedding gift?

140
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,809
Gosh, Hwa Young. You have no idea because you don't have kids.

141
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,940
It's better not to know. It really is.

142
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,609
I mean, look at me.

143
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,149
I still have to serve my mother-in-law...

144

while walking on eggshells around my daughter-in-law.

Mom has to live long.

146
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,419
I'm sorry, Jeong Rae.

147
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,788
Hwa Young, that is not what I meant...

148
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:22,888
- Goodness. - We'll head in first.

149
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,398
- Let's go. - You made it, Yoon Ki.

150
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,628
Congratulations.

151
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,469
- Congratulations, Jeong Rae. - Thank you.

152
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,470
Thank you all for coming.

153
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,600
- Yes, go on in. - Let's go.

- Hey! - Sir.

156
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,179
Thanks.

157
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,350
Okay. My nephew is getting married.

158
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,989
I should prepare this much.

159
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,249
- Move! It's our turn. - All right, next.

160
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,860
- She looks gorgeous. - Hey, hurry.

161
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,288
- Hyeon Min! You look stunning. - For real!

162
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,928
- Look at the camera. - You look so beautiful.

163
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,798
- You look absolutely gorgeous. - All right. In 1, 2, 3.

164
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,398
- Nice, beautiful. - You look really stunning.

165
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,169
- Look at the camera. - Oh, my.

166
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,840
Hello.

167
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,600
- Hello. - Hello.

168
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,610
Would you mind giving us some privacy?

169
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,268
- Not at all. - My gosh.

170
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,909
I must tell her something.

171
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,580
- My gosh! - How romantic!

172
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,579
- We'll leave you to it, then. - See you inside!

173
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,950
- See you. - You look so stunning today.

174
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,720
- Congratulations. - See you.

175
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,100
You look beautiful. More beautiful than I expected.

176
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,009
That's not what you wanted to talk to me about, right?

177
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,340
It's such a shame.

178
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,080
I want to brag about my beautiful bride.

179
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,679
And you would've been happy to have him here.

180
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,980
Who?

181
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,720
Do Jun.

182
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,090
Who?

183
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,559
The guy you like.

184
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,860
Jin Do Jun.

185
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,408
Do Jun can't come today.

186
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,620
He doesn't have the guts to face my grandfather.

187
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,250
You're not waiting for him, are you?

188
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,460
Stop.

189
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,559
You see, Do Jun...

190
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,529
The DMC deal Miracle took was too much for him.

191
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,429
They've decided to hand it over to Soonyang Construction.

192
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,399
This means...

193
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,940
that I managed to get my revenge, like you said.

194
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,379
If you knew everything, then why...

195
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,490
I told you.

196
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,659
You truly amuse me.

197
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,830
It's funny how you think you're the only one with a thinking brain.

198
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:48,370
It's ridiculous that you think you can always have your way.

199
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,769
And you believe that everyone would like you. That's...

200
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,740
I guess that's kind of cute.

201
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,809
Think about it, Hyeon Min.

202
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,750
The world wouldn't be so kind to only you.

203
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Shut your mouth.

204
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,789
Walking out the door now doesn't mean you can undo your decision.

205
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,659
People will say you dared to call off your wedding to Soonyang.

206
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,669
You cannot call off this wedding.

207
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,970
You may ditch your pride as it doesn't bring you any money,

208
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,709
but you can never give up on your market value...

209
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,580
as the only daughter of the Hyunsung Daily family.

210
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,179
I still find you very amusing.

211
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,919
Is this what you wanted to talk to me about?

212
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,548
- Is that why... - You didn't choose me as a man,

213
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,690
and the feelings are mutual.

214
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,129
Let's keep things that way even after the wedding.

215
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,929
You get what I'm saying, right?

216
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,100
I figured you should know the rules before you joined the game.

217
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,720
Let's play fair and square.

218
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,360
See you inside.

219
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,059
Hello.

220
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,740
Last but not least, the highlight of the ceremony awaits us.

221
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,340
The bride and groom will now march together.

222
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,840
Let us bless the bride and groom...

223
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:17,720
with a big round of applause.

224
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,649
Promise me one thing.

225
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,120
Whatever you do, you will not dirty the family register.

226
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,799
The bride and groom will now march.

227
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,289
Father, you need to see this.

228
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,960
(Jin Seong Jun's Slush Fund)

229
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,829
I don't think you need to worry about Seong Jun.

230
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,829
He's extremely clever and resourceful.

231
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,740
Is this your wedding gift for Seong Jun?

232
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,239
Well, he's only starting out,

233
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,210
so you should train him well.

234
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,880
(Jin Seong Jun's Slush Fund)

235
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,309
Did you think I wouldn't know about this...

236
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,450
when you knew about it too?

237
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,579
You knew?

238
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,219
What? The land-banking for the New Seoul Town project.

239
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,259
You knew that it was all Seong Jun, not Young Ki?

240
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,029
My grandson, Seong Jun.

241
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,200
I was right there the moment he was born...

242
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,599
instead of his father, who was in jail at the time.

243
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,470
He is my eldest grandson,

244
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:52,210
the one and only.

245
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,619
Okay. Everyone is ready, right?

246
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,890
All right, here we go.

247
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,389
One, two...

248
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,559
Hey, Do Jun!

249
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,839
I'm sorry I'm late.

250
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,369
- All right. - Hey, come here.

251
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,249
Okay, here we go.

252
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,450
Smile, everyone.

253
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,149
Well, since we were interrupted anyway...

254
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,750
Mr. Mayor, do you mind switching?

255
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,989
- With her? - No, with Mr. Jin.

256
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,489
- Smile. - You two can switch.

257
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,159
- You can stay where you are. - No, why should he...

258
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,459
Why? Do you have nothing to smile about these days?

259
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,159
Mr. Jin Dong Ki, please take your hands out of your pockets.

260
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,669
- Yes, thank you. - Grandfather, you were right.

261
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,729
Oh, Hyeong Jun.

262
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,768
I was foolish.

263
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,200
All right. Give me a bigger smile.

264
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,409
I've given up on my goal of buying Soonyang with my money.

265
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,808
All right, here we go. Smile, please!

266
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:32,880
We'll take it now.

267
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,880
One, two, three.

268
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,459
My gosh, thank you all for coming.

269
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,359
- Congratulations, sir. - Congratulations.

270
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,029
- Oh, my. You made it too. - Congratulations, sir.

271
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,598
- Congratulations, sir. - Congratulations, sir.

272
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,930
- Sir. - Yes?

273
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,200
That little...

274
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,348
I tried to keep my cool but couldn't. I was so fuming mad...

275
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,819
that I ran here as soon as they removed the IV from my arm.

276
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,859
I wanted to take it up with you in person.

277
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,660
What's going on? What happened?

278
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,200
Look.

279
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,970
Don't you have enough to worry about with your foolish sons?

280
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,640
Your grandson.

281
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,339
You need to teach him better!

282
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,289
You may leave.

283
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,799
Congratulations on your wedding.

284
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,670
As for DMC, I'm sorry.

285
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,269
How dare you think of going up against Soonyang?

286
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,569
You're smart. Why did you make such a mistake?

287
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,509
Grandfather may think it's his youngest grandson's prank,

288
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,009
but I'm different.

289
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,180
"Don't start a fight that already has an ending."

290
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,349
That's what you said.

291
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,890
It doesn't look like a fight that already has an ending.

292
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,039
Yes.

293
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:48,849
Is this true?

294
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,650
The spots at DMC have been filled?

295
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,720
Is it true?

296
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,119
That's why I was late to your wedding.

297
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,359
The deadline set out by Seoul City was today,

298
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:05,529
so I had to wrap up everything for the agreement.

299
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,568
Oh, right. I will not hand over the DMC project...

300
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,569
to Soonyang Group.

301
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,210
What on earth did you do?

302
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,809
Are you implying...

303
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,119
that there is no sensible, legal way...

304
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,519
for me to find companies that would support the DMC project...

305
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,559
because of Soonyang's meddling cowardly antics?

306
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,890
Is that what you meant, Seong Jun?

307
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,579
Tell me.

308
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,180
How can Daeyoung beat Soonyang...

309
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:59,650
and become number one again in the distribution industry?

310
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,619
Is there a way?

311
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,390
I heard you decided to sell Daeyoung Distribution.

312
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,829
Now's not the time to sell it.

313
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,960
You should acquire another company.

314
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,798
What did you say?

315
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,670
A home shopping channel is up for sale.

316
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,399
You should acquire Buy and Sell Home Shopping.

317
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,970
Look, SNU Law student.

318
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,480
Don't you know the government's policy after the financial crisis?

319
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,379
Such an aggressive expansion strategy through acquisitions...

320
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,809
is a relic of a bygone era.

321
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,049
Daeyoung has no interest...

322
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,848
in showbiz, where fools are busy goofing around.

323
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,250
It's not showbiz, sir.

324
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,460
It's distribution...

325
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,359
and logistics.

326
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,589
Daeyoung's specialty.

327
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,939
It's a mink coat with a classic, timeless design...

328
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,979
offered to you at an affordable price point.

329
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,078
At a glance, you can tell...

330
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,009
People no longer buy what they need. They buy what they want.

331
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,379
Thanks to the home shopping channels that stimulate...

332
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,819
the impulse purchase instinct 24-7.

333
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,119
In the comfort of their own home,

334
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,088
with a single click of a button.

335
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:13,318
That's a given.

336
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,689
As you can see here, the luxurious sheen...

337
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,430
And all home shopping channels...

338
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,329
need a logistics company to move goods.

339
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
If Daeyoung has a logistics company...

340
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,199
and a home shopping channel as well...

341
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,970
It'd be like killing 2 birds with 1 stone,

342
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,539
killing 2 flies with 1 slap,

343
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,980
and mashing 2 potatoes with 1 fork.

344
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:38,549
Am I right?

345
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,990
I suggest you acquire a home shopping channel, sir.

346
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,329
Then Daeyoung will soon be...

347
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,859
the number one distribution company again.

348
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,240
He was very persuasive. So what can I do?

349
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,569
I had no choice but to give in.

350
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,509
Daeyoung is joining DMC.

351
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,009
Sit back and wait.

352
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:11,009
We'll retrieve the number one title in no time.

353
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,119
I can't see you out.

354
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,420
Take care of your health.

355
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,960
How petty.

356
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
Is this how you treat your guests?

357
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:48,179
As you ordered, I prepared a share transfer agreement...

358
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,750
for Mr. Jin Seong Jun.

359
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,430
Sir!

360
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,960
It's okay. Hold on.

361
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,730
(Share Transfer Agreement)

362
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,670
(Share Transfer Agreement)

363
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,539
Symptoms include...

364
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,608
sudden headaches...

365
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:16,880
and temporary mobility impairments.

366
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,849
(Share Transfer Agreement)

367
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:38,569
Mr. Lee.

368
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Yes, sir.

369
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,440
About Director Jung...

370
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,539
Let's make sure he'll keep his lips sealed.

371
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:50,579
Gosh.

372
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,819
Oh, dear.

373
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,960
My children can't find out about this yet.

374
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,160
Oh, I'm okay now.

375
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,909
On behalf of the ten million citizens of Seoul,

376
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,539
I'd like to propose a toast.

377
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,149
Here's to their forever love. Cheers!

378
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,609
- Cheers! - Cheers!

379
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,778
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, Seong Jun.

380
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,179
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

381
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,950
- My gosh. - Congratulations, son.

382
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:38,160
It's sweet.

383
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,299
I guess I'm finally growing up...

384
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,740
now that my son is married.

385
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:55,279
Father. Thanks to all your help and support,

386
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:58,950
I managed to raise Seong Jun well,

387
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,049
who has now found his better half.

388
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,619
Thank you, Father.

389
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,990
Please say a few words.

390
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:14,029
Seong Jun and his wife will always remember and heed your advice.

391
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,930
I'm sure they'll live a happy life together and won't let you down.

392
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,598
He's asking for the wedding gift, isn't he?

393
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,209
Does it really need all the bells and whistles?

394
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,470
The reception is over.

395
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,809
The coronation ceremony has begun.

396
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,289
My advice?

397
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,660
Who wants to listen to this old man nag?

398
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,160
You're all curious about my wedding gift for Seong Jun.

399
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,500
Doesn't anyone here not know...

400
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,940
how precious Seong Jun is to me?

401
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,150
My gift is...

402
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,089
something Seong Jun had asked for.

403
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,289
Oh, my.

404
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,059
- Mr. Lee. - Yes, sir.

405
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,109
Thank you.

406
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,089
(Transfer Notice, Geochang Distribution Warehouse)

407
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,299
You asked me to let you take responsibility as a real adult.

408
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:12,980
Starting Monday, Seong Jun...

409
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,220
will work at Geochang Distribution Warehouse.

410
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:29,868
- Father. - The notice states that he's now...

411
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,599
in charge of the warehouse.

412
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,539
The illegal land-banking of the New Seoul Town.

413
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,509
And we failed to land the construction of DMC.

414
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,420
You should take responsibility, don't you think?

415
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,089
That is what a real adult ought to do.

416
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:00,900
Father, but this is...

417
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,799
As for his shares in the company,

418
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,140
we can revisit the issue another time,

419
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,869
but you want him to work at a distribution warehouse?

420
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,410
As of today,

421
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,680
Soonyang...

422
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,220
will no longer follow the rule of primogeniture.

423
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,710
Either buy all the shares with your money...

424
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,210
or prove your competence and abilities as a leader.

425
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,710
Suit yourselves.

426
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,319
The one who can make Soonyang bigger and better than I can...

427
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,589
will get everything,

428
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,759
including my shares...

429
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:03,529
and the right to run the business.

430
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:11,130
Father.

431
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,970
How could you do this to me? How?

432
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,709
After everything I've done for you and Soonyang...

433
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,480
Young Ki, about your knee...

434
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,480
Director Jung at the medical center said...

435
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,349
that the medicines these days worked very well.

436
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,980
Fixing it will be no problem at all.

437
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,559
Don't miss your doctor's appointments.

438
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,828
If you don't take care of yourself,

439
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,558
- who will? - Father!

440
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,599
Don't you know whom I love the most...

441
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,900
out of all my children?

442
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:53,309
It's Soonyang.

443
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:11,989
Dong Ki, do you know anything about this?

444
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,160
Hey! Jin Hwa Young, you little...

445
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:17,329
What are you saying? What would I know?

446
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,069
You know, at the wedding,

447
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,499
Dong Ki and Father talked for a while.

448
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,009
- Hey! - Am I wrong?

449
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,210
- Dong Ki, you little... - I don't know anything!

450
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,349
Well, if what Father said is true,

451
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:32,750
Seong Jun must know the reason.

452
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,380
Hey. Am I wrong, Seong Jun?

453
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:38,890
That brat...

454
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,589
- Hey! - Hyeon Min!

455
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,329
- My gosh! - Hyeon Min! Oh, dear.

456
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,828
Hey! What's wrong with her?

457
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:23,729
Wake up, Hyeon Min. Open your eyes!

458
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,638
My goodness. Why did she faint suddenly?

459
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,169
- Honey! - Seong Jun! Call an ambulance!

460
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,408
- Wake up! - Why did she pass out suddenly?

461
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,739
- Hyeon Min, wake up! - Hello? We need an ambulance...

462
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,019
You need to teach him better!

463
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,259
How dare he come at me like that,

464
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,190
without even batting an eye?

465
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,429
He has quite a nerve, that kid.

466
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:59,739
But he sure knows how to catch the whiff of money,

467
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,739
just like you.

468
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,669
He reminds me of the Jin Yang Cheol...

469
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,610
I met at the repair shop in Incheon 50 years ago.

470
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,539
He takes after you.

471
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:10,808
I had let my guard down because none of your sons...

472
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,280
takes after you.

473
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,750
But your grandson got me good.

474
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,150
He sure made me flinch.

475
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,769
I was foolish.

476
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,340
I've given up on my goal of buying Soonyang with my money.

477
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,079
Instead,

478
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,980
I'll use what I learned from you.

479
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,519
Okay. Everyone's ready, right?

480
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,349
Here we go. We'll take it now.

481
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,119
I am your grandson. But even against me,

482
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,760
you used all the authority and power Soonyang had.

483
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:59,030
I'll do the same. I will do everything in my power...

484
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,098
to buy Soonyang.

485
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,268
All right. Let's do this, for one last time.

486
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,800
- Smile, please! - Smile, Grandfather.

487
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,099
We'll take it now.

488
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:11,139
One, two, three.

489
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,050
Mr. Lee.

490
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,750
Do you think so too?

491
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:24,849
Pardon?

492
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,730
That Do Jun takes after me.

493
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,159
Do you think that makes sense?

494
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,940
It went as you planned, young expat.

495
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:51,510
Congratulations.

496
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,179
At last, you, the youngest grandson...

497
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,619
have a shot at inheriting Soonyang.

498
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:02,759
I didn't break the rule of primogeniture...

499
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,659
because I needed a shot.

500
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,230
I'm still intent on buying the company.

501
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,739
I know better than anyone else...

502
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,170
just how much...

503
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,710
my dear Soonyang family...

504
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,809
loves and cherishes each other.

505
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,250
What?

506
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,690
They'll show faces unlike any they showed before.

507
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,590
Now everyone has a shot...

508
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,090
at becoming the next owner of Soonyang.

509
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:40,159
That's too much money...

510
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,300
to stay loyal to each other.

511
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,860
It's late.

512
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,460
Stop protesting and go to bed.

513
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,929
Good for you.

514
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:22,440
You can tell I'm protesting?

515
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:30,479
Did you have to go and do that...

516
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,949
on a wedding day of all days?

517
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,059
How shocked must the new bride have been to...

518
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,759
If he did something wrong, you could talk to him nicely...

519
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,199
and teach him what he should do.

520
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,969
You have a way of hurting the kids.

521
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,940
Does coddling them make them a better person?

522
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,078
His dad is incapable of teaching his son...

523
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,980
when the boy goes off course.

524
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,610
His uncle is terrified...

525
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,979
he'll lose what's his to his nephew...

526
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,579
and is wary about everything.

527
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,489
And his aunt...

528
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,420
thinks less of her father than a stick with poop on the end.

529
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,328
Out of the kids we had,

530
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:20,329
none of them have their heads screwed on straight.

531
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,440
Then...

532
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,610
what about Yoon Ki?

533
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,610
Do you think I don't know?

534
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:39,079
Why do you not care for Yoon Ki's family?

535
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,379
You gave him the foundation that makes nothing.

536
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,049
What do you think people will say of me?

537
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,420
They'll say that I discriminate the kid that isn't mine.

538
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,190
That nonsense again.

539
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,630
Didn't you hear what I said earlier?

540
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,769
The one who makes Soonyang bigger,

541
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:01,570
whoever that may be,

542
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,369
gets to keep it all.

543
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:10,849
Remember this one thing.

544
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,519
Our Yoon Ki.

545
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:19,389
I fed and clothed him the exact same as I did Young Ki and Dong Ki.

546
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,119
I stayed up at night, worried for them all.

547
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,960
It wasn't because I pitied him for not having a mother.

548
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,570
It was so as not to ruin your reputation.

549
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,039
I need you to...

550
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,139
remember that one thing.

551
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,119
(Soonyang Hospital)

552
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:01,230
Director Jung says it's not serious.

553
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,199
Don't worry too much.

554
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:05,269
Okay.

555
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:09,039
You talk to her parents so they don't worry.

556
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:11,769
I should ask her mother...

557
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,280
if she's weak or sick.

558
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:17,010
I know she had a scare,

559
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:18,879
but what woman makes her husband...

560
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,750
stay up to nurse her on their wedding night?

561
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,820
He already has a lot on his plate.

562
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,260
You should go home and rest.

563
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:27,719
Okay.

564
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,659
I put you through a lot today.

565
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,690
We can talk about the rest later.

566
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,599
- Okay. - Bye.

567
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,960
Tell your mother.

568
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm not the weak one. Her son is.

569
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:11,199
What are you doing?

570
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:13,500
That's what I want to say.

571
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:15,940
What were you going to do?

572
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,170
Were you going to run up and throw a punch?

573
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:22,178
Why? To take it out on Jin Do Jun?

574
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:24,110
Were you worried he'd get punched?

575
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:27,280
Pull yourself together.

576
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,719
The rest of your family...

577
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,989
are just waiting for you to mess up.

578
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,929
They're always preparing to drag you down.

579
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,230
Will you feed yourself to them so easily?

580
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,030
I can't accept that.

581
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,670
Remember.

582
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,900
You're only allowed to show them your back...

583
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,699
when I'm there.

584
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:51,440
Because we at least are a team.

585
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,480
Can you handle it if I show my back?

586
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:02,449
I warned you that...

587
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:05,190
it's bad for you to overestimate yourself.

588
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:09,090
If you look down on someone, you end up paying dearly.

589
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,400
This is the only time I'll let you off for hitting me.

590
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,170
It's our wedding night,

591
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,710
so I'll remember it as fierce foreplay.

592
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,190
Can I go?

593
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,988
It's my wedding night.

594
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:42,159
I'd like to sleep in a room that smells nice.

595
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,559
To be honest.

596
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:08,079
(Soonyang Group)

597
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,150
As per the chairman's wishes,

598
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,460
we must reorganize the subsidiaries you own between you.

599
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,960
First, Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki.

600
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,098
You'll remain Vice-Chairman...

601
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,300
of Soonyang Corporation and Electronics, but on top of that,

602
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,940
you now have the same authority to make decisions as the chairman.

603
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,170
Why?

604
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,739
So he can hold me responsible and exile me too...

605
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,409
if business profits go down?

606
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,480
Executive Director Jin Dong Ki.

607
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,719
You'll serve as vice-chairman of the whole group,

608
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,888
and manage Heavy Machinery, Chemicals,

609
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:50,760
the stock firm, and Soonyang's asset management.

610
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:52,730
If he's vice-chairman,

611
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,069
does that make him Young Ki's equal?

612
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,130
Why would you say we're equals?

613
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,669
So what if I'm in charge of a whole lot?

614
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,599
None of them are worth anything.

615
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,340
Heavy Machinery and Chemicals put together...

616
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,639
make less than 60 percent of what Electronics does.

617
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,210
Soonyang Department Store...

618
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,449
will merge with the hotel and supermarket chains.

619
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,519
The new Soonyang Distribution Group will be a separate entity.

620
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,289
The necessary procedures will be taken care of soon.

621
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,690
What does that mean?

622
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,089
He's giving me a separate group...

623
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,689
because I'm married and no longer part of this family?

624
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,658
It's not just a small group.

625
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,429
The hotel chain includes the condos...

626
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:32,199
Wait, the golf courses too?

627
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:36,139
You're taking the main pillar of the business.

628
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:39,010
You still get to live in the main house.

629
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:45,849
The separation is a demand...

630
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:48,079
made by the government and IMF.

631
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,089
The future of your group depends on whether...

632
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,019
the supermarket chain goes nationwide.

633
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,289
Chairman Jin...

634
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:59,289
has given you a chance to show what you can do.

635
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,329
To separate the subsidiaries,

636
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,440
we must sort who owns how much...

637
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,170
and who owes how much.

638
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,110
That is the amount...

639
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,050
you must repay your brothers' subsidiaries.

640
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,880
This much?

641
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:33,098
So you had a hard time?

642
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:34,299
I did.

643
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,960
If you need that much money,

644
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:38,769
you should talk to CEO Oh Se Hyeon of Miracle Investment.

645
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:45,469
It's a company that has the most cash flow in Korea now.

646
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:49,880
- Put me down. - Oh, dear...

647
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,079
You want me to ask Do Jun for help?

648
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,280
What?

649
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,650
Stop it.

650
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:57,619
Why do you think Dad made that announcement at the wedding?

651
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,750
What?

652
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,860
He'd always been displeased with Young Ki.

653
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,360
And there's no way Dong Ki or I suddenly impressed him.

654
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,400
The only change is Do Jun's existence.

655
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,730
Jin Do Jun, Miracle's majority shareholder.

656
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,339
Do you still think I should go to him for money?

657
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,409
Well...

658
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,940

I clearly said I will invest when the flower wilts...

826
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,808
and it comes to fruition.

827

Let me report back on 4-2.

832
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,480
It looks like he has taken interest in stock trading.

833
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,519
He's often visiting stock firms,

834
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:42,518
and I could tell through his phone calls...

835
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:45,190
that he invested a huge amount in a venture business.

836
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,219
Yes, what was the name again?

837
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,429
New Data Technology?

838
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,630
It's a newly listed IT venture company.

839
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:01,070
They began at 1.50 dollars, and stock firms presume...

840
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,139
it'll reach up to 40 dollars.

841
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:05,840
Wait, then 300,000 dollars will give me 10 million dollars?

842
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:08,880
Are you sure about this?

843
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:11,909
How is their business?

844
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,250
IT businesses are...

before the general election will go?

848
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,589
Above all, the research team of Soonyang Investment is...

849
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,260
the top of the industry, Vice-Chairman Jin.

850
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:34,769
Where does Do Jun get all this information?

851
01:00:36,739 --> 01:00:40,579
That young kid is the owner of Miracle Investment?

852
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,380
Did Father...

853
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:47,380
break the rule of primogeniture because of him?

854
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:52,289
Is the guy that I planted next to Do Jun doing well?

855
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:54,420
He's been doing well since he returned from his break.

856
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:56,090
Do Jun is not suspicious of him either.

857
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,460
Call the Business Department of the investment firm.

858
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:02,360
Tell them to do everything to buy the stocks of New Data Technology.

859
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:09,300
So? How much do we need right now, Ms. Im?

860
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,110
A total of 400 million dollars.

861
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,209
It costs 120 million dollars...

862
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:18,010
to make a nationwide chain network for Soonyang Mart.

863
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:20,308
Also, we have to pay back Soonyang Electronics...

864
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,049
and Soonyang Heavy Machinery...

865
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,920
for share acquisition, 150 and 130 million, respectively.

866
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,289
How much more can we borrow from the bank?

867
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,828
We've already taken out loans to our limit from our primary bank.

868
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:34,599
I see. That leaves me no choice.

869
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,630
I need to look into funds from Myeong-dong.

870
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,999
The private loan industry agreed not to put any cash out...

871
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,698
into the market right now.

872
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:45,209
The interest rate for banks is speculated to go up to 25 percent.

873
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:48,039
So they'll hold it back until that moment comes...

874
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,480
What's the alternative?

875
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,980
I'm sorry.

877

that you're sorry?

and Soonyang Heavy Machinery.

881
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,029
If they would postpone the time limit of payment...

882
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:10,968
or reduce the interest rate,

883
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:12,800
it'll help us hold out.

884
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:19,968
Sure, I'll do that for you.

Right, Ms. Jin. Are you aware of this?

889
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,090
If the stock transactions are incomplete between affiliations,

890
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,959
the separation process will also be delayed.

891
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,960
Is it okay for Father to find out?

892
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:43,659
What if he...

893
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:46,629
makes a scene saying you are incompetent...

894

Hello? Hello...

895
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,409
Father was harsh on you.

I'm here sitting with you, Mr. Oh.

But people are so weird.

our own Do Jun.

914

What do you think, Mr. Oh?

917
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:15,090
Does he have a knack for investing unlike his young age?

918
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:19,789
I didn't know you were here for a parent-teacher meeting.

919

Doesn't it feel unfair?

920
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,599
You brought up Miracle to this day with your own power,

921
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:28,039
but it has degenerated into a rich kid's trophy.

Everything in this world comes with a price tag.

There is no noble value that cannot be converted into money.

924

People who dare to say love is an invaluable thing...

925
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:42,179
are people who are like thieves that love free things.

If you cannot buy happiness with money,

927
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,519
then it's because you don't have enough.

928
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:50,260
- So? - If you're in need of Miracle,

929
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:53,289
then you can pay the price.

930
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,658
As long as I'm the CEO of Miracle,

931
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:59,099
we won't cause any influence over the succession of Soonyang.

932

I'm saying you don't have to mind Do Jun.

933
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,969
I'm with a partner who speaks my language.

934
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,809
I need 400 million dollars. As soon as possible.

935
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,150
Our partnership also comes with a price, Ms. Jin.

936
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:19,249
Give us 30 percent of Soonyang Department Store's stocks...

937
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,250
as the collateral.

938
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:24,860
Thirty percent of my shares?

939
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:30,799
Are you saying the department store is only worth that little?

940
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,300
I'm taking them only as collateral...

941
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,900
until you pay everything you owe us.

942
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:37,969
The consumer sentiment will return on track by the end of the year.

Yes.

I put on a huge fight this time.

as soon as it was listed.

I see.

957
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:23,518
It began at 1.50 dollars, then reached 10 dollars in a week,

so that's seven times.

Oh, my.

960
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,190
It'll surely rise up to at least 40 dollars.

961
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,400
Forty...

962
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,000
I would've been in big trouble if I had listened to him.

963

- Excuse me. - Wait.

964
01:06:40,969 --> 01:06:43,598
It already jumped up 7 times, yet it can reach 40 dollars?

965
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,739
How is that possible?

966
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:49,840
It's a shame that Do Jun couldn't see that,

967
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:51,980
but he's still young.

968

Hwa Young paid back what she owes you too?

She must have paid back what she owes the Electronics too.

Man, that means we cannot revert the separation...

976
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:32,489
Our father has an only daughter with great initiative.

977
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:37,590
Where did she find such a huge amount of money?

978
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,559
Could it be Father?

979

980
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:51,940
So the 400 million dollars came out of Do Jun's pocket?

981
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:59,780
They must have requested collateral for that huge amount.

982
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,150
If she put out a percentage of her shares,

983
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:06,789
her managerial rights may fall in danger after the merger.

984

She went on her way with 8,000 employees to look after.

I'm sure she has a plan.

01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:23,869
Find all the cash we can in the Distribution Group.

988
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:27,640
I'm going to invest everything in New Data Technology.

989
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,679
CEO Jin, that sounds a little dangerous.

990
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,649
You heard the Research Team of Soonyang Investment too.

991
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:36,720
They said it'll go up to 40 dollars within 1 month.

992
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,319
It'll rise up by fourfold!

993
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:42,658
Also, the Business Department of Soonyang Investment...

994
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:44,859
who has the highest earnings in the industry...

995
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,500
has been purchasing the shares of New Data Technology.

996
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,829
While Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki, that man who knows these things,

997
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:52,828
is earning fourfold, fivefold of profit,

998
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:54,840
should I sit around doing nothing?

999
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,509
But Ms. Jin,

1000
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:00,340
you cannot make private use of the department store's fund...

1001
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:03,209
I'm not keeping this for myself.

1002
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,879
I'll return the principal and the profit...

1003
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,349
back to the department store in just a month.

1004
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,579
Don't worry about it.

1005
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,649
Make sure you find three million dollars at all costs,

1006
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,960
then invest it into New Data Technology.

1007
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,659
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

1008
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:30,170
Mr. Oh, it's me, Jin Hwa Young.

1009
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:32,869
You bought some too?

1010
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,140
You put in three million dollars?

1011
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:40,920
CEO Jin, listen up.

1012
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,288
Once the stocks go up to 40 dollars in a month,

1013
01:09:45,289 --> 01:09:47,189
you have to sell them without looking back.

1014
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,220
There is a false report going around...

1015
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:51,788
between people in finances saying...

1016
01:09:51,789 --> 01:09:53,560
it'll go up to 100 and 200 dollars,

1017
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,698
but do not look back.

1018
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:57,770
You must focus on managing the department store.

1019
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,430
I am sharing this with you not as a creditor...

1020
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,369
A partner.

1021
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:03,939
but as a partner.

1022
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:08,680
How long will this rally of new top price continue?

1023
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,850
Up to about 300 dollars.

1024
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,779
Come on, not 30, but 300 dollars?

1025
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:19,050
Says who? Was this in a finance report?

1026
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,819
Mr. Oh.

1027
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,489
- Me? - Mason?

1028
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:26,159
If what's moving the stock price isn't their technology or business,

1029
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:28,399
then the answer to this soaring price is evident.

1030
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:30,630
Hosts of manipulators.

1031
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:32,069
Yes.

1032
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:34,938
They'll need the money...

1033
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,898
by the nomination of next year's general election.

1034
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,039
If the level of increase remains the same,

1035
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,439
then it'll go up to 300 dollars.

1036
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:42,839
But why 40 dollars?

1037
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,649
Why did you tell her to pull out at 40 dollars?

1038
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,179
She put in 3 million, so she'll make 12 million.

1039
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,350
Exactly four times.

1040
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:53,720
That's good enough.

1041
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:56,560
It'll make her happy for making money...

1042
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,329
and feel confident about investing.

1043
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:06,569
Miracle Investment, Rachael speaking.

1044
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:09,368
It's Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki.

1045
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:10,470
One second.

1046
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:13,409
It's the secretary of Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki.

1047
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,939
He's looking for you, Mr. Oh.

1048
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:21,180
I called you out today...

1049
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:23,779
to be a good brother.

1050
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,619
Hwa Young, no.

1051
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:31,029
CEO Jin Hwa Young borrowed money from you, right?

1052
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,630
I'll pay that back.

1053
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:34,960
In return,

1054
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,029
you can give me the shares of Soonyang Department Store...

1055
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:40,399
you got as collateral.

1056
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:42,969
I'm guessing you weren't happy...

1057
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,909
that the department store separated from Soonyang Group.

1058
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,979
The IMF doesn't know what the situation in Korea is like.

1059
01:11:50,979 --> 01:11:52,479
But at this point in time,

1060
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,479
large corporations must stick together to survive.

1061
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,850
We must push and pull each other forward.

1062
01:11:59,789 --> 01:12:02,059
I'm sure you've heard the term Korean democratization.

1063
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,159
It's the same thing.

1064
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:07,130
Korea needs a Korean way of economic democratization.

1065
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,300
Giving work to specific places. Corrupt ties with politics.

1066
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,198
Reckless business diversification. Illegal managerial succession.

1067
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,229
Things like these?

1068
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:15,069
You do not want the separation of the affiliation...

1069
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:19,670
because you're afraid you won't inherit as much.

1070
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:23,379
Hand over her collateral to me.

1071
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,810
I demand 800 million dollars.

1072
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,350
You're going to get twice as much from this?

1073
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:34,590
This is 30 percent of the shares of your sister's department store.

1074
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:37,390
I'll need at least twice as much...

1075
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,060
to betray my partner.

1076
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,869
I'll give you twice as much.

1077
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,770
Give me the shares for the department store.

1078
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:55,909
I believe Chairman Jin Yang Cheol wanted this separation.

1079
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,380
Do you think he'll be happy if the collateral...

1080
01:12:58,979 --> 01:12:59,979
ends up in your hands?

1081
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:05,189
I'm doing everything for my father's sake.

1082
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:07,419
She is my sister, but CEO Jin Hwa Young...

1083
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,920
can only run the department store.

1084
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,929
She's not competent enough to run the Distribution Group.

1085
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,728
If I walked in her shoes, I would have cashed out...

1086
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:15,959
the affiliations that don't bring in money.

1087
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,060
Well, anyway.

1088
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:22,170
This is the only way to keep the department store together.

1089
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:26,869
Give me the collateral, Mr. Oh.

1090
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:33,149
I'll think about it if you give me four times as much.

1091
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,890
Are you saying you aren't looking to sell those?

1092
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:50,399
I see. You weren't after the money.

1093
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,228
You wanted the managerial rights of the department store, Mr. Oh...

1094
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:56,039
No, it's not you.

1095
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,640
Is this Do Jun?

1096
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:01,710
Onroad, the top internet company of Korea...

1097
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:04,909
just announced a technical tie-up with New Data Technology.

1098
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,478
When the announcement was made,

1099
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:08,818
New Data Technology's stock price skyrocketed...

1100
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,220
and ended the day at 55 dollars.

1101
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,148
The stock market says...

1102
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:16,420
if this level of increase continues,

1103
01:14:16,659 --> 01:14:19,129
they will become the first company in the history of KOSDAQ...

1104
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:21,460
to reach 100 dollars within the month.

1105
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,170
The price went over 40 dollars. It's skyrocketing.

1106
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,500
I'm starting to wonder.

1107
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:33,810
Will she feel satisfied after getting what she wanted?

1108
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,239
Or...

1109
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:40,409
will she feel at a loss for losing something she could have had?

1110
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:44,689
I wonder which is more significant.

1111
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:47,050
("New Data Technology, Stock Prices Skyrocket!")

1112
01:14:47,051 --> 01:14:50,319
Do you know how much I lost after selling this at 40 dollars?

1113
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:54,328
In just a few hours,

1114
01:14:54,329 --> 01:14:55,429
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

1115
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,100
I lost 4.5 million dollars.

1116
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,229
I lost 4.5 million dollars!

1117
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:02,670
The rationality of the human mind...

1118
01:15:03,069 --> 01:15:04,869
always tells us to focus on the satisfaction we have.

1119
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:07,770
But desire...

1120
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,880
always stand on the side of the things we could have had.

1121
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,709
New Data Technology continues to hit a new high...

1122
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,549
for 55 days in a row.

1123
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,649
Look at that. Drop.

1124
01:15:19,289 --> 01:15:21,049
We'll conduct an on-site audit...

1125
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,619
for the new four branches.

1126
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,060
How does next week sound, Ms. Jin?

1127
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,989
Drop.

1128
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,600
Excuse me.

1129
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,560
Ms. Jin?

1130
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,970
- Ms. Jin? - Ms. Jin?

1131
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,359
Aunt, Mr. Oh told me...

1132
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,000
that you invested in New Data Technology.

1133
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,399
Is he really an expert investor?

1134
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,969
Do you know how much I lost...

1135
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,569
after I listened to that man's advice?

1136
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:10,970
I see. What a relief. I was worried.

1137
01:16:14,109 --> 01:16:17,409
There are hosts of manipulators behind New Data Technology.

1138
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:20,079
- Manipulators? - Yes.

1139
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:23,520
I hear they'll take the flight up to 300 dollars.

1140
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,219
But who knows when this defective aircraft...

1141
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,319
will take the plunge?

1142
01:16:27,989 --> 01:16:29,859
But I guess it's high risk, high return.

1143
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:32,689
So it will go up further?

1144
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,800
This isn't the time for you to make such aggressive investment.

1145
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,470
What do you mean?

1146
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,649
Two uncles each came to see Mr. Oh.

1147
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,978
I guess they were worried about the collateral.

1148
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:59,890
They wanted to buy the department store's shares.

1149
01:17:01,989 --> 01:17:02,989
And?

1150
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,659
Are you saying he handed it over?

1151
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,529
That's impossible, Aunt.

1152
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:10,630
We're family.

1153
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:15,640
But Mr. Oh is different. You know that, right?

1154
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,539
He's willing to do anything if you can pay the price.

1155
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,680
Do not lay your hand on the department store's shares.

1156
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:26,210
I don't care who touches it, but I will not forgive them.

1157
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:31,350
Don't stand around like a creditor. Go.

1158
01:17:31,489 --> 01:17:34,589
That darned money? I'll pay it back.

1159
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:35,959
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

1160
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,020
Good grief.

1161
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,430
My gosh.

1162
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:42,760
I knew it, Aunt.

1163
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,369
You surely are different from us.

1164
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,170
Gosh.

1165
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:04,579
Tell Director Im to come in now.

1166
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:12,159
When desire is defeated, it turns into anger...

1167
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:15,659
and pulls the bowstring tightly.

1168
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:32,809
What's the settlement cost for next month...

1169
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:34,279
from the businesses in the department store?

1170
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,619
- 140 million dollars, ma'am. - Make them into postdated checks.

1171
01:18:37,149 --> 01:18:39,189
- Sorry? - I'm going to invest...

1172
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,819
those 140 million dollars into New Data Technology.

1173
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,528
CEO Jin, that's the department store's...

1174
01:18:45,529 --> 01:18:47,488
I am Soonyang Department Store,

1175
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,359
and Soonyang Department Store is me!

1176
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,270
Invest...

1177
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:57,670
all 140 million dollars.

1178
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,680
When the arrow leaves the bow,

1179
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:09,479
it flies over to the target without hesitation.

1180
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:13,289
And that target is...

1181
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:19,529
always one's own self.

1182
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:27,529
(Reborn Rich)

1183
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:00,228
Ms. Jin, you have made enough.

1184
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:01,799
You should stop investing in stocks...

1185
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,899
It'll go up to 300 dollars.

1186
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:06,269
There will be a photoshoot.

1187
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:07,710
The theme is a female prosecutor.

1188
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:10,210
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong. Who's calling?

1189
01:20:10,609 --> 01:20:13,710
You want me to investigate CEO Jin Hwa Young's embezzlement?

1190
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,648
So we're here today as a prosecutor and an informant.

1191
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:18,649
Why not?

1192
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,390
Am I not allowed to?

1193
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:22,420
Jin Do Jun, that jerk!

1194
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:24,559
Pull yourself together, Jin Hwa Young!

1195
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,028
How is Do Jun at fault?

1196
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:28,198
Father.

1197
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,429
I must hold a board meeting.

1198
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:32,399
Today's agenda is the dismissal of CEO Jin Hwa Young.

1199
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,629
The prosecutor in charge of Aunt Hwa Young's case is...

1200
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,800
Do Jun's friend from college.

1201
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,000
