Okay. As you requested,

8
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,530
we deposited 600 million dollars into your account, sir.

9

You can now withdraw the entire balance...

10

whenever you like.

11
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,469
You became so wealthy at such a young age.

12
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,539
Was it hard work or luck?

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,359
Which of the following isn't true...

21
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,699
about marketable securities?

22
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,730
Equity security...

23
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,000
Equity security is another word for stocks.

- Here he comes. - Over here!

25
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,318
Manipulation of stocks, misconduct, and embezzlement.

26
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,688
Do you admit to the charges?

27
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,318
Prison time of 3 years with 5 years probation.

28
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,059
What is your take on the sentence?

29
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,088
Did you expect the court...

30
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,159
to grant probation in the second trial?

31
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,729
Do you have anything to say?

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,740
I'm impressed, sir.

36
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,839
Your acting has gotten better.

37
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,139
You look good on camera too.

38
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,649
The justice department does its job well, doesn't it?

39
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,410
Fairly and justly.

40
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,879
Once again, the outcome was undoubtedly 3 and 5.

41
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,050
Prison time of 3 years with 5 years probation.

42
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,290
As long as you're wealthy enough,

43
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,490
a gracious chairman can get away with professional misconduct,

44

embezzlement,

45

A fixed wholesale price of 3 years and 5 years.

48
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,600
It's like the crimes come with a price tag.

49
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,239
Why? Because there can't be a probational period...

50
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,139
for a sentence over three years.

51

What can we do but adhere to the court's ruling?

54
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,818
What? Really?

55
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,220
We should respect the ruling...

56
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,689
and make an appeal with additional evidence.

57
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,959
We'll have him convicted and imprisoned.

58

Yes, of course.

Is there an issue? None are past the expiration date.

Actually, I should first ask who you are.

The chairman is allergic to peaches.

76
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,799
He might lose consciousness from respiratory distress...

77

Yoon Hyeon Woo?

84
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,579
The one I've heard stories about?

85
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,919
I apologize for the belated greeting.

I'm Shin Gyeong Min, the newest member of your team.

We don't have time for that. Let us hurry.

Yes, sir.

- Remove those beverages. - Sure.

90

What should one do to be like you?

91
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,838
I hear the brutal workload...

92
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,639
has the average person quit in less than three years.

93
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,869
You're the only one who held out for more than five,

94
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,680
and you serve the chairman as one of his most trusted employees.

95
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,750
Allow me, sir.

96
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,419
I want to be just like you, Mr. Yoon.

97
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,460
Could you share some pointers? I'm a quick study, you see.

98

Let me see your phone.

99

Gosh, are we exchanging numbers?

100
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,600
It isn't one of Soonyang's.

101
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,240
I'll get a new one right away!

102
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,809
Could he be any sexier?

103
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,148
- Can you look this way? - Over here!

104
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,349
- Please look this way. - Can you look this way?

105
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,249
- Over here. - Sir, please.

106
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,819
- Could you look this way? - Sir, over here.

107

- This way, please. - How have you been doing?

109
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,960
Attention. 1-0, 1-alpha are entering the building.

110
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,529
Let us hurry.

111
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,299
Mr. Yoon, what does "1-0" mean?

112
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,409
We are not allowed to refer to the chairman's family by name.

113
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,538
The chairman who is the eldest goes by 1-0,

114
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,139
and his wife is 1-alpha.

115
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,638
The vice-chairman goes by 2-0,

116
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,710
his wife is 2-alpha, and his daughter is 2-1.

117
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,250
And so on and so forth.

118
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,029
I have 1-1 and 1-2 traveling up from the parking lot.

119
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,129
What is it? What is this about?

120
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,370
Can't you give me a heads up?

121
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,298
The ceremony will soon commence.

122
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,110
I don't know what this is about, but tell him after the ceremony.

123
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:08,679
Don't you know who Father is having this ceremony for?

124
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,148
The press, prominent social figures,

125
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,619
and members of your exceptional family...

126
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,149
will be focused on you today.

127
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,450
Are you going to ruin it for yourself?

128
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,129
Sir.

129
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,470
Father!

130
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,080
The succession...

131
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:42,009
within Soonyang Group?

132
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,820
It won't go as planned.

133
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,159
Because I'm renouncing my inheritance.

134
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,559
What?

135
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:59,459
Shortly at 11am, we will commence the bust unveiling ceremony...

136
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,628
of Soonyang Group's founder, the late Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

(Family, Jin Hwa Young)

138

We ask all guests present at the event...

139
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,409
to take their seats in order to ensure a peaceful ceremony.

140
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,279
We will soon commence the bust unveiling ceremony.

The accident that day.

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,789
Did you think I would never find out?

144
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,200
- Seong Jun. - It's over, Father.

(Chairman Jin Young Ki)

146

Pride...

147
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,070
is only feared when someone is worthy enough.

148
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:43,769
How dare you renounce your inheritance!

149
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,850
Especially when you haven't earned even a penny...

150
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,309
on your own before.

151
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,820
The house you live in,

152
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,820
your car, your title, your wife,

153
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,129
and even your name.

154
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,129
What you have been enjoying...

155
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:09,470
were given to you by me, your grandfather, and Soonyang.

156
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,899
Pride...

157
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,479
is a luxury for only those...

158
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,279
who can actually leave the lifestyle behind.

159
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,580
You are not a man of such caliber.

160
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,379
No one knows that more than I do.

161
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,889
All I did...

162
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,990
was my best as your father.

163
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,100
It was for my sake, you say?

164
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,370
You...

165
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,340
have been suffocating me in the cruelest way.

166
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,879
That I'm not worthy.

167

That I'm not a man who can lead Soonyang.

168
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:04,049
You told me that in your own way...

169
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,990
by making that choice that day.

170
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,370
This is me living up to expectations.

171
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,730
Don't go.

172
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Don't...

173
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,679
Chairman Jin, it's time.

174
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,590
Chairman Jin?

175
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,759
Chairman Jin, it's Yoon Hyeon Woo.

176
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,899
Sir!

177
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,169
Sir?

178
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,308
Send paramedics to the chairman's office.

179
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:55,340
This is an emergency.

180
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,740
Sir?

181
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,679
Sir!

182
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,049
Darn it.

183
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,590
Come on. Hurry!

184
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,230
You said Young Ki would be behind bars.

185
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,370
Never do you keep your promises.

186
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,909
Darn politicians.

187
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,038
Politics should be conducted on a broad perspective.

188
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,439
The whole nation shouldn't have to suffer...

189
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,879
from a family feud.

190
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,249
"Soonyang runs the South Korean economy."

191
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,819
Your family takes pride in that.

192
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,048
I'm close to witnessing Seong Jun's coronation...

193
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:44,460
at the ceremony designed to commemorate my father...

194
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,859
all while clapping my hands off.

195
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,189
It's why you should've supported me back then...

196
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,528
instead of your own family.

197
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:52,658
If you had done that,

198
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,798
it would've been you claiming the throne.

199
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,729
- No way. - Yes way.

200
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,268
- No way. - Yes way.

201
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,339
- How mature of you. - I'm glad you noticed.

202
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,239
- Is it dementia you have? - You know nothing about...

203
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,809
Goodness, Director Kim.

204
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,939
So? What is this about?

205
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,049
Allow me to tell you inside.

206
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,919
What is this?

207
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,590
Why did you gather us in private?

208
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,000
The chairman is currently receiving emergency surgery...

209
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:31,940
for acute myocardial infarction.

210
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,370
What?

211
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,049
What about the unveiling ceremony?

212
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,879
We will proceed as planned.

213
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,919
Issuing a press release will hurt our stock price.

214
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,860
The special announcement...

215
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,928
should come from the chairman for it to be meaningful.

216
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,558
- Of course. - The chairman of a company...

217
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,158
who the prosecution just released...

218
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,230
was now met with a health issue.

219
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,199
Displaying lack of leadership won't help the business.

220
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,570
So?

221
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,469
Who should announce it instead?

222
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,809
Honey, did you bring another necktie?

223
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,379
It's in the car. Should I get it?

224
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,850
Yes.

225
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,750
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun should give the announcement.

226
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,690
What?

227
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,190
The announcement.

228
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,819
The restructuring of the organization hierarchy...

229
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,259
may seem complex,

230
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,990
but the issue at hand is simple.

231
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,099
How will Soonyang resolve its issue...

232
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,799
surrounding the succession?

233
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,329
Don't they all want to see...

234
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,230
the vice-chairman step up to the plate?

235
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,799
The government, the people, and also our shareholders.

236
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,009
Don't you agree, Hyeon Min?

237
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,299
I hear you summoned me.

238
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,029
You never have to ask Mr. Yoon twice.

239
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,339
After the unveiling ceremony,

240
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,410
Soonyang will make a special public announcement.

241
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,150
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun will be giving the speech.

242
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,619
The ceremony will be over in 30 minutes.

243
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,160
Wherever he went, you are to find him...

244
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,920
and bring him to me.

245
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,960
Time isn't a luxury we have, Mr. Yoon.

246
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,589
You must hurry.

247
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:46,339
If he isn't on the podium by that time,

248
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,809
you will no longer have a place at Soonyang.

249
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:57,509
The shortest route to the hotel will get you back in 20 minutes.

250
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,380
- I'll drive. - Sure.

251
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,659
The only problem is that the nearby department store...

252
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,190
is having a sales event, and it's lunch hour.

253
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,230
If we get stalled at the hotel,

254
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,599
thirty minutes won't be enough.

255
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,599
You should formally complain about the unreasonable task.

256
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:17,529
You said you wanted to be like me.

257
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,268
Of course.

258
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,210
- You wish for a long career. - Yes.

259
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:23,210
There are three things I never do.

260
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,180
Three things. Just a second.

261
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,849
I never reject orders made by the chairman's family.

262
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,380
I never ask questions, and...

263
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:39,059
I never make my own judgment.

264
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:41,859
Those are my rules.

265
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:27,200
Excuse me. Vice-Chairman Jin?

266
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Vice-Chairman Jin?

267
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,049
Quiet.

268
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,390
I can hear them speak.

269
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,130
They can sense tremor on the sides of their bodies.

270
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,730
Right now, they're speaking loudly.

271
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,930
They want us to be quiet.

272
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,338
French cuisine...

273
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:03,169
made from seasonal ingredients will be served...

274
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,410
When in danger,

275
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,750
they send out a distress signal.

276
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,078
Do you know what it is?

277
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,990
If you're not interested, we will not serve lunch today.

278
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,359
Sir?

279
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,059
Vice-Chairman Jin?

280
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,599
Didn't I tell you to be quiet?

281
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:30,900
I just said it.

282
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,440
Please!

283
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,750
I ruined it.

284
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,650
I ruined it!

285
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,160
You knew the answer!

286
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,670
You will pee.

287
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:05,440
Just like now.

288
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:14,309
One, two, three!

289
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,160
Who called you smart when you are the opposite?

290
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,599
Why would you let Seong Jun make the announcement?

291
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,639
You'd only be solidifying his position at the company.

292
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,869
Don't you know that?

293
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,710
That'll only be true when he makes the announcement.

294
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,410
Are you saying he won't be here?

295
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,450
It'll be official.

296
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,779
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun...

297
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,890
is a bit too dangerous to take on the mantle.

298
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,769
Darn it!

299
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,569
If you had been quiet,

300
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,940
none of this would've happened.

301
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,180
Once again, you think I'm the bad guy.

302
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,990
Why make me out to be one...

303
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,250
when you're the ones at fault?

304
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,490
Why?

305
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,930
Mr. Jin...

306
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:40,099
Mr. Yoon, are you all right?

307
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,069
Mr. Shin, escort everyone out.

308
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,970
Sure. Let us leave. Come on.

309
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:50,769
Oh, no.

310
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,940
This happened in 1987,

311
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,849
at the 60th birthday party for your grandfather,

312
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,549
former Chairman Jin.

313
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,420
You smashed the Goryeo celadon that he cherished...

314
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,088
and was scolded by him for the first time.

315
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,460
- What? - Not because of the celadon.

316
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,430
Because being driven by emotions...

317
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:49,430
wasn't an adequate quality in someone...

318
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,169
who were to run a business that is Soonyang.

319
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,140
- Mr. Yoon! - I read it...

320
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,680
in his autobiography.

321
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:02,108
Since that day, you honed his teachings...

322
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,450
and gave thought to the true qualities of a businessman.

323
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:05,579
That is how...

324
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,890
you were able...

325
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,920
to become the responsible and prudent businessman.

326
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,329
The PR team is putting together a press release.

327
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,829
You were only late to the unveiling ceremony...

328
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,930
because you stayed behind until the last second...

329
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,269
in order to cautiously reflect the late chairman's...

330
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,269
management philosophy...

331
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:31,039
in the announcement.

332
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,339
The ceremony ends...

333
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,609
in 12 minutes.

334
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,049
If you make it there by that time,

335
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,690
no one will take issue with today's events.

336

The chairman is currently receiving emergency surgery.

338
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,670
What happened in that room before he collapsed...

339
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,140
will never become public knowledge.

340
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,750
For I...

341
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,619
will never talk.

342
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,720
You have ten minutes.

343

I only ask for your cooperation.

344
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:28,890

345
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,029
open-mind management...

346
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,930
has mutts barking at their owners, Mr. Yoon.

347
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,509
Have the car ready.

348
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:55,019
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

349
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,890
Thank you.

350
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,950
Gosh. I apologize for my tardiness.

351
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:32,890
Our Soonyang...

352
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,029
wishes to do its due diligence as one of Korea's top companies...

353
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,829
by being reliable and by meeting the ethical standard of the people.

354
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:46,139
Soonyang will be restructured as a holding company...

355
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,038
to improve asset quality...

356
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,539
which is an issue the group has been numerously...

357
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,470
called out on.

360
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,150
I am well aware...

361
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,789
that Soonyang has been criticized for evading the law...

362
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,859
during its tumultuous former succession processes.

363
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,430
We will accept any criticism that comes our way,

364
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:18,700
and do our best to honestly answer...

365
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,539
to the needs of time.

366
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,769
Soonyang's innovation...

367
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,710
won't stay limited to its technology and products.

368
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:29,809
In that sense,

369
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:31,879
the huge amount of profit that will be levied...

370
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,419
as a result of the shares traded...

371
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,489
by all subsidiary companies during the transition...

372
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,220
will be paid faithfully and accurately.

373
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,329
That little brat.

374
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,630
What on earth is that brat blabbering about?

375
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:52,069
A business that'll benefit the nation.

376
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,740
Fairness in business.

377
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,768
I will honor the wishes of my grandfather,

378
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,579
former Chairman Jin Yang Cheol,

379
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,849
and let Soonyang be reborn as a company...

380
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,950
that is cherished by the people.

383
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,190
Tell us.

384
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,259
What happened to Mr. Yoon's face?

385
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,359
As if you need to ask.

386

Everyone knows that 1-1 can be violent.

387

Even after the humiliation,

388
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:34,939
I bet he'll act all high and mighty...

389
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,768
as the senior manager at Soonyang.

390
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:37,839
Mr. Yoon.

391
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,980
He's incredible.

392
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,279
Not anyone can be the chairman's right-hand man.

393
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,250
He's no right-hand man.

394
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,690
A dirty glove he wears on his right hand, maybe.

395
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,490
You know, the cheap kind you wear...

396
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,089
to keep your hands clean that can be replaced at any time.

397
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:57,789
To be honest, he doesn't have the qualifications.

398
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,859
He was a handpicked high-school graduate.

399
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:01,529
They're easily done away with.

400
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,899
What qualified guy in the right mind would do what he does?

401
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,809
But look at Mr. Yoon. He stakes his life to serve.

402
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,539
He has to.

403
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,940
He's not good at much else.

Hello, ma'am, Yoon speaking.

406
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:26,619
Sorry for taking my time.

407
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,230
Yes, I understand. I'll be right over. Bye.

408
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,829
It's done, ma'am.

You know,

410
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,380
I feel uncomfortable, Mr. Yoon.

411
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:56,608
I know he has a carer,

412
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,579
but I'm stuck here as long as my husband is.

413
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:03,519
You know how particular I am about cleanliness.

414
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,920
Must I call and give instructions...

415
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,359
regarding minute details?

416
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,059
I apologize.

417
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,359
I was neglectful.

418
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,799
I'm not a stingy person, am I?

419

and Mom waited for a while.

502
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,939
"To be able to afford the massive amount of taxes..."

503
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,309
"that would occur in the process,"

504
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,239
"the owner family including Jin Young Ki..."

505
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:09,250
"and Jin Seong Jun have enough funds stashed aside."

506
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,349
It sounded like a confession to me.

507
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:15,420
And I couldn't ignore that confession.

508
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,659
- If we're done, let's go. - Okay.

509
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:22,090
Pack up. It's time to go.

510
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,130
The Future Asset Management Department?

511
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,809
That means the owner family is the future asset.

512
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,710
Do you really think so?

513
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,820
They call you "Soonyang's Grim Reaper."

514
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:56,190
Not only do you only wear black,

515
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,359
you indict anyone without a care...

516
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,260
if Soonyang's involved somehow.

517
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,639
Do you want to gain fame for taking Soonyang down or...

518
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,139
is there a personal vendetta others don't know about?

519
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:15,539
There's a lot of gossip about you.

520
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,980
I don't think it's either.

521
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,679
I think...

522
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:25,190
you're just doing your job as best you can.

523
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,920
The same goes for me as well.

524
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,300
Do you take special lessons?

525
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,000
You're quite eloquent.

526

(Prosecutors' Office)

(Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office)

528
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,119
Is it true?

529
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:03,889
All the computers are new, never used once,

530
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:06,828
and other than the first few pages,

531
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:10,099
the files are printouts of PR stuff and of Soonyang's history.

532
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,139
It has to be that...

533
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:17,340
they knew we'd be coming and they were prepared.

534
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,800
- Mr. Shin. - Yes?

00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,429
Planning and Coordination's seating chart.

536
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,799
Replace all the computers as assigned.

537
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,070
Yes, sir.

538
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,579
I sent a list of files to either keep or delete.

539
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,610
It's a sensitive job, so be extra careful.

540
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,150
Yes, sir.

541
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,590
Mr. Shin.

542
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,019
You got a new phone?

543
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,159
Oh, yes.

544
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,000
Mr. Yoon.

545
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,199
So...

546
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,469
I apologize. What happened yesterday...

547
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:00,940
I'm off to report to the Vice-Chairman.

548
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,550
Do you want to tag along?

549
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,679
Yes.

550
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,590
Prosecutors are so weird.

551
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,760
I said I'd abide by the law, and they attacked me first.

552
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,269
It makes me want to retaliate.

553
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,570
What's the likelihood of another search and seizure?

554
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:33,280
It is very unlikely.

555
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,349
I already gave Mr. Yoon the necessary instructions.

556
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,948
He'll work with Planning and Coordination,

557
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:40,650
and any problematic files...

558
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,550
will be carefully separated and deleted forever.

559
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,250
Even if prosecutors come by again,

560
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,760
they won't find anything illegal or suspicious, sir.

561
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,860
You do a good job.

562
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,699
Thank you.

(Soonyang Medical Center)

564
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,519
Who was that gentleman?

565
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,289
He's 4-0, Advisor Jin Yoon Ki.

566
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:00,829
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's fourth son.

567
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:05,269
I didn't know the late chairman had a fourth son.

568
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,170
I heard he'd cut ties with the family for some reason.

569
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,980
- Mr. Shin? - Yes?

570
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,909
Oh, right.

571
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:25,789
Gosh.

572
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,489
Wasn't that ex-Miss Soonyang and movie star...

573
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,019
What was her name?

574
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:02,860
She's 4-alpha.

575
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,260
What? Then she's...

576
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,630
Yes. She's married to Advisor Jin Yoon Ki.

577
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,400
She's the exact reason he cut ties with the family.

578
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,699
That's crazy.

579
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,869
Do they have any children?

580
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:18,569
They have a son.

581
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,739
I heard 4-1 is into entertainment...

582
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,679
that's not tied to Soonyang.

583
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,909
He must be quite old.

584
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,480
I guess it pays to come from a great family.

585
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:33,260
His heart stopped twice during surgery,

586
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,219
so while administering CPR,

587
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:38,059
we inserted a stent in his aorta.

588
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,929
As a result, this morning, oxygen saturation was good,

589
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,130
and all numbers and levels have returned to normal.

590
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,269
Oh, thank you. Thanks so much.

591
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:52,939
- Thank you. - I must see him.

592
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:56,610
Right now, complete rest is the best medicine.

593
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,650
You cannot see him for a while.

594
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,179
Please cooperate.

595
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,420
Doctor Ahn.

596
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:07,659
Just a moment.

597
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,369
Hey. You still have that skill.

598
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,738
You startle people by showing up.

599
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:22,500
And you're still afraid.

600
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,610
If you have nothing, you fear nothing.

601
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,480
You should try harder, Auntie.

602
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:35,519
Did you call her? As if anyone misses her.

603
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,349
She doesn't even take my calls.

604
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,630
A long time has passed.

605
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,968
Am I still an unwelcome guest within the family?

606
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:58,210
- You know that and... - If you knew what I brought,

607
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,710
you couldn't mistreat me anymore.

608
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,710
Let's hear it.

609
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,178
What did you bring with you?

610
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,250
Three percent.

611
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:14,159
Three percent of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

612
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,300
Once Soonyang becomes a holding company,

613
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,500
when the time comes for you to fight over who becomes chairman,

614
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,239
won't my three percent be the casting vote?

615
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,710
What do you want instead?

616
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:45,789
My son.

617
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,469
I must know...

618
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:00,869
the truth behind the accident that day.

619
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,170
You all know!

620
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,809
Bring me the answer.

621
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,119
Then I'll hand over all I own.

622
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,130
Thank you.

623
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,269
Mr. Yoon, I need to talk to you about something.

624
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:35,570
Sure.

625
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:37,109
As you said, I separated the files to be discarded...

626
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,639
from the ones we should keep.

627
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,539
- The ones on the computer too? - Yes.

628
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,579
But I found something.

629
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:47,420
Well...

630
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:50,619
This wasn't on the list.

631
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,118
The thing is, it's an old document that is out of date.

632
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,860
At first, I was just going to dispose of it. But I saw...

633
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,630
a number of transactions involving large amounts in the span of years.

634
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,969
You should go through it and decide what to do with it.

635
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,269
(Confidential)

636
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:03,889
As you can see, Soonyang Micro...

637
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,460
is a dummy company that only exists on paper.

638
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:10,368
The records show large transactions between the company...

639
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:13,369
and Soonyang's subsidiaries that took place for over a decade.

640
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,538
Despite Soonyang Micro's transaction and sales records,

641
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:21,909
I could not find anything on the company...

642
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,780
in any of Soonyang's contracts and financial documents,

643
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,579
as if it had been hidden on purpose.

644
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,619
Do you...

645
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,459
realize what that means?

646
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,230
Someone is siphoning Soonyang's money overseas...

647
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,670
through this paper company, sir.

648
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,320
- Sir. - This is...

649
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,789
just a document that should've been disposed of long ago.

650
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:07,689
Had there been a problem,

651
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:10,159
Internal Affairs would've already dealt with it.

652
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,530
Do you think you're more competent...

653
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,500
than Soonyang's top-tier talent?

654
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,268
But this is clearly...

655
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:24,239
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo, the head of Future Asset Management.

656
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:34,780
Do you know why I've been keeping you on for the past five years?

657
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:40,690
You know exactly when to step in and when to back off. That's why.

658
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,460
So keep it up.

659
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:46,289
Do not make me repeat myself.

660
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:50,630
Got anything else to say?

661
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:52,900
No, sir.

662
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,050
I guess you had to work late, Mr. Yoon.

663
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,269
So? Have you finished organizing the documents?

664
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:30,539
Yes, sir.

665
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,510
It's been taken care of.

666
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,210
I'll be off, then.

667
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,349
(Chairman Jin Yang Cheol)

668
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,349
It was white porcelain.

669
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,050
My grandfather's vase that I broke.

670
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:48,619
It wasn't Goryeo celadon. It was a white porcelain vase.

671
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,429
But in his autobiography, he wrote that it was a Goryeo celadon vase.

672
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,400
I swear, he knew nothing about me.

673
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,500
You know more about me than he ever did.

674
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,739
My grandfather always said...

675
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,449
that Soonyang would go bust because of lazy fools like me.

676
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,820
But once again, he was wrong.

677
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,059
Sure, there are lazy fools like me at Soonyang.

678
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,159
But the company has employees like you as well.

679
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:40,780
You certainly deserve to wear the Soonyang badge.

680
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:46,480
About that day...

681
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:49,480
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

682
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,230
Don't look at me like that. You should get going.

683
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,800
Yes, sir.

684
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,090
(Chairman Jin Yang Cheol)

685
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,260
Sir.

686
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:38,769
There's something I must tell you.

687
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:41,969
(Confidential)

688
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,940
Soonyang's assets are being siphoned...

689
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,809
into a paper company overseas in large amounts.

690
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,550
And the prosecution...

691
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,389
suspects that Soonyang has a large slush fund.

692
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,190
Once the prosecution finds out about the paper company,

693
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:04,859
the company will be charged...

694
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,589
with embezzlement, breach of duty, and tax evasion.

695
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,630
Also,

696
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,829
the plans for the holding company and the succession will be affected.

697
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:14,840
Then let me hear what you think I should do.

698
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,809
You should make a move before the prosecution does.

699
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,609
Submit a declaration of business closure for the paper company...

700
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,650
and make sure...

701
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:27,718
Soonyang Corporation absorbs the assets.

702
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:28,880
That's my suggestion, sir.

703
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,789
You found this in a cabinet in Planning and Coordination?

704
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,420
That's correct, sir.

705
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:39,860
Where is the original document?

706
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,400
Not these photos you took.

707
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,170
The original document.

708
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,409
Pardon me?

709
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:56,980
The original document...

710
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,550
Sir, Mr. Kim is here.

711
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,019
Okay.

712
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:18,570
Mr. Yoon brought something interesting.

713
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,070
(Confidential)

714
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,250
Go on.

715
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,719
Where's the original document?

716
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,030
Well...

717
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,530
I got rid of it, sir.

718
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,369
You did?

719
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,269
Yes, sir.

720
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:00,340
If the existence of the paper company comes to the surface,

721
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:02,280
someone...

722
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,920
will try to destroy all evidence. That's why...

723
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,949
I took and saved the photos and got rid of the original document.

724
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,489
You made a wise choice, Mr. Yoon.

725
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,030
I'd like to ask you something, Mr. Kim.

726
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,670
About this paper company, Soonyang Micro.

727
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,239
I bet you...

728
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,639
You knew about it, didn't you?

729
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,110
Pardon?

730
00:59:57,769 --> 00:59:59,469
Answer wisely, Mr. Kim.

731
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:02,499
Sir, I...

732
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,269
If you knew but didn't report it, you either...

733
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,510
do not approve of me as your boss...

734
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:10,579
or became greedy for that money.

735
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,820
If you didn't know about it, that's even worse.

736
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:19,590
It means you're incompetent.

737
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:27,000
So which one is it?

738
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:32,570
I apologize, sir.

739
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,050
Either way, I now know that you've betrayed Soonyang.

740
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,979
- Mr. Yoon. - Yes, sir.

741
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,579
- You have a valid passport, right? - Yes.

742
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:19,408
As of today, you're the senior finance manager...

743
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,949
of the Planning and Coordination Department.

744
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,989
Go retrieve Soonyang's assets that have been siphoned off overseas.

745
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:29,519
That is your first mission as the senior finance manager.

746
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,230
I trust that you'll do a good job.

747
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:45,769
I'll do my best, sir.

748
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,909
I've done some thinking, Father.

749
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,780
You were right.

750
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,949
So now,

751
01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:28,250
I must have something to my name.

752
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:34,260
The new Soonyang and its glowing future will be mine.

753
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,059
Soonyang's dark past shall perish with you, Father.

754
01:02:52,909 --> 01:02:54,840
Until the succession is completed,

755
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,980
just keep on breathing like this.

756
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,369
Please sign here.

757
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,189
Okay. As you requested,

758
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:41,059
we deposited 600 million dollars into your account, sir.

759
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,928
You can now withdraw the entire balance...

760
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:45,989
whenever you like.

761
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,900
You became so wealthy at such a young age.

762
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:53,030
Was it hard work or luck?

763
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,070
Then let me hear what you think I should do.

764
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:01,070
You should make a move before the prosecution does.

765
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:04,408
Submit a declaration of business closure for the paper company...

766
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:05,909
and make sure...

767
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:08,839
Soonyang Corporation absorbs the assets.

768
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,480
That's my suggestion, sir.

769
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,780
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun.

770
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:20,920
Do you think you can indict him?

771
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:05,099
Hey, where are you going?

772
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:07,500
Is this the right way?

773
01:06:07,639 --> 01:06:10,670
Don't worry. This is the shortcut.

774
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:13,670
Only we know. Taxi drivers.

775
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:33,329
We're almost there.

776
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,329
Okay.

777
01:06:58,219 --> 01:06:59,519
One minute left.

778
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,989
Okay.

779
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:11,989
Hey!

780
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,000
Hey! Help!

781
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,560
Hey...

782
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:21,699
Are you okay? Let me help you up.

783
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:24,069
Sorry.

784
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,760
The 600 million-dollar slush fund.

785
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:22,260
The slush fund created through Soonyang Micro.

786
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,770
I heard Yoon Hyeon Woo went to retrieve and launder the money.

787
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,470
Ye Jun.

788
01:09:32,409 --> 01:09:34,039
Who told you such nonsense?

789
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,510
Our finance director.

790
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:39,680
Do you want to meet him?

791
01:09:41,619 --> 01:09:42,649
Director Kim.

792
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,439
Then the slush fund...

793
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:04,569
Once it's retrieved,

794
01:10:06,909 --> 01:10:08,180
can I have it?

795
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,619
Ye Jun, you've grown a lot.

796
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,449
Mr. Shin.

797
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,250
Why are you here?

798
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:38,630
Mr. Shin.

799
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:43,340
Why in the world... Why are you doing this to me?

800
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:48,239
You told me...

801
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,609
to never...

802
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,579
disobey the higher-ups' orders or ask questions.

803
01:11:57,789 --> 01:12:00,789
You said I should never make my own judgment.

804
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:04,189
I simply...

805
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:07,699
followed your advice.

806
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:14,770
Let go.

807
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,569
Let go!

808
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:21,609
Who is it?

809
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,810
Who ordered you to do this?

810
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:35,890
The person who needs this.

811
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,010
Do Jun, you woke up?

812
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:02,710
What? 4-alpha?

813
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,409
We're almost there. Time to wake up.

814
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,250
That's 4-0.

815
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:16,319
Hey, what are you doing?

816
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:21,398
Hey, then you must be 4-1.

817
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:23,859
What? "Hey?"

818
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,800
You little...

819
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,380
Am I alive?

820
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,460
Why do I look...

821
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,229
What happened to me?

822
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:00,000
Do you want to know?

823
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:01,899
Shall I tell you?

824
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:12,050
It's obvious at a single glance.

825
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,250
Why?

826
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:19,319
Why am I here?

827
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:20,890
Why?

828
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:25,529
- Do Jun. - What is it? What's wrong?

829
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,289
It wasn't me.

830
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,899
I didn't do anything!

831
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,339
Where is this place?

832
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,868
(Gwanghwamun)

833
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:39,140
The National Museum of Korea?

834
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:43,079
Today marks a historic moment when the demolition...

835
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:45,810
of the Japanese General Government Building commenced.

836
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:48,779
Gyeongbokgung will be restored...

837
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,949
That building was demolished in 1995.

838
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,149
How is it still there?

839
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,699
Do Jun, are you all right?

840

(Sejong Center for the Performing Arts)

842
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:33,329
Are you all right?

843
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,630
Let's go say hi to Grandma.

844
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:39,600
Let's go.

845

(The 24th Trade Day Business Medal Reward Ceremony)

846
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:51,079
Hey, Yoon Ki.

847
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,880
Hello.

848
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:56,449
Oh, Yoon Ki. There you are.

849
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,488
Hyeong Jun, Do Jun. You're here too.

850
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,220
Come to Grandma!

851
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:02,519
Hello.

852
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,459
My gosh. You're a big boy now.

853
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,488
This can't be.

854
01:17:05,489 --> 01:17:08,828
Oh, my. You're a man now.

855
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:09,859
You people are...

856
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,949
Mr. Chairman is here.

857
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:44,699
Welcome.

858
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:46,369
Congratulations, sir.

859
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:48,670
Congratulations.

860
01:17:49,569 --> 01:17:50,600
Congratulations.

861
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:55,310
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, sir.

862
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,010
Hello.

863
01:17:57,539 --> 01:17:58,649
- Congratulations, sir. - Congratulations, sir.

864
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:01,579
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol?

865
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:21,800
The founder of Soonyang.

866
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,239
It's him.

867
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,470
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

868
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:44,390
(Reborn Rich)

869
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,688
Who am I?

870
01:19:15,689 --> 01:19:17,260
What kind of question is that?

871
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:21,329
You are Jin Do Jun, the youngest grandchild of the Soonyang family.

872
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:23,529
This can't be.

873
01:19:23,899 --> 01:19:25,170
Does it make money?

874
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,029
Will it help Soonyang?

875
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,698
Between DJ and YS, choose the one who's more likely to win.

876
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:30,770
Who would that be?

877
01:19:30,869 --> 01:19:34,339
If it were me, I'd back Roh Tae Woo's campaign.

878
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:35,840
Did you eavesdrop on the adults' conversation?

879
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,038
You little...

880
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,108
Throw salt after them.

881
01:19:38,109 --> 01:19:40,148
There are beggars everywhere.

882
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:42,149
It's not a prank. It's true.

883
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:45,449
By any chance, do you know what the future holds?

884
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:47,350
Answer me!

885
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:49,689
One of these people...

886
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,729
killed me.

887
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:26,130
