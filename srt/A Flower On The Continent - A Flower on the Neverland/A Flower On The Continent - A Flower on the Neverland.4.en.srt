3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,920
Pretty good.

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,320
What's good?

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,040
Being honest is good.

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,840
I've been hiding it from you
and I feel bad about it.

7
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,680
Considering I saved you,

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,560
you won't tell anyone, right?

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,000
That's your personal business.

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,560
I won't interfere.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,680
Straightforward.

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,760
From today on, we're besties.

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
As a woman, you should be more cautious.

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,720
Don't touch or grab me.

15
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,690
We're both women. What's there to fear?

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,760
Actually,

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
I've wanted a girl friend
for a long time.

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,200
By the way,

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,880
I have something good to show you.

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,840
Look.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,840
Look at these.

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,440
Years of collection, I had no one
to share it with.

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,320
Today, they can finally
see the light of day.

24
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,140
Just tell me what you like,
and it's yours.

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,640
This powder,

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,240
it smells wonderful.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,280
Let me try it on you.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,120
Take it away.

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,200
Just try it.

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Take it away.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
It's OK.

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,390
I should change my clothes

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
since I just came back.

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,200
Xuan,

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,040
bring me the clothes on the bed.

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,180
She didn't hear me?

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,680
Xuan?

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,680
Xuan?

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,440
I heard you, stop yelling.

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,120
Thanks.

41
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,840
Why are you standing there?

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,480
Getting some air.

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,840
Getting air?

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,280
The gentle breeze

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,600

Xiyu, is it?

70
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,040
I warn you, stay away from her.

71
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Or else...

72
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
Or else what?

73
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,680
Why are you here?

74
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
To talk to you.

75
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,640
Let's go.

76
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,520
Come out.

77
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
That day in the alley,

78
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,600
you left the man in black alive
on purpose.

79
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
I secretly tracked him

80
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,360
and found his secret hideout.

81
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,840
I also obtained Tu Mountain Clan's
unique weapon.

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,040
It's at Fragrance Teahouse.

83
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,880
It's under Hua Xiyu's name.

84
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
If Hua Xiyu is the mastermind,

85
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,120
he must've approached you

86
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,160
with ill intent.

87
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,960
Impossible.

88
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,000
Tell me, should I hit you or not?

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,480
Yes.

90
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,490
I told you to be discreet
but you told your sister?

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,760
If I didn't tell Mei,

92
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,200
her life would be ruined.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,960
Yours too.

94
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,240
What about me?

95
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,380
If you don't stay away
from that Ning guy,

96
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
you'll be ruined too.

97
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,160
Enough.

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,600
If you trouble her again, I'll ruin you.

99
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,670
The emperor ordered to treat her
with courtesy,

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,640
yet you cause trouble,

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,400
ignoring his words.

102
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,960
I...

103
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,080
Xuan.

104
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Where did she go?

105
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,240
Don't touch it.

106
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
So, you're here.

107
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,960
What's this?

108
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,360
This is a secret weapon
I brought from home.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Handle it with great care,

110
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,120
or it can easily harm you.

111
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,160
I see.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,120
Is it powerful?

113
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,560
(If Hua Xiyu is the mastermind,)

114
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,800
(he must've approached you)

115
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,880
(with ill intent.)

116
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,400
Of course.

117
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,490
Careful, or it could blow you to pieces.

118
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,120
(She doesn't even know it's dangerous.)

119
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
(How could she be the mastermind?)

120
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,600
(Xiyu treats me with sincerity,)

121
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,040
(but I've been deceiving her.)

122
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,160
Xuan,

123
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,600
help me out.

124
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,760
Sure, ask away.

125
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,960
Help me braid my hair.

126
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
You don't know

127
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,960
how long I've wanted a beautiful hairdo,

128
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,000
but I never dared to ask anyone.

129
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,800
If someone discovered, I'd be finished.

130
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,800
I can't do it well myself.

131
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,360
You've suffered enough for years.

132
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,440
Exactly, it's been miserable.

133
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,000
I blame my mom's ambition.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,490
She insisted I become the family head.

135
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,600
But it's been tough for her.

136
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
My father passed away.

137
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,120
If I can't give her what she wanted,

138
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,800
who else would?

139
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,320
Is it done?

140
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,280
Almost.

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,040
I want to see.

142
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,000
It's done.

143
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,200
What...

144
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,720
Sorry,

145
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
my skills aren't great.

146
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,960
It's OK, we're the same.

147
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,320
We lack experience.

148
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,040
How about I help you braid?

149
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,560
No need.

150
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,080
No need.

151
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:14,920
Really.

152
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,440
- I'm glad to do it.
- No need, Xiyu.

153
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,680
No worries.

154
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,480
Really, no need.

155
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,960
We're like sisters.

156
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,040
No need to be shy.

157
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,120
Xiyu, actually, I...

158
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
What is it?

159
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,440
Nothing.

160
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
But if you keep being so reckless,

161
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,520
I'll need a new roommate.

162
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,840
Come on, who else could be
your roommate?

163
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
Hong Wuhui? Zhang Fengtian?

164
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,560
They're all men.

165
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,960
(Right, it'd be more dangerous for her.)

166
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,120
Wait a minute.

167
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,080
What are you doing?

168
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,760
Why draw a line with your own friend?

169
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,560
No, I must.

170
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,440
No need.

171
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
It must be done.

172
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,080
Drawing a line with me

173
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,400
is hurting.

174
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,760
We share

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,480
our deepest secrets.

176
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,190
We'll eat together,
wear the same clothes,

177
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,760
share a bed, even bathe together.

178
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,320
What?

179
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,360
Scrub each other's backs.

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,280
I'm a man.

181
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,360
What?

182
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm a man.

183
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
Xuan,

184
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
you're joking, right?

185
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
That day at the teahouse,
I did want to escape,

186
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,920
but as a man disguised as a woman.

187
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,160
Do you believe me when I say this?

188
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,440
Pretty good.

189
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,080
What's good?

190
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,440
Being honest is good.

191
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,280
I've been hiding it from you

192
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,080
and I feel bad about it.

193
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,160
Will you tell anyone?

194
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,720
Tell anyone?

195
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Now everyone knows you're a man,

196
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,080
but I was the only one who didn't.

197
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
What can I say?

198
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,480
That I was blind?

199
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Listen to me.

200
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,880
I won't listen.

201
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,040
Ning Xuanzhou, you jerk.

202
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
I'll go cool down

203
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,480
and deal with you later.

204
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
What are you doing?

205
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,360
You still have the girl's hairdo.

206
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,600
You can't go out.

207
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,880
Don't hurt yourself.

208
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
If you don't want to see me,

209
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,800
I'll leave.
