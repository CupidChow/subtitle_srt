=Episode 15=

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,400
You need to make sure
it's done better this time.

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,560
Don't worry, I guarantee it'll be
a lot better than last time.

5
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,360
You can even do the Flying Fairy Bun?

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,290
Even the hairdressers in the capital
might not be able to.

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
If you focus, you can learn it.

8
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,960
Does it look good?

9
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,680
Especially good.

10
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,760
But no matter how good it looks,

11
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,240
it's only for you to see in the room.

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,560
To others,

13
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,360
I'm still that Master Hua
who cherishes beauty.

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,480
That's fine.

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
I hope to keep you hidden,

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
so only I can see you.

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Really?

18
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,680
Not true.

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,560
I wish all the men in the world
could see you

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,840
and then I'll tell them

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,120
this beauty belongs to me,
Ning Xuanzhou.

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,920
I've noticed

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,760
ever since your identity as a commander
was revealed,

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,760
you've changed.

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,280
Changed how?

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,240
You've become both willful

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,440
and a bit wicked.

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
That's not a change.

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,240
I was pretending before.

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,720
This is my true nature.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,600
So annoying.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,800
What's wrong?

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,960
You've hurt me.

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,640
Stop pretending.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,160
Don't hit my arm.

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,640
It's fun to hit my face.

37
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,590
♪This love, this scene, this long night♪

38
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,049

Xuan,

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,840
do you want to...

43
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,200
Do you want to...

44
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
meet my mom?

45
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,300
(Hua Mansion)

46
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,040
Greetings, Madam Hua.

47
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,760
Prince Ning is indeed

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
dignified and charming.

49
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,800
Please, take a seat.

50
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,310
No need to be so formal, Your Highness.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,180
Please enjoy the tea.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,680
I've heard even your master

53
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,800
praise Your Highness's calligraphy.

54
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,840
You should give Xiyu more guidance.

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,440
He doesn't study well,

56
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,650
but loves to flirt with girls.

57
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,800
The girls at Fragrance Teahouse
swarm around him

58
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,040
like flies around a stinky egg,

59
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,640
never letting go.

60
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,760
You're embarrassed?

61
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,320
When you turn 20,
make sure to get married,

62
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,280
so you don't stray outside.

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,360
Your Highness, my son has many flaws

64
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
but is very filial.

65
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,200
Look, he often buys jewelry for me.

66
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,000
This hairpin is mine.

67
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,760
He knows I'm a woman.

68
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,520
Come here.

69
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,920
He really knows?

70
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,640
I wondered why he suddenly came over.

71
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,490
It turns out he has ulterior motives.

72
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,880
Mother, he just...

73
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,840
I understand.

74
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,000
Hurry over.

75
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,040
I'll handle this.

76
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,120
Quickly.

77
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,320
Your Highness,

78
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,640
since you know everything,

79
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,320
we're now family.

80
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,040
Please, take a seat.

81
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,640
Madam Hua, I came this time to...

82
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,680
Your Highness,

83
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,400
if you have something to say,
just say it.

84
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Since you know Xiyu is a woman,

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,040
I came to...

86
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,400
Don't try to extort the Hua family.

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:15,920
You...

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,880
Mother!

89
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
Mother, what are you doing?

90
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,240
How come you're not out?

91
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,880
The pot is dented.

92
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,080
He is a martial arts expert
with profound internal strength.

93
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,020
Why didn't you tell me?

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,280
You didn't ask.

95
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,600
Madam Hua, what are you trying to do?

96
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,760
Don't harm Xiyu.

97
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,760
It's all my fault.

98
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,520
Please don't do this.

99
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,640
It's alright.

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
Since you know Xiyu's secret,

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,160
I should listen to you
and fulfill your wishes.

102
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,640
But I was blinded and even hit you.

103
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,160
Does it hurt? Should I rub it for you?

104
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,840
It doesn't hurt.

105
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,680
It's all my fault.

106
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,960
- I'll make amends.
- No...

107
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,780
- No need.
- You...

108
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Please, let Xiyu go.

109
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,760
As long as you let Xiyu go,

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,440
I'll give you anything you want.

111
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,640
Mom, he won't let me go.

112
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,600
- What?
- He wants me!

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,880
You beast!

114
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,800
How dare you use such despicable methods

115
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,840
to take my daughter!

116
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,360
No, no.

117
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,840
- I didn't...
- I'll kill you!

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,980
That's not what I meant.

119
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
- Mother!
- I'll kill you!

120
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,760
- Mother!
- Madam Hua!

121
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,960
You beast!

122
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,380
Madam Hua!

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,080
Enough!

124
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,080
You're dead!

125
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm the one who proposed the marriage.

126
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,520
Proposal?

127
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,720
The pot is already dented.

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
Why didn't you fight back earlier?

129
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,040
I couldn't.

130
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,280
Even if auntie hits me,

131
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,540
I'll still respect and love her.

132
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Your face is scratched.

133
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,800
It must hurt.

134
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,000
It doesn't hurt.

135
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,920
Your Highness,

136
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,120
I was a bit reckless today.

137
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,440
No, it's my fault.

138
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,720
I didn't explain clearly,

139
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,800
which led to this.

140
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,960
Actually, this is Xiyu's fault.

141
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,720
She was stammering

142
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,800
and trembling behind the curtain.

143
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,720
I thought she was being coerced.

144
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,120
Trembling and stammering?

145
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
I was just shy.

146
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,760
Since I gave birth to you,

147
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
I've never seen you shy.

148
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,680
It's my lack of experience.

149
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,920
I didn't notice it.

150
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,560
Who made me dress as a man?

151
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,360
- You...
- Xiyu!

152
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,960
Don't talk to auntie like that.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,080
She raised you with great difficulty.

154
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,000
Listen to him.

155
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,520
Learn more from Xuanzhou.

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
Xuanzhou, Xiyu is immature.

157
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,640
Please teach her

158
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,120
how to be filial to elders.

159
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
Yes, since you've entrusted Xiyu to me,

160
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,160
I'll do my best.

161
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,440
(When did I entrust Xiyu to him?)

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,080
(The proposal was done very quickly.)

163
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,290
(Gift List)
Madam, here.

164
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
I only have one daughter.

165
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,750
I can't bear to part with her.

166
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,120
Ning

167
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,560
is too far away.

168
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,800
There's no need to part.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Xiyu is filial and will take care of you
for a lifetime.

170
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
As for staying in Yan or moving to Ning,

171
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,240
it's up to you.

172
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,320
Though you're very thoughtful,

173
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,120
still...

174
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,960
How did your hand get injured?

175
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,320
Mother, your nails are too sharp.

176
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,720
Let me see.

177
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
You're on his side?

178
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,800
In our family, we only focus on talent

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,320
when selecting a husband,

180
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
not on these things.

181
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,500
(Bracelet, Necklace, Earrings,
Ring, Accessory)

182
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,640
Ning Xuanzhou,

183
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,160
what do you take me for?

184
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,480
We have a long history
of serving as officials

185
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,800
and value reputation.

186
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,920
For such a major matter as marriage,

187
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,360
presenting the list

188
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,400
of betrothal gifts without my permission

189
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,380
is highly inappropriate.

190
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,480
You have no manners.

191
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,760
Auntie, you get me wrong.

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
This is just a small gesture

193
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,240
of respect on my first visit.

194
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,240
This...

195
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,120
This is just a small gesture?

196
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,840
Upon the next visit,

197
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,720
I'll present my full heart and effort.

198
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,160
Well...

199
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,840
It's settled.

200
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,520
It's settled?

201
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,960
Since he'll present his full heart,

202
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,160
it must be a good match.

203
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,840
Where did you find such a good man?

204
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,200
I mean,

205
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,120
since he's full-hearted,

206
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,280
it must be a good match.

207
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,360
Come, Xuanzhou. I'll pour you some wine.

208
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,600
Today, let's have a few drinks.

209
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,400
Thank you.

210
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,840
When Xiyu turns 20,

211
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,440
I'll say she's going elsewhere
to study.

212
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
By then,

213
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,720
you can take her wherever you like.

214
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Auntie, Xiyu said

215
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,440
she dressed as a man
not for the family inheritance,

216
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
but to get Blood Coral

217
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,090
and solve the mystery
of her dad's death.

218
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,800
Now that it's confirmed

219
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,400
there are no secrets in Blood Coral,

220
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,000
why not tell the truth

221
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,000
and let Xiyu reveal her identity?

222
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,320
You foolish girl, you even
told him that?

223
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,600
I...

224
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,880
Be careful with your hand.

225
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,360
Such delicate limbs...

226
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,040
You're very thoughtful.

227
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,760
Madam, you worked hard raising her,

228
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,320
so I'll cherish her dearly.

229
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,920
Regarding Xiyu dressing as a man,

230
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,320
it's all my fault for being foolish.

231
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,360
I regret it deeply now.

232
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
After Xiyu's dad died,

233
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,160
her uncle took great care of us

234
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
and treated Xiyu as his own.

235
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,240
If he had known we deceived him
for 18 years...

236
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Mother is afraid if my uncle discovered it,

237
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
we wouldn't be able to face him.

238
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm not targeting your uncle.

239
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,320
I couldn't tell anyone

240
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,520
about your father's final words.

241
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,190
When Marquis Wen visited me that night,

242
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,280
I didn't reveal a single word.

243
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,400
Marquis Wen?

244
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,880
So, he came the night before he died

245
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,800
not to see Chancellor Hua,
but to see you?

246
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,120
Yes.

247
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,760
Why did he come to see you?

248
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,560
He said he felt your father's death

249
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,840
was suspicious.

250
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,720
He asked if your father

251
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,680
left any final words or items

252
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,360
and whether there had been
any unusual occurrences over the years.

253
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,240
Did you know Marquis Wen well?

254
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,400
I met him twice at court banquets.

255
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,760
We were only acquaintances, not close.

256
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,200
Marquis Wen and your father
had always been at odds politically.

257
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,440
I was surprised by his sudden visit.

258
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,960
So,

259
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,040
despite his earnestness,

260
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,920
I said nothing.

261
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,160
I didn't expect he'd die just like that.
