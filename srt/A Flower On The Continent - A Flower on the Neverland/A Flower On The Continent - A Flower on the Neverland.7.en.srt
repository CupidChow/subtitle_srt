=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,840
I...

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,240
I'm not doing this for the inheritance.

5
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,480
I'm doing it for Blood Coral.

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,200
Yes,

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,880
Blood Coral.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,680
You don't care about anything.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,560
You only care about Blood Coral.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,880
In your eyes,

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,040
neither I nor my father is more important
than Blood Coral.

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,680
You...

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,960
That day, your father

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
died in front of me.

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
The last words he said

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,920
were Blood Coral.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,160
All these years, I've always thought,

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,320
perhaps by obtaining Blood Coral,

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,360
I could understand

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,000
why your father died.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,800
Mother,

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,880
why didn't you

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,760
tell me this earlier?

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Your father was upright all his life.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,600
Who knows how many people
he offended?

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,200
The Hua family has high walls
and guards,

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
yet assassins still managed
to sneak in and kill him.

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,280
This shows how powerful and ruthless
his enemies were.

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
Moreover,

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,600
I had to guard against spies
within our family.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,160
It's not that I didn't tell you.

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
I didn't tell anyone.

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,360
Firstly,

34
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,680
I didn't know who I could trust.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Secondly, if the secret
within Blood Coral

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
caused your father's death,

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,600
then telling anyone

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,200
could put them in danger.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,720
Not even my uncle knows?

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,840
Blood Coral

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,080
is hidden in your uncle's
treasure vault.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,000
If I could explain everything to him,

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,240
I'd have asked him to take it out
long ago to find out the truth.

44
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
You wouldn't have had
to disguise as a man

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,160
to inherit the family

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
in order to obtain the heirloom.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
Xiyu,

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
it's my fault.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,280
All these years,

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,080
I was only concerned
with your father's death.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,160
I always thought you could endure
for a few more years.

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
I neglected

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,600
how difficult and depressing
it must've been for you

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,000
to disguise yourself as a man

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,360
for so long.

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
Mother, don't be like this.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
It's my fault for making you angry.

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,960
But there's something I need to say,

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
though I'm afraid it'll upset you.

61
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
Go ahead.

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,320
Mother,

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,080
you need to change your habit
of hiding things.

64
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,680
It delays important matters.

65
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,880
If I knew you weren't
after the inheritance,

66
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
but wanted to uncover the truth

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,200
about father's death,

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,690
I'd have helped you find out long ago.

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,280
How would we find out?

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,400
Mother,

71
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,680
to get Blood Coral,

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,280
I don't need to become the head.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,400
I can steal it.

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,880
Steal?

75
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,780
Your Highness,

76
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,580
we found Marquis Wen
visited the Hua family

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,760
before his departure.

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,360
The Hua family?

79
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,440
Yes,

80
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,520
he went incognito, very discreetly.

81
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Few people knew,

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,270
so it took a while to find out.

83
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,720
The Fragrance Teahouse
where they hid the firearms

84
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,280
also belongs to the Hua family.

85
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,720
The Hua family must be

86
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,920
involved in this matter somehow.

87
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,120
Let's visit tonight

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,720
to investigate.

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Yes.

90
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Mrs. Hua.

91
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,840
Uncle.

92
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,600
You're very fast.

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,320
Come in, Uncle.

94
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,760
Alright.

95
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
You're very kind.

96
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,160
You work so hard for the Hua family.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,840
What's a few dishes?

98
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,640
Uncle, please sit here.

99
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,440
Yes,

100
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,480
please sit.

101
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,960
Alright.

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,880
Mrs. Hua, sit.

103
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,200
Uncle, I'll get some good wine for you.

104
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,080
Xiyu is becoming more considerate.

105
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,680
Yes.

106
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,640
How have you been lately?

107
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,760
He's asleep?

108
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,600
They say my uncle
manages the family well,

109
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,600
but he's not very good
at disciplining servants.

110
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,200
Mom only mentioned there's
a hidden mechanism in the study

111
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
and it's well concealed.

112
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,360
How can I find it
with such vague information?

113
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,720
Is this well concealed?

114
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
Dad was indeed upright.

115
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
He didn't know how to hide things.

116
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,520
Thank you.

117
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,440
With your martial skills,

118
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,520
you could easily kill me.

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,480
But you took the effort
to cover my eyes,

120
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
which shows your kindness

121
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,360
in not wanting to kill me.

122
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,440
Only by not seeing your face
can I stay alive.

123
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,920
(She thinks I'm a thief.)

124
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
Alive? You're stopping me from obtaining wealth!

125
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,680
No.

126
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm not after wealth.

127
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,760
You want wealth.

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,240
I want a tree.

129
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,440
We're like-minded.

130
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,440
How about you let me go?

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,160
We each get what we want

132
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
without interfering with each other.

133
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,760
How about it?

134
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,560
We're on the same side.

135
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,680
I promise not to betray you.

136
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,400
Besides,

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
you can't cover my eyes forever.

138
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,000
There are so many treasures
waiting for you.

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,960
Choose whatever you like, brother.

140
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,520
(Luckily, I reacted quickly.)

141
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,280
(Otherwise, he'd have killed me.)

142
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,320
(My intrusion is an internal conflict,)

143
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,300
(but your intrusion
is an external threat.)

144
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,880
(It must be prioritized.)

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,600
(I need to deal with you
before obtaining Blood Coral.)

146
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,150
(I could tell instantly
you want to escape.)

147
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
(If I were a real thief,)

148
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,720
(how would you escape?)

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,360
Someone, catch the thief!

150
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,640
Who's there?

151
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,240
Kid,

152
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,680
I'll remember you.

153
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,880
This thief broke in so easily.

154
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Xiyu,

155
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,040
why are you here?

156
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,480
Uncle, Blood Coral isn't safe here.

157
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,000
You should let me take care of it.

158
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,440
Xiyu, I have no children.

159
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,880
The Hua family will be yours soon.

160
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,320
What, you don't trust your uncle?

161
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,400
It's not that...

162
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,440
I swear to the heavens,

163
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,920
when you turn 20,

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,820
I'll give you everything
that should be yours.

165
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,840
Is that enough?

166
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
Alright, as you say.

167
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,800
Xiyu, don't go any further.

168
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,120
Blood Coral is in there, isn't it?

169
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,360
I'm curious to see it.

170
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,280
In a few years, it'll all be yours.

171
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,440
You can see all you want.

172
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,650
- Uncle...
- Now let's go out.

173
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,800
I remember you said
you were going to get wine.

174
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,960
Why are you in the vault?

175
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,920
I...

176
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,600
Alright, go on.

177
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,800
Your mom is waiting.

178
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
Go on.

179
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,240
So rash.

180
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,100
So eager to become
the head of the family.

181
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,760
Your Highness.

182
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,260
A letter from the emperor.

183
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,680
Last night, Your Highness worked hard.

184
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,840
Unfortunately, it was in vain.

185
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,280
Not finding evidence
doesn't mean it was in vain.

186
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,180
I intentionally left something behind
before I left.

187
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,280
The note reads there are firearms
in Fragrance Teahouse

188
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
to harm students from the academy.

189
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,200
What a clever move.

190
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,640
If Chancellor Hua is upright,

191
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,280
he'll report this matter.

192
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,280
Yan will also be wary
of the Tu Mountain Clan.

193
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,040
If he remains silent,

194
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
then he's hiding something.

195
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,360
Stop following me.

196
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm protecting you.

197
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,840
You ruined that thief's plan last night.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
What if he seeks revenge?

199
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,840
Let him come. I want to catch him.

200
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,680
Don't follow me.

201
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,690
Otherwise, he won't come.

202
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,000
Xuan.

203
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,400
Let's go to the academy.

204
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,680
Let's go.

205
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,680
The two just had a fallout days ago.

206
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,200
How are they back together?

207
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,520
No way.

208
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,480
I can't let him keep clinging to Xiyu.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Why didn't you wait for me?

210
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,000
You didn't return to the dorm.

211
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,600
I thought you'd take the day off.

212
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
Come on.

213
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Speaking of last night,

214
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
my house was robbed.

215
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,440
I had a good fight with that thief.

216
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,680
What do you think of
his martial arts skills?

217
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Not bad,

218
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,000
but he wasn't very smart.

219
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,360
One casual remark from me

220
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,080
made him let his guard down. Very silly.

221
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,400
His lowered guard

222
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,400
might mean he was kind-hearted
and spared you.

223
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,480
How could that be?

224
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
He was still menacing

225
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,400
when he left.

226
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,280
Brat, I'll remember you.

227
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,240
Remembering you

228
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,840
could indicate

229
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
some sort of affection.

230
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,280
What affection?

231
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,520
He was menacing.

232
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,400
Menacing?

233
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,400
Yes, although I didn't see his face,

234
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,440
I touched it.

235
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,280
You want wealth.

236
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,400
I want a tree.

237
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,040
We're like-minded.

238
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
Tense and trembling,

239
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,720
like this.

240
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,600
See, isn't this menacing?

241
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
You even touched his face?

242
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
Maybe he was

243
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
embarrassed.

244
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,240
Embarrassed?

245
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,000
You mean he's embarrassed?

246
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
What's so funny?

247
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,800
You...

248
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,000
Your words are quite funny.

249
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
You don't think so?

250
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,040
I don't.

251
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,600
Don't go.

252
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,800
Why are you angry?

253
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,960
You keep defending that thief.

254
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm not even mad.

255
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,680
I...I lost my brush.

256
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,480
Master is here.

257
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,190
- Greetings, Master.
- Greetings, Master.

258
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,680
Sit.

259
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,840
Alright.

260
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,960
Everyone, turn in your assignment.

261
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Oh no, I was busy all night

262
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,600
and forgot to write my assignment.

263
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,040
Master, here you go.

264
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,640
Master.

265
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,400
Xiyu,

266
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
did you forget again?

267
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,600
I didn't.

268
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,800
Turn it in then.

269
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,400
Yes.

270
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,080
Where's your name?

271
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,560
Right.

272
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,640
Master, take a look.

273
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,400
Ning Xuanzhou

274
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,600
was very careful.

275
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,920
Put it down.

276
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,600
I...

277
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Sit.

278
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,360
Yes.

279
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,200
That's indeed good handwriting.

280
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,400
Alright, everyone,

281
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,280
review the content I taught you.

282
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,600
Review the content I taught you.

283
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Yes.

284
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,960
I really don't know
what you all are doing.

285
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,080
I found it.

286
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,640
Thank you.

287
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
Where's my assignment book?

288
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,000
I turned it in.

289
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,040
You did?

290
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,360
With your name on it.

291
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,270
I turned it in for you.

292
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,040
I was supposed to turn that in.

293
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,200
But I meant the other book.

294
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,440
I borrowed it to turn it in.

295
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,600
You borrowed it?

296
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,000
Isn't it just an empty book?

297
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,760
I'll buy you a new one after class.

298
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
We're brothers. Help me out.

299
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,320
Sit down.

300
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,590
- Greeting, Master.
- Greeting, Master.

301
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,240
The sage said,

302
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,720
"Isn't it a pleasure to learn

303
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,480
and practice what's learned?"

304
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,360
(If the teacher sees the empty book,)

305
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,600
(he'll hit me with the ruler.)

306
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,400
Fortunately, I copied one during class.

307
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,560
Master.

308
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,840
