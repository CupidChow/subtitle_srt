00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,420
(Yong'an Academy)

4
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,700
(Yong'an Academy)

5
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,880
Today, I've troubled you young ladies
to come here.

6
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,120
I hope you can forgive me.

7
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,840
It's alright.

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,080
Your Highness, you're too kind.

9
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,720
I understand it's abrupt for me
to make such a request

10
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
to the Yan emperor.

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,760
So I've prepared a little something.

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,840
Please don't mind it.

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Xuan.

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,240
He even knows I like the color red.

16
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,680
(He must have put special effort
into this.)

17
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,160
How does he know I like this style?

18
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,080
He must be showing off
how many spies he has.

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,040
How could he compare to Master Hua
who's more open?

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Shameless, using jewelry to curry favor.

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,360
Exactly. Is being rich so great?

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,480
- Yes.
- Please make way.

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,440
Sorry.

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,040
We weren't peeking on purpose.

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,960
The voice just now sounded familiar.

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,840
Hua...

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
Hua Xiyu?

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
Xiyu?

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,320
Look,

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
this hairpin looks really good on you.

31
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,480
Let me pin it for you.

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,640
How does it look?

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,440
She seems a bit familiar.

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,880
Really?

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
Xuan.

36
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,685
♪Gazing at the returning swallows♪

37
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,660
♪The seasons swiftly come and go♪

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,440
You came.

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,720
I...

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,880
Say whatever you want.

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,080
I'm listening.

42
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,520
Xuanzhou,

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,040
I...

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,960
Let's go.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,240
What are you doing?

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
Let go!

47
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
What are you doing?

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,680
Xiyu, we're also angry
about that guy showing off,

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,680
but what you're doing is too much.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,880
Yes, you like to disguise as a woman.

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,320
It's fine to play around secretly.

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
But this time it's a royal decree.

53
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,080
You can't act recklessly.

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm not disguised as a woman.

55
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,360
Stop hiding.

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,640
We know

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,160
about your little quirk.

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm really a woman.

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,360
Really?

60
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,640
If I'm lying,

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,690
may the heavens strike me.

62
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,280
During the last archery practice,

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,640
I was sweaty

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,000
so I took off my clothes.

65
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,360
You...you saw it.

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,640
So what?

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,840
Oh my, I can't face anyone from now on.

68
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,320
I...

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,960
How can you be a woman?

70
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,920
Usually, we're arm in arm.

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,000
Stop talking.

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,400
When we sunbathed by the river
and picked at our toes,

73
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,640
you really enjoyed it.

74
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,280
Stop talking!

75
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,160
Xiyu.

76
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,360
Xuanzhou, I...

77
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,440
Are you really...

78
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm really...

79
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
The woman I like

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,920
is Hua Xiyu from the Hua family.

81
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,280
How is that possible?

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,720
She looks so much like Hua Xiyu.

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,920
I disagree.

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,760
Mei, you already knew I was a woman.

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,280
But I didn't know you were so ruthless.

86
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,520
You were disguised as a man

87
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,360
and made me fall deeply in love,

88
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,000
deceiving me for so many years.

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,000
I stopped loving you

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,640
and fell in love with someone else.

91
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,080
Now you want to ruin it again.

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,400
I...

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,640
Hey.

94
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,920
I'll kill you.

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
Mei, stop.

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,200
Mei, don't do this. Mei.

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,920
Stop it, Mei.

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,800
Stop fighting.

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
Women fighting is no business of men.

100
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,280
Mei, stop fighting.

101
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,960
- I'll kill you.
- Stop fighting.

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,600
Mei, stop.

103
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,760
Mei, what are you doing?

104
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,640
Control your sister.

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,520
Your sister is crazy.

106
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,000
Mei.

107
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,240
I'm crazy. Leave me alone.

108
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,440
Why do I care about her?

109
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
My own youth is ruined.

110
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,400
You jerk.

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,200
I'll kill you.

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,480
You ruined my youth!

113
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,080
Stop fighting!

114
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,320
Who ruined your youth?

115
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,320
Xiyu is mine.

116
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,200
If it weren't for you...

117
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,640
- What are you doing?
- Xiyu would be mine.

118
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
Mei.

119
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,760
You guys...

120
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,840
Look at

121
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,680
what you've become.

122
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,280
A perfectly good marriage

123
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,640
has now turned into a joke.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,490
It's spreading throughout the capital.

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,640
It won't be long

126
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,840
before it reaches Ning.

127
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,320
You'll be going to Ning to be a consort.

128
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,440
Look at you now.

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,560
And you!

130
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,080
You were so fierce.

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,480
How will your mother find a good match
for you now?

132
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,080
Before the two countries go to war,

133
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,480
you two are already fighting.

134
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,880
I really can't bear to look.

135
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,080
I can't bear to look.

136
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,290
You should handle it yourselves.

137
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,240
You're young and impetuous.

138
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
What's the harm in a little quarrel?

139
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,880
You must be hungry after all this.

140
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,640
Look at your faces.

141
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,480
You're all dirty.

142
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,960
Hurry and clean up.

143
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,360
I've prepared the best tea and snacks

144
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,920
to replenish you.

145
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,280
I'll be waiting.

146
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,680
Xiyu, why are you still
standing there? Hurry up.

147
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
Have a good talk.

148
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,320
I'll go prepare some more snacks.

149
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,880
I can't get over this.

150
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,760
Why not?

151
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,040
I've made mistakes
and deceived many people.

152
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,680
But the only one
I didn't deceive is you.

153
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
I'd rather you deceived me.

154
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,280
Why?

155
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,000
I...

156
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
Knowing you're a woman,

157
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,560
he harbors feelings for you.

158
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,360
Hong Wuhui, I consider you my buddy.

159
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,840
What do you take me for?

160
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
A graceful woman is always the best match.

161
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,280
If you had treated me equally
and deceived me also,

162
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,960
we wouldn't be in this situation today.

163
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,840
- You...
- General Hong, what eloquence.

164
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,720
Shut up.

165
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,960
Alright.

166
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,520
I'll admit half my mistake.

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,680
I'll

168
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
get over it myself.

169
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,790
In the future, we won't be
sworn brothers.

170
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,440
I'll see you as my sister.

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,280
Your sister? Your sister is me.

172
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm still here.

173
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,240
What kind of sister is she?

174
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,560
Hua Xiyu,

175
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll never forgive you.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,800
I'm telling you.

177
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
Mei, it's not that bad.

178
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
It is.

179
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
She's deceived me for so many years

180
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,560
and made me believe
she was a refined gentleman.

181
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
But I said

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
I've always seen you as my sister.

183
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,800
If you really see me as a sister,

184
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,920
knowing I like you,

185
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
you should've told me the truth.

186
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,320
Do you know how dragging this out
has harmed me?

187
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,120
I can't find a good man now.

188
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,560
How will you compensate me?

189
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,520
With this.

190
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,080
Don't think this...

191
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,120
I think the man in this painting
has quite some charm.

192
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,680
Who is this?

193
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,760
My brother.

194
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
The emperor of Ning?

195
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,040
No wonder.

196
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,520
An emperor could also be this handsome?

197
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,960
He's still single.

198
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,880
Xiyu.

199
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Miss Xiyu,

200
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,480
I suddenly feel

201
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,640
you and Prince Ning are a match
made in heaven.

202
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,640
After you get married,

203
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,320
you'll return to Ning
with your husband, right?

204
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,760
I...I should.

205
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,040
You should?

206
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,240
You must return.

207
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,280
As buddies...

208
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,760
No, as besties,

209
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,840
I've decided

210
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,120
go with you to the capital
of Ning in person.

211
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,880
Miss Hong, thank you
for your kind heart.

212
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,560
On behalf of my brother,
I extend a sincere invitation.

213
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,720
You're welcome.

214
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,760
I should call you brother-in-law now.

215
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,040
Brother-in-law,

216
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,600
just call me Mei.

217
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,360
Xiyu and I are besties.

218
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,160
So, in this case,

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,200
isn't your brother

220
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,120
also one of us?

221
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,040
Of course.

222
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,160
After meeting him,
you'll become even closer.

223
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,520
That's wonderful.

224
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,640
Brother-in-law,

225
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,880
here, have some.

226
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,760
Have one.

227
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,520
You got over it so easily?

228
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,840
Getting over what?

229
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,360
This is called a stepping stone.

230
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
Rising step by step.

231
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,120
Every time I meet someone better.

232
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,840
That's how I can live up to my youth.

233
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,480
You've just sold out
your brother like this?

234
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,510
Shadow Guards are adept at espionage,
sowing discord and betrayal.

235
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,120
My brother appointed me as the commander

236
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,680
knowing my expertise in this field.

237
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,240
How could I disappoint
my brother's insight?

238
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,080
Commander Ning, what eloquence.

239
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,880
I have many more advantages.

240
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,920
You'll know in the future.

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,840
Miss Xiyu,

242
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,640
I've heard Chancellor Hua

243
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,480
prepared many beautiful jewelry for you.

244
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Yes, I've also prepared
a lot for myself.

245
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,840
Really? Xiyu.

246
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
You should take me to see them.

247
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,440
I also want beautiful jewelry.

248
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,040
Alright.

249
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,940
If there are pretty ones, give me a few.

250
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,080
No problem.

251
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,440
Let's talk business.

252
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,040
Both our emperors have approved

253
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
our collaboration to investigate this.

254
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,880
I've already investigated the academy.

255
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,560
Besides Tu Wenjue,

256
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,880
there are four other servants

257
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,200
who are from the Tu Mountain Clan.

258
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,880
We have already cleared them out.

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,550
No wonder when I arrived in the capital,

260
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,680
I encountered a man in black
at the Fragrance Teahouse.

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
He chased me all the way to the academy,

262
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,920
probably intending to inform Tu Wenjue,

263
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,560
but I intercepted him halfway.

264
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,720
Before committing suicide,
he activated a mechanism,

265
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,880
causing a fire that burned down
most of the dorm.

266
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,680
The academy dormitory was...

267
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,680
I was wondering

268
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
why you were sharing a room.

269
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,960
What about Tu Wenjue?

270
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
He escaped and we're pursuing him.

271
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,280
What about the item on Marquis Wen?

272
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,080
How did you know there was an item?

273
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,040
How many times do I need to remind you?

274
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,840
I'm the Commander of Shadow Guards.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,480
I'm very capable.

276
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,080
You were pretending
to be pitiful before.

277
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,400
Now that you've got Xiyu,

278
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
you are showing off.

279
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,880
Do you think you're a peacock?

280
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,680
The item.

281
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,360
We thoroughly searched the corpse

282
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,960
and found nothing suspicious,

283
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,120
