00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,120
Xiyu,

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,040
why didn't you tell me?

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,560
Don't you trust me at all

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,120
since you were little?

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,320
Uncle, I'm sorry.

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,200
I thought Blood Coral

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,760
hid the secret of my father's murder.

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,080
In fact, it hid nothing.

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,440
You've always treated me as your own.

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,240
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
Please don't be angry.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
No.

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,600
Come.

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm not angry.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm heartbroken.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,920
Since your father died,

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,480
I've been restless day and night.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,080
So many times I've woken up from dreams,

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,200
hoping your father could talk to me

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,180
like when we were young.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,560
Until today,

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,720
I didn't know his final words.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,440
If I'd known his last wish,

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,480
I'd have given you Blood Coral long ago.

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,000
Xiyu, take it now.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,240
No, uncle.

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,480
Let it remain under your care

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
as per the family rule.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Good,

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,640
good child.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,040
Promise me, in the future,

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,920
you'll speak to me directly
if there's anything on your mind.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,100
Don't keep secrets from me.

36
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,720
We're family.

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,440
Don't become distant.

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,320
Then I want to ask you

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
about Marquis Wen.

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,480
Marquis Wen?

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,600
Why do you ask about him?

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,920
I heard he came to see you
before he left.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,640
No,

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
absolutely not.

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,200
He never came?

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
Never.

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,660
He really didn't come.

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,520
My uncle said Marquis Wen never
visited the Hua Mansion.

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,040
My information can't be wrong. Trust me.

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,280
Why should I trust you?

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,760
You've lied to me

52
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,880
again and again.

53
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,440
I know

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
my uncle also lied to me.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
That night, I saw a man

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,560
with a wide hat enter the Hua Mansion.

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,840
This way, please.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
I only caught a glimpse

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,920
and didn't think much of it.

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,840
After you reminded me,

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,440
I realized

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,360
it was indeed Marquis Wen.

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,040
Could it be Chancellor Hua?

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,280
My uncle isn't like that.

65
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,280
He couldn't have killed Marquis Wen

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
to incite war between us.

67
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,320
But he lied to you.

68
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,480
Didn't you also lie to me?

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,680
Did you really come to Yan

70
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,080
just to investigate Marquis Wen's death

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
and prevent a war?

72
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,840
Indeed.

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,600
I swear by my deceased parents.

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Open your mouth.

75
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm the only one who can detoxify.

76
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,440
If you lie to me again,

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,480
you'll pay dearly.

78
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,880
Understood?

79
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,440
Yes.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Why is the handcuff broken?

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,040
Maybe after drinking
the Soft Bone Powder,

82
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,980
my inner strength raged

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,040
and caused this.

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,280
Commander Ning, you have strong
inner strength, huh?

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
You should sleep with it on.

86
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,640
Xiyu.

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
Xiyu, today's lesson...

88
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,680
Don't get it wrong. We were just
playing around.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,600
We get it.

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
Get what?

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
We'll keep it a secret.

92
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,440
Let's go.

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,320
Come on.

94
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,320
Let's go.

95
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,040
That got a bit intense.

96
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,520
Everyone has their quirks.

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,520
Don't meddle.

98
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Hurry up, let's go.

99
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,560
Do you think they'll misunderstand?

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,200
What are you doing?

101
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,480
The door wasn't closed.

102
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll do it.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
Why are you here now?

104
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Let Ning come to my room instead.

105
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,320
So nosy.

106
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,040
Xiyu, he already knows you're a woman.

107
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,640
What if he doesn't behave at night?

108
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,440
I can't be at ease.

109
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
No need.

110
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,760
Nicely done.

111
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,840
Now you've seen,

112
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,680
you can be at ease.

113
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
You can go back now.

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,120
Xiyu, I...

115
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,430
- I'm going to rest.
- I think...

116
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm going to sleep.

117
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,920
How about...

118
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,240
So rough.

119
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,520
It's so you.

120
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

121
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,440
You have strong inner strength.

122
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
Why are you pretending?

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,120
Sorry

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,000
for disturbing you.

125
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,040
I have inner strength.

126
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,320
I can handle a bit of cold at night.

127
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,720
Go ahead and sleep.

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,600
I locked you up,

129
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,840
but you could still lie down.

130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,280
You have a blanket, don't you?

131
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,240
Don't move.

132
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,960
What kind of commander are you?

133
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
Besides being skilled and deceitful,

134
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,000
what else can you do?

135
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,160
What are you doing?

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,840
What if you get cold?

137
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,600
Just sleep.

138
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,040
If you disturb me again,
I won't forgive you.

139
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,720
(Master, master.)

140
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,720
You just keep coming.

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,640
Is this intentional?

142
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,880
(Master,)

143
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,520
(Mrs. Hua suddenly fell ill.)

144
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
(Chancellor asked you to check on her.)

145
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,680
Xiyu,

146
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,080
you just asked him
about Marquis Wen's visit.

147
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,280
Now he uses your mother as an excuse
to get you back.

148
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,440
It might be dangerous.

149
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,790
You can harm me, but my uncle
never would.

150
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,840
Master.

151
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,800
What happened to my mom?

152
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,270
She was fine during the day
but has vomiting and diarrhea now.

153
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,880
Hurry.

154
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,080
Your Highness,

155
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,640
you've already injured yourself earlier

156
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,190
from neutralizing the powder.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,880
Don't exert yourself.

158
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,800
I'll protect Miss Hua along the way.

159
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,720
Hua Chenghao isn't simple.

160
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
If he targets Xiyu,

161
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,920
he'll likely act decisively.

162
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,560
I must go myself to ensure her safety.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
Your Highness!

164
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,880
Hotpot?

165
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,920
Yes, the doctor said

166
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,200
it was just a stomachache.

167
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
A night of rest will do.

168
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,600
She should eat less oily food.

169
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,080
Mother.

170
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,520
You're back. It hurts.

171
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,260
How could you have hotpot
for a late-night snack?

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
You're greedy.

173
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,720
I've told you so many times.

174
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Your stomach can't handle it.

175
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,080
I was hungry at night

176
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
and wanted a snack.

177
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,000
It's been several days

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,080
and I was craving it.

179
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,720
Xiyu, your mom just got better.

180
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,120
Let her rest.

181
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,840
It's late.

182
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,880
You should stay home.

183
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,030
Don't go back to the academy.

184
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,840
Got it.

185
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,600
Lie down.

186
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,280
It hurts.

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,880
Alright, let me rub it.

188
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,480
Who is it?

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
Master Hua.

190
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,040
Why draw your swords?

191
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,200
There've been thieves.

192
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,480
We must be alert.

193
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,120
Drawing our swords early
makes fighting faster.

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,240
It might hurt the innocent.

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,040
Don't hurt yourself.

196
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,600
You're hurt.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is a secret medicine from Ning.

198
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,120
It stops bleeding

199
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,320
and prevents scarring.

You said you want to prevent the war,

217
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,640
so I temporarily kept you here.

Good day, sir.

223
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,040
Sit.

224
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,600
The emperor decrees,

225
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,310
on the first day of next month,

226
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,880
there will be a Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt
at Luoma Mountain.

227
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
You all must attend.

228
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,880
The academy will have a day off.

229
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
A day off? Great!

230
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,920
Master, the Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt
is an old custom of Chen.

231
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,760
Why does the emperor suddenly want that?

232
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,280
Chen has been a part
of Yan for a century

233
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,320
and completely integrated.

234
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,840
What's Chen's is Yan's.

235
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,240
Yes.

236
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,040
When Marquis Wen was alive,

237
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,040
he mentioned this old custom
to the emperor.

238
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,720
It can both reflect the yin and yang
of heaven and earth

239
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,480
and comfort Marquis Wen's spirit.

240
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,640
That's why the emperor decreed it.

241
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,000
Xiyu, what is Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt?

242
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,000
