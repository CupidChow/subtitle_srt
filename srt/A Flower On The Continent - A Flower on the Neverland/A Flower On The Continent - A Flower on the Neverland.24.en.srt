3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,200
Uncle.

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,800
Uncle.

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,760
Uncle!

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,760
What is it?

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,960
You didn't respond.

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,240
I was lost in thought.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,720
Speaking of which, I wonder,

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,000
any updates on Tu Wenjue?

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,120
Not yet.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,760
The arrangements
for capturing Tu Wenjue...

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,160
As uncle mentioned before,

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,120
someone is handling it.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,220
Just focus on your recovery.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,160
You ask every time.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,960
Aren't you annoying?

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,840
Uncle, we're leaving now.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,760
Hua Chenghao,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,360
eighteen years ago,
the two countries went to war.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
Don't forget what you did.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,120
Your hands aren't clean now.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,440
You need to follow this path to the end.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,760
If not for Ning Xuanzhou,

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
the master wouldn't be dead.

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,560
Hand over Ning Xuanzhou

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,920
and I'll spare you.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
No way.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,160
He's the future husband of Xiyu.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,320
Master,

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
Prince Ning really cares
about Miss Xiyu.

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
I can tell.

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,760
Because of this,

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,880
he often asks about

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,920
our family's matters.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,560
What did he ask?

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,000
Just some old stories,

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
like how the old master
became an official in Yan

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,560
and why the precious Blood Coral

40
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,040
was hidden away.

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Did the old master had
some untold adventure

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,000
when he acquired Blood Coral?

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,760
But I have no idea.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,200
Don't say anything then.

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,760
We don't want people to say
our people are immature.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,800
Yes, Master.

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,840
Get back to work.

48
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
You've seen Ning Xuanzhou's skills.

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,160
If he senses anything,

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,200
do you think he'll let you go?

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,000
We should deal with Ning Xuanzhou

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
before your niece marries him.

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,760
So she won't become a widow.

54
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,620
(Act according to the plan)

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,360
Hua Chenghao agreed.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,040
Chief, does that mean we won't
kill Hua Chenghao?

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,160
That day, Hua Chenghao thought
the master was killed at the border,

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,000
so he set an ambush at Luoma Mountain

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,920
to silence our Tu Mountain Clan.

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,720
He thought by doing so,
no one would know

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,760
he was involved in the incident
18 years ago.

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,460
At the Crown Prince's
centennial memorial,

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
although Ning Xuanzhou

64
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,440
intervened and ruined the plan,

65
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,520
it was Hua Chenghao

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
who personally took the master's life.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,040
He thought I didn't know
because I wasn't there.

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,920
This treacherous, despicable scoundrel.

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,360
Once I've used him
to kill Ning Xuanzhou,

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,920
I'll slowly kill him.

71
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,360
Your Highness,

72
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,720
Chen royals

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,800
indeed had one Blood Coral.

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,600
But when the Crown Prince surrendered,

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,320
many items from the treasure vault

76
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,720
were missing.

77
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,400
The war had just ended

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,720
and it was chaotic.

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,160
No one paid attention to Blood Coral.

80
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,960
However, Xiyu's great-grandfather
was still uneasy,

81
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,160
so he kept Blood Coral hidden,

82
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,960
only showing it
to subsequent family heads.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,840
It seems your deduction was correct.

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,040
Eighteen years ago,
traitors incited the war

85
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,140
between the two countries,
causing countless deaths.

86
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,560
Chancellor Hua must've been involved,

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
but it's unclear what role he played

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,720
or to what extent.

89
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
What do you think?

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
He didn't hesitate to kill Marquis Wen
to silence him.

91
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
Exactly.

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,880
He must've leaked Marquis Wen's route

93
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,840
and also sent the assassin Wu Hao.

94
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,960
He failed the first time

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,240
at the border

96
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,000
but succeeded the second time.

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,800
It seemed like a desperate act,

98
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,720
but the stab was too precise.

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,800
It was one fatal blow.

100
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
Have you found Tu Wenjue?

101
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
Finally, there's some news.

102
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,920
This scoundrel is cunning.

103
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,000
We can't let him escape again.

104
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,760
I'll personally go then.

105
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,560
Understood.

106
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,560
Time for your medicine.

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You're sneaky.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,160
What shady business were you discussing?

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,400
I wasn't avoiding you.

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,240
It was him.

111
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
I don't want him to see you feeding me.

112
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,640
Feeding?

113
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Your hands aren't shaking anymore.

114
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,600
Last time you pulled
the tablecloth so forcefully.

115
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,520
Your hands seemed
even steadier than mine.

116
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,200
Just pulling the tablecloth

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,160
hurt my arm

118
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,000
again.

119
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,040
Look at this.

120
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
You've been pretentious.
Aren't you tired of it?

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,960
I kiss you every day.
Are you tired of it?

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,840
You...

123
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,600
Alright,

124
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,880
I'll feed you.

125
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,890
You're more demanding
than a spoiled princess.

126
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,720
It's hot.

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,120
Blow on it.

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
Not there.

129
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,160
Here. Blow here, it's hot.

130
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,640
Ning Xuanzhou, you're really pushing it.

131
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,160
Do you want a beating?

132
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,920
Be gentle.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,640
It hurts.

134
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
Listen to how loving they are.

135
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,640
I just hope Prince Ning
stays healthy.

136
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,680
Yes,

137
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,000
he should be well-nourished.

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,920
So he can take a beating
and they can have a child sooner.

139
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,000
Quick,

140
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,040
bring out all the good ginseng we have.

141
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes.

142
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,480
Let's go.

143
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,160
Let me go.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,680
No.

145
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,080
If I let go, you'll hit me.

146
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,040
Hit you?

147
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
With your martial skills,

148
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,000
you can subdue me with one finger.

149
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,240
I wouldn't dare.

150
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,120
Be good and take your medicine.

151
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,320
Xiyu, in a few days, I need to go out.

152
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,880
Where to?

153
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,360
You're not fully recovered.

154
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,800
Don't take the risk.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,960
Don't worry.

156
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
It's a minor matter.

157
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,520
Just something my brother
asked me to handle,

158
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,840
so I have to make an appearance.

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
Xiyu,

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,960
after I deal with the matters at hand,

161
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,720
I'll take you and your mother to Ning.

162
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
I've already made arrangements

163
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,920
to ensure you both live comfortably.

164
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,240
As for Yan,

165
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
we won't concern ourselves
with it anymore.

166
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,920
How does that sound?

167
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,800
That won't do.

168
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,920
Though mother will follow me to Ning,

169
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,360
my uncle will remain in Yan.

170
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,320
I must visit him often.

171
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you unhappy?

172
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,440
No.

173
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,360
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

174
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,560
Finish your tasks and come back soon.

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,240
Mother said she has prepared ginseng soup
for you at home.

176
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,400
Alright, stay home while I'm gone.

177
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,560
You can go on business

178
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,640
but I can't go out for fun?

179
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,760
Since you sold your brother out
to Mei,

180
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,920
she's been very warm to me.

181
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,560
Today she even invited me to her place.

182
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,200
I'll go once I change my clothes.

183
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,200
Alright, have fun.

184
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,200
Your Highness.

185
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
If Xiyu goes out,

186
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,960
follow her and protect her.

187
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,960
Yes.

188
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,960
Uncle.

189
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,000
Xiyu, are you going out?

190
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,520
Mei invited me over.

191
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,600
No rush.

192
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,200
Help me with something first.

193
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
I have an old friend

194
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,520
from Cangnan

195
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,520
who sent a letter this morning.

196
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,400
But it's written in Cangnan language.

197
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,320
I remember you studied it.

198
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
I learned a bit from mother.

199
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
But isn't the messenger from Cangnan?

200
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
You could have him read it to you.

201
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,680
The letter came unexpectedly
and in a rarely used language.

202
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,560
It might contain private matters

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,260
that I can't let outsiders know.

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
I need someone trustworthy to help.

205
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,840
Then let me take a look.

206
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,400
Alright.

207
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,160
Uncle,

208
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,600
it seems your friend is in trouble.

209
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Really?

210
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,960
Read it to me.

211
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,120
What does it say?

212
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,960
It says, "I'm in trouble,

213
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,800
situation

214
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,200
is critical..."

215
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,360
Uncle, I don't know
the language well either.

216
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,160
You should have my mother read it to you.

217
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,640
Your mother went out.

218
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,840
She said the ginseng at home
wasn't good enough

219
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
and went to buy better ones

220
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
from outside the city.

221
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,680
Who knows when she'll be back.

222
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,640
Since

223
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,200
you're here,

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,500
just translate and write it down.

225
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,040
I'll look at it later.

226
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,400
Fine.

227
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,320
Alright.

228
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
I'll be right back.

229
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,800
Take your time, Uncle.

230
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,200
Chancellor, you were right.

231
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,520
He had other plans.

232
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,440
He sent men to watch Xiyu,
even though he went out himself.

233
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,560
This shows while he appears kind
to Xiyu,

234
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,720
he's actually cautious.

235
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,600
If that's the case,

236
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,720
don't blame me then.

237
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,320
Go, deal with him.

238
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,080
Yes.

239
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,160
Uncle.

240
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,320
Uncle.

241
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,920
Here.

242
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,040
What happened to you?

243
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,520
Nothing.

244
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,640
I just twisted my ankle.

245
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,440
I'll help you up.

246
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
Careful.

247
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,680
Be careful.

248
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,240
Alright.

249
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Sit down.

250
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm getting old...

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,950
What's the matter, Xiyu?

252
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,800
The paper I just translated is missing.

253
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,920
Missing?

254
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,160
Did the wind blow it away?

255
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,160
Wind?

256
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,640
It's just a piece of paper.

257
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,590
You translated it earlier, right?

258
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,520
You should remember it.

259
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Just tell me.

260
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,520
Stop looking.

261
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,520
You're as stubborn as your dad.

262
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,960
If you can't find it,

263
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,840
forget it.

264
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,200
Wait, uncle.

265
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,960
Something's off.

266
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,760
There isn't much wind today.

267
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,960
I was only away for a motherent.

268
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
How could it be blown away
so conveniently?

269
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,800
Even if it was blown away,

270
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,290
it should still be in this yard.

271
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
How can it be missing?

272
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,760
Could someone have stolen it?

273
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,760
Stolen it?

274
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,920
Who would steal a piece of paper?

275
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Silly child.

276
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,960
After everything
that's happened recently,

277
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,800
I'm becoming paranoid.
