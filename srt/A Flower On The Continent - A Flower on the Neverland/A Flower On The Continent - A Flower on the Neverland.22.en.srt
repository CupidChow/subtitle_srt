=Episode 22=

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,200
Just take a look.

4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,360
Don't have any bad ideas.

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,520
Try not to open this window
in the future.

6
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,080
If there's someone on the wall outside,

7
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,880
they can see everything inside
through this window.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,440
This window is fine.

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,730
It's not easy to peep through it.

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,960
Hang a piece of silk on it

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,840
attached to the back

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,280
and tie a bell to the outside.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,600
If someone breaks in,

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,680
pull it and the bell will ring.

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,240
It makes it easy to call for help.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,160
You insisted on coming in

17
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,880
just to teach me to guard
against thieves?

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,440
Guarding against thieves is secondary.

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,560
The main reason is to understand
your preferences.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,720
Preferences?

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,400
If I don't know your preferences,

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,600
how will I arrange our house?

23
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,480
If the house isn't arranged
to your liking,

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,520
you'll cuff me to the bed again.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Actually, I don't mind being
cuffed to the bed,

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,920
but the wedding night would be wasted.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,840
I didn't.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,480
You cuffed yourself to the bed.

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,960
You did it.

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,080
No, I helped you open it

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
and gave you the key.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,480
You brought the handcuffs over.

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,680
It all started with you.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,720
It's been so long.

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,680
Why bring it up...

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
Because at that time,
I wanted to kiss you.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,480
When you had the key in your mouth?

38
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,480
Even if I had thorns in my mouth,

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,520
I wanted to kiss and hold you,
to the point of madness.

I said, just take a look.

46

Don't have any bad ideas.

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,480
Alright, I'll listen to you next time.

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,640
If you don't ask,

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,520
I'll stand straight.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,960
No need to be so serious.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,360
You're so bad.

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,920
By the way, Xiyu, there's something
I don't want to hide from you.

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
This piece of Blood Coral was found
on Marquis Wen.

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,480
He carried it closely,

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,520
so it must be important.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,600
Blood Coral?

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
This is related
to our Hua family's heirloom?

58
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,040
It's hard to say.
Although Blood Coral is rare,

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,480
what you have is not the only one.

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
I want to see your piece again

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,840
and compare it with this one.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,320
What direction is that?

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
That's the Clove Garden.

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,320
Clove Garden?

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,440
Blood Coral is still there.

66
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,640
Let's go see it.

67
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,720
Here, this way.

68
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,360
Coming.

69
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,400
Just a couple more times.

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,080
Uncle.

71
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,800
Wait.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Xiyu,

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,240
don't go in.

74
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,360
It's too dangerous inside.

75
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,880
Since it's destroyed, so be it.

76
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,400
Over here.

77
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Everything's destroyed?

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,880
A thief snuck in

79
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,960
and blew up Blood Coral with firearms.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
It's gone.

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
This was passed down by the old master.

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,560
It's gone?

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,680
Firearms? It must be
the Tu Mountain Clan.

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,990
Their chief, Tu Wenjue,
is still on the run.

85
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,110
He's likely seeking revenge
on the Hua family.

86
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,280
Xuanzhou, you're still injured.

87
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,280
Don't exert yourself.

88
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,680
Leave this matter to me.

89
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,520
I'll report to the emperor tomorrow,

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,280
requesting more men to search
for Tu Mountain remnants.

91
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Xiyu,

92
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,280
take good care of Xuanzhou.

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,760
Sure, uncle.

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,200
Losing the heirloom

95
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,280
upset you?

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,520
I just feel so foolish.

97
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,400
Mother said,

98
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,200
dad mentioned Blood Coral
in his last words.

99
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,680
I thought it was the one at home.

100
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,520
But what if he was

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,560
referring to the one on Marquis Wen?

102
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
You little brat,

103
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,990
not knowing when to stop
just like your dad.

104
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,480
- What did you do to my dad?
- Xiyu!

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
Marquis Wen's words that day implied

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,240
he was involved in your dad's death.

107
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,880
Yan and Ning were once suspicious of
each other. My dad tried to prevent war.

108
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,560
He probably sensed
Marquis Wen's conspiracy.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,240
Marquis Wen feared exposure

110
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
and killed my dad.

111
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Perhaps when he attacked my dad,

112
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,720
he had Blood Coral with him

113
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,320
and my dad saw it.

114
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,280
That's why he left the words

115
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
"Blood Coral" before he died.

116
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
So Marquis Wen came to see
your mother before he left

117
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,880
because he felt guilty.

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,280
He wanted to provoke a war between us

119
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,480
but feared my dad
had left something behind

120
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,680
or some evidence.

121
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,480
So he came to ask my mother.

122
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,920
Luckily, my mother was cautious

123
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,840
and said nothing.

124
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,360
Otherwise, he might have...

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,840
Don't be afraid.

126
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,040
As long as I'm here,
there's nothing to fear.

127
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,440
When I was disguised as a man,
I thought I was miserable.

128
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,720
Now, looking back,

129
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,640
those were the most carefree times.

130
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,760
Now I only see the treachery
of human hearts,

131
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,960
full of deceit.

132
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,480
I just hope all these troubles will end

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
and never happen again.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,320
Xiyu, it's all over now.

135
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,880
As long as I'm here,

136
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,360
only good things will happen,

137
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,760
no bad ones.

138
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,520
Oh no,

139
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,680
I spoke too soon.

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,320
There's one more bad thing.

141
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,880
What is it?

142
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,960
The wound is starting to hurt.

143
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,560
Sit tight.

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,560
I'll go get the doctor.

145
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Why get the doctor?

146
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,680
To check your wound.

147
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I don't need a doctor.

148
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,720
Are you pretending?

149
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Your uncle told you
to take good care of me.

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,640
You promised.

151
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
You said, "sure, uncle."

152
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,840
You're so bad.

153
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
Are you mad?

154
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,480
I need to get you the medicine
to take care of you.

155
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Really,

156
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,880
ever since I met you,
I haven't had a peaceful day.

157
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,040
Are you pretending again?

158
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,980
Time for your medicine.

159
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,280
How embarrassing.

160
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,160
Your hands are fine.

161
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,280
Why ask to be fed?

162
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,480
The wound hasn't healed. My hands shake.

163
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,320
Where's Blood Coral?

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,760
Here it is. Why?

165
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,480
What do you plan to do next?

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,960
Let's not talk about it.

167
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,520
Talking about it will only upset you.

168
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,800
I'll handle the remaining

169
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,720
minor matters.

170
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,200
But you can't leave things unfinished.

171
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,520
Last time, you said

172
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,480
you wanted to compare it with ours.

173
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,120
I wanted to see if the cut matches.

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,840
If it does, it proves

175
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,840
it's a piece taken
from your family's heirloom.

176
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,920
Unfortunately, that Blood Coral
has been destroyed.

177
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,280
It's my fault.

178
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
I was so focused on checking

179
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,880
if it was hiding something.

180
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
I didn't notice

181
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,920
if it was missing a piece.

182
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
It did have a broken piece.

183
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
Do you remember this?

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,960
You're injured.

185
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,080
The color of Blood Coral makes the break

186
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,240
easy to miss without close inspection.

187
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,890
I only noticed because I got cut
and looked closely.

188
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
It did have

189
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
a sharp break which could hurt someone.

190
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,800
But I'm not sure

191
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,760
if this is the missing piece.

192
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,640
Stop thinking about it.
The big piece is gone.

193
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,960
Why bother with the small one?

194
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,240
It's gone.

195
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,440
The medicine is bitter.

196
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,280
I'd like something sweet.

197
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,280
You want medicine and sweets?

198
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,080
Are you treating me like a maid?

199
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm a patient now.

200
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
You're really pushing it.

201
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,460
(Hua Mansion)

202
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,360
Xiyu,

203
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,880
now you're not a man.

204
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,280
A lady should be more reserved.

205
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,400
Xuanzhou, you're injured.

206
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
You can't drink wine. Have some soup.

207
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,920
Yes.

208
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,040
Xuanzhou,

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
Xiyu has always been

210
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
different from other girls.

211
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
You know that.

212
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,480
In the future, you should let her
have her way.

213
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,640
Let her have her way? I can't do that.

214
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,000
Auntie, you should tell her
to let me have my way.

215
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,040
In the academy,

216
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
she made me sleep on the floor.

217
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Really?

218
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,920
Indeed, it's understandable
because of propriety

219
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,320
between men and women.

220
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,280
But later, she went further

221
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,920
and shackled my hands and feet.

222
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Shackled?

223
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,120
Ask her then.

224
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,040
You really did that?

225
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,960
I did it because...

226
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,520
Auntie, you see? She admits it.

227
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,960
- Ning Xuanzhou, you want a beating?
- Madam, help me.

228
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,280
- You earned it.
- You girl.

229
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,800
Come here.

230
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,160
Follow me.

231
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,720
Mother.

232
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,320
Mother.

233
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,420
No need to say. Just listen.

234
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,600
Knowing you're so capable,

235
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,720
I'm relieved.

236
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
I was worried about you

237
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,120
marrying so far away to Ning.

238
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,760
But now

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,120
I see you've trained him well.

240
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,240
I can finally relax.

241
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,160
Xiyu's dad,

242
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,120
rest assured.

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,720
Heaven has given our daughter

244
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
a good match.

245
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,040
I'm satisfied

246
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,680
with our future

247
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,920
son-in-law.

248
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,800
In the future, when you hit him,
don't hold back.

249
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,240
Since you're going to be a couple,

250
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,720
you must consider long-term stability.

251
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,400
You need to make him maintain

252
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,800
a sense of awe toward you.

253
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,000
No, a sense of respect to you.

254
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,200
If he dares to stray

255
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,520
or be disloyal,

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,480
you must teach him a lesson.

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,600
Mother,

258
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,440
did you treat dad this way?

259
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,640
What are you saying?

260
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,720
I only tugged his ear a bit.

261
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,720
Not like you,

262
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,280
using shackles on him.

263
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,760
I didn't! I just...

264
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,520
Alright.

265
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Since my daughter isn't mistreated,
it's fine.

266
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,800
As for the future son-in-law...

267
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,440
If you ever mistreat Xuanzhou,

268
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,240
I trust you'll be firm.

269
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,960
I won't let you off!
