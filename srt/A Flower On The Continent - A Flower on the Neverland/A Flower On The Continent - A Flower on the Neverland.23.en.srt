00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,360
Xuanzhou,

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,480
just now, I've

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,040
reprimanded Xiyu for you.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,080
Thank you for upholding justice.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,160
By the way, auntie,

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,880
my brother wrote to say
once my injury is healed,

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,960
he wants me to take Xiyu
back to Ning to visit him.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,080
But Xiyu said you're worried
about her traveling far.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,640
What's there to worry about?

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm very reassured.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,680
Thank you, auntie.

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,080
Also,

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,040
the doctor said for a good recovery,

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,280
I should go out for walks.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,440
Xiyu and I wanted to stroll around town,

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,120
but she said

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,360
you might not feel at ease
if we go together.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,280
No problem at all.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,290
You can take a beating...

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,120
No, I mean, you're
so accommodating to Xiyu.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
I have absolutely no worries.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Xiyu,

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,480
after lunch,

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,200
take Xuanzhou for a walk in town.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,480
Alright.

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,720
Mother, you've said so much,

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,990
your throat must be dry.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,800
Have some water to moisten it.

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,240
If he dares to look at other girls
on the way,

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,280
don't go easy on him.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,310
Establish your authority.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,760
This soup is delicious, right?

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
Very.

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:02:00,000
(Hua Mansion)

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
I knew your mother would let you out.

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,120
Do you know

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,880
what my mother pulled me aside
to say just now?

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,480
To not go easy on me if I misbehave.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,120
You eavesdrop?

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,280
No.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,780
It's just that my hearing
is sharper than others.

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,920
Now my mother got it all wrong.

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,080
It's alright, as long as
auntie trusts me.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,680
I'll accept being called "henpecked."

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,280
It's no big deal.

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,960
Wait a minute.

49
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
I've never bullied you,

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,480
but got called a "tigress."

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,920
It's me who's been wronged.

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,600
And you dare to play the victim?

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,360
Being so fierce,
she might not get the best reputation.

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Reputation?

56
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,080
Her reputation couldn't be
worse already.

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,240
The girl who pretended to be a boy,

58
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,840
it's a sensation outside.

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,040
Since it's like this,

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,360
I'll just let my daughter
live happily however she wants.

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,040
Those people can gossip
whatever they want.

62
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,380
Isn't this the one who pretended
to be a man for 18 years?

63
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,440
Yes.

64
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,240
It's her. She's so wild,

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,560
yet there's a man who wants her.

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,640
Look at her, walking so boldly.

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,080
Does she even look like a girl?

68
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,960
I heard there was a big fight
in the academy because of her.

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,520
How does she still dare to go out?

70
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,680
Exactly.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,680
Let's go back.

72
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,120
What's wrong?

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,760
In their eyes, I must be a freak,

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
neither man nor woman.

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
In their eyes,

76
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,800
you're the most beautiful,
most enviable

77
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,560
and happiest woman in the world.

78
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,760
I want all the wine here.

79
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,280
No need to pay this much.

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
My fiancée loves drinking.

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,680
As long as it pleases her,

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,840
I don't mind the cost.

83
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,840
Send the wine to the Hua mansion,

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,280
not a single jar less.

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,840
Understood.

86
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,120
Sorry.

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,680
Please come back tomorrow.

88
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
So snobbish.

89
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,160
Sorry.

90
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,520
Someone, take all this wine
to the Hua mansion.

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,840
Master, do I send these to the Hua Mansion?

92
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,520
With Xiyu's noble status,

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
she only deserves the best jewelry.

94
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,160
How could she fancy these?

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,160
Don't say that.

96
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,680
There are delicate things
among the common goods.

97
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,520
Sometimes I want to buy them.

98
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,440
I didn't think it through.

99
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,680
Pick whatever you like.

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,280
Careful not to prick yourself. Let me.

101
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,320
So beautiful.

102
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
Send all your best jewelry

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,080
to the Hua mansion.

104
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,160
Alright.

105
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,880
Let's go.

106
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
Come check us out. Don't miss out.

107
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,280
Come and taste our good wine.

108
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,600
Pick two for me.

109
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,640
No need to pick.

110
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,887
♪Just seeing flowers bloom and fall
in the courtyard♪

111
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:58,953
♪Like a love poem, endlessly extending♪

112
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,600
They're all yours.

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Not going to pay?

114
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,840
No need.

115
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,880
Let's go.

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,400
You exposed the undercover
Shadow Guard to me.

117
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,960
Won't your brother be angry?

118
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,680
You're indeed clever.

119
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,760
Last time we went shopping,

120
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,080
I saw you chatting with him

121
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,360
but didn't think much of it.

122
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,840
Today, you made it so obvious.

123
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
If I still didn't get it, I'd be a fool.

124
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,440
You only knew Fei Ying

125
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,600
among Ning's guards here.

126
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,760
Today, you met another one.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,440
If you can't find Fei Ying,
you can look for him.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Marquis Wen is dead.

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,740
What else could happen?

130
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,000
But Tu Wenjue is on the run.

131
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,200
With you around, he'll be captured soon.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Don't blink.

133
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Watch closely.

134
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,280
Come, don't miss out.

135
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
The performance is about to start.

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,960
Watch closely, don't blink.

137
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,080
Watch closely.

138
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,520
Here we go.

139
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,880
- So amazing.
- How was it?

140
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
I'll do it again.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,080
A family heirloom

142
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
should be flawless.

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,320
If Hua's Blood Coral is missing a piece,

144
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,400
there must be a reason.

145
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,240
And don't forget,

146
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,080
Marquis Wen kidnapped Chancellor Hua
through that secret passage.

147
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,920
How did he know there was a passage
under the treasure vault

148
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,440
and where the mechanism was?

149
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,240
It's gone.

150
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,000
This was passed down by the old master.

151
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
I inquired.

152
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,880
The old master the housekeeper mentioned

153
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,000
should be Xiyu's great-grandfather,
Hua Zhongjing.

154
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,960
By this calculation,

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,920
the Hua family must have
obtained Blood Coral

156
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,800
during the time

157
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,160
when Chen surrendered.

158
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
When Chen's Crown Prince surrendered,
he brought his ministers with him.

159
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,840
Chen must've had
a treasure vault back then.

160
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,560
Check if there's any Blood Coral.

161
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,600
Yes.

162
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,600
I can master martial arts.

163
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,280
I can't master this delicate skill?

164
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
Your Highness, is it necessary?

165
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,960
It is.

166
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,880
Xiyu praised another man's skill.

167
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,640
See, I'm still the best.

168
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,600
This is too easy.

169
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,680
What do you want?

170
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,160
My people and I have been hiding
for many years,

171
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
risking our lives

172
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
all for one thing.

173
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,000
Marquis Wen is dead.

174
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
The royal family of Chen is extinct.

175
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Stop talking about restoration.

176
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,200
I advise you to leave here

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
and find a secluded place

178
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,160
to live peacefully

179
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,200
with the remaining clan members.

180
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,960
If you lack money,

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,680
I can...

182
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
I don't want money.

183
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,800
Then what do you want?

184
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,040
Revenge. I want you to help me
kill Ning Xuanzhou.

185
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,680
Impossible.

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,040
When Chen was crumbling,

187
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,280
the Tu Mountain Clan fled
to the deep mountains,

188
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,000
lying low to gather strength

189
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,320
for a future restoration.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,680
Your Hua family, as an minister,
surrendered to Yan

191
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,800
and gained a position in the court

192
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,040
to assist from within
when the time came.

193
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,160
Before surrendering to Yan,

194
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,080
the Crown Prince gave your grandfather
Blood Coral,

195
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,080
urging him not to forget
the restoration.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,880
Your grandfather broke off
a piece on the spot,

197
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
pierced his own fingertip

198
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
and wrote this letter in blood,

199
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,280
swearing eternal loyalty to Chen.

200
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,000
That piece of Blood Coral is gone,

201
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,200
but this blood letter remains.

202
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,000
The Hua family's oath to
the royal family of Chen still stands.

203
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,840
Xiyu, watch closely.

204
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,240
You can do this too?

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,040
It's a trivial skill.
I learned it in one try.

206
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,000
The other day on the street,
you were cheering for the performance.

207
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,800
How come you're so quiet for mine?

208
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,200
You already said it's a trivial skill,

209
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
so it's not a big deal.

210
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
Why should I be so amazed?

211
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
Even a trivial skill, if done well,

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,480
deserves recognition.

213
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,360
Alright then.

214
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,280
I'll recognize it.

215
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,960
You're amazing.

216
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,200
So insincere.

217
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,080
Then how can I be sincere?

218
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,600
Show me.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,320
You're amazing!

220
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
You're amazing!

221
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,800
Xuanzhou, you're awesome.

222
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,000
Xuanzhou, you're awesome.

223
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,440
Xuanzhou, I really like you.

224
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,680
Xuanzhou, do you like Xiyu?

225
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,280
I do.

226
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,640
You're so bad.

227
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,000
I like you too.

228
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,640
You think destroying Blood Coral

229
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,520
clears your name?

230
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,600
We searched the corpse.

231
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,520
There's nothing suspicious except for this.
