00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Why are you here again?

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,800
Leave me alone.

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,800
The more I think, the angrier

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,920
and angrier I get.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,720
I want to ask Hua Xiyu

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,560
why she deceived me for so many years
and wasted my time.

9
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,480
She always treated you like a sister.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,880
It's your own misunderstanding.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,040
Move aside.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,680
If you have time to waste,

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,120
you might as well find another.

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,520
Marry someone else

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
and calm our parents.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,440
Leave me alone.

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Don't follow me.

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,080
If you follow me,

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,800
I'll tell everyone

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,920
Hua Xiyu is a woman.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,560
You...

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,600
Hua Xiyu.

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,680
Watch out!

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,320
Mei!

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Mei, are you OK?

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,440
It's lucky you're fine.

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,040
You really scared me to death.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,240
It's you two who scared me to death!

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,320
Trying to kill me?

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,280
It's the time for students
to practice archery.

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,800
- You ran around without knowing that.
- You...

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,120
Luckily, I'm fine.

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
If anything had happened to me,

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,320
my brother would've killed you.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,680
Thankfully, this gentleman is here.

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,600
Young Master?

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,040
Young Master?

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,520
- Where did he go?
- Ning Xuanzhou?

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,480
He left just now.

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Ning Xuanzhou?

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,480
So he's the prince of Ning

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,560
who went alone into danger?

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,440
Still not back yet?

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,960
Did he run away?

45
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,240
Why are you sneaking around?

46
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,320
Why don't you come in?

47
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
You might be annoyed to see me.

48
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,200
I promised the emperor
I'd look after you.

49
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,080
I'd be more annoyed if you left.

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,080
Come in.

51
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,000
These days, when I sleep...

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,880
I divide the bed properly
and never cross the line.

53
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,040
When I change...

54
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,280
I always step outside.

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,400
When I bathe...

56
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,360
You never bathe here.

57
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,040
Oh right, I always go home to bathe

58
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,880
since it's nearby.

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,760
It's late. Let's sleep.

60
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,480
What are you doing?

61
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,040
I won't do anything inappropriate.

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,440
As if you'd dare.

63
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,960
If you try anything,

64
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,480
I'll chop you to pieces.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Liar, stay away from me.

66
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,400
What's the matter?

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,080
I don't know.

68
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,290
- Good day, Master.
- Good day, Master.

69
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,920
Take a seat.

70
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,840
Today, we won't discuss the Analects.

71
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,040
We'll talk about
the Edict of Compassion.

72
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,200
Xuanzhou,

73
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,000
since you're new and unprepared,

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,360
you can share a book with Xiyu.

75
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
Master, I've studied this before.

76
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,280
I memorized it by heart.

77
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
No book needed.

78
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Our Xuanzhou is indeed
diligent and studious.

79
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,240
You all should learn from him,

80
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,560
especially Xiyu.

81
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,320
You can't even write properly.

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,920
Your father, Official Hua,
had excellent handwriting.

83
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,120
His handwriting

84
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,720
was admired even by the headmaster.

85
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,440
Look at your writing,

86
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,600
so weak and soft.

87
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,760
Anyone who sees it
would think it's from a girl.

88
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,600
- A girl's handwriting?
- A girl's handwriting?

89
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,320
Zhang Fengtian,
are you fooling around again?

90
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
No, Master.

91
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,440
Just now, my butt was...

92
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,280
Stand outside.

93
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
Yes, Master.

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Let's begin the lesson.

95
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,240
In springtime,

96
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,680
the grass and trees grow,

97
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,880
but my people, the widows,
orphans, and destitute,

98
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,320
may face death without anyone
to care for them.

99
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,080
- Farewell, Master.
- Farewell, Master.

100
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,640
Xiyu.

101
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

102
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,120
I wasn't worried about you.

103
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,120
You scared me!

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,560
Well done.

105
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,600
I always said, there's
no good person from Ning.

106
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,680
Why are you suddenly enlightened today?

107
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,800
He's a man.

108
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,360
Of course. Only a fool wouldn't know
he's a man.

109
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,360
(A fool.)

110
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,600
Xiyu, from now on,

111
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,720
you should do the same.

112
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,080
Whenever you can, bully him

113
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,520
to vent for us Yan people.

114
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
Who said I bullied him?

115
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
I just ignored him.

116
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,960
Right.

117
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,320
You didn't glare at him
the entire class.

118
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,720
You just ignored him.

119
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,760
That paperweight

120
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,120
dropped on his foot was just
him being clumsy.

121
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,160
I understand.

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
You understand nothing.

123
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,680
(Did I go too far today?)

124
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,080
(Even though he deceived me,)

125
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,120
(he's been respectful these days.)

126
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,520
(As a hostage treated coldly
by everyone,)

127
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,520
(his lack of candor towards me)

128
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,200
(is understandable.)

129
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,200
I'll talk to him when he returns.

130
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,240
It's indeed the scent of His Highness.

131
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,360
Mei, you...

132
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,320
Mei, what...

133
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,580
I'm sorry to have deceived you
for so long.

134
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,380
How will you make it up?

135
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,920
When you get married in the future,

136
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,840
as your buddy...

137
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,960
As my bestie.

138
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,520
As your bestie,

139
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,280
I'll give you a generous dowry.

140
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
But only if I find a good man.

141
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,360
Mei, you're beautiful and lovely.

142
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,560
You'll surely find one.

143
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,960
I already have.

144
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,440
Your roommate.

145
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,760
Ning Xuanzhou?

146
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,560
Why aren't you saying anything?

147
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,200
Do you like him too?

148
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,640
I...

149
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,280
No wonder you chose him as roommate.

150
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,320
I knew it!

151
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,400
Stop talking nonsense.

152
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,080
I had no choice.

153
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
Besides, he just arrived.

154
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
When did you meet him?

155
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,720
Yesterday.

156
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,440
Yesterday?

157
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,480
Yesterday,

158
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,720
I saw his kindness

159
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,120
bravery

160
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,600
and strength.

161
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,880
If you don't want to see me,

162
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
I'll leave.

163
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
(I thought he went out to reflect,)

164
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,440
(but he...)

165
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,720
If I marry him in the future,

166
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,920
calling him 'husband' is too ordinary.

167
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,760
How about

168
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,240
calling him 'Xuan'?

169
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,400
Xuan.

170
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,720
Xuan.

171
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,000
So gentle and intimate.

172
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,480
Xuan sounds good.

173
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
Wait, Mei.

174
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,980
Aren't you thinking too far ahead?

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,880
Don't forget he's from Ning.

176
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,510
We could go to war at any time
with them.

177
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,240
Right.

178
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,080
In times of discord,

179
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,240
it's when marriage alliances are needed.

180
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
To turn swords into plowshares,

181
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,320
who else but me?

182
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,160
Right.

183
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,280
Xiyu, I'll go home now.

184
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,280
Thank you, Xiyu.

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,520
I'll be going.

186
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,240
Mei.

187
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,680
Mei!

188
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,440
Xiyu.

189
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,360
Xiyu.

190
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,480
Xiyu.

191
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,040
Your Highness,

192
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,640
you're quite skilled.

193
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,240
I underestimated you.

194
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,760
I...

195
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,280
Xiyu.

196
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,880
Your Highness.

197
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Didn't I tell you

198
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,600
to meet me outside?

199
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,040
Stay away from Xiyu

200
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,440
to avoid implicating her.

201
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,640
This is urgent.

202
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,360
A large batch of weapons

203
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,120
was secretly sent to Fragrance Teahouse.

204
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,920
I don't know what they're plotting.

205
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,140
(Fragrance Teahouse)

206
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Back then, our entire village

207
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
was burned to ashes by Ning people.

208
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,640
Only me and my niece survived.

209
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,880
We got separated later.

210
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,280
I thought we'd never meet again.

211
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,440
Thanks to your efforts, Master Hua,

212
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,160
we're reunited today.

213
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,560
Your great kindness

214
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,480
is beyond words.

215
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Seeing you reunited,

216
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,200
I feel very satisfied.

217
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,680
This is the greatest reward for me.

218
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,840
That's true.

219
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,480
Just now, Master Hua came over in a rage.

220
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,520
I was pondering

221
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,080
which tea could calm him.

222
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,400
Hearing your words,

223
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,960
he instantly cheered up.

224
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,440
By the way, who dared

225
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,760
to offend our Master Hua?

226
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
Don't mention it.

227
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,200
I came here to avoid him.

228
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,500
Thinking about it makes me angry.

229
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,680
Upstairs, please.

230
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,280
Good, isn't it?

231
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,120
(That's...)

232
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,960
(Ning Xuanzhou?)

233
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,640
Master.

234
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,400
Please.

235
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,200
I'm not here for tea today,

236
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,320
but for you, Miss Ruyi.

237
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,760
Master, you're too forward.

238
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,720
Our teahouse is a respectable place.

239
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,560
Master.

240
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,960
Master.

241
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,200
Tu Mountain Clan

242
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
still likes to brand their children

243
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,400
with the totem at birth.

244
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,890
Hoarding a large number of weapons,

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
what do you intend to do?

246
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,820
I won't tell you, even if I die.

247
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,040
Killing you is too much effort.

248
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,490
What do you want the weapons for?

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,680
To blow up...

250
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,800
To blow up the academy.

251
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,080
Why?

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,520
They're all sons of the powerful.

253
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,720
Blowing...

254
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,640
Blowing it up

255
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
would force Yan to declare war on Ning.

256
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,200
Indeed.

257
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Since I'm now in the academy,

258
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,680
I'll naturally take the blame.

259
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,040
Who ordered you to blow it up?

260
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,560
It's...

261
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,960
It's the master.

262
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,960
Who's the master?

263
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,520
No,

264
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,680
I won't say it, even if I die.

265
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,960
Scoundrel, how dare you force her!
