=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,680
The academy is just ahead.

4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,880
Hurry back.

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,080
Mister, don't forget
what you promised me.

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,880
I promised to steal Blood Coral.

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,680
No need.

8
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,880
I've already seen it anyway.

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,640
You promised me you'd change
your line of work.

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,080
You really care about me?

11
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,160
I thought you were just joking.

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,880
How could I?

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,360
After all, you gave me
the precious Red Spirit Gem.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,440
So, what's important is the gem?

15
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,280
Not the one who gave you the hairpin?

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
Mister, you need to speak
more tactfully

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
once you turn over a new leaf.

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,460
Don't expose my secret
so bluntly, got it?

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,680
Mister.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,640
Which way should I go?

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,760
Mister?

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,360
(She'll definitely get suspicious)

23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,480
(if she sees this.)

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,000
Xuan, what happened to you?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,290
I bumped into something just now.

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
So clumsy.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,560
Let me apply some medicine.

28
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,640
You need bandages for a finger injury.

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,960
You're just like a princess.

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes,

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,960
without you, I can't do anything right.

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,920
Don't say that.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,280
You're very good at studying.

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,320
Xiyu, what happened to your hand?

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,880
It's nothing.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,960
This is a secret medicine
I brought from Ning.

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,200
It can stop bleeding

38
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,360
and prevent scarring.

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,040
No need.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
I've already taken it out.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,680
The one who gave you the hairpin,
do you like him?

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,720
This bandage is just right for you.

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,280
Does it hurt?

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,680
No.

45
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880
What's wrong?

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,440
Nothing.

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,280
Xuan,

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,440
did you give me the hairpin
because you like me?

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,520
Yes,

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,640
like the way I like my brother.

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,680
You mean brotherly, right?

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
Or what?

53
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,120
Where are you going?

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,640
To find food.

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,960
This is so frustrating!

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Who is it?

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,960
It's me.

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,760
Mister,

59
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
you're still here?

60
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,160
Let's talk elsewhere.

61
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,360
OK.

62
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,590
Every time, you have to blindfold me.

63
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,160
I've told you to change your ways.

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,760
Then you won't feel guilty like a thief.

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,680
What...what is it?

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,960
You...How...

67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,920
I've already set the gem for you.

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,080
Answer me one question.

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,880
Mister, not again.

70
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,520
Does the one who gave you
the hairpin like you?

71
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,640
He said he likes me like a brother.

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,520
You say it so lightly,

73
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,680
but why did you get angry
when he said it?

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,880
I don't know.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,160
I just got so angry.

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,840
I've never been this angry in my life.

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,520
He's not telling the truth.

78
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,480
If he saw you as a brother,

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,040
why give you the hairpin?

80
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
You mean...

81
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,960
He should like you as a woman.

82
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
Really? No, wait.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
How...

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,920
How do you know I'm a woman?

85
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,880
A thief's eyes are sharp.
How could I not tell?

86
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,080
Never mind that.

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,480
Let's talk about your Xuan.

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
How do you know Xuan
gave me the hairpin?

89
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,980
That day, you were afraid I'd kill him

90
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
and clung to my arm for hours.

91
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,440
Who else could it be but him?

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,640
You're amazing.

93
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,120
You guessed it right.

94
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,880
Since you know I'm amazing,

95
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,120
trust me on this.

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
Xuan giving you the hairpin

97
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,280
means he sees you as his beloved woman.

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,880
Then why doesn't he say it directly?

99
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,120
He might just be too shy
to say it to your face.

100
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,520
You're back.

101
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,320
(He should like you as a woman.)

102
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,440
Xuan giving you the hairpin

103
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,960
means he sees you as his beloved woman.

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,160
Xiyu, what's wrong?

105
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Xuan,

106
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,680
do you like me as a woman?

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,640
Am I your beloved woman?

108
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,040
So direct?

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,080
Sorry.

110
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,160
I've been disguised for too long.

111
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,120
I forgot women should be more reserved.

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,680
I'll ask again next time.

113
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,320
You are.

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm what?

115
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,280
You're my beloved woman.

116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,360
♪Shadows on the window♪

117
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,880
What about you?

118
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,880
Do you like me?

119
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,420
♪Willingly endure the torment
of longing♪

120
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,640
♪The mysterious moon
hides behind clouds♪

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,480
Thanks to a guy who enlightened me,

122
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,280
I wouldn't have noticed
your feelings otherwise.

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,520
Then we should really thank that guy.

124
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
He's incredible.

125
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,880
He moves very fast

126
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,780
and is highly skilled.

127
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,120
His predictions are spot on.

128
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,520
I'll introduce you to him next time.

129
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,520
- Ning Xuanzhou!
- Sure.

130
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Let go of Xiyu!

131
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,440
What are you doing?

132
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,120
He knows you're a woman

133
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,840
and still touches you.

134
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
He has ulterior motives.

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,080
What ulterior motives?

136
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,480
Explain to me

137
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,160
why you were sneaking around outside
with this bundle.

138
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,840
Put it on.

139
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,880
Xiyu.

140
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,720
Put it on.

141
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,680
Xiyu.

142
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,080
How dare you provoke her again?

143
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,560
The academy is locked up.

144
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
You can't escape.

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,680
I'll deal with you when I get back.

146
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,280
Xiyu, I'll definitely stand up for you.

147
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
Tomorrow, I'll send him away

148
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,960
and interrogate him thoroughly.

149
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,680
Interrogate?

150
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,720
Your Highness,

151
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
your identity is exposed.

152
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
It's dangerous here. You must leave.

153
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,320
I can't leave,

154
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
or Xiyu will never forgive me.

155
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,680
Your Highness, why do you still care
about that?

156
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,920
You leave first.

157
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,640
- Your Highness.
- Hurry!

158
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,280
Right,

159
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,160
he's in disguise,
so he must have a plot.

160
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,880
Tomorrow, I'll bring more experts

161
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,280
to torture him until he can't live...

162
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
I made him to.

163
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,680
I wanted to see Blood Coral at home,

164
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,820
but my uncle wouldn't let me.

165
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,320
So I made him wear that

166
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,280
to scare my uncle.

167
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,000
But you saw the bundle

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,880
and got so mad.

169
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,720
I told him repeatedly
not to reveal anything,

170
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,120
but you saw it all.

171
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,840
How could I not be angry?

172
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,080
But...

173
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,240
No buts. If you really don't believe me,

174
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,840
you can interrogate me instead.

175
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,600
Xiyu.

176
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,690
- Xiyu.
- Move aside.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,800
Drink.

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
You drank Soft Bone Powder.

179
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,880
I can tell.

180
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,640
Speak.

181
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,560
I'm indeed the prince of Ning,

182
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
but I'm also commander
of the Ning Shadow Guards.

183
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,160
If the two countries go to war,
countless lives will be lost.

184
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,680
To prevent the tragedy of 18 years ago,

185
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,880
I must find out the truth
about Marquis Wen's death.

186
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,680
I've told you everything I can.

187
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,960
Why did you appear at my house
multiple times?

188
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,880
Marquis Wen's killer

189
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,040
must know his travel route.

190
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,360
And the night before his departure,
he secretly visited the Hua residence.

191
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,160
You suspect my family?

192
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
I don't suspect you,

193
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,320
but I suspect Chancellor Hua.

194
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,680
My uncle.

195
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,520
I'll go ask him.

196
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,640
If you alert him,

197
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,640
it'll be bad for you.

198
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,680
It's best to...

199
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,880
Ning Xuanzhou, I'm not like you.

200
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,320
I don't use these shady tricks.

201
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,360
Do you think you've been so stealthy?

202
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,440
The guards at home aren't deaf.

203
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,400
They heard you say,
"Don't hurt anyone. Out the window."

204
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,040
They recognized your voice.

205
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,920
Tell me, who was the thief with you?

206
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,760
Why did you break into Clove Garden?

207
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,720
The thief was someone I hired to help.

208
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,160
I wanted to steal Blood Coral.

209
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
What did you say?

210
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,960
Because my dad said those words
before he died.

211
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,760
You...

212
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,880
Everyone out!

213
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,360
Yes.

214
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,520
(Listen,)

215
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,880
(without my permission,)

216
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,090
(no one is allowed near.)

217
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,120
(Yes.)

218
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,080
Xiyu,

219
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,760
you mean to say

220
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
the words your dad left before he died

221
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,320
were Blood Coral?

222
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,880
Yes.
