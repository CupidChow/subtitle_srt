00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,120
(Since you've found out,)

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
(I'll need to take action.)

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,160
You're nominally the prince of Ning,

6
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,080
but in reality,

7
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,840
you're the princess of Ning.

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,080
Surprised that

9
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
I guessed right?

10
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,080
Very surprised.

11
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,160
Since you showed up in a dress
at Fragrance Teahouse,

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
I had already guessed it.

13
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,320
Ning doesn't want war,

14
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,990
but they won't cede territory.

15
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,760
Sending a princess disguised
as a prince to fool Yan?

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,800
How despicable.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't worry. If I wanted to expose you,

18
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,160
I'd have done it just now.

19
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,260
The emperor of Ning is a scoundrel,

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,280
but you're just an innocent sacrifice.

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,640
I'm thirsty.

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,200
Understandable.

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
Princesses

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
can be a bit spoiled.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,480
However,

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,320
someone was killed at the teahouse
last night.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
It made me think all night.

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
Not thirsty anymore?

29
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
When in a foreign land,

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,520
how can one act as freely as at home?

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,920
I was presumptuous.

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,440
Master, please.

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,240
That person was killed over jealousy.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,240
The culprit turned himself in.

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
I paid for those women to stay
at the teahouse

36
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,920
to learn a skill and support themselves.

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,320
I didn't expect such a mess.

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,880
I couldn't sleep last night.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,360
Xuan,

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,600
if you want to escape,

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,200
don't go to the teahouse. Just find me.

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,780
Why do you say I want to escape?

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,000
You must've heard

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,960
the teahouse takes in women
with no way out.

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,380
That's why you showed up there.

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,440
Otherwise, why did you sneak out

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,680
after arriving in the capital?

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,380
You were afraid of being discovered

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
and were running very fast.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Yes,

51
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,160
that's exactly how it is.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,360
However, I discovered something odd.

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,480
Since you already ran out,

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,840
why did you come here?

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,240
It doesn't make sense.

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,240
At that time, I was scared.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Later I thought,

58
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,100
if I leave, the two countries
will fight,

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
which will cause millions to die.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
It defies heavenly reason.

61
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,360
Good girl, you have courage.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,680
Let me make a toast with tea.

63
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,840
Three times you snatched my cup of tea.

64
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,960
Is there poison in it?

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
Sorry, I'm really thirsty.

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Master Hua, there's something
for you from home.

67
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,540
What were you going to do just now?

68
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,080
He said he knows your identity,

69
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,960
so I...

70
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
I'll handle him.

71
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,890
Did you arrange for the one
at the teahouse to turn himself in?

72
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,360
Yes.

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
Have you identified the man in black?

74
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,240
The body was burnt beyond recognition,

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,860
but the way he set the fire

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
seems to be from Tu Mountain.

77
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,400
Tu Mountain Fire Clan?

78
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,520
Weren't they wiped out 18 years ago

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,600
during the Ning-Yan War?

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
It seems some survived.

81
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,160
Back then, my father suspected

82
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,360
they massacred several border villages,

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,880
causing mutual suspicion
between Ning and Yan,

84
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
which led to war.

85
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,200
Now they want to repeat the trick.

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,480
Put this behind the screen.

87
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,840
Yes.

88
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,320
Don't come.

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm changing.

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,960
Put it down.

91
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,560
Get out now.

92
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,720
In the future, without my order,

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,560
don't come in.

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,160
Yes.

95
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,360
It was my oversight just now.

96
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,760
It's alright.

97
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
How is it alright?

98
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,320
You're a princess.

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
What if men barge in
while you're changing?

100
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,000
(Look how embarrassing she is.)

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,800
(Yes, in her eyes, I'm also a man.)

102
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,000
(But I can't reveal my secret
that I've hidden)

103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,240
(for 18 years just like that.)

104
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,240
Though we must share a room,

105
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,840
don't worry, Princess.

106
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,120
I won't have evil thoughts.

107
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,680
You're absolutely safe with me.

108
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Could you not call me princess?

109
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Right, you might be exposed that way.

110
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,360
Xuan, don't worry.

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,680
I'll never take advantage of you.

112
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,120
Don't move.

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,720
I can handle this rough work.

114
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,400
In front of me,

115
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,960
just enjoy the happiness
of being a woman.

116
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,560
Xuan,

117
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,480
I want to ask,

118
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,800
where did you get these boots?

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,940
They make you so much taller.

120
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Actually, I...

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,640
I'm a genuine man.

122
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
But I'm naturally short,

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,400
so I always wear elevated shoes.

124
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm naturally tall.

125
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,760
You have that advantage.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,160
No wonder they chose you.

127
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,560
Just this spot.

128
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,480
Alright, pour.

129
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,490
- Pour more.
- Here goes.

130
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
Pour more.

131
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,280
Come here.

132
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,520
You, sit here.

133
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,400
Wait.

134
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,480
You guys,

135
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,760
Ning Xuanzhou is now my roommate.

136
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,960
Next time, there'll be consequences.

137
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,360
Xiyu,

138
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
we're doing this for Yan.

139
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,760
Exactly.

140
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,670
Yes, if you dared to do this
to the king of Ning,

141
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
I'd count it as patriotism.

142
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
But bullying a girl in the academy...

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,560
A hostage.

144
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,080
Right, bullying a hostage

145
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,960
is bullying the weak, understood?

146
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm so angry I can't speak straight.

147
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,280
You, bring your cushion over.

148
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,640
I...

149
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Bring it over.

150
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,640
Put it down.

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,560
Do it.

152
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,680
You sit on this.

153
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,720
I, I sit on this?

154
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,320
Yes.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,320
Alright, dismissed.

156
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,840
Dismissed.

157
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,640
Come on.

158
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,200
Xuan, sit here, come.

159
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
- Farewell, Master.
- Farewell, Master.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,890
Your sleeves are large
and they might be dirty.

161
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,880
Let me do it.

162
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,680
You don't have to be so nice.

163
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,400
You're used to being bullied,
so when someone treats you well,

164
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,280
you feel uneasy.

165
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,680
But don't worry.

166
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,120
I'm like this not just with you.

167
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,760
The women at the teahouse also...

168
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,600
So,

169
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,520
that's why they call me
a true gentleman.

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,400
Who did this? Step out.

171
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
Yes, who did it?

172
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
Dare to do it but not admit it?

173
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,320
Xiyu, leave it to me. I'll help you find out.

174
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
Come on, let's wash up.

175
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,840
My classmates are actually
not bad at heart.

176
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,200
It's just because...

177
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Marquis Wen, whom they respected,
was killed by Ning.

178
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,240
It wasn't Ning.

179
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,980
The two countries have been at odds.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,190
Conflicts occur at the border.

181
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,600
Marquis Wen advocated peace.

182
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,920
Upon hearing he was coming,
we looked forward to it.

183
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,800
How could we've harmed him?

184
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,840
But it's a fact he died in Ning.

185
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,240
He died on the way to Ning's capital.

186
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,880
The route was extremely secret.

187
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,640
Only you Yan people knew.

188
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,120
Forget it, it's national affairs.

189
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,680
Why discussing them with a girl?

190
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
(Rascal.)

191
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,260
I picked it up in the academy.

192
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
Seems it knocked over the brush.

193
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,080
Alright.

194
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,560
When I find out who it is,
I'll beat him up for you.

195
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,760
Can you try not to mention that I'm a girl?

196
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,200
Looking closely,

197
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,920
your facial contours are quite good.

198
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,080
Actually, I was thinking last night.

199
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,640
As a girl, you have quite a rugged look.

200
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,200
Add some rouge to the cheeks
for a bit of contour

201
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,560
like this...

202
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,160
Ning Xuanzhou,

203
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,800
what did you give Xiyu?

204
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
What's your problem?

205
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,020
This pretty boy just arrived
and has already charmed you.

206
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
He must be suspicious.

207
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,600
I think you're the suspicious one.

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
Dare to do but not admit it, huh?

209
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,160
Xiyu, let me explain.

210
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,960
- I...
- I don't need an explanation.

211
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,040
I want to beat you up.

212
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,400
Seriously.

213
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,320
- Alright.
- You...

214
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,560
(Already asleep?)

215
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,240
(She's a big-hearted girl.)

216
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,120
(She really believes I'm a gentleman.)

217
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,920
Disguising as a man is not easy.

218
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,000
We can't wear a dress,

219
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,320
nor wear flowers.

220
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,080
We're girls yet are treated as men.

221
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,960
When we get slapped on the back
by those brutes,

222
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,520
we have to laugh it off.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,960
Xuan,

224
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,480
only I understand your pain.

225
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,080
(If he finds out Xiyu is a girl,)

226
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,040
(that'd be terrible.)

227
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,880
(How can I sleep?)

228
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,840
So painful.

229
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,880
Tightening like this,

230
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,040
my bones are breaking.

231
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,860
To flatten your breast like this

232
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,480
must hurt even more.

233
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,480
This girl endures a lot,

234
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,560
yet pretends nothing's wrong.

235
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,080
It makes me feel sorry for her.

236
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,440
(Luckily, I have a girl roommate.)

237
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,280
(I can sleep peacefully.)

238
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,880
