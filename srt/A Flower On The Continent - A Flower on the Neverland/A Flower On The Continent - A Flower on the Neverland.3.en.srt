00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
You didn't sleep well?

4
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,640
(Oh no, she thought I was a man.)

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
(Big misunderstanding.)

6
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,960
Sorry.

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,360
Don't take it the wrong way.

8
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,520
Things aren't what you think.

9
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,040
We should draw a line.

10
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,440
Don't overstep boundaries.

11
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Understood.

12
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,560
(I thought she'd be heartbroken.)

13
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,680
(I didn't know she was so open-minded.)

14
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,960
(For the sake of the country,)

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,160
(how much humiliation did she endure)

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
(to remain so calm?)

17
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm still angry

18
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,640
about what you did to her.

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,040
I thought about it all night.

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
It's too dangerous for you
to be with that pretty boy.

21
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,880
After all, you're a woman.

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Shut up.

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
Don't say this at the academy.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,640
I only told you my secret.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
I'm worried about you.

26
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,320
Worried about what?

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
You're different.

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
How am I different?

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
(You can't wait to attack Ning.)

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,720
(Like I'd tell you.)

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,200
Ning Xuanzhou is gentle,
upright and reliable.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,000
Stop causing trouble for her.

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,720
Why do you always protect him?

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,040
Don't tell me you fancy him.

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Yes, she's willing to face danger
for her country.

36
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,290
She's loyal and open-minded.

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,320
I particularly admire that.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,200
After all, it was also my fault.

39
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,880
I should find a chance to make it up.

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,080
Wuhui.

41
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,200
Mei.

42
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,280
Why are you here?

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,840
The academy is on holiday today.

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
I came to see Xiyu.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
While I was at the border,

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,480
mom wrote to me saying

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,740
you turned down
many marriage proposals.

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,360
You wouldn't like Xiyu, would you?

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,880
Wuhui.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,310
What do you think?

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,240
How do you like him
as your brother-in-law?

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,400
No way.

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Why not?

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,840
A few years ago, when I said

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,520
I wanted to be a family with Xiyu,

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,600
you even applauded.

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,040
When I said family, I didn't mean
you should marry her.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,600
If I don't marry him,

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
would you marry him?

60
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,200
I...

61
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,520
Anyway, Xiyu won't marry you.

62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,640
Come back.

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,120
Candied hawthorn!

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
Sweet candied hawthorn!

65
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,360
What did you find?

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm Fei Yun, prince.

67
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,640
The fireworks used by the Fire Clan
are intended for...

68
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,480
This one won't do.

69
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,920
The hawthorn isn't red enough.

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
It's sour.

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,080
This one is sweet.

72
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,080
Take it.

73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,280
How much?

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,520
One coin.

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,720
Here.

76
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,440
It's OK. Girls like sweets.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,120
I understand.

78
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,760
Xuan.

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,400
Xuan.

80
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,320
Wait for me.

81
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,520
Master Hua, aren't you busy?

82
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm busy shopping with you.

83
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,080
No need.

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,800
Of course you do.

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,320
The local thugs here

86
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
love to bully outsiders.

87
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
You have good taste.

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,840
This jewelry stall
is the most famous in town.

89
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,780
Pick anything you like,
and I'll buy it for you.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,360
Give me a chance to make amends.

91
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,160
Let go.

92
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
If we make a scene here,
your identity will be exposed,

93
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,760
Your Highness.

94
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,240
I bought you so much. Are you happy?

95
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,520
It seems you're happier.

96
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,440
No way.

97
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,520
This is my gentlemanly demeanor

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,600
to cherish the beauty.

99
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,720
Why don't you eat?

100
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
I can't eat this much.

101
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,680
How about you help me, Master Hua?

102
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,000
Sure.

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,480
Xuan,

104
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,080
I find you quite deceitful.

105
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,200
Why?

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Where did you buy
your voice-changing pill?

107
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
Voice-changing pill?

108
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,400
Even though you're a woman,

109
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,320
your voice is deeper

110
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,840
and more robust than me,

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,000
a genuine man.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,490
You must've used voice-changing pills.

113
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,920
What do you want?

114
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,560
It's not you. Get lost.

115
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,800
Do you know who I am?

116
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,160
Chancellor Hua is my uncle.

117
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,600
General Wuhui is my sworn brother.

118
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,960
I'll give you all the money.

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,880
(Coming for me?)

120
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Spare me, please.

121
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,120
(I must protect her.)

122
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
When I'm out there,

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
I always carry self-defense powder.

124
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Do you have more?

125
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,040
I only brought one.

126
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,590
How would I know you're so popular?

127
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
Run!

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's go!

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,720
Careful!

130
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,520
Let's go.

131
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,200
Are you OK?

132
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm fine. How about you?

133
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,200
Since you can smile,

134
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,190
it means you're not hurt.

135
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,720
Dust on your face?

136
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,620
Let me wipe it for you.

137
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Your face is dirty.

138
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,560
I...

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,840
Don't move.

140
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,450
♪Gazing at the returning swallows♪

141
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,390
♪The seasons swiftly come and go♪

142
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,080
Thank you.

143
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,120
Why did you save me just now?

144
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,760
What kind of man would I be
if I stood by and did nothing?

145
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,040
Master Hua, you truly cherish beauty.

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,240
I'm honored.

147
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,560
Besides, those people were masked.

148
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,880
Clearly they weren't good people.

149
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
If you were killed,

150
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,720
the emperor of Ning wouldn't rest.

151
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,400
I think

152
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,240
they intended to provoke a war.

153
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
I thought the same.

154
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,960
Therefore, to prevent a war,

155
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,520
I'll protect you from now on.

156
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,840
Aren't you afraid of dying?

157
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,840
I am.

158
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,280
But if my death can save thousands,

159
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,520
it's worth it.

160
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,760
What a good girl.

161
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,440
A good girl like you

162
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,800
can risk your life for the country.

163
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,360
How can I not do the same?

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,720
Did I hurt you?

165
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,600
No.

166
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,560
Your wrist-arrow is pretty good.

167
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,400
It's from my uncle.

168
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,640
It's small and delicate.

169
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,880
Seems like it's broken.

170
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,400
What's wrong?

171
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,880
All of them are broken.

172
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,520
This hairpin's design is rare.

173
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
(She's been pretending to be a man)

174
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,580
(and silently suffering.)

175
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,800
(How lonely she must be)

176
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,680
(to mistake me,)

177
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,640
(a genuine man,)

178
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
(for a woman.)

179
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
Sorry,

180
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,000
they fell to the ground when I panicked.

181
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,600
It's OK.

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,400
I'll buy you a new one next time.

183
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,240
By the way, wasn't I very handsome
when I was fighting?

184
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,480
Yes.

185
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,800
I've been practicing hard
since childhood.

186
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,320
Your dad was a righteous man,

187
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,400
so he had many enemies.

188
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,400
Being defenseless

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,280
led to his tragic end.

190
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
Practice well.

191
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,120
At least you can protect yourself.

192
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,040
Catch.

193
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,760
What a shame.

194
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,040
I should be holding
an embroidery needle.

195
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,000
Hard work pays off.

196
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,000
You're skilled in martial arts

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and are very graceful.

198
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
Thank you for your praise, princess.

199
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,680
Those thugs were nothing.

200
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Why are you here again?

201
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,040
I'm waiting for Xiyu.

202
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
Among so many suitable proposals,

203
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
why do you insist on Xiyu?

204
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
I don't care.

205
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,360
I won't marry anyone but Xiyu.

206
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,000
Silly girl, she...

207
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,760
Anyway, Xiyu will never marry you.

208
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,760
I don't believe it.
If he won't marry in a year,

209
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,840
I'll wait three years.

210
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,840
If he won't marry in three,
I'll wait ten.

211
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,760
I believe I'll eventually succeed.

212
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,720
Why does Xiyu have a woman's belongings?

213
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,040
Does Xiyu like someone else?

214
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,440
Don't mention those men in black
to anyone else.

215
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,680
Understood.

216
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,940
The situation is delicate.

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
We must act discreetly

218
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
to avoid being exploited by others.

219
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,880
Sorry, don't get me wrong.

220
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,640
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

221
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,560
Don't worry. I won't misunderstand.

222
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,840
You're a true gentleman
who cherishes beauty.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,280
Right, a true gentleman.

224
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,320
No way.

225
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
I need to find Xiyu for an explanation.

226
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,120
Enough.

227
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,760
Do you want the whole world to know?

228
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,880
What are you doing?

229
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,440
I want to ask Xiyu why he avoids me

230
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,840
and why he hides a woman's belongings.

231
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,840
I need an explanation.

232
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,000
Xiyu is a woman.

233
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,280
Xiyu is really a woman.

234
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,400
Who'd make such a big joke?

235
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,200
It'd be awkward to go in now.

236
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,280
Let's go.

237
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,800
That's it.

238
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,840
We must help her keep this secret.

239
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,400
We?

240
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,480
You're her sworn brother.

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm just a fool who was tricked.

242
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,600
Why should I help her?

243
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,920
People love to gossip.

244
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,360
Hua Xiyu, you deceitful woman.

245
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
- I will expose you!
- Mei!

246
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,600
Wait.

247
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,760
Don't stop me.

248
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,360
Hua Xiyu!

249
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,600
My leg.

250
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,240
It's cramped.

251
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,440
Mei, calm down.

252
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,640
Calm down? How can I calm down?

253
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Hua Xiyu pretended to be a man
and deceived me.

254
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,600
How can I calm down?

255
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,400
Keep your voice down.

256
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,680
Keep it down.

257
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,440
Someone, come quickly!

258
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,760
Outrageous.

259
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,280
Hua Xiyu is a girl.

260
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,040
Hua Xiyu is a...

261
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Please, it's already chaotic enough.

262
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,320
Don't make it worse.

263
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,880
You don't believe
what Hong Wuhui said, do you?

264
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,120
If I say I don't believe it,

265
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
will you believe it?
