1
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,920
Your Highness,

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,440
we discovered Tu Wenjue
appeared here before.

5
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,380
People all over Yan
are searching for him.

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,640
He didn't flee outside the city
but hid here, playing a trick on us.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,320
Quite clever of him.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,360
We've summoned all Shadow Guards.

9
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,080
This area is surrounded by our men.

10
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,360
Let's go inside and take a look.

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,600
(This is Xiyu's handwriting.)

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,720
Your Highness, what does it say?

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,640
Nothing you need to worry about.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,680
Tu Wenjue won't come here.

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,120
Have everyone withdraw.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,780
I have something to attend to.

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,760
Don't follow me.

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,520
Your Highness.

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,440
Your Highness.

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
If you don't want Hua Xiyu to die,

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
surrender yourself.

22
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,440
The letter is indeed
in Xiyu's handwriting

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,760
and the ink is very fresh.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
She wrote it just this morning.

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,800
But before I left,

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,840
I left someone to protect Xiyu.

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,760
I've already killed

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,760
the one you left behind.

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,200
At the Fragrance Teahouse?

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
You're indeed very smart,

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,520
still playing tricks on us.

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,120
Hua Xiyu didn't go
to the teahouse today.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,040
She was going to meet Hong Mei'er.

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,720
I made my move on her way
to Hong Mansion.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,600
If you want to avenge Marquis Wen,

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
take it out on me.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,840
This has nothing to do with Xiyu.

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,800
You believe she's in my hands now?

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
Candied hawthorn.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
Don't miss out.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,600
What did His Highness do today?

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,720
Take a look.

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,960
I know you're a spy and can't reveal much,

44
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,960
but at least take me to Fei Ying.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,720
Put down your weapon.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
If I don't resist,

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
will you release Xiyu?

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,280
Rest assured.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
I swear on the spirits

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,160
of all the deceased
of the Tu Mountain Clan.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,440
As long as you accept your fate,

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,680
Hua Xiyu will be safe and sound.

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,360
Otherwise,

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,640
I'll have her brought here

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
and torn her apart

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,960
in front of you.

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,280
That's roughly how it is.

58
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,960
I also hope, as Uncle said,
it's just unnecessary worry.

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,520
But what if the sky really falls?

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,800
It says in the letter,

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm in trouble
and the situation is urgent,

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,880
like a plea for help.

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,560
If it really was stolen
and used to blackmail Xuanzhou,

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,200
he might fall for it.

65
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,160
Oh no, His Highness has
already fallen for it.

66
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,600
He insisted on leaving alone

67
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,840
after reading the letter.

68
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,560
Does it say "come alone

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,480
and don't bring anyone"?

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,960
For the sake of my deceased master,

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,760
I'll make you suffer before I kill you.

72
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,240
Tough guy, huh?

73
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
Then die now.

74
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,600
Hua Chenghao,

75
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,200
you scoundrel!

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,560
You want to silence us...

77
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Sorry, Your Highness.

78
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,920
I must kill you today.

79
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Stop!

80
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,290
Watch out for the poison powder.

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,760
Cover your mouth and nose.

82
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
- Your Highness.
- Xuan.

83
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,120
I'm so sorry.

85
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Can you see?

86
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,080
Physician, how is he?

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,720
The flesh wounds are severe

88
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,680
but can heal with a few months
of good care.

89
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,360
However, the poison is too strong.

90
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,080
It's a miracle he survived, thanks to
his profound inner strength.

91
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
The eyes are very delicate.

92
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,160
They might never...

93
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,200
I'll check the medical texts again.

94
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,680
Physician, thank you.

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
This shouldn't be.

96
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,840
Before leaving Ning,

97
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
the emperor gave him a Red Spirit Gem

98
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,320
to neutralize all poisons
and ensure safety.

99
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,680
He didn't bring it with him?

100
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Xuanzhou,

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,120
this is the Red Spirit Gem.

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,280
Smell it.

103
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
It's too late.

104
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,960
Then I'll grind it into powder
and feed it to you.

105
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
It'll work better.

106
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,000
Xiyu, it's no use.

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,000
The poison has reached my eyes.

108
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,080
It's my fault.

109
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,520
It's all my fault.

110
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,120
You've done very well.

111
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,560
You saved me.

112
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,640
How did you know I was in the woods?

113
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,400
The letter,

114
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,080
it said to meet in the woods
three miles outside the city.

115
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
I thought it was
from uncle's old friend,

116
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,800
but

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
it ended up harming you.

118
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Xiyu.

119
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,840
Xiyu.

120
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,780
- I heard Xuanzhou...
- Uncle.

121
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,160
How did this happen?

122
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,320
How did this happen?

123
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,200
Uncle, that letter.

124
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,480
There was something wrong with it.

125
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,920
What...

126
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,160
After you left today,

127
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,720
I thought something didn't feel right.

128
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,520
So I wanted to question the messenger,

129
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,520
but found his body in an alley
outside the mansion.

130
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
Someone used my friend's name

131
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
to write that letter,

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,160
but they used the Cangnan language.

133
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,880
Otherwise, I'd have known
the handwriting.

134
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,990
When I heard from an old friend
after so many years,

135
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,440
I was too excited to think straight.

136
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,120
Only now do I see something suspicious.

137
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
Xiyu, I was foolish

138
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,480
to let Tu Wenjue use my hand

139
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,080
to harm Xuanzhou with a fake letter.

140
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,640
I...

141
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Xuanzhou, I'm sorry.

142
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,520
Uncle, don't blame yourself.

143
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,090
That villain is treacherous.
No one could've expected this.

144
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes, Uncle.

145
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,720
If anyone is to blame,

146
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,920
it's me.

147
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
I've always been careless

148
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,000
and implicated Xuanzhou many times.

149
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,240
It's my fault.

150
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,920
He's really blind?

151
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,120
It can't be cured?

152
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,440
The physician said he'd check
the medical texts again.

153
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,200
When the physician says that,

154
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,280
it means no cure.

155
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
Xuanzhou, there must be a way.

156
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,120
Right.

157
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
What are you planning to do?

158
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,190
You don't want me to abandon him,
do you?

159
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,320
Why are you so angry?

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,240
I mean,

161
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,560
since he got ambushed because of you

162
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,040
and got so badly hurt,

163
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,360
you should take good care of him.

164
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,240
Of course.

165
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,400
If he were blind for the rest
of his life,

166
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,800
would you still marry him?

167
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
Even if he were dead, I would.

168
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Alright.

169
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Why so angry?

170
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,000
I bought some good ginseng.

171
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,680
I'll go make some soup for him now.

172
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
Careful.

173
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,480
Take it slow.

174
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,120
You can lie down now.

175
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
You're not going back?

176
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
No, I'll stay here and take care of you.

177
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,000
You can't sleep on the floor.

178
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,040
You'll catch a cold.

179
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,380
How do you know I'm sleeping
on the floor?

180
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,640
Blind people have sharp ears.

181
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,240
I can tell.

182
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,760
Don't call yourself blind.

183
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Then come sleep here.

184
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,080
How...

185
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
How could that be?

186
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,480
What's wrong with it?

187
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,800
We're to be husband and wife.

188
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
Besides, you're a true gentleman
who cherishes beauty

189
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,520
and I'm a weak and powerless scholar.

190
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,360
As long as our hearts are pure
and behave appropriately,

191
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
it doesn't matter.

192
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm just worried you'll catch a cold.

193
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,960
Alright.

194
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,240
You promised to behave properly.

195
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
I know.

196
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,440
Here,

197
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,080
open your mouth.

198
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,720
Good, just one more spoon.

199
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,840
It's too bitter.

200
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,200
Here, have a sweet one to encourage you.

201
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
You wish.

202
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
How bitter can it be?

203
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,920
You must be lying to me again.

204
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
So bitter.

205
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,920
I'll get you something sweet.

206
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,880
Wait,

207
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,080
I'll go get a candied hawthorn.

208
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,480
Your Highness,

209
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,990
the emperor's secret letter.
Shall I read it to you?

210
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,640
Hand it to me.

211
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
Your Highness, your eyes...

212
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,320
I used half of my inner strength

213
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,880
to drive out the poison all night.

214
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,200
Now I can see.

215
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,200
You didn't tell Miss Hua?

216
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,200
If I told her,

217
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,320
she'd think I was deceiving her
from the beginning

218
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,760
and taking advantage of her.

219
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,320
It's better to delay her beating

220
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,880
until after I've recovered.

221
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,080
Also, I went to meet Tu Wenjue

222
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,560
to lure out Hua Chenghao.

223
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,760
Now he thinks I'm blind

224
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,400
and will lower his guard,

225
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,240
making it easier to catch him.

226
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,560
You should go back.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,640
Miss Hua has met me before.

228
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,520
She won't leak the secret.

229
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,520
Am I worried you'll leak the secret?

230
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
You'll disturb us.

231
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,920
Leave quickly.

232
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Yes.

233
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,600
Candied hawthorn is coming.

234
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,840
Let me have a bite.

235
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,000
Here.

236
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,080
Be careful.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,720
Is it sweet?

238
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
Still bitter.

239
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,240
How could it be?

240
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,160
Try it yourself if you don't believe me.

241
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,360
Don't joke around.

242
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,600
The doctor said your wounds
heal faster than others

243
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960
and can now touch water.

244
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,360
You haven't bathed recently.

245
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Want to take one?

246
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,840
Sure.

247
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,640
I'll prepare hot water.

248
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Really sweet.

249
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
Clean clothes are ready.

250
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,200
So are the towels.

251
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,840
Come this way.

252
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,290
Just hold onto the edge of the tub.

253
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,920
Be careful not to fall.

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,520
Don't worry, I won't fall.

255
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,840
You can leave now.

256
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,000
Be careful.

257
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,040
(Better keep an eye on him.)

258
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,640
(What if he falls?)

259
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,160
(After all, he can't see.)
