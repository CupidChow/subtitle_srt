00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,600
Tell me now!

4
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,160
Ning Xuanzhou!

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,080
Xiyu!

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,320
You beast from Ning!

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,040
She infiltrated the teahouse
with malicious intent.

8
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,040
I was defending myself.

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,760
Explain clearly.

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,600
I thought you wouldn't listen.

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,520
The men in black who tried to kill you
in the alley

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,880
also used this device.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,200
Yes, they belonged to the same group.

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,960
I was bored and came here for tea,

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,760
but they had set up an ambush.

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,800
Ruyi said she lived in a small village
near the Yan border.

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,440
Dissatisfied with the Ning army's raids,

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,600
she fled to the capital.

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,160
I never expected
she was actually from Ning.

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,040
From Ning?

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,360
You once placed one of these on the desk

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,200
in the academy,

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,340
saying you brought it from home
for self-defense.

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,840
This group uses Ning's specialties.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
Aren't they from Ning?

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
(If she knew I suspected her,)

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
(she'd be furious.)

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
You make a good point.

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,960
From this, we can deduce

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,190
the spies inciting war
between the two countries

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,680
are hidden within Ning.

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Not necessarily.

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,660
There might be spies in both sides.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,960
But it's likely more in Ning,

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,320
given they even use your...

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,760
Watch out!

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,640
Luckily, it was soaked in water.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Otherwise, you'd be hurt.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
A man shouldn't fear getting hurt.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,360
Your hand...

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,000
It's nothing.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
A man shouldn't fear getting hurt.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,280
You're different.

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,160
How different?

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,720
You...

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,640
In my heart,

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,640
you'll always be the princess of Ning.

48
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,400
What did you say?

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
First impressions really matter.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,240
Does your wound hurt?

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,640
No.

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,230
Why are you holding your arm then?

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,250
I'll change the bandage.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,080
No need.

55
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,200
I'm not a princess.

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,640
Still holding a grudge?

57
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
It's all in the past.

58
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,440
Madam Sun reported that day

59
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,280
and the officials took Ruyi's body away.

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,800
Now there's news.

61
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,800
The coroner has confirmed

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,880
Ruyi slit her own throat

63
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,260
and it's been ruled as suicide.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,560
But it's strange.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,480
Even if she couldn't kill you,

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,560
she could've escaped.

67
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,200
Why would she commit suicide?

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
I heard assassins commit suicide

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,920
to protect their companions
when exposed.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,160
Why are you asking me?

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,480
You were there that day.

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
As if I'd know.

73
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,160
I was splashed with tea.

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
When I looked up,
she was already lying there.

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,080
Oh right, I visited the teahouse
that day...

76
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,960
I know.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
You worried things would escalate

78
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
and be used against you.

79
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,000
I've already told them
not to mention you.

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
But someone from Ning wants to kill you.

81
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,800
We can't just ignore this.

82
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,480
No worries.

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,600
I've already sent word to Ning.

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
They'll investigate.

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,640
Are you silly?

86
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,800
The investigation is secondary.

87
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,520
The priority is for Ning

88
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,720
to send experts to protect you.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Look at you, unable to protect yourself.

90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
That day at the teahouse,

91
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,440
if I hadn't shouted loudly

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,840
and scared Ruyi into stopping,

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
you'd probably be dead by now.

94
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,800
I can't protect myself?

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,440
I think

96
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,880
you can't even change the bandage.

97
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,720
Really worrisome.

98
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,760
Until Ning sends experts,

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,280
you'll follow me

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,760
to avoid any more accidents.

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,600
Alright, I'll listen to you.

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,960
You're so obedient today.

103
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,880
Call me as you used to.

104
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,840
As before?

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
Yes, to avoid suspicion.

106
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,560
But you never responded

107
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,280
when I called you Xuan before.

108
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,680
Didn't I?

109
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
Not once.

110
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,840
Xuan.

111
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,880
Xuan.

112
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,720
Xuan.

113
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,520
Here.

114
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,080
Xuan, I just had a good idea.

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
What idea?

116
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,920
Accessories, sachets.

117
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,960
Accessories.

118
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Xuan.

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,440
I'm here.

120
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,480
Why are you stunned?

121
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,560
No wonder you got me here after class.

122
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
What if others see?

123
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,680
First,

124
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,920
I'll wear this to disguise myself
as your maid.

125
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,920
Second,

126
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,080
if unfortunately, my veil falls off

127
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
and we run into someone I know,

128
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,720
I'll say I'm only pretending
to be a woman.

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,400
First you dress as a man,

130
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,000
then as a woman.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
This was inspired by you.

132
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,520
If you can disguise yourself
at the teahouse,

133
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,960
why can't I?

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,480
Everyone has quirks, right?

135
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,880
Help me wear it.

136
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,560
Xiyu!

137
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,760
What are you...

138
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,990
Xiyu is on a secret mission.

139
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,080
Secret mission?

140
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,920
The border situation is tense

141
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,560
and many people have fled
to the capital.

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,360
I heard evil people are taking the opportunity
to abduct women.

143
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,880
Xiyu is in disguise

144
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
to investigate and help.

145
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,400
We won't disturb you then.

146
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,400
Good luck.

147
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,800
What secret mission?

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,960
Do you think we're fools?

149
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,400
Who knew Xiyu had this quirk?

150
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,380
She's hiding it so well.

151
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,600
Why care about others?

152
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,360
Besides, don't you have

153
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,160
- your own secrets?
- Shut up.

154
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,520
This is actually pretty good.

155
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Yes, now you don't even need the veil.

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,400
Since it's like this,

157
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,520
I might as well not pretend. Let's go.

158
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,000
Miss, have a look.

159
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,280
Various new styles of jewelry.

160
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,720
Take a pick.

161
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,360
Let me see.

162
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
It's Tiger Gem.

163
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,720
Quite common.

164
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,360
Common in Ning,

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
but here it's a rarity.

166
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,390
18 years ago, the war
between Yan and Ning

167
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
halted trade

168
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
and it hasn't resumed since.

169
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
How did Ning items get here?

170
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,600
Naturally, there are many ways

171
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,520
to make money.

172
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
Ma'am, I'll take these.

173
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,000
Alright.

174
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,680
How much?

175
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,520
Candied hawthorn!

176
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,400
Candied hawthorn!

177
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,080
Take care.

178
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,120
Don't miss out.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,490
Candied hawthorn is nice. Is it sweet?

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,880
I guarantee it's sweet, not sour.

181
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,680
Give me two sticks.

182
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,200
Sure.

183
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Master, please give me some food.

184
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,160
Master, have mercy.

185
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,300
You've dealt with the weapons
at Fragrance Teahouse?

186
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,680
Yes.

187
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
But the remaining Tu Mountain members

188
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
killed themselves.

189
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,640
We didn't catch any alive.

190
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,360
Master, spare some money for food.

191
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
Don't touch me. Go away.

192
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,320
Miss.

193
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,640
- Here.
- Thank you.

194
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,760
Miss, please spare some money for food.

195
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,560
My wife is starving.

196
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,520
- We have money.
- You can't save all.

197
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,560
I'll do my best.

198
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,360
Take it all.

199
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,160
Thank you, Miss.

200
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,320
Thank you, Miss.

201
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,320
Thank you, Miss.

202
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
- Take it.
- A lifesaver.

203
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,160
You're a lifesaver.

204
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,440
Thank you, a great person indeed.

205
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,760
Candied hawthorn!

206
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
Candied hawthorn!

207
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't miss out.

208
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,560
If I had known, I would've
brought more money.

209
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,960
If you become the head of the family,

210
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,640
you'd empty your family's wealth.

211
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,800
My father once met a beggar

212
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,920
asking for food.

213
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,600
At that time, he had no change

214
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,040
and needed to cross the river.

215
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,320
He promised to give him money
when he returned.

216
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,640
But when he came back,

217
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,840
the beggar had starved to death

218
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,760
on the shore.

219
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,640
My father was heartbroken for a long time,

220
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,640
saying his one moment of delay
cost a life.

221
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,720
So whenever someone asks for food,

222
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,160
I do my best to help.

223
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,800
I heard you're a posthumous child.

224
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,440
Yes.

225
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
I've never seen my father.

226
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,280
Everything I know about him

227
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,760
is from my mom.

228
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,120
We're the same.

229
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,660
I've never seen my father either.

230
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
During the war between Ning and Yan,

231
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
my father, a great general, died in battle.

232
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,000
My mother, devastated

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,080
by the news,

234
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
died in childbirth.

235
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,720
Remembering my father's bravery,

236
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,200
the emperor adopted me

237
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,640
and raised me in the palace.

238
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,200
I don't want to see the two countries
go to war again

239
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
and cause more suffering,

240
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,520
so I volunteered to come to Yan.

241
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,120
When...

242
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
When did you buy this?

243
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,040
While you were busy looking at things,

244
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,360
you didn't notice me.

245
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,240
Thanks.

246
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,520
I'll treasure it.

247
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
(Hua Mansion)

248
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,440
Are you crazy?

249
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
If you want to scold me, do it.

250
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,160
Why throw my stuff?

251
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,360
You've been disguising for 18 years.

252
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,760
Now you dress like a woman
to stroll the streets?

253
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,640
Do you think
people here are blind?

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,790
They all say I'm a man disguised
as a woman.

255
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
Your uncle is a sharp man.

256
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,640
If the rumor gets to him,

257
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,760
he'll suspect.

258
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
If he finds out the truth,

259
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,560
he won't let you be the head
of the family.

260
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
You're always focused
on these pointless things.

261
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,920
The head of the family.

262
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,760
Mother, can't you stop being so greedy?

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,840
Greedy?

264
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,520
To make me the head of the family,

265
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
you're driving me crazy.

266
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,440
It's all for the inheritance.

267
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,160
It's not even for me,

268
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,480
but for you!
