=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 26=

3
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,080
Why did he suddenly stop moving?

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,680
This belt is too hard to untie.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,840
Forget it, I'll just wash with it on.

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,240
(Why doesn't she go?)

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,120
(Why hasn't he started?)

8
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
(Luckily, I didn't leave.)

9
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,690
(Otherwise, he couldn't even
get into the tub.)

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,360
(This man is so proud.)

11
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,080
(He wouldn't call for help.)

12
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
Xiyu is so sweet.

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
The towel she prepared for me

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
is scented with incense.

15
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,960
It smells so good.

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,480
Who's there?

17
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,960
Bold cat.

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,760
How dare you peek at me bathing!

19
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,880
Go away!

20
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,200
Is it gone yet?

21
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,600
Go away!

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,120
It's still here?

23
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,440
Go away!

24
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
What a fierce cat.

25
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Xiyu, you're back.

26
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,080
I'm back.

27
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Are you done bathing?

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,400
I was bathing just fine,

29
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,840
then a cat came over

30
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,080
and just wouldn't leave.

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,840
Did you see that cat?

32
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,680
No, it might've already run away.

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,000
If it ran away, so be it.

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
If I see it again,

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,400
I'll catch it for you to play with.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,920
I don't want that.

37
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,600
What?

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,400
I said don't bully the cat.

39
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,600
If you provoke it again next time,

40
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
it won't just scratch you.

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,600
It'll bite you.

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,000
Xiyu, your hair is wet.

43
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
How do you know?

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,920
When you supported me
just now, I felt it.

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,160
How did your hair get wet?

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,800
I went out to wait for you just now

47
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,920
and it started raining.

48
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,600
It didn't rain earlier or later,

49
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,640
only when my future consort

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,920
was standing outside.

51
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,920
This rain god is really annoying.

52
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,560
It's nothing to have wet hair.

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,680
The rain god spreads his blessing.

54
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,000
Actually,

55
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,840
he's quite nice.

56
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,560
Since you say he's nice,

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,280
then he is.

58
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,240
Uncle.

59
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,080
Is that Xiyu?

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,680
Yes.

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,680
You two came.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,520
Here.

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,320
Turn around.

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,600
Sit.

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,440
OK.

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,160
Alright.

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,360
Uncle,

68
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
Xuanzhou ate too much dinner,

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
so we came for some tea.

70
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,360
I know you have plenty stored.

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
Can you share some with us?

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,320
Since you two are here,
I have everything.

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,760
Let me see.

74
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,320
You two are in for a treat.

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,200
This is what the emperor just bestowed.

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,080
I'll use your great-grandfather's tea set
to brew it.

77
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,240
I'll go get it.

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,640
I know where it is, I'll get it.

79
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,680
Xuanzhou, how are you feeling?

80
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,080
Better,

81
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,600
but sometimes I still sweat a bit.

82
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,320
No rush.

83
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,600
Take your time to recover.

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,520
Where's my handkerchief?

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Xuanzhou, you carry a lot of things.

86
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,960
Money is always necessary.

87
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,400
The jade pendant is from my mom.

88
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
This Blood Coral

89
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,280
is crucial evidence for a case.

90
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,600
I'll to return it to Hong Wuhui
when I see him.

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,120
Xuanzhou,

92
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,800
what's this you're holding?

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,680
I don't know.

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,240
You don't know?

95
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,600
I grabbed it randomly from Tu Wenjue.

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,160
At that time, I thought

97
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,320
even if I die,

98
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,320
I have to grab something from him.

99
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,640
So when others find my body,

100
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,240
they know who killed me.

101
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,040
But since Tu Wenjue is dead,

102
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,400
this thing is useless.

103
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
It feels like a letter.

104
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,760
Haven't you read it?

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,760
Not yet.

106
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,440
When I came back, my eyes were...

107
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,680
Uncle,

108
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,080
can you take a look for me?

109
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,080
Alright.

110
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Uncle, what's written on it?

111
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,640
I'm old

112
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,800
and my eyesight isn't good.

113
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,520
Let me

114
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,960
take a closer look
under the candlelight.

115
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,240
(I knew it.)

116
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,600
Uncle,

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,800
you're burning...

118
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
Why isn't there any sound?

119
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,400
Xiyu, what did you just say was burning?

120
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,280
I asked what tea uncle was brewing.

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
Didn't he just say

122
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,040
the tea bestowed by the emperor?

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,520
We're in for a treat.

124
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,760
Uncle, what does it say?

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,200
It's hard to see at night.

126
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Let me look again.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
Xuanzhou,

128
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,560
what did you show uncle?

129
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,920
When I was in the woods,

130
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,600
I took this from Tu Wenjue.

131
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,840
I don't know what it is,

132
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
so I asked uncle for help.

133
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,640
What are you doing?

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,490
(This is
great-grandfather's handwriting.)

135
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,040
(Our family and the Chen Crown Prince
actually...)

136
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,760
(So this is what dad wanted
to say before he died,)

137
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,480
(the secret of Blood Coral.)

138
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,920
Why isn't anyone talking?

139
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,680
Are you boiling the water?

140
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,320
Yes.

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
Xiyu, come on.

142
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,540
Come help me get some silver charcoal.

143
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,440
Wait a moment.

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,480
Hurry.

145
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,000
Fortunately, he's blind

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,290
and didn't see this blood letter.

147
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,800
Fortunately?

148
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Fortunately?

149
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,200
I misspoke.

150
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
But Xiyu, remember,

151
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
you're a Hua family member.

152
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,640
If people find out,

153
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,400
not only you,

154
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,120
even your mom will be implicated.

155
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,920
So, give it to me.

156
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,160
I'll burn it, end of story.

157
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Burning it is just deceiving ourselves.

158
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,440
Xiyu.

159
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,760
Xiyu.

160
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,990
Got the silver charcoal?

161
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
Here.

162
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,960
Xiyu, give it to me.

163
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,390
(I wanted to handle it privately
to avoid upsetting her,)

164
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,920
(but she still found out.)

165
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,840
Uncle, is that letter important?

166
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,960
If it is, I'll return it to Hong Wuhui.

167
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,440
If not, you can dispose of it.

168
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
I've read it.

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,090
It's just a family letter,
useless to keep.

170
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
I'll burn it for you.

171
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,440
This isn't a family letter.

172
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,920
It's a letter from great-grandfather
to Chen's Crown Prince.

173
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,860
Back then, great-grandfather

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,800
received Blood Coral
from the Crown Prince

175
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,680
and wrote this letter in blood.

176
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,960
As a minister of Chen,

177
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,680
great-grandfather joined Yan
after surrendering,

178
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,800
all to be an inside man

179
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,080
for the restoration of Chen.

180
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,440
After all the investigation,

181
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,360
turns out I'm also

182
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,440
part of the rebels.

183
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,720
You're wrong.

184
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,980
If he didn't uncover
Marquis Wen's conspiracy

185
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,520
and wasn't loyal to the emperor,

186
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,280
your dad wouldn't have been killed.

187
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Your dad was loyal.

188
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,600
You're a loyal minister's daughter.
