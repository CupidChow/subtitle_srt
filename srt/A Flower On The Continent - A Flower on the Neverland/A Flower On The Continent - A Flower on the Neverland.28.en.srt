00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 28=

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,920
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,800
I hated them.

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,040
Though I was coerced

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,040
and had to join them,

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,800
I still wanted them dead.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,160
I wanted to avenge my brother.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,520
It was you who killed your brother.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,640
What are you saying?

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,000
You didn't tell your brother

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,440
because you were uneasy.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,960
He discovered your collusion
with Marquis Wen.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,360
To stop him from revealing it,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,240
you killed him.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,080
Marquis Wen and Tu Wenjue were present
at the scene.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,640
They knew what you did.

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,440
That's why you wanted them dead.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,360
No!

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,040
I didn't!

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,920
In the grand mansion of the Hua family,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
there are many guards and servants.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,120
When Xiyu's father died,

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
nobody but you saw the assassin.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,800
You just emphasized to Xiyu's mother

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,440
Xiyu's father died by an assassin's sword.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,040
But I personally examined him.

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,660
Xiyu's father had fractured bones
on his skull,

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,950
indicating he died from
a heavy blow to the head.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,000
You...

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,240
You dug up my brother's grave?

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,840
If it helps the deceased find peace,

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,200
so what if I dug up the grave?

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,840
You...

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,160
Based on the fractured bones,

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,560
it could've been done by someone else.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,960
You have no evidence.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,960
You don't.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,360
No, I have no other evidence,

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
but this reasoning

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,680
explains why you did

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,720
those crazy things.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,580
You hired an assassin and set traps,

44
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,880
personally killed Marquis Wen

45
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,440
and poisoned Tu Wenjue.

46
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,880
It also explains

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
why you've been so good to Xiyu.

48
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,880
Because you killed her dad
with your own hands,

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
you want to compensate her at all costs.

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,680
No, it wasn't me.

51
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,040
It was them, not me.

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
You know best whether or not it was you.

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Where are you going?

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,200
Don't tell Xiyu.

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
I beg you.

56
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,960
I can't bear to tell her,

57
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,800
but justice will prevail
and karma will come.

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,360
For the innocent people
of the two countries,

59
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,880
for Xiyu's parents,

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,160
I can't let this matter go.

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,400
You have one day.

62
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,800
What you do is up to you.

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
Hua Chenghao,

64
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,600
how could you do such a thing?

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,320
Chengyi, I didn't want to.

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,890
They used grandfather's blood letter
to coerce me.

67
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,240
If I didn't help Marquis Wen,

68
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,580
our Hua family would be finished.

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
Foolish!

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,240
- Chengyi!
- How can the Hua family

71
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,520
compare to the lives of people
in two countries?

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,760
Chengyi, there are dozens of lives
in the Hua family.

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,360
Chengyi!

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,240
Let's go.

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,280
Come with me to see the emperor.

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,040
No, Chengyi.

77
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,890
I'm already implicated
and can't clear myself.

78
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,760
Chengyi.

79
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,880
It's not too late to repent.

80
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,600
Chengyi!

81
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,440
- Let's go!
- Chengyi!

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,480
- Chengyi!
- Come with me!

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,920
Don't force me.

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
Don't force me!

85
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,000
Chengyi!

86
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,840
Chengyi!

87
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,640
Chengyi, I didn't mean to.

88
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Chengyi!

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
I didn't mean to.

90
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,680
You're a disgrace of the Hua family.

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,680
He...he wanted to report to the emperor.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,960
I didn't mean to.

93
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,760
Then give him a quick death.

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,000
No!

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,760
Kill him.

96
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,320
If he doesn't die,

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
we'll all die.

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,000
Kill him.

99
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,360
Don't let him escape.

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,720
Hurry, say there's assassin!

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,440
Quickly!

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Assassin! Assassin!

103
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,440
My dear.

104
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,200
My dear!

105
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
My dear!

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,880
Blood...

107
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,640
Blood...

108
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
Coral...

109
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,520
Coral...

110
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
My dear!

111
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,120
Blood Coral...

112
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,120
My dear!

113
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Chengyi,

114
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm so sorry.

115
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,000
The emperor of Ning

116
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,120
is really something.

117
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,400
Instead of arranging your marriage,

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,640
he sends Xuanzhou to the border.

119
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,560
What kind of brother does that?

120
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,560
Our marriage is nothing

121
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
compared to the truce

122
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
and peace between the two countries.

123
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,520
But he didn't have to take you along.

124
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,200
The border's windy and dusty.

125
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,400
It's bad for a woman's skin.

126
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,960
Mother, Xuanzhou goes for Ning

127
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,480
and I go for Yan.

128
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,200
We both go to care
for the suffering people.

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,950
The righteous way doesn't differentiate.

130
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
Serving the country knows no gender.

131
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Alright.

132
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,160
I'm just saying.

133
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,600
I'm not one to disregard
the bigger picture.

134
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,840
Take care of yourself out there.

135
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,360
If you miss me, send a letter.

136
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,520
Xuanzhou,

137
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,600
Xiyu has never traveled far before.

138
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,000
Take good care of her.

139
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,520
Certainly.

140
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,760
Then I'll leave Xiyu in your care.

141
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Rest assured, auntie.

142
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,760
Let's go.

143
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,840
We haven't said goodbye to Uncle.

144
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,520
Yes, we should pay our respects.

145
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,960
Yes, go see your uncle.

146
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,720
Uncle.

147
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,560
Uncle.

148
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,160
Uncle has been exhausted lately.

149
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,720
Let's not disturb him.

150
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,960
Come in.

151
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,360
It's time to depart?

152
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,400
If you confess to the emperor,

153
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,560
we don't know if you'll be forgiven.

154
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
I wanted to stay for the news,

155
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,840
but Xuanzhou must go to the border now.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,160
Though we've stopped fighting,

157
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,000
the border people still live in fear
after years of suffering.

158
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,640
There are many refugees.

159
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Xiyu and I must go to comfort them.

160
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Good.

161
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,400
Very good.

162
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Xiyu,

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,800
you're very much like your father.

164
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,520
Why bother disguising as a man?

165
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,800
You've inherited your father's spirit.

166
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,200
You're better than a man.

167
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,360
Go.

168
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
I'll handle things here.

169
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Don't worry.

170
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Xiyu.

171
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,560
I...

172
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,600
I wish you a happy life.

173
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,360
Good.

174
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,160
Go now.

175
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,160
Take care.

176
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,320
Chengyi,

177
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm coming to apologize to you.

178
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:15,660
(Hua Mansion)

179
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,590
This is a new letter
from Chancellor Hua.

180
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,600
He confessed everything in it.

181
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,600
I'll deliver it to the emperor.

182
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,160
Take Chancellor Hua away after we leave.

183
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
When I arrived,

184
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,400
Chancellor Hua had already
ended his life.

185
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,240
In the end, he couldn't face

186
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
what he had done.

187
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,960
If Xiyu finds out,

188
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,160
she'll be heartbroken.

189
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,560
So I need to take her away.

190
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,520
