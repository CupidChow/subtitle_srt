00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,760
(In the 11th year of Jiashou,)

4
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,640
(Marquis Wen of Yan was sent
as an envoy to Ning.)

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,280
(He was assassinated en route,)

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,480
(leading to the possibility
of rekindled war)

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,920
(between Yan and Ning.)

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,000
(To prevent this, Prince Ning Xuanzhou,
brother of the King,)

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
(traveled alone to Yan.)

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,400
Tell my brother,

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,880
I won't fail him.

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,480
Hua Xiyu,

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,240
my sweetheart.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,880
You're about to cause big trouble.

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,140
Aren't you afraid of being seen?

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,960
There's no one else in my room.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,200
No one will see.

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,120
Where is it?

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,880
Mom, it's hurting me.

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,690
For the sake of your dead father,
endure it a little longer.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,400
I've endured it for 18 years.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,200
Since birth, you've forced me
to disguise as a man.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,880
Can't I be a woman just once?

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,040
In a few years, you can.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,160
The eldest son can take over
as family head at 20.

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,440
After retrieving Blood Coral
from your uncle...

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,280
Blood Coral again.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,320
Mom, all you care about is Blood Coral.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,240
My dear husband...

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Mom, come on.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
Stop crying. I'll endure it, OK?

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,320
Then hurry over.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,880
Madam.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,080
What's the matter? Is there an issue?

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,660
Fragrance Teahouse reported,

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
the guest Master Hua invited has arrived.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,760
They wonder when you'll be over.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,960
Tell them I'll be there shortly.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,840
Another girl joined us today.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,320
Fragrance Teahouse is becoming
more lively.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,720
Indeed, I think she came for Master Hua.

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,400
Of course.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Yes, only Master Hua would be so kind

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,120
to take in us unfortunate women.

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,840
Indeed, Master.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,120
Today, I'm wearing the lipstick
you gave me.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,840
Look.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,880
The color is beautiful.

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,920
As long as you like it.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,720
I do.

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
Here, Master.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
(I want to wear it too.)

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,320
This powder smells so nice.

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,280
You're the sweetest.

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,080
Exactly.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
(I want to wear it too.)

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,160
Master, the guest is still waiting.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,400
Let him in.

59
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,420
(Fragrance Teahouse)

60
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,160
Master Hua, how can I help you?

61
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,920
Nothing much, just inviting you
to a meal.

62
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
Master Hua, you're too kind.

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Master Hua, this...

64
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,920
Last month, I gave you money

65
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,910
to help those refugees from the border,

66
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,280
but you pocketed it

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
by using rotten rice
instead of good rice.

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,240
Master Hua, let me explain.

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,420
I don't want your explanation.

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,960
I want you to eat this bucket of rice

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
to taste what the refugees tasted.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,160
This...this is too much.

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,720
Well...

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,800
The current Chancellor,
Hua Chenghao, is my uncle.

75
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
General Wuhui is my sworn brother.

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,320
So what if I force you?

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,040
Who are you?

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,520
Daring to ambush here?

79
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,240
Marquis Wen was sent to Ning,

80
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,360
but was assassinated on the border.

81
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,840
War between the two countries
could break out at any moment.

82
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,560
Who is the mastermind behind this?

83
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,760
My patience is running thin.

84
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,960
I'll give you two choices.

85
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Two choices for you.

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
Either eat now...

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,360
You confess now...

88
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,720
Or eat on the road to the afterlife.

89
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,440
Or you confess after I torture you.

90
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
I don't know.

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,160
Master Hua, I really can't eat anymore.

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
You can.

93
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,840
If refugees can eat it, so can you.

94
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,640
Not confessing, huh?
Then suffer some more.

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,160
Not eating, huh?

96
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,200
I'll personally feed you.

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,800
Speak, who killed Marquis Wen?

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Help!

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,520
Help!

100
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,240
Hong Wuhui?

101
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,890
Why did you suddenly return
from the border?

102
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,480
For my uncle.

103
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,920
Marquis Wen was really killed by Ning?

104
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,440
If not them, then who?

105
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,000
That's to say,

106
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,840
Yan and Ning are going to war again?

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
I do want a good fight,

108
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,160
but the new king of Ning is a coward.

109
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,880
He refuses to admit Marquis Wen's death
is related to him.

110
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
He even wants to send his brother
to Yan to study.

111
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,680
Study?

112
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,920
Only in name.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,080
In fact, he's a hostage.

114
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
He's a frail scholar
who's powerless to do anything.

115
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,120
Just a useless pretty boy.

116
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,040
Hearing you,

117
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,160
you seem to know this hostage well.

118
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,960
Of course, I escorted...

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,120
No, I protected him to the capital.

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
And now, he's at my house.

121
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,720
You dare come here then?

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,200
Aren't you afraid he'll run away?

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
If he runs,

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
that means Ning is guilty.

125
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,440
War will break out immediately.

126
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,880
He can't bear the responsibility.

127
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,800
They're going to kill you.

128
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,890
You still won't talk?

129
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,080
I'll go check.

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
You stay put here.

131
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,000
Do I look like someone who stays put?

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,600
A new girl? She's very shy.

133
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,360
(That dress is beautiful.
I want to wear it too.)

134
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,490
Who ordered you to ambush
Marquis Wen at the border?

135
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,320
I won't betray my master.

136
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
Why frame Ning?

137
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,560
Yan and Ning can only be enemies.

138
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,960
Don't think of reconciling.

139
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,160
Come out.

140
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,110
I'm a Shadow Guard, Fei Ying.

141
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,800
I arrived late.

142
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,790
Forgive me, Your Highness.

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're a prince.

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,440
You shouldn't risk coming to Yan.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm the Shadow Guards' commander.

146
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,660
If I don't come, who will?

147
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,940
We must find the culprit quickly

148
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,840
to prevent this war.

149
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,440
Yes.

150
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,980
(Yong'an Academy)

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Good morning.

152
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,240
Morning.

153
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,480
Mister Li.

154
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,960
This matter is hard to explain.

155
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,560
Morning.

156
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,080
Xiyu, morning.

157
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
You're all very early.

158
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
The master is here.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
Today,

160
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,640
I'll introduce a new student.

161
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,160
Xuanzhou.

162
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
(Yesterday's shy girl?)

163
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,880
(Yesterday's frivolous guy?)

164
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm Ning Xuanzhou.

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,880
(Did she take a voice-changing pill?)

166
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,400
No need.

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,400
She can't be...

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,200
This is the prince of Ning.

169
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,640
Prince?

170
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,400
That's clearly...

171
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,360
Is what?

172
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,720
Nothing.

173
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,520
(This girl's disguise as a man
is very convincing.)

174
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Xuanzhou is from Ning.

175
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
From today onwards,

176
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,640
he'll study with you at the academy.

177
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,980
(She's better disguised than me.)

178
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,560
(Oh no, I'm being targeted.)

179
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,280
(This is a rare encounter.)

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,720
You're from Ning?

181
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,960
Why come to our academy?

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,630
- Yes.
- Right.

183
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,320
What is going on?

184
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,760
Stop shouting.

185
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,320
Where's your decorum as scholars?

186
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,880
Xuanzhou, you can go.

187
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,360
Xiyu, you...

188
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,040
Don't do that.

189
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,000
If you trip me, you can't afford to pay.

190
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,120
(This girl will have a tough time)

191
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,400
(at the academy.)

192
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,160
(His behavior is suspicious.)

193
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
(Did he see through me?)

194
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,760
Another thing to announce.

195
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Last night, the academy caught fire.

196
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,200
Most of the dorms were burned down.

197
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,400
So no single rooms are available
this time.

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,720
You'll share rooms in pairs.

199
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,080
You'll eat, live, and sleep together.

200
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
Sleep together? This is bad.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,760
Master, my home is close.

202
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,680
I want to live at home.

203
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,760
(If my mom knows,
she'll stop my studies.)

204
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,440
Yes, let us live at home.

205
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,120
Yes, Master.

206
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,880
No way.

207
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,040
Get familiar with each other.

208
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,520
Xiyu, share a room with me.

209
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Help me with my studies.

210
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,440
Are you crazy?

211
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,440
Xiyu can only share a room with me.

212
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,680
Are you crazy?

213
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,590
Taking advantage of me?

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
We're brothers.

215
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,490
I won't take advantage of you.

216
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,320
I'm not sure about them.

217
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,800
There are only men here.

218
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,190
Who will you pick if not me?

219
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,040
(Of course, I'd pick the girl.)

220
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,080
(No way.)

221
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,760
I pick her as my roommate.

222
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,360
You pick the guy from Ning?

223
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,520
Yes.

224
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,720
Since you all reject her,

225
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,120
I'll take care of this guest

226
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,160
on behalf of His Majesty.

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,880
(What are they doing?)

228
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,560
(Is it a trap?)

229
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,760
Are you mad?

230
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,840
How can you share a room with a man?

231
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,640
She's powerless.

232
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,160
She looks safer than you.

233
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
(I'll stick to the plan.)

234
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,360
You don't trust me?

235
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,240
I disagree.

236
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,120
You can't pick him.

237
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,720
Then I still won't pick you.

238
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,960
You don't pick me, then I'll pick him.

239
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,160
Shameless.

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,960
Don't touch her.

241
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
Don't you dare touch him.

242
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,800
Stop pulling.

243
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,920
I'm doing this for you.

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,040
Choosing her is best.

245
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,680
You two...

246
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,440
Shut up.

247
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,040
- I picked first.
- Come with me.

248
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,040
I picked first.

249
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,800
- Let go.
- Come on.

250
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,520
You let go.

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,390
- You can't pick him.
- Let her go.

252
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,360
Hong Wuhui has some strength.

253
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,000
I really can't win against him.

254
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,760
Luckily, the master came in time.

255
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,000
Seeing us both picking you,

256
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
he let you decide.

257
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,880
Why did you pick me?

258
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,240
(Could she know I'm also
disguised as a man?)

259
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,640
Because you...

260
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,120
(You have no martial skills
and are easier to kill.)

261
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,390
You seem easier to get along
than General Hong.

262
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,360
I see.

263
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,920
Please.

264
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,440
(She doesn't know I'm a woman.)

265
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
(His smile is so fake.)

266
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,680
(Seems he knows I have a secret.)

267
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,640
Just say it, I know your identity.

268
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,320
Identity?

269
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
Why pretend?

270
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,600
Last night, I learned your secret.
