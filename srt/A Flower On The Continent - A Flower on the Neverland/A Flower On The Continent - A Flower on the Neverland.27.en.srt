00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 27=

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,400
Eighteen years ago,

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,560
Marquis Wen suddenly appeared

5
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,560
with this blood letter
and the piece of Blood Coral.

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,080
He found me,

7
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,880
demanding us Hua family
fulfill the promise

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,480
to help him with a small matter
at the border.

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,040
You massacred villages and framed Ning

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,200
to incite war between us.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,330
You call that a small matter?

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:10,920
No.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,600
At that time, I didn't know
he'd commit such heinous acts.

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,400
He only asked me to make it easier
for his men to leave the city.

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,880
But I've always been
a cautious official

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,690
and I didn't dare get involved
in even this.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,640
So I didn't help him.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
He spared you?

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,000
He was afraid I'd expose him.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,440
I was afraid he'd reveal
my grandfather's blood letter

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,760
and the emperor
would punish us.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,440
Both sides had fears,

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,200
so we were at a temporary stalemate.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,560
What about dad?

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
How did he die?

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,180
When I heard about the village massacre,

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,880
I was very uneasy,

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,120
so I told my brother about Marquis Wen.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,840
Upon hearing it, he said
regardless of implicating our family,

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,440
he had to report it to the emperor.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,840
But before he could,

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
he was brutally killed

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
by assassins sent by Marquis Wen.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,160
Mother.

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,400
You knew all along
who killed Xiyu's father,

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,360
yet you kept it a secret.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,200
Madam Hua, I didn't dare to speak out.

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,480
For many years, Marquis Wen had been
highly respected in Yan.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,600
Though I knew he was wicked and evil,

40
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,200
I was weak

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
and had no evidence at hand.

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,400
Besides, if he could kill Xiyu's father,

43
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,320
he could kill you too.

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,880
I don't care if I die.

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
I was just worried about Madam Hua

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,000
and the newly born Xiyu.

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,560
Marquis Wen threatened

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
if we made any move,

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,240
he'd annihilate the entire Hua family.

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,320
So, I had to wait

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
for Xiyu to grow up.

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,280
Now that Xiyu is 18,

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,360
you've decided to avenge your brother?

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Originally,

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
I planned to wait until Xiyu was 20,

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,320
hand over the Hua family to her

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,400
and go ahead with my plan.

58
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,800
But with the new emperor
of Ning ascending,

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,760
and Marquis Wen going to Ning
for peace between the two countries,

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,460
I knew he was going
to make a move again.

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,960
Eighteen years ago, I lost my brother

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,600
and watched the people
of both countries suffer.

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,560
This time, I can't let
the villain succeed.

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,240
So, the assassin of Marquis Wen, Wu Hao,

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,760
was indeed sent by you?

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,640
Yes.

67
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,080
I knew Marquis Wen's crimes were severe,

68
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,720
but I had no evidence.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,620
The situation was urgent,
so to stop him,

70
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,040
I had to hire an assassin.

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
I've already

72
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,160
become a criminal myself.

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
Madam Hua,

74
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
I've let you down.

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
I implicated my brother

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
and caused his death.

77
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,840
For 18 years,

78
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,720
I've blamed myself every day

79
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,280
for being so cowardly back then.

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,760
I let you down.

81
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,880
I let down my brother

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,440
and Xiyu.

83
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,520
But I did it all to protect
the Hua family.

84
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
Chenghao,

85
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,200
though grandfather
wrote the blood letter,

86
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,480
he did many good deeds for the people

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,120
as an official in Yan
after surrendering.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Whether he was right or wrong,

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,400
it's not for future generations
to judge.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,200
But we can be honest
and upright ourselves.

91
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,880
Your father and grandfather

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,640
worked diligently all their lives.

93
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Your brother

94
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,560
was loyal and patriotic,

95
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
upright and incorruptible.

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,440
Since you didn't participate
in Marquis Wen's evil deeds,

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,040
you should report the truth
to the emperor.

98
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,240
Even if guilty of concealing the truth,

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,040
the emperor might consider
your brother's

100
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,000
loyalty and sacrifice

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
and show some leniency.

102
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,280
Yes.

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,040
Madam Hua, you're right.

104
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,360
In fact,

105
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,880
I've already written everything down,

106
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,840
ready to confess to the emperor.

107
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,000
Before I hand it over,

108
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,400
I hope to see Xiyu find a good match.

109
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,880
Then I can face my brother in heaven

110
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
with some peace of mind.

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,000
Uncle.

112
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,480
Xiyu.

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,920
Madam. Hua.

114
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,360
Don't be sad.

115
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,720
After all these years,

116
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,960
Uncle can finally face everything
with peace.

117
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
It's a good thing.

118
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,560
Great-grandfather,

119
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,120
Father,

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,840
Uncle.

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,280
Though the truth is out,

122
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm deeply troubled.

123
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,400
Xuanzhou,

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm so sad.

125
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
It's my fault

126
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
to make you sad.

127
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,160
You didn't do anything wrong.

128
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,760
It has nothing to do with you.

129
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Of course it does.

130
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,560
If you're sad,
it means I didn't do well.

131
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,880
Don't cry.

132
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,360
Seeing you cry breaks my heart.

133
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,200
You...

134
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,640
You can see now?

135
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,240
I'm sorry,

136
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,640
I...

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,760
That's great!

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,160
Finally, some good news.

139
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,960
It's my fault.

140
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,800
I shouldn't have hidden it.

141
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
It doesn't matter.

142
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,600
As long as you're safe,

143
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,040
it's all that matters.

144
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,840
Your Highness.

145
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,400
You saw everything?

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,880
I was hiding

147
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,000
and saw what happened clearly.

148
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,840
I also checked the study.

149
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,640
Chancellor Hua indeed wrote
a letter of confession.

150
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,120
Do you believe what he said?

151
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,480
Does Your Highness not believe it?

152
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,000
For Xiyu's sake,

153
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,400
I truly hope

154
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,040
things are as simple as he said.

155
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Why are you here again? Where's Xiyu?

156
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Your eyes...

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,000
You were pretending to be blind.

158
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,960
You were plotting against me all along.

159
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,160
How did Marquis Wen find out

160
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,090
there was a secret passage
under your treasury?

161
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
It must've been

162
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,720
my grandfather who told
the Crown Prince of Chen

163
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,040
and the Crown Prince

164
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,960
told Marquis Wen.

165
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,040
No,

166
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,680
I investigated.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
When Prince Crown died,

168
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,480
this house hadn't been built.

169
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,280
You told Marquis Wen about the passage

170
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,360
to facilitate
your secret communications.

171
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,160
So, you must've participated
in Marquis Wen's crimes.

172
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,240
You were involved 18 years ago.

173
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,200
But now, as the Chancellor,

174
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,600
you no longer want to serve
the non-existent Chen

175
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,280
nor continue being threatened
by Marquis Wen.

176
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,680
So you ordered Marquis Wen
to be killed at the border.

177
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,480
You thought with Marquis Wen dead,

178
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
only the Tu Mountain Clan was left.

179
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,440
So you set an ambush at Luoma Mountain

180
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,960
to eliminate them.

181
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,480
Do you remember what he said

182
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,680
before he died?

183
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,920
Hua Chenghao,

184
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,400
you ungrateful,

185
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,760
faithless scoundrel...

186
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
Yes,

187
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,600
I intentionally killed Marquis Wen.

188
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,880
I'll turn myself in tomorrow

189
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,440
and await the emperor's punishment.

190
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,520
Congratulations, Your Highness.

191
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
You've achieved a great merit.

192
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,160
What more do you want?

193
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,640
(Confession)
You missed something in your confession.

194
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,400
What did I miss?

195
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,520
You assisted Tu Wenjue
in luring me to the woods.

196
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,960
Yes.

197
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,800
You set up traps

198
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,120
and poison in the woods to kill us.

199
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,080
Yes.

200
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,880
I felt the people you most wanted
to silence

201
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,320
were Marquis Wen and Tu Wenjue.

202
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,080
You took several attempts

203
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,560
to kill them.

204
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,680
Yes, that's right.

205
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,560
I hated them.

206
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,800
Though I was coerced

207
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,800
and had to join them,

208
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,560
I still wanted them dead.

209
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,920
I wanted to avenge my brother.

210
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,280
It was you who killed your brother.
