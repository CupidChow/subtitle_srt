=Episode 17=

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,120
Spare me.

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,440
Fei Ying, drag him further out.

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,080
The howls are frightening my wife.

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,960
Yes.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,720
Spare me.

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,080
If you marry the Shadow Guard Commander,

9
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,040
you'll encounter odd matters
frequently in the future.

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,080
Are you afraid?

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,120
No.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,760
Being afraid is OK.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,040
As long as I'm here,

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,160
no matter what happens,

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,760
I'll protect you.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,880
Drink this, and I pledge this vow.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,880
As long as I'm here,

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,880
I'll do my utmost to ensure your safety.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,760
If things don't go our way,

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
then we'll live and die together.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,880
I'm a man.

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,380
Do I still need you to protect me?

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,180
The way of the world knows no gender.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,800
What difference does it make?

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,680
Your Highness.

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,680
The person has confessed.

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,280
The insider in Ning is...

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,000
It's him?

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,920
Send word back to Ning now.

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
My brother will deal with the traitor.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
On Yan's side,

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
he's already drawn out
the smuggling routes.

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,280
He said in the capital of Yan,

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,720
the contact is an official
from the West Gate.

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
The official is just a small fry.

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,080
Who is the mastermind?

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,960
He said he's just a minor character

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
and has never seen the one behind it.

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520
He's already been tortured.

40
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,040
It doesn't seem like he's lying.

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,760
Your Highness,

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,960
how should we handle them?

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,440
Those criminals have seen my face.

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,480
We can't leave them.

45
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,040
Tie them up and secretly
send back to Ning.

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,480
My brother needs someone
to testify against the traitor.

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,360
As for the items,

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,440
I'll take those three Ning inkstones.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
Leave the rest to Hong Wuhui.

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,320
We Shadow Guards have been doing
all the work for them.

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,600
It's time for them to do something.

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,160
Yes.

53
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,420
(Yong'an Academy)

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,720
Remarkable.

55
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,040
Wuhui, you're impressive.

56
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,360
Since the last time I discovered
weapons and armor,

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
the emperor ordered thorough searches.

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
I dared not slack off,

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,320
spending all day with my men
searching the city.

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
We happened to encounter a house fire.

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,480
Once I entered,

62
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,320
the house was filled with Ning goods

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,160
which were worth a fortune.

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,360
Really.

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
Those were certainly

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,960
smuggled in by outlaws.

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,920
Inside, there was also a nameplate
of a gatekeeper.

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,880
I thought this must be evidence
of his collusion with the thieves.

69
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
I captured and questioned him.

70
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,040
Turned out I was right.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,880
One achievement after another.

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,080
Your house will likely be filled
with rewards

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,880
from the emperor.

74
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,680
Gold and silver are commonplace.

76
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,120
The most precious

77
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,560
is the authentic Ning Fragrance Wine.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,360
Let's share the rewards

79
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,680
for the country's merit.

80
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,360
Here, this jar is for you.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,380
- For us? Thanks, Wuhui.
- Thanks.

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Wuhui.

83
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,760
Let's go.

84
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,320
Xiyu,

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,960
this is the wine I saved for you.

86
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,080
Thank you.

87
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,720
But I drank too much last night.

88
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
I can't drink anymore today.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
Last night? Who did you drink with?

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,520
I...

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,120
What could he give you?

92
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
This is Ning Fragrance Wine

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
which money can't buy.

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
You've made several achievements.

95
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,840
I can't compare.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,440
Seeing you being sarcastic,

97
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,480
I just want to hit you.

98
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,960
Wuhui, stop it.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,680
Why do you keep giving Xuan a hard time?

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,880
You're protecting him again.

101
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,080
Xiyu, wake up.

102
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,640
I'm your sworn brother

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
and he isn't.

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,960
We aren't sworn brothers,

105
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,720
but we're something else.

106
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,760
What's that?

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
What he meant is,

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
since I can be sworn brothers with you,

109
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
I can also be with others.

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,880
Xiyu, you want to become sworn brothers
with him?

111
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,880
I...

112
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,120
I...

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,880
That's a good idea.

114
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
You and Xiyu are brothers.

115
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm also brothers with Xiyu.

116
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,560
Her brother is also my brother.

117
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,280
In the future, please take care
of me, Brother.

118
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
Who's your brother?

119
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,680
Xiyu, our brother is scolding me.

120
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,160
You're sowing discord.

121
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Can't you stop this?

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
Xiyu, do you have a brain?

123
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,720
You're all confused by this jerk.

124
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,080
It's OK for you to scold me.

125
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,760
Why are you scolding Xiyu?

126
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,160
You've known her for so many years.

127
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
She treats you so well.

128
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
Why don't you cherish her at all?

129
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,480
You...

130
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,240
If you want to hit, hit me.

131
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,080
Don't hit Xiyu.

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,960
Alright, stop the fuss.

133
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
Why do you keep provoking him?

134
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,040
Because he keeps angering you.

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,320
If it were someone else,

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,560
I'd have already killed them.

137
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,680
I know you'd be angry if I did it,

138
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,680
so I've been enduring it.

139
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,760
Because he's your sworn brother,

140
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,240
I let him take all the credits.

141
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,480
He took such great benefits from me

142
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,680
but he kept bullying me.

143
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,080
How could I not tease him?

144
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,560
You're so capable.

145
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
Who dares to bully you?

146
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,680
In your heart, am I really that capable?

147
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,200
I was being sarcastic.
I haven't even said anything

148
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
and you're already so proud.

149
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
How can I praise you?

150
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Good inkstones.

151
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,880
These are truly amazing.

152
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,280
I took these from the palace
when I came to Yan.

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,680
Yes, uncle, these are tribute inkstones.

154
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,760
Xiyu said you need good inkstones
to host the literary meeting.

155
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,720
That's why I brought them to you.

156
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,640
These are for me?

157
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,480
No way.

158
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,080
The inkstones are excellent,

159
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,910
but a gentleman doesn't take
what others value.

160
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,440
Uncle, he's sincere.

161
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,400
Please accept them.

162
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,920
You have outstanding literary talent.

163
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
I've long admired you.

164
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,560
So, please accept this token
of my esteem.

165
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,000
Since you both say so,

166
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
then I'm honored to accept it.

167
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
I'll choose this one.

168
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,360
They're all yours.

169
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,560
All?

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Yes.

171
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,760
No way.

172
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,320
One is already too valuable.

173
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,280
Three are definitely
out of the question.

174
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,640
Your Highness,

175
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,560
please take these two back.

176
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,720
Since I've brought them,
I won't take them back.

177
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,720
This...

178
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,840
Uncle,

179
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
as long as you're happy,

180
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,440
any inkstone is worth it.

181
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
I know you don't want to take
too many things from Xuan,

182
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,720
but he's my friend.

183
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,760
I'll repay

184
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,640
his favor.

185
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,160
Just consider it as a gift from me.

186
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
Let me fulfill my filial piety.

187
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,280
Xiyu, you've really grown up.

188
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,960
If only your dad could see this,
he'd be so happy.

189
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,880
Alright, then I'll accept all of them.

190
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Here,

191
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,240
take this one.

192
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,440
This...

193
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,680
It's not for you to play with.

194
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,840
You should practice writing with it.

195
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,480
Uncle, I have something to tell you...

196
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
This one,

197
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,240
I'll keep for you for now.

198
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,180
I'll take it out when you get married
to add a bit of glory.

199
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,080
What were you saying?

200
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,320
I'm saying,

201
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,560
isn't it too early to get married now?

202
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,840
It's not early.

203
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
From the day you were born,

204
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,080
small as a kitten,

205
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,280
I've been watching you grow every day.

206
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,040
Now, I'm just waiting
to attend your wedding.

207
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,920
Housekeeper.

208
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,160
Master.

209
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,280
Store it well

210
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,720
in the warehouse.

211
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,280
Take it out when Xiyu gets married
in the future.

212
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,120
Master, the warehouse is almost full.

213
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,440
Most of the good inkstones
in your collection

214
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,240
are for Master Hua's wedding.

215
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,280
In a scholarly family, we can't have
enough good inkstones.

216
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,160
Go ahead.

217
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,960
Yes.

218
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,120
This one is for the literary meeting,

219
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,320
so I'll take it to the study.

220
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
Your Highness,

221
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,960
thank you very much.

222
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm honored.

223
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,000
He truly cares for you.

224
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,520
So

225
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,560
how can I bear to tell him?

226
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,000
At first, I was very confused.

227
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,720
How could an inexperienced kid
like Hong Wuhui

228
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,880
defeat me at Luoma Mountain?

229
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Now I understand.

230
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,240
It was you who planned it.

231
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Hua Chenghao,

232
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,400
you've ruined my big plan.

233
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,680
How can I let you go?

234
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,280
I feel like I've been too...

235
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,080
I think I heard something.

236
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,200
People in my mansion make noise.

237
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,240
No, it's a very special sound.

238
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
Just now, your uncle said he'd take
the inkstone to the study.

239
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
Yes.

240
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,880
Uncle!

241
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,720
My uncle is in trouble.

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
I knew it's the Ning inkstone.

243
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,440
The sound of it breaking
is quite unique.

244
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,040
They must've abducted him
through the secret passage.

245
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,120
Those who captured Chancellor Hua
must be dangerous.

246
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,160
Stay here. I'll go.

247
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,120
No way, he's my uncle.

248
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,520
Then I'll go first.

249
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,360
You follow behind me.

250
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,780
You want to shut the door
and leave me outside, right?

251
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,310
I can follow you in the passage,

252
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,090
but I have to enter
the treasure vault first.

253
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,080
You guessed right.

254
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,520
I won't let you take the risk.

255
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,120
Ning Xuanzhou!

256
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,360
Dang it!

257
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,760
This voice sounds familiar.

258
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
This bird is really annoying.

259
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,120
