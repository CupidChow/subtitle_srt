00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,480
Xuan.

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,920
Xuan, are you alright?

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,480
What could happen to me?

6
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,880
But you, you went to bed
so early last night.

7
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,520
This morning, I saw you lying on the bed,

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,880
holding a pillow, completely still.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
You have no idea.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,080
That menacing thief really came

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,360
to seek revenge last night.

12
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,360
It was only because of my persistence

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,920
that he changed his mind.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,330
You barely escaped with your life.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,120
If he wanted to kill Hong Wuhui,

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,720
would you've fought so hard?

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,200
No, you're different.

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,920
Wuhui is skilled in martial arts,
so he can handle it.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,920
You're not the same.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,280
You're too easy to get killed.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm not that weak, alright?

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm not saying you're weak.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,360
It's just the thief was strong.

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,640
He was so big.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,520
His chest was like rock.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,990
It made a banging sound when I hit it.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,400
And when I tried to stop him,

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,520
his arms

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,960
were solid

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,120
without an ounce of fat.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
Seems like

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,120
he's a really strong

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,600
and powerful man.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,880
Exactly.

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,960
With such a strong build,

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
he could do anything,

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,790
but he chose to steal.

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,920
Maybe

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,480
he has his reasons.

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,360
He was going to kill you

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,840
and you still speak up for him?

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,120
Poor little fool.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,750
Even though you're skilled
in martial arts,

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,120
if you want to harm Xuan,

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,640
I won't let go even if I die.

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,680
(You're the real fool.)

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,480
Why aren't you wearing
the hairpin I gave you?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,320
I'm always disguised as a man.

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
I don't have time.

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm hungry.

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,820
I didn't even have dinner.

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,960
I'll find something to eat.

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,120
Your clothes are dirty.

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Change them.

55
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,520
Got it.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,080
In the court of Yan, everything is calm.

57
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,490
Chancellor Hua hasn't reported
about the firearms

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,080
and the content in the note.

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,760
Something is fishy.

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,520
The secret passage leads
to the Hua's treasury.

61
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,640
Did Chancellor Hua hire Wu Hao

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,800
to kill Marquis Wen?

63
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,280
It seems so.

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
But why did he

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
want to kill Marquis Wen?

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Marquis Wen visited him privately
before his departure.

67
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,360
Could it be

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,520
he discovered something
about Chancellor Hua?

69
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,120
How exactly did Xiyu's dad die
back then?

70
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,320
Did you find out?

71
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,720
Old matters are hard to investigate.

72
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
His enemy infiltrated the Hua family

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
and killed him.

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,120
The true culprit was never found
in 18 years.

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,600
Eighteen years?

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,000
Her father died the year Yan and Ning
went to war.

77
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,840
Yes.

78
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,600
After his father's death,

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,620
the two countries went to war
in no time.

80
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,080
The authorities had no resources
to hunt down the culprit.

81
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
With Marquis Wen's death,

82
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,360
we're about to go to war again.

83
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,640
It's such a coincidence

84
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,480
he visited the Hua Masion
before his death.

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,480
If Chancellor Hua is the mastermind
behind the conflict,

86
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,160
then Hua Xiyu...

87
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,890
Don't involve her.

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,160
He's who he is.

89
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,120
Xiyu is different.

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,040
Understood.

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,480
My mother broke it.

92
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,680
It's hard to explain.

93
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
It can't be repaired.

94
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,080
Find the best craftsmen.

95
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,120
Cost isn't an issue.

96
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,500
Craftsmen are easy to find.

97
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,600
The gem is rare.

98
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,280
Isn't it just ruby?

99
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,520
This is a Red Spirit Gem.

100
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
It has the power to ward off evil.

101
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
It looks like ruby,

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,880
but is much more precious.

103
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,120
Is it that rare?

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,280
This gem is found only
in Jun Mountain in Ning

105
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,000
and is considered a treasure
by the royals.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,060
They keep it in the palace.

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
By the way,

108
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,960
where did you get this hairpin?

109
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,760
Ning Xuanzhou?

110
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,120
Does he know you're a girl?

111
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
You're so annoying.

112
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,440
Xiyu.

113
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,520
Xiyu.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,910
Such a valuable gift
suggest he has an agenda.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
Weren't you out looking for food?

116
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,440
Why are you back?

117
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,960
I got full on the way.

118
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,120
Xuan,

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,920
the hairpin you gave me
is quite valuable, isn't it?

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
It's priceless.

121
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,120
I didn't buy it,

122
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
so it has no price.

123
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,400
When the emperor

124
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,800
tested the princes' knowledge,

125
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I got first place.

126
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,190
My mother was so happy
that she rewarded me with it.

127
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,600
It suits you better,

128
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,120
so the treasure won't go to waste.

129
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
Aren't you worried I'll damage it?

130
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,520
You promised to cherish it.

131
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,600
I believe you.

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
Of course, I keep my word.

133
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,880
(A consort's personal gift.)

134
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,720
(He even brought it with him
as a hostage in Yan.)

135
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,490
(It shows how much he treasures it.)

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
(But I...)

137
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,040
(Where can I find
another Red Spirit Gem?)

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,810
Where are you going?

139
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,920
To find food.

140
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,520
Didn't you just eat?

141
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,840
Are you hungry again?

142
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,320
Up to no good again.

143
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,960
Never a moment's peace.

144
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,740
(Hua Mansion)

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,320
Why did you tell me you went home?

146
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,080
Yesterday, with the blindfold,
I didn't see clearly.

147
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,560
This is what it's like.

148
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,280
He made me lift my foot,

149
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,160
so he must've brought me from there.

150
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,280
If I follow this passage,

151
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,800
I might find out where he went.

152
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,720
Looking for me?

153
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,390
- Mister...
- Don't turn around.

154
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,080
No need, we know each other well.

155
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,880
Mister...

156
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,920
No,

157
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,600
mister.

158
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,360
Firstly, I'm here today

159
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,560
to thank you
for sparing my life yesterday.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,800
And secondly?

161
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,160
To give you some money.

162
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,440
This is my savings
for the past 18 years.

163
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,080
I don't need your money.

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,160
I knew you were a chivalrous thief

165
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,260
and wouldn't take my money.

166
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
So I thought I'd use it

167
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,800
to hire you to go
to the Ning royal palace

168
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,890
and steal a Red Spirit Gem.

169
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,600
You want me to steal from
the Ning royal palace?

170
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,760
With your skills,

171
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,760
the Ning royal palace is no challenge.

172
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm not scared.

173
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,600
But why do you need a Red Spirit Gem?

174
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
To repair this.

175
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,680
You've agreed?

176
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,520
Take your money back.

177
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,760
Mister...

178
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,760
We're like-minded.

179
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,400
This deal is on me.

180
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,880
I'll get you the gem.

181
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,080
Being like-minded is so valuable?

182
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,200
Thank you, mister!

183
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,120
When will you go?

184
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

185
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,680
No need to go.

186
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
I happen to have one.

187
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,360
But you need to answer one question.

188
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,520
Ask away.

189
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,120
The person who gave you this hairpin,

190
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,800
do you like him?

191
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,560
How do you know someone else
gave me the hairpin?

192
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
Am I asking you or are you asking me?

193
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
Never mind.

194
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,400
Yes, I like him.

195
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,640
Really?

196
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,640
Really.

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,520
If someone gave you a valuable hairpin,

198
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,420
wouldn't you like them?

199
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,080
What if he doesn't give you anything?

200
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,400
I'd still like him.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,800
Really?

202
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,640
Of course.

203
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm not someone

204
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,840
who judges friends by their gifts.

205
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,320
As long as they're my friends,

206
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
even if they give me a stone,

207
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,400
I'd still like it.

208
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,120
So your liking for him

209
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,920
is brotherly?

210
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,600
Not entirely.

211
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
Sometimes it feels like...

212
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,680
Feels like what?

213
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,480
Like sisterly

214
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,320
and intimate.

215
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,320
Mister, you're in a bad mood?

216
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,760
Mister,

217
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,040
we share

218
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
such a valuable bond.

219
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,680
I must say something.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,920
With your skills,

221
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,800
you could do anything.

222
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,880
Why be a thief?

223
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Change your line of work.

224
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,520
Yes.

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
Since meeting you,

226
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,160
even being a thief is hard.

227
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,720
You've turned over a new leaf.

228
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Congratulations.

229
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,960
We must commemorate this.

230
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,120
Mister, take me with you.

231
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,200
Lift your foot.

232
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,540
(Clove Garden)

233
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,200
Squat down.

234
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,360
I've heard

235
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,120
my uncle cleared out
Clove Garden that night

236
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
and posted many guards.

237
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
He must have temporarily

238
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,320
moved the treasures there.

239
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,560
Doing good is

240
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,160
helping you steal your own heirloom?

241
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,360
I lost my father young.

242
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,920
My mother said seeing Blood Coral
is like seeing him.

243
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,320
If you help me steal it,

244
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
I can see my dad every day.

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,560
It's a good deed.

246
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,200
Who was advising me not to steal?

247
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,560
Turning over a new leaf
requires one last job, right?

248
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,160
Let's go.

249
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,390
Don't take it off yet.

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,960
Mister, if I can't see,

251
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,500
how will I cooperate with you?

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
You couldn't see but still led me here.

253
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,880
This is my home.

254
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,520
I played hide and seek here
when I was a kid.

255
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,480
But stealing things...

256
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,460
Leave the stealing to me.

257
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,120
Let's go.

258
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,600
Slow down.

259
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,720
Just stealing,

260
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,560
no hurting people.

261
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,320
Relax, they'll be asleep.

262
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,440
Let's go.

263
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
Watch your step.

264
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,040
Slow down.

265
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,480
The Red Spirit Gem wards off
all poisons,

266
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,280
including the smoke.

267
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,040
True.

268
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,160
But again,

269
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,960
mister,

270
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,920
why do you carry so many
Red Spirit Gems?

271
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
My family has many.

272
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,880
Many?

273
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,920
What?

274
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Many thieves.

275
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,640
We habitually

276
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
carry stolen valuables

277
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,720
for quick sale.

278
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,720
Family tradition, huh?

279
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,800
Mister,

280
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,960
we agreed, right?

281
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,880
You can take whatever you want here,

282
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,520
but Blood Coral is mine.

283
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,400
Don't worry.

284
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,320
Do you really want Blood Coral?

285
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,720
Yes, we had a deal.

286
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,480
You'd steal it.

287
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,960
You can't go back on your word.

288
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
If I get it, you carry it yourself.

289
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,320
Rest assured,

290
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,280
I won't peek at you.

291
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,720
So big.

292
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,520
You're from the Hua family

293
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,500
and you've never seen it?

294
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,920
Never.

295
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,480
Only the head of the family
is allowed to see it.

296
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,400
As if looking too much would ruin it.

297
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,320
So big.

298
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,920
I definitely can't carry it out.

299
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,120
What are you looking for?

300
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm looking for...

301
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,680
No need to tell me.

302
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,720
I'll keep watch outside.

303
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,520
Mister!

304
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm sorry!

305
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,640
I promise to follow the rule

306
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,800
and never peek at you again.

307
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,520
Actually, I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

308
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,960
I just know this Blood Coral
hides a secret.

309
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,360
A secret?

310
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Without you,

311
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,880
I wouldn't have found this Blood Coral.

312
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,000
So I'll tell you.

313
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,000
My father's last words before he died

314
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
were Blood Coral.

315
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,880
My mother thinks it's related
to his murder,

316
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
so I need to find the secret.

317
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,560
This...

318
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,800
This has no mechanisms

319
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,320
or hidden compartments.

320
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,520
Nothing is hidden inside.

321
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,120
What's the secret?

322
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,680
Where is it?

323
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,160
Xiyu,

324
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,760
this is just

325
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,280
a genuine Blood Coral.

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,160
It's rare because of its color

327
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,560
and large size.

328
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,400
No, my father spent his last breath
saying it.

329
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,920
It must hold a secret.

330
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Why was he killed?

331
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,360
It must be related.

332
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,720
You're hurt.

333
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,360
No.

334
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,520
Don't worry. I kept my word.

335
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,720
I didn't open my eyes

336
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
or peek at you.

337
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,520
If you really want to look, just look.

338
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,520
No, I don't want to die yet.

339
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,720
Why are they all lying here?

340
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,400
Smoke? There's a thief!

341
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,120
Let's go.

342
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,440
