=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,440
I knew my uncle wouldn't deceive me.

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,980
Did you suspect he was deceiving you

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,680
because he had his reasons?

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,600
Yes.

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,360
But speaking of that,

8
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,590
with such a generous betrothal gift list
for my mother,

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,680
where did you get the money?

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,760
Do you remember the weapons and armor

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,360
Hong Wuhui found
at the civilian house?

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,840
Besides the weapons and armor,

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,360
he also found several boxes

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,480
of valuable jewels.

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,720
You kept the treasures for yourself?

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,080
I discovered them first.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,160
I already gave half to Yan.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,280
That's very generous.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,880
I can't help Yan for nothing.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,680
My fees are usually quite high.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,080
You're quite proud.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,040
Making money to please
the mother-in-law is necessary

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,920
to pamper my wife.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
Who's your wife?

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,480
You've accepted the gift list,

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,270
but won't admit it?

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,440
That's pocket money,
not the betrothal gift.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,760
Alright.

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,160
Someone is already anxious for me
to settle the betrothal gift.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,280
Fine.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,280
Since you don't like those things,

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,240
how about I give you my heart?

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,360
Your academic line is good,

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,320
but your health line is a bit lacking.

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,440
You should rest more while studying.

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,280
Uncle, you came.

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,040
Xiyu, who is this?

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,080
A classmate from the academy,
Ning Xuanzhou.

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
The one from Ning?

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,280
Hello, Uncle.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,280
Your Highness is quite unpretentious.

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,520
We share the same interests

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,160
and are good friends at the academy.

44
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
We almost swore brotherhood.

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,280
My elder

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
is his elder,

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,680
so he feels very close to you

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,080
and calls you Uncle as well.

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
When did you learn to read palm lines?

50
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,800
I learned it for fun,

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,980
so I just commented casually.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
But his health isn't very good,

53
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,680
so just now,

54
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,840
I measured his heartbeat,

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,160
checked his pulse

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,960
and reminded him to rest more.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,240
I see.

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
I thought you two...

59
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,280
Silly child.

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,200
When measuring the pulse,
don't press here.

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,320
Press here, or here.

62
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,480
Here.

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,880
Here.

64
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm quite busy.

65
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,880
Entertain your classmate properly.

66
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
Uncle, take care.

67
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,960
You have quite a nerve.

68
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,320
Aren't you afraid he'll find out?

69
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm not afraid.

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
I am.

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
Xiyu, you can't hide it
from him forever.

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
I feel very guilty too because...

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,160
Since childhood, my uncle
has been the most caring.

74
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,680
Last time I told him about Blood Coral,

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,960
he was distressed.

76
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,260
He said after all these years,

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,390
he only learned about my father's
last words.

78
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,160
Seeing him so sad,

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
I felt extremely guilty.

80
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,440
He spent 18 years carefully nurturing

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
the Hua family heir,

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,520
who turned out not to be a man.

83
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,320
I really can't bear to tell him.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,920
All these years,

85
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,240
I've been pretending and deceiving him.

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
I also have to pretend every day

87
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,080
to be a brother to the woman I love.

88
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,080
I know this is difficult for you, too.

89
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,880
It's not difficult.

90
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,760
You look charming as a man.

91
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,280
But we have to face
what needs to be faced.

92
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,080
How about this?

93
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,720
We take care of uncle well

94
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,240
and make him happy.

95
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
When you're ready,

96
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,120
we can find a suitable time

97
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,840
to slowly explain things to him.

98
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,120
Alright.

99
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,040
But what if he gets angry
when I tell the truth?

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Chancellor Hua holds
the Winter Literary Meeting every year.

101
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,240
This event needs good inkstones.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,040
How about we give him
some Ning inkstones as gifts?

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,480
Sure, Ning inkstones are renowned.

104
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,580
He'll definitely like them.

105
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,320
How many did you bring this time?

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,480
I came in a hurry

107
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,440
and didn't bring any.

108
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,040
The meeting is at month-end.

109
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,960
Even if you send someone
back to Ning now,

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,840
it'll be too late.

111
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,280
It's hopeless.

112
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,520
Hopeless?

113
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,320
With me here,

114
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,680
I'll definitely make it work.

115
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
What are you two up to?

116
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
Buying something.

117
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,680
Go to the store then.

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
What are you doing here?

119
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
The emperor is far away.

120
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,640
The roads are dusty.

121
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,160
Where did you descend?

122
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
Wang from City South.

123
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,920
Please.

124
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,280
There's so much
Ning Fragrance Wine here.

125
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,680
Do you have Ning inkstones?

126
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,040
Yes, sure.

127
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Here, look.

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,680
Amazing, suitable for tribute.

129
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
You have good taste.

130
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,160
This is a tribute inkstone
for the Ning royal family.

131
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,520
Only with our connections in Ning

132
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,920
can we get a few.

133
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,720
How much?

134
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,560
Each one

135
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
costs this amount.

136
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,680
So expensive. Are you trying to rob us?

137
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,960
It's reasonable.

138
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
They painstakingly obtained it from Ning

139
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,880
and transported from afar.

140
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,000
Exactly.

141
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,080
You're quite understanding, Young Master.

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
Young Master, which one do you like?

143
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,560
All of them.

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Great.

145
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
But I didn't bring any money today,

146
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,160
so I'll take them for free.

147
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,840
You...

148
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,320
Turns out you're the robber?

149
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,200
That's right.

150
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,240
Kid, do you know where this is?

151
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,120
Of course.

152
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,880
The Gray Gang exploited
Ning and Yan's discord,

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,280
colluding on all sides
and engaging in rampant smuggling.

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,530
You've already made quite a bit.

155
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
Today, we're here to help you pack up.

156
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,480
Wait here.

157
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,760
Your Highness.

158
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,040
His people are in control.

159
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,520
Take them away and interrogate them.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,520
Take him.

161
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

162
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
- Go.
- We'll see.

163
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,120
The emperor learned you're injured,

164
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,160
so he sent a secret medicine
via the falcon.

165
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
You're injured.

166
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,720
When did it happen?

167
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,560
Shut up.

168
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,240
Sorry, Your Highness.

170
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,480
What princess?

171
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
Stop talking nonsense.

172
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,840
That's right, don't be veiled.

173
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,240
Be straightforward.

174
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
Are you joking?

175
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
I don't dare.

176
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Excuse me.

177
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,720
Wait. Give me the medicine.

178
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Please take care

179
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,360
of His Highness's injury.

180
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,520
Hurry up.

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,990
(You should be punished.)

182
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,040
(Since you're smart,)

183
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,840
(I'll let you off.)

184
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,190
Thank you, Your Highness.

185
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,640
Where are you injured?

186
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
The wound is severe.

187
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,480
You wouldn't like it.

188
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,680
Where are you injured?

189
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,920
Don't do that.

190
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Clumsy.

191
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,320
What if you touch the wound?

192
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,280
Isn't it bad?

193
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,020
What's bad about it?
I can't take advantage of you, can I?

194
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,240
You're so injured

195
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,720
and you said nothing?

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,720
Does it hurt?

197
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,280
I'm asking you if it hurts.

198
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,920
It doesn't.

199
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,740
It looks severe,
are you sure it doesn't?

200
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,040
It hurts a lot.

201
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,160
Stop lying to me.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,260
You wouldn't believe me before.

203
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,680
And now you scold me.

204
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,920
Annoying. I'm not talking to you.

205
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
Stop hissing. If it hurts...

206
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,680
If it hurts, drink some wine.

207
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,480
Wuhui said drinking wine
can relieve pain.

208
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,240
Alright.

209
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,480
This is the best Fragrance Wine.

210
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,920
Have some too.

211
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,280
I...I don't...

212
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
Wuhui said you love this wine.

213
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm busy.

214
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,520
Did I hurt you?

215
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,760
Be gentle. Don't shake your hand.

216
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,760
I'm not shaking.

217
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
The wound is very sensitive.

218
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,560
You think you didn't,

219
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,840
but you did.

220
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,480
Really?

221
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
But this pain is bearable. Keep going.

222
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,240
What should I do?

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,120
It's OK. You're flustered
because you care.

224
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,120
Take a sip of wine and calm down.

225
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,560
Is it fragrant?

226
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,880
Yes.

227
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,640
Have some more.

228
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,120
No, if I get drunk, your wound...

229
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,280
My wound doesn't matter.

230
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,040
I'll give you everything
you love in this world

231
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,480
to make you happy every day.

232
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,880
That's what's important.

233
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,720
Then let me finish bandaging you first
and then we can be happy.

234
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Don't you think this is like
on a wedding night

235
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,840
when we drink wedding wine?

236
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,080
Wedding wine isn't drunk like this.

237
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
How is it drunk?

238
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,080
Like this.

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,600
You...

240
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,160
What a jerk you are.

241
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,080
Since I'm a jerk,

242
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,640
