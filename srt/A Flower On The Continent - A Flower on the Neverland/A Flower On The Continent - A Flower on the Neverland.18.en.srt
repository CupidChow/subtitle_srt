=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,960
Xiyu, I haven't been
feeling well lately.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,560
I have a few lecture notes.

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,120
Can you help me copy them?

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,600
Sure.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,440
Xiyu, just copy them here.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,280
Yes.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,640
Master,

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,440
I remember there was a bird
in your courtyard

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,680
with a very unique chirp.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,560
Yes, how did you know?

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,400
I happened to pass by

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,320
and heard it.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,960
Why isn't it chirping today?

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,480
That bird

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,320
doesn't chirp every day.

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,560
It only chirps when there's
something going on.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,480
(Instead of chasing the bird away,)

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,440
(did he use the bird's chirp as a signal)

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
(to meet with someone?)

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,760
The emperor has decreed
on the first day of next month,

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,720
there will be a Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt
at Luoma Mountain.

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,680
You all need to attend.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
(He summoned the students
to Luoma Mountain.)

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,680
The one who wants to kill you
is Ning Xuanzhou.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,480
Oh no, they want to frame you.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,480
Xuanzhou,

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,840
I've finally found you.

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,520
I just remembered,

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,480
you have no golden pearl or rabbit.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,320
Why suffer here

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
in the wilderness?

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,920
(He made Xuan leave alone.)

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,480
(Let him be the only one alive)

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,960
(to set him up.)

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,880
Xiyu, why have you stopped?

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,960
I don't like this brush.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,360
I'll go get one of my own.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,160
Be right back.

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,880
Master, what are you doing?

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,720
Master?

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm the chief of the Tu Mountain Clan.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,120
I've been lurking in the academy
for years for a great cause.

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,760
We track all the way
and finally found their lair.

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,560
Fei Ying, gather the men.

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,160
Yes.

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,720
Your Highness, you were injured last time
you went alone.

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
This time, don't be impulsive.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,680
Wait until I bring people over
before you act.

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,560
Understood. Hurry.

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,440
Xiyu.

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,600
Master, he's thrown himself
into the trap

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,880
and was drugged.

55
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,520
He'll make a good sacrifice
along with his uncle.

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,520
Take him away and lock him up.

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,200
Yes.

58
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,640
In the blink of an eye,

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,080
it's been a hundred years

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
since my grandpa's death.

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,280
But his wishes have not been fulfilled.

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,600
It's all because his descendants
are useless.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,480
Master, I believe Crown Prince

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,920
has seen your hardships
over the years in heaven.

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,720
By the way,

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,120
are the sacrificial items prepared?

67
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
Two vessels are still missing.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
Although Chen no longer exists,

69
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,480
we must adhere to some rituals
for my grandpa's hundred-year sacrifice.

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,760
We can't let him be slighted.

71
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,280
I'm on it.

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Uncle.

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,320
Uncle.

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,480
Uncle.

75
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,320
Uncle.

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,520
Xiyu.

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,400
Xiyu, how did you...

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,560
This Red Spirit Gem can detoxify.

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,960
I wasn't drugged because of it.

80
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,790
Uncle, smell it more.

81
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,920
Your headache will ease.

82
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm much better.

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,990
Xiyu, don't be afraid.

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
I'm here.

85
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,640
These people are ruthless and cruel.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,920
They won't let us go.

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,600
I'll find a chance to cover for you.
You must escape.

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,600
What are you saying?

89
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,720
We'll escape together.

90
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,280
I have this.

91
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,480
This thing is very useful.

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,760
It can detoxify and unlock.

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,520
And it's pretty.

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,480
Where did you get this hairpin?

95
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,240
Xuan gave it to me.

96
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,520
He said a good brother's elder
is also his elder,

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,320
so he made this hairpin for my mom.

98
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
I've been too busy lately

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,400
and haven't had time to give it to her.

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,840
Uncle, let's go.

101
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,280
OK.

102
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,720
Go, hurry up.

103
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,840
Xiyu.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,520
Master,

105
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,600
they tried to escape.

106
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,920
Who are you?

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,160
You're heartless and deranged.

108
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,440
Xiyu, don't ask.

109
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,000
Knowing his identity will make you die.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,440
Do you think he will let us go?

111
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,640
We should know before we die.

112
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
Xiyu!

113
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Little brat, you're reckless
just like your father.

114
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,520
What did you say?

115
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,640
My father?

116
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,520
- What did you do to my father?
- Xiyu?

117
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,560
I'll start by cutting off your limbs.

118
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,440
You can't hurt him.

119
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,520
And you, when the time comes,

120
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll put you on the sacrificial altar.

121
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,320
Xiyu!

122
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,160
Who are you?

123
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
Killing is bad.

124
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,320
It's better to sit down and talk.

125
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
How come it's you again?

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Who are you?

127
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,600
Let him go, and I'll tell you.

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,880
You're alone but you don't mind
exposing your whereabouts.

129
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,480
It seems he's truly important to you.

130
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Exactly.

131
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,640
Ning Xuanzhou?

132
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,560
How could it be you?

133
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,640
Yes.

134
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,120
Prince Ning is a powerless scholar

135
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,320
who can only be bullied.

136
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,600
You can only use him

137
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,760
as a scapegoat.

138
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,400
How could he repeatedly
spoil your plans?

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm the Shadow Guard Commander of Ning.

140
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,760
I'm much more valuable
than this guy here.

141
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,200
Let him go.

142
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,560
I'll surrender

143
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,320
and be your sacrifice.

144
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,840
Ning Xuanzhou, are you crazy?

145
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,400
Will he let us go after killing you?

146
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,790
There can't be enough sacrifice.

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,440
Why are you glaring at me?

148
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,480
Escaping is better

149
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
than being killed.

150
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,320
Hurry up and leave.

151
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,080
Xiyu, come on,

152
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
just shut up.

153
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,800
Listen to your uncle.

154
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
What are you scheming?

155
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,240
Leave him.

156
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,000
Drop your weapon.

157
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
Don't do that!

158
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
You've already captured me.

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,960
Let him go now.

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,120
Did I promise you?

161
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
Ning Xuanzhou, you're usually so calm.

162
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,960
How come you're falling
for such a lousy trick?

163
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,520
Change places with me.

164
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,520
See how calm you'll be.

165
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
You're really...

166
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,320
Xiyu.

167
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,240
Are you OK?

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,960
Wearing a mask must be hard.

169
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,720
Take it off,

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,720
Marquis Wen.

171
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
It's really Marquis Wen?

172
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
How did you know it was me?

173
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,000
The assassin, Wu Hao, said you were
burned to death,

174
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,680
and I became suspicious.

175
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,680
Tu Mountain Clan is skilled with fire.

176
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,520
He thought they were going to kill you,

177
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,320
but he might have guessed wrong.

178
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,600
On the contrary,

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,660
Tu Mountain Clan was there
to rescue you.

180
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
You took this opportunity

181
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,960
to fake your death,

182
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,240
making it easier to provoke war
between us.

183
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
You have wealth, honor

184
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,600
and everything else.

185
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Why did you do this?

186
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,160
Remember the stone tablet
at Luoma Mountain?

187
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,660
(Luoma Mountain)

188
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,680
When you spoke about Crown Prince,

189
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,280
I went back and checked.

190
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,720
I found Crown Prince had a son

191
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,880
who was later adopted.

192
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,560
Following the trail, I discovered

193
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,400
Marquis Wen's grandfather

194
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,760
was that Crown Prince of Chen

195
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
who surrendered there.

196
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,600
Surrendered?

197
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
My grandpa took a temporary measure

198
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
to preserve strength.

199
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,240
To restore Chen,

200
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,200
he endured humiliation.

201
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,160
Tu Mountian Clan refused to surrender

202
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,560
and fled to the mountains.

203
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,480
That was also one way your grandfather
preserved strength.

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,180
You were inside while they were outside,

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,960
inciting discord to start a war

206
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,480
and weakening Yan

207
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,800
to avenge Chen.

208
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,280
Not only that,

209
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,920
there's also the smuggling Gray Gang.

210
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,280
On the surface, you advocate for peace
between the two countries

211
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,320
and gain people's respect
by crossing the border.

212
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,280
In reality, you secretly
support the Gray Gang,

213
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,760
reaping huge profits

214
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,920
and hoarding weapons and troops.

215
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,920
Eighteen years ago, the border massacre
that started the war

216
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,040
was also your doing.

217
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,640
(Why hasn't the fuse burned through?)

218
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,160
You two have figured it out quite well.

219
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,120
Such smart sacrifices

220
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,440
will surely please my grandpa
in the afterlife.

221
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,120
I'll now send you to meet him.

222
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,440
Xiyu, get away.

223
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,720
Be careful.

224
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,160
There's a house fire in the south.

225
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,120
It's been unstable lately.

226
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,840
Why are there so many fires recently?

227
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,480
Yes, a lot has burned.

228
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,000
General.

229
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,960
Be careful.

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,720
Ning Xuanzhou,

231
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,720
hurry up and leave.

232
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,720
There are too many men.

233
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,640
You can't win.

234
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,640
Hurry up and leave.

235
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,180
If you don't, I'll kiss you.

236
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,160
Hurry up.

237
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,560
Uncle?

238
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,160
You're not dead?

239
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,880
He's the mastermind provoking war
between the two countries.

240
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,400
Wuhui, kill them quickly.

241
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,840
After restoring Chen,

242
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,200
you'll become a royal member.

243
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
What Chen?

244
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,680
I'm a general of Yan.

245
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,200
Wuhui,

246
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,600
you ungrateful wretch.

247
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Hua Chenghao,

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,680
you're so ungrateful

249
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,480
and deceitful.

250
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,120
Xiyu,

251
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,280
are you OK?

252
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm fine. You've lost a lot of blood.

253
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
I'm OK, just minor wounds.

254
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,000
You're in big trouble.

255
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,640
The powerless scholar is actually
a martial arts master.

256
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,160
There's intelligence

257
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,890
the Shadow Guard Commander
has come to Yan.

258
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,160
Could it be you?

259
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,280
General, I'm late.

260
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,800
Just in time.

261
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
We found a Shadow Guard from Ning.
Take him away.

262
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,440
Yes.

263
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,440
You can't take him away.

264
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,300
Matters of state aren't

265
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
for you to act on a whim.

266
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,920
Let go of me!

267
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,520
Let go of me!

268
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,640
- Xuan!
- It's OK.

269
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,760
- Xuan!
- Alright, Xiyu!

270
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,920
- Xiyu!
- Xuan!

271
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,460
Calm down.
