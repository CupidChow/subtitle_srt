00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,800
Why are you here?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Same as you.

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,920
You're very loyal.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,160
Master.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,240
Master.

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,560
What is it?

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
Ning Xuanzhou and Xiyu
can't be roommates.

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,320
Why not?

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,960
He's the prince of Ning,

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,920
not one of us.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,600
The academy only distinguishes
based on knowledge,

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,640
not nationality.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,720
But Xiyu...

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,400
What about him?

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,840
Xiyu...

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,480
Xiyu is a handsome young man.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,960
I worry Ning Xuanzhou
has ill intentions towards him.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
Xuanzhou has such
an unacceptable quirk?

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,880
Exactly.

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,920
When I first met you,

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,120
I thought you looked like a princess.

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,800
I...

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm a real man.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,440
You're a princess.

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,880
A princess isn't as strong as me.

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,360
What evidence do you have?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
I just heard it.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
How can you slander your classmate

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,440
with this hearsay?

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,600
The sage said,

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,560
"A gentleman doesn't speak ill of others

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
behind their back..."

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,640
The chirping

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,560
is truly annoying.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,600
Take it.

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,520
Copy it ten times before you can leave.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
The master is gone.

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,960
He's still here.

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,160
Copying ten times will take a long time.

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,720
With you here,

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
I don't mind.

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,960
Being with you, I don't mind either.

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,760
Who's there?

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,200
Come out.

47
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,640
You really have ill intentions.

48
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,880
Xiyu?

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,320
Why are you...

50
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,990
Then I also have ill intentions.

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,600
Are you going to report me?

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,000
Of course not.

53
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,520
A true friend indeed.

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,360
We're leaving.

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,400
No way.

56
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,160
Why did you both crawl under the bed?

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,200
Explain yourselves.

58
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,840
Then you explain first

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,200
why you slandered Xuan.

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,760
I...

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,960
Do it again, and we won't
be friends anymore.

62
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,040
Xiyu,

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,040
do you still consider me your friend?

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
Which book are you supposed to copy?

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Qimin Yaoshu.

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,760
I'll copy six times for you

67
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,950
and bring them to you tonight.

68
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
We'll take a move.

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,840
Why six?

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,520
You three, I three.

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,280
Wuhui gets one more

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,240
for speaking nonsense.

73
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,560
Why should I help him copy?

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
He's my good friend.

75
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,440
What about me?

76
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
You're also my good friend.

77
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,320
What,

78
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,440
do you want to be my bestie?

79
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,240
How spoiled.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,360
Your Highness.

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
He's the one my brother
mentioned in the letter?

82
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,960
Yes,

83
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,360
assassin Wu Hao.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
It took a lot to capture him.

85
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,760
No matter how we interrogate him,

86
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,690
he won't confess about
the Tu Mountain Clan.

87
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,480
We have to trouble Your Highness.

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
He's so injured.

89
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,640
If I use the Soul Burning Finger,

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,880
he'll surely die.

91
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,560
His crimes are numerous.

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
He should've died long ago.

93
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,990
What's your relationship
with the Tu Mountain Clan?

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
I don't know them.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,040
I intercepted Marquis Wen at the border

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,480
and was about to kill him.

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,480
A group of men in black appeared

98
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,120
and killed him

99
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,440
before me.

100
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,760
Two groups of people
wanted Marquis Wen dead?

101
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
Why did you want to kill him?

102
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,680
I was paid for the job.

103
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,640
Who hired you?

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,680
I don't ask for details

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,960
when taking a job.

106
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,960
Let me ask again, who hired you?

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,320
I really don't know.

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,840
I followed the person who paid me once.

109
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,400
He disappeared into a residence.

110
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Which residence?

111
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,880
Changsheng Alley,

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,600
second house

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,120
on the left.

114
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,000
(Changsheng Alley,
second house on the left.)

115
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,860
(He disappearing suddenly)

116
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,760
(means there's a secret passage.)

117
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,560
The emperor keeps uncle in the palace,

118
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
so I can continue investigating.

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,120
The thief must've broken the lock,

120
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,090
making it easier for me.

121
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,480
What?

122
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,760
He moved them?

123
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,040
That's too fast.

124
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,280
Don't move.

125
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,680
Brother, we met before.

126
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,490
You figured it out.

127
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,080
Of course,

128
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,920
your charming voice is unforgettable.

129
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,640
But I didn't call for help yesterday

130
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,120
to spoil your plans.

131
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,890
No need to explain.

132
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,680
Anyway, I remember you.

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,120
My good friend said

134
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
remembering someone

135
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,760
might indicate an affection.

136
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,360
Really?

137
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,680
Really.

138
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,080
Maybe you felt an affinity with me.

139
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,640
You just haven't realized it yet.

140
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,280
You smiled.

141
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,640
That's an affection.

142
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,880
We're like-minded indeed.

143
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,760
What about letting go?

144
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,880
So we can talk properly.

145
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,640
You didn't cover your face today.

146
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,680
Afraid I'll recognize you?

147
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,560
No worries.

148
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,680
A gift from me.

149
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Just take it.

150
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Close your eyes.

151
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,560
Eyes closed.

152
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,160
No peeking.

153
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
I won't.

154
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,920
You...

155
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,080
What?

156
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,080
That's a good idea.

157
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,040
No peeking.

158
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,440
I promise.

159
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,920
Now, tell me about yourself clearly,

160
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,320
or I'll silence you.

161
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,880
I'm Hua Xiyu.

162
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,760
My father was Hua Chengyi,

163
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,080
and mother Mrs. Hua.

164
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,280
My uncle is Hua Chenghao,

165
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,640
and my good friend Hong Wuhui.

166
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,520
People call me...

167
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
a true gentleman who cherishes beauty.

168
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Where is the treasures?

169
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,240
I don't know either.

170
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,360
You...

171
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,520
You just went up?

172
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,480
It's a shame.

173
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,240
If you knew I wasn't around,
you'd have slipped away.

174
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,320
Why would you say that?

175
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,880
You and I hit it off immediately.

176
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,760
We should have a good conversation.

177
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,520
How could I bear to slip away?

178
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,440
Please spare me.

179
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
I was trying to run.

180
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,560
I didn't remove the blindfold.

181
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,880
Don't silence me.

182
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,560
So you kept the blindfold for this?

183
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,760
My mother said

184
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,440
always leave myself a way out.

185
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,360
Follow me.

186
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,920
Where are we going?

187
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,720
Mister.

188
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,240
Lift your foot.

189
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,280
Why are you here today?

190
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,920
Same as you, stealing.

191
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Stealing from your own family?

192
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,720
The peak of thievery

193
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,680
is to be an insider.

194
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,120
You smiled again.

195
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,880
Seems you like me even more.

196
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,320
If that's the case,

197
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
would you consider letting me go?

198
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
What if I don't?

199
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,520
Are you holding me hostage?

200
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,120
Mister.

201
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Mister.

202
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,800
Mister, listen to me.

203
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,520
Really, trust me.

204
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm not worth much as a hostage.

205
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
My father died early.

206
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,160
My mother sold her dowry to raise me.

207
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,440
I heard Chancellor Hua is fond of you?

208
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,240
No way.

209
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,160
He won't even let me see the heirloom.

210
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,120
I heard you had a sworn brother?

211
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,560
Hong Wuhui?

212
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,440
We fell out recently
and are no longer friends.

213
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,080
And you know the prince of Ning
very well?

214
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,040
Not at all.

215
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,720
Xuan...

216
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,680
With Ning Xuanzhou,

217
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,240
although we're roommates,

218
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,880
we have no connection.

219
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,880
Really?

220
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,120
We live together,
but he drew a line with me.

221
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
Isn't he heartless?

222
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,240
So heartless.

223
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
He didn't bring a book to class,

224
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,880
so I lent it to him.

225
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,720
But he claimed to have memorized it all.

226
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Isn't he very arrogant?

227
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,240
So arrogant.

228
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,960
Even if he's arrogant,

229
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
last time he got surrounded in an alley,

230
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,200
I rushed out to save him.

231
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,320
He was only hiding behind me.

232
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,360
He's very useless.

233
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,080
So useless.

234
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,440
Then I'll kill him.

235
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,880
He's such a terrible roommate.

236
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,040
I'll help you kill him.

237
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,320
No, no, you can't.

238
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,880
We're like-minded.

239
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,720
Don't worry about it.

240
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,120
Aren't we talking about me
being a hostage?

241
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,880
Why do you suddenly want to kill Xuan?

242
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,120
We hit it off,

243
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,240
so I must help you.

244
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
So I can take you hostage next time

245
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,960
with a clear conscience.

246
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,160
Where are you going?

247
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,240
You can't kill Xuan.

248
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,880
Let go first.

249
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,840
I won't.

250
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,520
I won't let you kill Xuan.

251
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,080
Your voice...

252
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,640
Mister, you scared me
into hallucinating.

253
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,280
I thought Xuan was speaking.

254
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,080
Are you going to hold me forever?

255
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,440
I won't let go. Though you're strong,

256
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,960
if you harm Xuan,

257
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,560
I won't let go even if I die.

258
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,760
Strange. You have no martial arts,

259
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,880
yet I can't escape

260
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,480
such strength.

261
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,760
My master said,

262
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,480
"Where there's righteousness,

263
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,840
strength can split mountains".

264
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,080
Even in sleep, you're holding so tight.

265
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,240
