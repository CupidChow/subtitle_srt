1
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,520
The Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,320
is when you engrave your name
on a golden pearl

5
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,280
and hang it around a rabbit's neck.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
Then we go hunting in the forests.

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,760
Whoever catches a rabbit
gets the pearl with the name,

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,400
signifying a predestined relationship.

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
The emperor said unmarried children
of official families

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
must participate,

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,520
including me.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,800
Understood?

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,160
Yes.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,560
The so-called Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt
is actually a Golden Pearl Chase.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,480
Hang the golden pearl, chase the rabbit.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,720
If a man gets a woman's golden pearl

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,120
or a woman gets a man's golden pearl...

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,320
It represents a heaven-sent match.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,200
What if someone gets a pearl
of the same gender?

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,320
Then they can become buddies or besties.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Fully understood.

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,080
So that's what you understood earlier.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,160
Mei.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
Looking for your brother again?

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,280
Your family sent rabbits over so soon?

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,560
My dad got the news early

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
from the court.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
So he sent them over

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,400
and fatten them up

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,480
for good fortune.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,600
I heard this way one can find
a good match.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,200
Plump and round,

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,480
girls will definitely like them.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,320
Hopefully,

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,720
it can end up with the daughter
of Minister Pei.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,160
You'll also go to Luoma Mountain
that day, right?

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,720
Our master said all students must go.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,040
Then you...

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,520
Mei.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,600
What smells so good?

41
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,460
(Fragrance Ning Wine)

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Isn't that the Fragrance Ning Wine
I hid?

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,480
I borrowed it.

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Prince Ning is away from home.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,080
He must miss the wine from his hometown.

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
He can drink freely at home.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,920
Why come here?

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
This fine wine is a fortune in Yan.

49
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,320
You can't buy it with money.

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,320
You're talking money with me?

51
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,920
Don't mind him. Let's drink.

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,320
You can't drink it. I saved it for Xiyu.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,480
Bring it over. I want to give it to him.

54
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,340
He doesn't deserve it.

55
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,360
Are you OK?

56
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,400
Let me wipe it for you.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,120
No need.

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,980
- Let me.
- No need.

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,560
Move aside.

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,880
- Really.
- I...

61
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,500
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

62
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,560
You're just in time.

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,120
This is your favorite wine.

64
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,480
I got it with great effort.

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,680
Drink it before others spoil it.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,080
Why are you with her?

67
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,360
I asked you
what Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt is

68
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,880
but you told me to ask others.

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,090
The students always
distance themselves from me.

70
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,280
I had to ask Miss Hong.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,760
Exactly.

72
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
You didn't pay attention to him.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
Xuan, let me prepare the rabbit for you.

74
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
And the golden pearl
with your name engraved.

75
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,480
This is an event
for the official families of Yan.

76
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,320
Yes.

77
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,990
He's from Ning and not qualified
to release the rabbit.

78
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Xiyu is right.

79
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,880
I'll listen to her.

80
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
The emperor only decreed

81
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,280
children of Yan's officials can
release the rabbits.

82
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,120
He didn't say who can catch them.

83
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,880
If you can't release, you can catch.

84
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,880
Just catch mine.

85
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,360
There'll be hundred of rabbits.
How will he know?

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,560
Well,

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm prepared.

88
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,040
Look, three hundred golden pearls,

89
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,320
all engraved with my name, Hong Mei'er.

90
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,360
I only keep black ones.

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,280
When you see a black rabbit, catch it.

92
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,160
You can ensure a good match with me.

93
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
If he can catch them, other can too.

94
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,320
Am I supposed to have
300 brothers-in-law?

95
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Catching the golden pearl
requires mutual acceptance.

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,880
I only acknowledge a match with Xuan.

97
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,200
The others can just be my buddies

98
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
or besties.

99
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,320
Xuan, what do you think?

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,520
We have a deal.

101
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,560
Why are you looking at me?

102
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,880
Right, don't look at her.

103
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,280
She can't control us.

104
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm your brother.

105
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
I have the right.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,160
If you meddle, I'll tell everyone

107
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,200
she's a woman.

108
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
- Don't you dare!
- Don't.

109
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,200
Fine, Xuan.

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
Since you said no, I won't.

111
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,520
I'll listen to you.

112
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
You're usually so arrogant,

113
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,280
but so gentle with him.

114
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,960
Do I need to be gentle
with a rough guy like you?

115
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,080
Xuan is different.

116
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,480
He's so delicate

117
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,560
like a girl.

118
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,120
I must be gentle with him.

119
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,160
Yes, he's like a princess.

120
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,720
What's with your hand?

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,920
He shares a room with Xiyu.

122
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,320
It's safer to cuff him.

123
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,640
Handcuff?

124
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,920
Hua Xiyu, how can you be so vicious?

125
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,720
Don't blame Xiyu.

126
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,680
I volunteered.

127
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
Look at your hand.

128
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,200
Your hand is injured.

129
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,920
How painful. Let me rub it for you.

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,880
No need.

131
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
It's alright.

132
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,560
Really, no need.

133
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,720
Don't look at her.

134
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,200
Don't be afraid. Let me tell you,

135
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,360
she's just a freak raised as a man.

136
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,080
We Yan girls

137
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,160
are very gentle and kind.

138
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,840
(Oh no.)

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
(I went too far trying
to make her jealous.)

140
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,880
- Xiyu.
- Don't go.

141
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,680
Don't mind her.

142
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,640
Let go.

143
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,240
- What?
- You want to marry an enemy?

144
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,880
What enemy?

145
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
The war hasn't started.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,180
There'll be war in the future.

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,320
Let go.

148
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,440
Tonight, go sleep in Hong Wuhui's room.

149
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
Lest people say I'm cruel,

150
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,880
torturing the gentle Prince Ning.

151
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,280
Xiyu.

152
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,240
Get out.

153
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,880
Get out.

154
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
It's good this way.

155
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,640
You...

156
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,760
Even if you cuff yourself,

157
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,040
I won't let you stay.

158
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Go.

159
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,960
Then uncuff me.

160
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,480
Do it yourself.

161
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,440
No one will bully you anymore.

162
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,400
You...

163
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,120
Why are you cuffing yourself to the bed?

164
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,080
So you can't make me leave.

165
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,760
Uncuff it.

166
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,120
No.

167
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,280
If you don't, I will.

168
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
Are you crazy?

169
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
Spit out the key.

170
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,840
Spit it out.

171
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,170
♪Flowers bloom, the night is sleepless♪

172
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,170
♪Cherishing your company by my side♪

173
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,520
Spit out the key!

174
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,520
Spit it out!

175
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,480
I won't drive you away.

176
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,120
You promise?

177
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,120
I promise.

178
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,760
Xuan...

179
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,400
Hua Xiyu, you're not human!

180
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Move aside.

181
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,600
You treat him like a dog,
cuffing him to the bed.

182
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,880
Why are you defending her?

183
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,760
You swallowed it?

184
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,120
I did.

185
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,280
Swallowed what?

186
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,720
The key.

187
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,880
Hua Xiyu,

188
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,880
cuffing him to the bed wasn't enough.

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
You even made him swallow the key?

190
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,680
I...

191
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,760
You're more venomous than a snake.

192
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,200
I...

193
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,920
- You...
- I...

194
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,560
I'll kill you.

195
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,680
- Wait!
- You crazy woman.

196
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,960
Hong Mei'er, you got it wrong.

197
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,720
Let me explain.

198
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,680
How can you bully Xuan?

199
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,720
- Let me explain.
- I didn't!

200
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,360
- Mei!
- You bullied him!

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
Mei, let me explain.

202
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,560
Mei, all right, stop.

203
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,840
- You bullied him!
- All right.

204
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Let go.

205
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,800
What are you doing?

206
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,680
Calm down.

207
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,920
Why are you fighting?

208
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,840
She treats Xuan

209
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,800
like a dog,

210
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
cuffing him to the bed.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
She's tormenting Xuan.

212
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,120
This is their dorm.

213
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,880
Why meddle?

214
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,520
Shut up.

215
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,280
- Go away.
- Stop!

216
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,160
Mom is waiting.

217
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,960
- I'll...
- Go.

218
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,240
- I'll kill her!
- Let's go.

219
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Go.

220
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
Hua Xiyu.

221
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,080
- All right.
- I'll take revenge!

222
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,480
Where are you going?

223
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,560
Getting a saw.

224
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,500
(Hua Xiyu)

225
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,280
What if someone gets your golden pearl

226
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,880
and wants to marry into your family?

227
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,200
You're silly.

228
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,880
If a man gets it, he'll treat me
as a brother.

229
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
If a woman gets it,

230
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,560
I'll definitely refuse.

231
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,440
I'll find an excuse no matter what.

232
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,320
That's good.

233
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,560
Good?

234
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,920
I'm still mad about you lying to me.

235
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,520
Still mad? Punish me then.

236
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Forget it. Cuffing you for two days
tired me out.

237
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
Just sawing off that chain

238
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
made my hand sore today.

239
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,090
Let me rub it for you.

240
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,120
Stop it.

241
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,040
I need to return the rabbit

242
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,480
to release it into the wild tomorrow.

243
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,080
Rest, I'll deliver it for you.

244
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,960
My rabbit is precious.
Take good care of it.

245
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,640
If there's any mistake,

246
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
I'll hold you accountable. Understood?

247
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,440
Yes.

248
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,840
Fengtian, has Xiyu's rabbit
been delivered?

249
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,840
Not yet.

250
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,400
What's wrong?

251
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,880
Nothing.

252
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,720
Come out.

253
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,920
Did you find anything?

254
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,990
The Tiger Gem from the jewelry stall,

255
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,760
Fragrance Ning Wine from hidden shops

256
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,840
and other Ning items

257
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,080
were smuggled in from Ning

258
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,360
through a secret route.

259
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
These items are

260
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,440
a hundred times more expensive in Yan.

261
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,680
The mastermind

262
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
must be the Gray Gang,
active on the border.

263
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,480
The border of the two countries
is tense.

264
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,480
The Gray Gang must have backing
from powerful people

265
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,320
to operate there.

266
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
Don't act yet.

267
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
Monitor them secretly

268
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,000
and follow the trail.

269
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,920
Yes.

270
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,200
By the way,

271
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,960
do you carry

272
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,320
the secret ink that

273
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,680
fades in a day?

274
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,400
Yes.

275
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,560
Are you writing a secret letter?

276
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,920
No, I want to confuse the enemy.

277
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,560
Hua Xiyu asked me to deliver this.

278
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,880
- Keep it safe.
- Yes.

279
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,400
(Xiyu's rabbit)

280
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,160
