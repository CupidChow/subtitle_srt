00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,320
Hurry up.

4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,960
Go inside.

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,080
Watch him closely.

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,640
Don't let him escape.

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,640
Yes.

8
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,320
Xuan.

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Xuan.

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,320
Xiyu, you finally woke up.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,560
How...how did I end up here?

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,880
Wuhui had someone bring you back.

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,110
He said you stopped him earlier.

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,720
You got angry and fainted.

15
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,760
What were you arguing?

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,040
Why did it end up like this?

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,920
What are you doing?

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
Take the medicine.

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,400
Where are you going now?
You just woke up.

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,320
- Xiyu.
- Where is Xuan?

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,520
Why aren't you resting?

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,120
Where did you take him?

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,560
Don't worry about him.

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,840
I've already investigated.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,400
He's the Commander of Shadow Guards.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,360
I know.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
You know?

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
Why did you hide from me?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,520
If he had done anything harmful to Yan,

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,960
I'd have reported him long ago.

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,520
But everything he's done
was to prevent the war,

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,040
saving both the Ning's

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,160
and Yan's people.

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,080
You should release him.

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,280
Release him?

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,920
He controls Shadow Guards' operations
in Yan.

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,320
How can I let him go?

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,240
The achievements and rewards
you've received

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,620
are all thanks to his assistance.

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,840
That's another thing.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,250
National interests take priority over
personal feelings.

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:15,960
You...

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,640
Then arrest me

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
and keep me with him.

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,920
Are you crazy?

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,000
Why would I arrest you?

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
I already knew

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
Ning Xuanzhou was the Commander...

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,800
Xiyu, you have a fever.

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,720
What nonsense is it?

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm very clear-headed.

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,150
- I committed a crime and withheld info.
- Xiyu!

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,840
I already knew

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,790
Ning Xuanzhou was the Commander
of Shadow Guards.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
Open the door.

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Xiyu?

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,960
Why are you...

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,720
Are you crazy?

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,040
How could you bring her in?

60
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,890
She kept shouting about
being your accomplice.

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,080
If I didn't arrest her,

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,480
when others offices arrest her

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
if they hear,

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,360
she'd be in big trouble.

65
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,180
She should be put in the women's prison.

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
She insisted she's a man.

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,880
Besides, if she doesn't see you,

68
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,520
she'll talk nonsense
wherever she's held.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
That'd be even more troublesome.

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,320
Why am I saying so much
to a traitor like you?

71
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,720
You...

72
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,560
I thought you were quite smart.

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,580
How could you do something
so futile and foolish?

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,480
Xiyu, I know your intentions,

75
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,840
but I really don't want...

76
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,800
Steel needle?

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,680
I've heard experts like you

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,160
can unlock shackles in a cell

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,120
with just one of these needles.

80
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,080
You...

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,760
What...

82
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,760
Now that you're here, I can't escape.

83
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,600
Assisting the enemy escape

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,960
and betraying Yan

85
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,520
would haunt you for a lifetime.

86
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,400
Don't worry about me.

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,200
You're already here.

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,760
I said before, as long as I'm here,

89
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
no matter what happens,

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,880
I'll protect you.

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,360
I also said,

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,080
I'll do my best to keep you safe.

93
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,560
If things don't go our way,

94
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,120
then we'll live and die together.

95
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,240
It's not time to die together yet.

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,680
If I'm in prison

97
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,560
and you're outside,

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,680
it's still living together.

99
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,720
Why do you have to get yourself here?

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,440
Feeling sorry for me?

101
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
No way, having someone accompany me,

102
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm very happy.

103
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,960
I'm just afraid you'll start crying
if you stay longer.

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,640
How is that possible?

105
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
I know the suffering of prison
to some extent.

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,400
I've mentally prepared for it.

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,520
No matter what, I won't cry.

108
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,920
Really?

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,280
Definitely.

110
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
Then if you cry later,

111
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,880
you must go home.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A promise...

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Is a promise.

114
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,680
Open up.

115
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,000
Take him out.

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,520
Where are you taking him?

117
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,040
Don't worry, Xiyu. I'll be back soon.

118
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,440
Xuan.

119
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
Xuan.

120
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,640
Xuan.

121
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,520
Xuan.

122
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,520
Go.

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,760
Go.

124
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,440
- Hurry!
- Xuan.

125
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,680
Xuan!

126
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,680
How can you...

127
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,080
How can you do this to him?

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Xuan.

129
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,040
Even after this beating,
you won't confess.

130
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,760
You're really tough.

131
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,640
Sooner or later, we'll crush your bones.

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,920
Don't look.

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,240
See?

134
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,840
You're crying.

135
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,040
It's me.

136
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
It's my fault.

137
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,280
In my line of work, getting caught

138
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,240
and suffering is common.

139
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,890
It has nothing to do with you.

140
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,240
Don't lie to me.

141
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,840
If it weren't for me,

142
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,280
you wouldn't have entered
the enemy's lair alone

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,280
and been forced to reveal your presence.

144
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,320
With your intelligence,

145
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,840
you'd have waited for back-up
before acting.

146
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
If you weren't injured saving me,

147
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,080
how could you've been

148
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,720
caught by Hong Wuhui?

149
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,480
Xiyu,

150
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,760
I'll tell you a secret.

151
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,240
What secret?

152
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,120
Human tears are salty.

153
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
They contain salt.

154
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,320
When they fall on a wound,

155
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
it stings a bit.

156
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,880
I...I hurt you.

157
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,720
I didn't mean to. Where...

158
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,280
Where does it hurt?

159
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Here.

160
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,680
But...

161
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,480
But there's fabric here.

162
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
How could tears seep through it?

163
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,560
Not just fabric, they can
seep through flesh

164
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,480
into the heart.

165
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,040
And the heart will ache.

166
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,440
You're crying.

167
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,040
How could my heart not ache?

168
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,680
Xuan.

169
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,760
Didn't you promise me?

170
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,480
If you cried,

171
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,880
you'd listen to me

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,480
and go home?

173
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
No, I don't want to go back.

174
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
I don't want to go home.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,160
I want to stay here.

176
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,720
How can you break your promise?

177
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,440
A promise

178
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
is a promise.

179
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,840
I don't remember.

180
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,840
I won't leave.

181
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
I want to stay here.

182
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,560
I want to always

183
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,520
be with you.

184
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
Get General Hong over here.

185
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,480
Ning Xuanzhou, are you planning
to confess?

186
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,240
Xiyu.

187
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,640
What happened to her?

188
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,880
She fainted from grief.

189
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,280
Before she wakes up,

190
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,180
take her away quickly.

191
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,560
Find someone to watch her.

192
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
Keep her safe.

193
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,680
Unlock it.

194
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,300
(Hua Mansion)

195
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,360
Xuan.

196
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,840
No.

197
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,160
No.

198
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,080
Xuan.

199
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,280
Xiyu.

200
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,680
Mom,

201
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,280
how did I get back here again?

202
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,160
This time, Wuhui brought you back again.

203
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,880
Xiyu.

204
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,240
Mom,

205
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
don't stop me.

206
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
No one can stop me.

207
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,120
I have something for you.

208
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,720
When you were brought back,

209
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
it was hidden in your clothes.

210
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,620
(Heart aches)

211
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,880
You think you're tormenting yourself,

212
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,880
but someone's heart

213
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,960
aches.

214
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,120
I can't cry.

215
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,000
I can't cry.

216
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,760
He's already suffering enough.

217
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,680
Did Ning Xuanzhou confess?

218
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,760
He looks so gentle,

219
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,240
but I didn't expect he's really tough.

220
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
He's tough, but he's from Ning.

221
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,920
Ning's Shadow Guards

222
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,560
are sneaking around in our Yan.

223
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,080
If we don't find out,

224
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,680
how can we face our emperor?

225
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
I heard he was the one

226
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,720
who uncovered the culprit

227
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,320
behind the border troubles.

228
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,680
Otherwise, a war between us

229
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,080
would've killed many people.

230
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right.

231
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,160
I've reported the matter to the emperor,

232
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,680
but there's been no response.

233
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,090
The higher-ups are also
pressing me to get a result.

234
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,040
General Hong,

235
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
the emperor's decree.

236
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
This is it?

237
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,080
The decree is here.

238
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,280
Do as the emperor commands.

239
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,560
Ning Xuanzhou, you and Shadow Guards

240
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,200
have been acting recklessly in Yan.

241
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
You should be punished,

242
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,360
but our emperor is merciful.

243
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,190
Considering you haven't
caused great harm,

244
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,240
he spares your life.

245
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,680
You can go now.

246
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,040
The door is open.

247
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,240
Why aren't you leaving?

248
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,240
Haven't you heard?

249
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,120
It's easier to invite the devil in
than to send him away.

250
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,760
We're showing mercy by letting you go,

251
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,080
yet you're still holding on.

252
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,520
If you don't leave, forget it.

253
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,240
How many of your spies hidden in Ning

254
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
have been captured?

255
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,560
How did you know?

256
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,720
Is there a traitor in here informing you?

257
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,080
No need for a traitor.

258
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
It's easy to figure out.

259
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
When my brother learned I was captured,

260
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
would he just sit back?

261
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,720
He'd definitely intensify efforts
to capture Yan's spies.

262
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,560
Before I left Ning,

263
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,620
I sent several pieces of information
to my brother.

264
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,720
At that time, I thought it'd be better
not to arrest them,

265
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,200
but to keep an eye on them,

266
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,680
leaving some dignity for Yan.

267
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,720
After all, I didn't want a war.

268
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Don't be too proud.

269
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,360
Yes, some spies were captured,

270
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,320
but their value

271
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,320
is far less than you,
Commander of Shadow Guards.

272
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,120
We've caught a big shot.

273
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,160
How could you bear to let me go?

274
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,640
Keep me then.

275
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,720
I just remembered,

276
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,280
my brother has an army at the border,

277
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,860
which must be giving
your emperor a headache.

278
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,360
Ning Xuanzhou, you risked your life

279
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,560
and sacrificed yourself.

280
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,320
Wasn't it to avoid war

281
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
and bring peace to the world?

282
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Why are you deliberately
causing trouble now?

283
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
I bled and sacrificed

284
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,160
to expose the treacherous Marquis Wen,

285
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,720
saving the people from suffering.

286
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,720
But what about you?

287
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,720
You repay kindness with enmity

288
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,280
by severely torturing me.

289
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,960
Starting a war by listening to traitors

290
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
is foolishness.

291
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,800
But fighting against ingrates

292
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,200
is an act of justice.

293
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Hong Wuhui,

294
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,440
if I die in Yan's prison,

295
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,680
my brother will surely send troops
to seek justice for me.

296
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,720
You...

297
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
How should I make you leave?

298
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
I want your emperor to give me a wife.

299
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,880
You must be crazy.

300
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,640
I can choose

301
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,280
from any single woman in Yan.

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,720
Why?

303
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,960
Because of my injuries,

304
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,520
because you owe me.

305
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,840
You...

306
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,320
You're too much.

307
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,520
The injury on your back
was from a traitor.

308
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
It's not our fault.

309
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,680
Go back and tell your emperor

310
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,480
to agree to my condition,

311
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,520
or this matter won't end.
