00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,690
I, Tu Wenjue, pay respects
to you, Master.

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,040
I'm so sorry.

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,560
I managed to get the firearms
from Fragrance Teahouse,

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,040
but they destroyed them all,

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,080
causing you significant losses.

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,360
With the secret route along the border,

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
money isn't a problem.

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I've spent a fortune to have
a batch of firearms made.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,280
This time, don't fail again.

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Rest assured, Master.

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,240
The Tu Mountain Clan is ready

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,560
to capture all the students
at Luoma Mountain.

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,960
What about the prince of Ning?

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,160
That scapegoat will be present.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,240
Good.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,280
When Ning and Yan go to war,

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,440
as the two powers struggle,

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,800
it'll be our opportunity

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,480
to restore Chen.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,080
Yes.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,160
The officer has ordered,

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,520
the Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt begins.

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,200
Release the rabbits.

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,440
(Luoma Mountain)

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,640
This handwriting is excellent.

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,840
It's from Crown Prince of Chen.

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,520
Crown Prince of Chen?

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,720
Back then, Chen couldn't defeat Yan.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,480
So Crown Prince of Chen
and his ministers

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,880
surrendered here to Yan.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,490
No wonder it's called Luoma Mountain.

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,720
Knowing they couldn't win,

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,780
surrendering avoided
a life-and-death battle,

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,440
saving countless soldiers and civilians.

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,320
Crown Prince of Chen
could see the big picture

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,160
and was decisive.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,880
He was remarkable.

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,080
Didn't expect you to say that.

41
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,240
My grandpa lamented
the bravery and wisdom

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,440
of Crown Prince of Chen.

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
However, Chen was too weak

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,880
to turn the tide.

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
He chose to surrender
to avoid further bloodshed,

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,120
but people called him a coward.

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,540
Though the emperor treated him,

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,680
a surrendered minister, with much grace,

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,520
he soon passed away in sorrow.

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,240
He bore the disgrace to protect
his ministers and people.

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Such a gentleman deserves a bow.

52
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,120
Getting married here?

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Nonsense.

54
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,960
The entrance is open.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,160
Students are in the mountain.

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,040
Why are you so late?

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
We were preparing tools.

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,920
We can multitask.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,960
Let's go. Miss Pei's rabbit
is waiting for me.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,320
Let's go.

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,160
Come.

62
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,880
There are no tigers
or leopards here, right?

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,480
Don't worry.

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,920
We've sent people to patrol five times,

65
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,200
beating gongs and drums.

66
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,480
Any large animals would've fled
to other mountains.

67
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,720
Even woodcutters and hunters
have been driven away

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,920
to avoid disturbing

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,560
the masters and ladies.

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm just waiting for Prince Ning
to catch my rabbit.

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,880
Who is it?

72
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
You scared me to death!

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,160
Why are you sneaking around here?

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm looking for Master Hua.

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,160
Hua Xiyu?

76
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,400
Do you also...

77
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,680
Master Hua is very handsome.

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Who wouldn't admire him?

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,520
I know you like him,

80
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,320
but I also have the right to pursue him.

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
I now find him distasteful.

82
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,200
Pei Xiaoyu,

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,280
since we're friends, I'll tell you.

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,120
Hua Xiyu is not worth liking.

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,640
They're coming.

86
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,280
Didn't you deliver your rabbit?

87
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,760
If you can deliver three hundred,

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
I can keep one for myself.

89
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,480
Everyone has connections.

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,160
Who doesn't cheat?

91
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,560
You're not...

92
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,520
You're not thinking of...

93
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
You cast a wide net,

94
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,960
but I aim for precision.

95
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,320
You're clever.

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,240
Here they come.

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,040
Master Hua!

98
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,680
Hong Wuhui, mind your own business.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,360
You're so righteous about cheating.

100
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
Want me to talk to Minister Pei?

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,960
You...

102
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,880
Xuan,

103
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,240
just catch the black ones later.

104
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,880
Catching more is fine too.

105
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,720
Don't forget. I'm off now.

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Xiaoyu!

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Xiyu, don't worry.

108
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,480
Your rabbit will be mine.

109
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,920
Don't be so sure.

110
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,990
You'll embarrass yourself.

111
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,080
Someone.

112
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,840
You're cheating.

113
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,880
The emperor never said
I couldn't get help.

114
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,520
Be sharp.

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,880
Remember, I want the pure white rabbit

116
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
with a tuft of black on its head.

117
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,840
- Got it?
- Yes.

118
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,880
Come here.

119
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,680
My rabbit is pure white.

120
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,960
What's with the tuft of black?

121
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,680
Look carefully.

122
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,000
Maybe he has bad eyesight.

123
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,200
Go.

124
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,360
Xiyu, this is my rabbit.

125
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,960
Remember it well.

126
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,180
Not only do you need
to catch Xiyu's rabbit,

127
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,880
but Xiyu also needs to catch yours.

128
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
You're an outsider.

129
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,720
You know nothing.

130
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,320
Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt

131
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,520
often means you catch mine

132
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
and I catch his.

133
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
It's only half a match.

134
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,640
Golden Pearls in a pair,

135
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,680
that's a perfect match.

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,320
Golden Pearls in a pair?

137
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,240
That means

138
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
among all the golden pearls,

139
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,080
you get mine

140
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,480
and I get yours.

141
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,880
It's a rare match.

142
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,480
Why tell him so much?

143
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,720
He doesn't even have a rabbit,

144
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,780
let alone a golden pearl.

145
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,960
Let's go.

146
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,080
Xiyu.

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,880
Don't come over. You're not qualified.

148
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,640
Stop giving him a hard time.

149
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,960
Xuanzhou.

150
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,560
I finally found you.

151
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
I just remembered,

152
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,280
you have no golden pearl or rabbit.

153
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,520
Why suffer here in the wilderness?

154
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,400
What if you fall?

155
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,560
How will the emperor explain
to your brother?

156
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,760
Master, but I...

157
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,560
No more talking, hurry.

158
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,080
Escort Prince Ning down to rest.

159
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,640
Yes.

160
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,040
You all...

161
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,720
Xiyu.

162
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,640
- You...
- Xiyu.

163
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
Listen to the teacher.

164
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,280
Be careful.

165
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,560
Xuanzhou is physically weak.

166
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,320
You need to protect him.

167
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,920
I've been looking for you for a while,

168
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,160
sweating all over.

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,560
I'll find a place to rest.

170
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,720
You can carry on.

171
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,960
Yes.

172
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,640
Master, we're leaving.

173
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,480
Go.

174
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,880
You're from the academy?

175
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,120
Why don't I recognize you?

176
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,260
(Hong)

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,880
Our General Hong sent me to help.

178
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,760
Smart kid.

179
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,720
I didn't think of that.

180
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,320
Who dares to harm?

181
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,720
Who sent you?

182
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,080
Hurry.

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
I need to pee.

184
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,080
There, hurry.

185
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,080
OK.

186
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
Don't look at me.

187
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,520
Scholars are troublesome.

188
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,960
Stay here and be quiet.

189
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,480
Daring to come to Luoma Mountain?

190
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,520
You're quite brave.

191
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,080
Go.

192
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,760
Stop.

193
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,920
Stop running.

194
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,680
Without weapons,
Wuhui might be outnumbered.

195
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,180
I need to find help quickly.

196
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,080
Don't come over.

197
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,840
Don't be afraid.
It's not time to kill you yet.

198
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,080
Once we capture everyone,

199
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,200
we'll send you all to hell.

200
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,080
Prince Ning is alone.

201
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
He can't be everywhere killing people.

202
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,190
He doesn't have a cloning technique.

203
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,760
It makes sense for you people

204
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,480
to die together.
