Oh no, Wuhui!

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
Wuhui was attacked by men in black.

16
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,360
He fled that way.

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,920
That way.

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,040
Impossible.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
I clearly saw him go that way.

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,360
Do you trust your eyes or me?

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
I trust you.

22
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's go.

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,920
Oh no, they've all been captured.

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Check if Hong Wuhui is among them first.

25
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,240
He's not there.
Could he have been killed?

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
General Hong is not that useless.

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,160
Otherwise, we'd have taken care
of him long ago.

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,120
Let's go.

29
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,800
Chief.

30
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,800
Chief.

31
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
Most of the students have been captured.

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,760
Some of them might be their guards.

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,560
What about the explosives?

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
They're all buried.

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
Once the fuse is lit,

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,320
no one here will escape.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,920
Good.

38
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,920
Who are you?

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,160
Why do you want to kill us?

40
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,840
Don't get it wrong.

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,760
The one who wants to kill you
is Ning Xuanzhou.

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,400
What? Ning Xuanzhou?

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,040
Oh no, they want to frame you.

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
He's just a scholar.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Scholars can be the most ruthless.

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,840
He works for Ning,

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,800
aiming to destroy the foundation of Yan.

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,040
He uses his friendship with classmates
to lure you here

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,320
and then kill you all.

50
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,120
Doesn't it make perfect sense?

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,760
It makes sense, but it won't deceive me.

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,160
Hong Wuhui can handle
such a small matter.

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
This way he won't bother us too much.

54
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you thinking?

55
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,760
Wuhui is being hunted
by those men in black.

56
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,940
It's already lucky he escaped,

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,040
let alone help you.

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,350
No matter how skilled he is,

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,860
he can't fight off so many by himself.

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,560
He didn't come up the mountain alone.

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,400
Look at those disguised as commoners.

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,800
Each of them is highly skilled.

63
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
They must be elite soldiers.

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,760
They're focused on a narrow goal,
neglecting the greater danger.

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,360
I was just lamenting

66
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
why you weren't here.

67
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,040
But now you've come to me.

68
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,520
Good. When the two countries go to war,

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,920
with Yan losing General Hong,

70
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,200
they'll be even more defeated.

71
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
You think I came back from the border

72
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,880
just to catch rabbits?

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm here to fish.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
Watch the hostages.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,720
Go.

76
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,320
Why don't you help him?

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,240
If Hong Wuhui knew
I was the Commander of Shadow Guards,

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,760
he'd immediately capture

79
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,960
and interrogate me

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,880
about our deployments in Yan.

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
Since you asked me to go,

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,320
I'll go.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,800
You...

84
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,000
Wuhui has many men.

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,240
He can handle it himself.

86
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
And if he can't?

87
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,560
If he truly can't,

88
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,000
you can go in with a mask.

89
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
Alright.

90
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,120
I'll listen to you.

91
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,560
Chief, let's go.

92
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Oh no, they have hidden weapons.

93
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,320
Wuhui, they have hidden weapons

94
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,680
and plan to die together with you.

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,760
Didn't I tell you to stay put?

96
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,040
Why did you come here?

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,720
It's dangerous.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
If I hadn't come, you'd have been
blown to bits.

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,560
How did you know
they had hidden weapons?

100
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,200
I saw the man in black grabbing you

101
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,180
with a strange posture,
clearly ready to strike.

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,520
I guessed right.

103
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,760
General.

104
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,720
We retrieved this from them.

105
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,560
None of us have such weapons.

106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,000
It's strange. Did it fall from the sky?

107
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,080
Leave us.

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,720
Yes.

109
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I saw the man in black
accidentally shoot off course.

110
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
He meant to hit you,

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,000
but instead killed his companion.

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,360
How do you know?

113
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,520
I saw it.

114
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,690
An observer sees more clearly.

115
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,960
This weapon flew so fast,

116
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,960
yet you saw clearly?

117
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,200
Hong Wuhui,

118
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
do you trust me or my eyes?

119
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,880
I trust your eyes.

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
I trust you even more
and I believe in this fateful bond.

121
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,480
Xiyu, you risked yourself

122
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
to save my life.

123
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
This is destiny.

124
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,240
Destiny asked me to marry you.

125
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,440
Dream on!

126
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,240
Tell me, what's really going on?

127
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
How did you know
something would happen today?

128
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
I didn't just guess.

129
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,760
I discussed with Chancellor Hua.

130
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,360
We believe these villains

131
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,920
might strike
during the Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt.

132
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,960
Uncle?

133
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,120
The other day when someone
broke into my treasury,

134
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,160
I found firearms from Tu Mountain
and this note.

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,960
So these are Tu Mountain firearms.

136
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,560
I thought their clan had vanished,

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
but they were hiding in the dark.

138
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,760
The one who broke in must've
left the note to warn us,

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,960
saying Fragrance Teahouse had firearms

140
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,560
to kill students at the academy.

141
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,200
But when I secretly arrived,

142
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
the firearms were gone.

143
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,360
Secretly?

144
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,960
A secret mission wouldn't alert the enemy.

145
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Otherwise, how could we ambush
the Tu Mountain Clan today?

146
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
Chancellor Hua didn't make it public,

147
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,800
but secretly notified me.

148
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,560
Since the Tu Mountain Clan wanted
to kill the students,

149
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,920
we seized the chance

150
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
to ambush them

151
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,200
instead of waiting.

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,440
No wonder the sudden
Golden Pearl Rabbit Hunt.

153
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,160
Luoma Mountain is unsafe.

154
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,840
I wanted to keep you here,

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,610
but feared the clan
would be suspicious.

156
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,560
If we failed to catch them all,

157
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,320
you'd be in greater danger

158
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,120
since they'd figure out my plan.

159
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,600
Xiyu, I apologize

160
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,920
for putting you at risk.

161
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,160
Uncle, no need for this.

162
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,160
Chancellor Hua repeatedly told me
to protect you,

163
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,800
but you didn't listen

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,040
and came out yourself.

165
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,520
What's this?

166
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,800
Don't touch me.

167
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
Ning Xuanzhou?

168
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,000
Take it off.

169
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,040
I won't.

170
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
That jerk! I'll deal with him.

171
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,440
Master, I've failed.

172
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,560
I fell into Hong Wuhui's trap
Nat Luoma Mountain.

173
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,360
Most of our experts are gone.

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,760
Is Hong Wuhui that skilled?

175
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,960
Catching your people is one thing.

176
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,640
To catch you,

177
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,040
I must act personally.

178
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,440
Not only did they have gold,

179
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
but also hidden weapons and armor.

180
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,280
They have grand plans.

181
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,240
Yesterday, after a tiring day
at Luoma Mountain,

182
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
I was bothered by Wuhui this morning.

183
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,640
I have something to tell you.

184
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,040
You misunderstood my uncle.

185
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,160
Misunderstood?

186
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,560
Everything was arranged by my uncle.

187
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,440
So your uncle set the trap
at Luoma Mountain

188
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,800
for the Tu Mountain Clan?

189
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,560
In short, my uncle is on the good side.

190
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,600
But why did he hide the fact

191
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,640
that Marquis Wen visited him
before he died?

192
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,240
Maybe it was a personal matter
Marquis Wen

193
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
asked him to keep secret,

194
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,840
so he couldn't betray

195
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,560
Marquis Wen's trust.

196
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,360
This explanation is a bit weak.

197
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,560
I said this weapon is dangerous.

198
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,120
How dare you carry this?

199
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,640
This weapon?

200
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,040
I remember you told me

201
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,320
you brought it for self-defense
from home.

202
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,200
Isn't this a powerful weapon
of Ning royals?

203
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
You even placed it on the table
for me to see.

204
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,760
Were you testing me?

205
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,720
Commander Ning, good tactics.

206
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,400
Xiyu, I actually...

207
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,400
I had to ensure you knew nothing
about the Tu Mountain Clan

208
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,640
to clear your name completely

209
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,840
and protect you better.

210
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,680
This explanation is weak.

211
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,160
Xiyu, I'm sorry.

212
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,340
You can punish me all you want.

213
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
You always play the victim.

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,000
I won't always fall for it.

215
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,840
