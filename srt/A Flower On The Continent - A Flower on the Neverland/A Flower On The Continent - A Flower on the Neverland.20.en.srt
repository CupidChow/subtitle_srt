00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,780
=A Flower On The Continent=

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,660
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,880
So great!

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,280
So great!

5
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,520
What are you so happy about?

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,160
Don't you know yet?

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,920
For the sake of the two countries,

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,360
the emperor has allowed Prince Ning
to choose a wife from Yan.

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,560
He generously said to choose anyone.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,000
Doesn't that mean my chance has come?

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,960
I don't want a brother-in-law like that.

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,840
I don't want a brother like you.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,680
You always go against me.

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,480
You're driving me mad.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,280
You...

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,480
Xuan.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,440
Hurry up.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,560
Let's go.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,240
Mei.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,800
Mei, here you are.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,080
What are you doing?

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,080
The emperor has allowed Prince Ning

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
to choose a wife from Yan.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,480
Have you heard?

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
I secretly got hold of his portrait.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,560
Let me see.

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,320
I only heard he was a hostage
sent by Ning.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,480
I didn't expect him to be so handsome.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,880
No matter how handsome,
he can't compare to Master Hua.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,880
Why are you still thinking
about Hua Xiyu?

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,480
Just give up.

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,240
You two won't work out.

33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,880
Does he have some hidden illness?

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
Worse than an illness.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,520
What exactly is it?

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,600
I...

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,600
I can't tell you.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,920
If I tell you,

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,680
my brother will kill me.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,360
Anyway, I'll tell you this.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,560
Hua Xiyu

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,080
is all show.

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,160
He has no depth at all.

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
Forget it.

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,680
Look, my Xuan is charming and elegant.

46
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,840
He won't waste my youth.

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,960
Xuan.

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,680
He's been released?

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,480
He's safe?

50
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,480
He's been released,

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
but the emperor...

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,960
Xiyu,

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
I haven't finished speaking. This child.

54
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,960
(Teahouse)

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,480
Xuan.

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,680
Xuan.

57
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,240
Why did you cuff yourself to the bed?

58
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,960
This way you won't make me leave.

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,960
Are you crazy?

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,440
Spit out the key now.

61
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,800
Drink.

62
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,990
You just drank Soft Bone Powder.

63
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,360
I can tell.

64
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,880
That's very lucky.

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,920
Yes.

66
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,720
Xiyu,

67
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,640
aren't you at home recovering?

68
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
Have you seen Ning Xuanzhou?

69
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,160
I heard he's been released.

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,320
But he hasn't returned to the academy.

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,040
He's accomplished great deeds now.

72
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
Of course he's enjoying himself
in the palace.

73
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,880
In a few days, when he's
fully recovered,

74
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,560
he'll start choosing a wife.

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,680
Choosing a wife?

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,280
You don't know yet?

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,080
The emperor has allowed him
to choose any single woman

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
from Yan.

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,480
The hearts of men

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,360
are always fickle,

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
swaying with the wind.

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,920
He valued you before

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,480
because the two countries
were about to go to war.

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,560
As a hostage, he was in constant danger.

85
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,280
Only you treated him well.

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,480
Now he's in the limelight.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,880
Even the emperor looks at him
with new eyes.

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,320
With all the women to choose from,

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,480
that's another story entirely.

90
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,040
Mother, are you saying
he's changed his heart?

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,600
He's achieved such great deeds.

92
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Why not use this opportunity
to ask the emperor to marry you?

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,390
It'd be perfectly justified for you
to switch back to women's clothing.

94
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,640
A win-win

95
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
and it'd be a good thing.

96
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,120
But he didn't.

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,360
What is he thinking?

98
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,040
He seeks more after achieving something.

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,440
I've long said he's unreliable.

100
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,760
But Xiyu, don't worry.

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
I'll definitely get justice for you.

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,360
Even if someday

103
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,520
he dares to shamelessly come asking,

104
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
I'll never

105
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,920
return the gifts to him.

106
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,040
Your Highness, why don't you visit her
since you miss her so much?

107
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,960
I've already seen her.

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
She's been running back and forth

109
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
between her home and the academy,

110
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,480
faster than a rabbit.

111
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,360
It's clear she's fully recovered.

112
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,240
Such a good opportunity.

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,760
Why don't you directly ask

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,120
the Yan emperor to marry Miss Hua?

115
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,600
Xiyu has been disguised
as a man for 18 years.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,710
She feels deeply guilty
towards her uncle.

117
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
When to face all this

118
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
and reveal the truth

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
is for Xiyu herself to decide.

120
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,640
I have no authority to interfere.

121
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,320
If I directly propose to marry her,

122
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,960
when the Yan emperor speaks,

123
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
it'd be as if I'm forcing her.

124
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,680
Your Highness is very thoughtful.

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,960
She'll be only woman in my life.

126
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,740
Of course I need to be thorough.

127
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,360
It also happens to fit your preference.

128
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,760
What preference?

129
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,440
Nothing.

130
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,680
Speak.

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,360
Your Highness,

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
since you were young,

133
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,120
you've been reluctant to ask
for what you want.

134
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,320
You always waited for others

135
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,640
to bring it to you.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,520
Fei Ying, you've grown some guts.

137
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,160
I dare not.

138
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,360
It's what the emperor said.

139
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,440
Great.

140
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,480
An emperor speaks ill of his brother
behind his back.

141
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
I need compensation.

142
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
With you as a witness,

143
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,080
my brother should at least

144
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,480
cover half of my wedding's expense.

145
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,160
Master,

146
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,600
when those men broke in last time,

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,920
your inkstone was damaged.

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
You should use this piece.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
No,

150
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,440
I promised to keep it
for Xiyu's wedding.

151
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,760
I just wanted to have a look

152
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,880
to satisfy my eyes.

153
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,440
Alright, put it back.

154
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,920
Yes.

155
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,880
Xiyu, how are you feeling?

156
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,960
Are you feeling better?

157
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
I was just about to come see you.

158
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,680
What are you doing?

159
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,840
Get up.

160
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,880
Uncle.

161
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,800
Xiyu, don't do this.

162
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,560
I...

163
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,360
I've already told you.

164
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,520
Even if you didn't ask me,

165
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,240
I'd still plead for Prince Ning.

166
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,320
I've repeatedly advised the emperor

167
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,680
and he's released him.

168
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,400
Don't worry, get up.

169
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,160
Uncle,

170
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,720
I'm a woman.

171
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,280
For 18 years,

172
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,720
to become the head of the Hua family
and get Blood Coral,

173
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
I've been disguised as a man.

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
No matter how you punish me,

175
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,600
I'm willing.

176
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,480
Don't blame Xiyu.

177
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,480
It's my fault.

178
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,480
Chenghao, I apologize.

179
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,360
Madam Hua,

180
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,480
don't do this.

181
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,280
Madam Hua, get up.

182
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,320
Get up, Madam Hua.

183
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,680
Xiyu, get up too.

184
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,190
Otherwise...

185
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,920
I've disappointed you

186
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,720
and deceived you.

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,600
We feel deeply ashamed

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,640
and regretful.

189
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,720
Get up.

190
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,480
I already knew.

191
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,440
What cover-up?

192
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,790
It's OK to deceive others.

193
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,950
But how can you deceive family?

194
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Come on.

195
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,040
When you were just this tall,

196
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,000
I started teaching you to write by hand.

197
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,760
How could I not see through it?

198
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
Your uncle is the current chancellor.

199
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm not blind.

200
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,480
Then how...

201
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,120
Madam Hua,

202
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,360
my brother passed suddenly.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
It's inevitable to be cautious

204
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,690
as a widowed mother with an orphan.

205
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,520
You've suffered enough.

206
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,080
Since you say you have a son, so be it.

207
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,280
Why would I expose it?

208
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,790
Anyway, Xiyu is my brother's child.

209
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,090
I don't have children of my own.

210
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,640
Whether Xiyu is a boy or girl,

211
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm ultimately going
to leave the family to her.

212
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,520
The items in the treasure vault

213
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
and that Ning inkstone,

214
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,000
I never said those were betrothal gifts.

215
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,840
Keep this well and put it in the vault.

216
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
Take it out for Xiyu's wedding later.

217
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,400
Xiyu, those are all dowries

218
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,240
I've prepared for you.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,920
Uncle.

220
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,880
Don't cry.

221
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,640
I remembered.

222
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,000
There are a few more good things

223
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,920
that have been hidden for a long time.

224
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,760
If we hadn't cleared things up today,

225
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,880
I wouldn't have taken out

226
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,320
these girly items.

227
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,800
Xiyu, come.

228
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,080
See if you like them.

229
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,800
Come, open them.

230
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,560
Come, Madam Hua.

231
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Thank you, Uncle.

232
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,480
Chenghao,

233
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,680
over the years,

234
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,520
you've been so considerate to us.

235
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm truly ashamed.

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,480
I...

237
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
I don't even know what to say.

238
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,880
Madam Hua.

239
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,560
I knew the truth but couldn't reveal it.

240
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,240
If I exposed it, wouldn't it be
even more awkward?

241
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,240
It's better like this.

242
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,880
A family in harmony

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,080
is better than anything.

244
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Everything has passed.

245
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,560
It's all over.

246
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,320
Yes, this is good.

247
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,080
Everything is over.

248
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,480
Come, take them in.

249
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,160
Take out the clunky things

250
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,840
and move the bright-colored ones in.

251
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,280
This will be a boudoir now.

252
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,600
From now on, Xiyu will be
your young lady.

253
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,240
You'll have to address her differently.

254
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,080
Finally, I can openly comb

255
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
my daughter's hair.

256
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,880
My Flying Fairy Bun

257
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,720
is the best in the world.

258
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,560
Mother, be modest.

259
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,280
There's at least one who can do it

260
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
better than you.

261
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,560
Still think you're a man?

262
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,640
You speak so bluntly and coarsely.

263
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,280
From now on, you're a young girl.

264
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,280
You should speak softly and gently

265
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,880
with tenderness.

266
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
Got it, Mother.

267
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,560
Come, I'll choose a hairpin for you.

268
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,400
How about this one?

269
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,400
Mother,

270
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,880
today I must wear this.

271
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,640
Alright,

272
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,680
as you like.

273
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,680
You're so pretty.

274
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,320
My little girl is really pretty.

275
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,440
She looks like me.

276
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,720
Do I look good?

277
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,400
You do.

278
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,480
You look good too.

279
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,200
Ladies, please.

280
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Go, go, hurry up.

281
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,840
Hurry inside.

282
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,600
He can choose a wife anywhere.

283
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,200
Why does it have to be at the academy?

284
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,840
It's clearly showing off.

285
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,320
It's infuriating. He used to be
just a hostage.

286
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,120
Now, he can choose any girl he wants.

287
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,320
Oh no.

288
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,520
What if Miss Pei chooses him?

289
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,520
What should I do?

290
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,280
Let's look.

291
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,960
Mei, why are you so happy?

292
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
It's a great day today.

293
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,080
How can I not be happy?

294
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,080
What, are you not happy?

295
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,160
I...I can't go against
the emperor's order.

296
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,200
That's why I'm here.

297
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,640
But besides Master Hua,

298
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,040
no one else can marry me.

299
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
In this lifetime, I'll only marry him.

300
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,280
I know you want to marry him,

301
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,840
but he isn't able to marry you.

302
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,040
What are you trying to say?

303
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,520
I...

304
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,400
Prince Ning has arrived.

305
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,720
Xuan!

306
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
