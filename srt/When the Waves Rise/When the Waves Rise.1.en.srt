1
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,356
(When The Waves Rise)

2
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,713
Hey, you look pretty laid back.
You know that we're late, huh?

3
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:04,635
No, l ran all the way here and I was...

4
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:08,667
Too much talking.

5
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:17,135
Being late for a minute or an hour,
I'm late anyway.

6
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:22,901
Then I'd rather get there an hour late.
And we're already 10 minutes late.

7
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:26,760
Actually, you are.

8
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:30,752
I'm sorry.

9
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:33,862
Let's go.

10
00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:58,917
What is it?

11
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:09,979
My ball. My ball.

12
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,500
Nice!

13
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,698
Kyung-jun, you're not playing?

14
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,651
Yeah, I'll take a break.

15
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:50,768
Isn't it burning?

16
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,870
It is.

17
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:54,752
Fucking hot.

18
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,667
Well?

19
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,596
It's just fun.

20
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:06,963
You don't have to think too much.

21
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:09,838
You should try.

22
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:12,643
It feels great.

23
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:17,213
I'm not good friends with the ball.

24
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:26,365
Or is it the ball that hates me?

25
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,355
That's why you look so pale.

26
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,271
Huh? Look at me.

27
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:38,349
Huh?

28
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,123
It's because you do it alone.

29
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:48,721
Hey, it's dirty.

30
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:49,724
Did it get into your eyes?

31
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,599
Stop.

32
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:52,029
- What's dirty?
- Stop.

33
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:53,787
- What?
- Stop!!

34
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:03,787
A desolate sea.

35
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:06,203
It doesn't even fluctuate.

36
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:11,125
The boatman is full of anxiety.
Look all over the sea.

37
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:15,253
The sea has not a speck of wind.

38
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,628
The four seas, there is no current.

39
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,558
Kyung-jun, you're the best.

40
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:27,687
How big is your dream
so that you could dream during the class?

41
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,751
Kyung-jun must be the president.

42
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:32,097
The president with the guitar.

43
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,371
Sounds great.

44
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:46,017
Okay, now write your thoughts
and feelings based on the poem.

45
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,339
Yes, sir.

46
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,058
You're not gonna write it
with your eyes, right? Use your hands.

47
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,597
I guess my head is in the cloud these days.

48
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,761
Why?

49
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,472
I lost the guitar pick.

50
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:17,245
Again?

51
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:22,097
I should hang it somewhere around my neck.

52
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:33,050
Happy Birthday.

53
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,925
Sorry?

54
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:39,269
Your Birthday. Happy Birthday.

55
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,667
Hey, who in the world celebrates
a birthday like that?

56
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,131
Well...

57
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:50,584
you're born so I'm saying Happy Birthday…

58
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:51,683
Keep going.

59
00:07:58,388 --> 00:07:59,503
Nothing.

60
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,573
I killed my mom when I was born.

61
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,745
I don't remember.

62
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:23,120
People say I did…

63
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:30,027
You better live hard, man.

64
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:37,581
It doesn't work out how I want it too…
including my studies.

65
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,079
So?

66
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:51,909
Don’t you have anything for me?

67
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,417
No…

68
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:17,909
Let's go out.

69
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:21,814
Now?

70
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,981
No.

71
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:26,066
Not a bad idea but on your birthday.

72
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,253
It's a week after mine, right?

73
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,559
Oh, right.

74
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,277
I think you aren’t in a good mood
even when it’s not your birthday.

75
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,964
I can't understand if you don't talk.

76
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,784
Nah. There’s no need.

77
00:09:57,206 --> 00:10:00,792
Nah. Let's go. Huh?

78
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:05,815
Let's make it a good one.
And stop holding a grudge.

79
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,331
What are you guys doing?

80
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,537
Ah…

81
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:20,698
Hwi-young has something on his shoulder.

82
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,277
I was just kidding. Why so surprised?

83
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,355
Let's hang out together.

84
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:34,441
You only hang out with him.

85
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:38,434
Why does he have so much to say today?

86
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:42,363
Let's play soccer,
it's Kyung-jun's birthday.

87
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:43,941
Do you want to join, Hwi-young?

88
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:46,710
Umm…

89
00:10:47,744 --> 00:10:50,058
I have something to do.

90
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,683
Sorry.

91
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,767
Let's go, Kyung-jun.

92
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,183
Alright.

93
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,355
I'll leave.

94
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,261
Take care.

95
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,581
Umm…

96
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:38,675
Should I keep standing here?

97
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:51,714
I'll go then.

98
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:54,862
- Bye.
- No. Come in.

99
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,642
Did you eat something?

100
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:02,050
Yeah… Not really.

101
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:21,886
Lie on the bed.

102
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,027
The floor might be dirty.

103
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,636
I'm messier than the floor.

104
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:29,872
And the floor looks fine.

105
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:32,043
But…

106
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:34,976
Then hand me the pillow.

107
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,425
This is my comfiest pose.

108
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:02,292
Try it. It feels great.

109
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:12,500
You know what?

110
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,542
I always had a feeling that your room is tidy.

111
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:25,386
It's better to be tidy than messy.

112
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,784
Who are you giving that to?

113
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,066
- Sorry?
- Is it mine?

114
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,870
Of course not.

115
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,402
If it's a no, why are you serious?

116
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,777
Huh?

117
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:47,042
Nothing!

118
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:55,847
What is it?

119
00:14:57,114 --> 00:15:01,402
The ocean? Are we going to the beach?

120
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:04,878
Yes…

121
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,433
I thought it would be a good idea
to go somewhere that's open.

122
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,058
And I like the ocean.

123
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:12,167
You're looking for somewhere to go!

124
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:13,909
You said it was too much.

125
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:18,175
But, I like the ocean, too.

126
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:20,456
Great. Let's go.

127
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:22,619
We should do it right away.

128
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:24,353
Let's book the bus ticket now.

129
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,180
Okay.

130
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:55,605
Why?

131
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:58,370
No, nothing.

132
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:16,558
I'll go if you go.

133
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,157
We should go together.

134
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,019
But without him.

135
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,581
What's that?

136
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,808
What happened?

137
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:40,316
Hey, Kyung-jun.

138
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:43,180
Can we talk outside?

139
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:44,913
Sure.

140
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:02,847
Hey, shut up.

141
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,042
You know.

142
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:09,732
I'm not

143
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:14,956
like that…

144
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,091
Let's go, Kkyung-jun.

145
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:56,739
Okay.

146
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:38,513
Kyung-jun.

147
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,950
Let's talk for a minute…

148
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,966
What are you doing here?

149
00:23:26,107 --> 00:23:28,315
Don't you have anything to say?

150
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:52,224
- Hwi-young, last time I…
- No.

151
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,591
It's alright.

152
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,427
- I think we need to talk…
- No.

153
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,715
Please go home.

154
00:24:27,316 --> 00:24:28,871
Hey, what makes me feel so stuffy?

155
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:37,767
Why is it so important?

156
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:41,645
Why do you have too much in your mind?

157
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:50,298
Please say something.

158
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:57,009
I can’t understand unless you talk.

159
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:08,392
Actually.

160
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,321
I think I was wrong.

161
00:25:16,677 --> 00:25:17,751
Sorry?

162
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:28,837
Why are you so foolish?

163
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,157
I got screwed!

164
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,196
Why?

165
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,454
What day is it today?

166
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,345
Wednesday.

167
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:03,203
No. The date.

168
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:04,862
18th.

169
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:06,517
Shit…

170
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:10,706
I have my make up class and I forgot.

171
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:13,704
Hey, you're wrong.
You didn't forget, you just didn't go.

172
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:15,939
Go now. You won't be scolded.

173
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,767
No way. It's already late.
Let's go home.

174
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,259
And I really can't.

175
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,318
Was it tough?

176
00:35:02,343 --> 00:35:03,309
Sorry?

177
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:06,460
To come here.

178
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,859
It's a long way.

179
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,148
Good.

180
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:26,476
Are you dumb?

181
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:28,187
What?

182
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,046
If you want to laugh, you need two.

183
00:35:34,114 --> 00:35:36,109
One is lonely.

184
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,210
There should be two to exchange presents.

185
00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:09,976
My birthday has passed.

186
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:15,264
Hey, stop playing around
and look at it later.

187
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,316
The letter is for later.

188
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:20,937
Hey, why did you give it to me,
if you going to be like this?

189
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,929
The letter is for later! Wait!

190
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:39,959
<i>When the hot sun shines
on the sea, I think of you.</i>

191
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:47,795
<i>When the moonlight floats
on the spring water, I think of you.</i>

192
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:55,256
<i>In the blue sky, In the warm sand,
when there is a lot of dust,</i>

193
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:59,506
<i>When the ball moves freely, I see you.</i>

194
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:03,811
<i>When the waves of faint sound break.</i>

195
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:07,091
<i>Sometimes everything is still underwater.</i>

196
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:11,384
<i>Sitting in front of the beach, I hear you.</i>

197
00:37:13,543 --> 00:37:16,418
<i>Even when I'm far away from you,</i>

198
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,795
<i>I'm just reminded of what we said.</i>

199
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,446
<i>I am with you, pondering happy times.</i>

200
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:28,439
<i>You are close to me,</i>

201
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,509
<i>so when the sun falls asleep today,</i>

202
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,876
<i>and the quiet time comes,</i>

203
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:39,265
<i>I hope you become a sunset for me.</i>

204
00:38:30,764 --> 00:38:40,490
(When the waves rise)

205
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:52,132
(When the waves rise)
