00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:36,192
<i>[Flourished Peony]</i>

2
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:38,560
<i>[Episode 22]</i>

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,879
My Lord said

4
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,400
there are few people in the mountains,

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,920
so it's easiest to avoid being seen.

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,439
Suizhi is always so considerate.

7
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:03,959
Suizhi.

8
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,056
Mr. Cheng.

9
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,832
This is…

10
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,016
Mr. Cheng.

11
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,448
Long time no see.

12
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,599
Greetings, Your Majesty.

13
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,480
Here.

14
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,280
He is going on patrol incognito,

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,759
so now he is Mr. Third.

16
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,960
The officials of the Eastern Capital's garrison,
together with those of higher and lower ranks,

17
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,599
seized other's farmland,
bribing the Ministry of Revenue,

18
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,000
and altering records.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have thoroughly investigated
the farmland plots that have been seized

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,240
and recorded them in the register.

21
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,240
I have compared it
with the tax and corvée ledgers,

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,919
and have grasped the Chen family's
methods and evidence of seizing farmlands.

23
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,400
Back then, the imperial court demoted you,

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
and sent you to Luoyang,

25
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,080
being the Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,680
But in my heart,

27
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,199
you are still my Imperial Censor.

28
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,560
After three years of lying low,
you have still maintained your duties.

29
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,000
Finally, you've thoroughly investigated
the Luoyang officialdom.

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,199
I am greatly comforted.

31
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Your Majesty, although
I report this to you alone today,

32
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,240
the evidence that has been investigated
is not the work of myself alone.

33
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,680
Although the Luoyang officialdom has been
controlled by the Chen family and other families,

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,039
there are still many loyal ministers

35
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,639
who are devoted to the public and you.

36
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,680
Please note down their names.

37
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,120
I shall surely reward
and promote them for their efforts.

38
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,272
Yes.

39
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,759
Back then, we were all students of Mr. Xu,

40
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,560
and you dared to argue with Mr. Third.

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,439
Haven't seen you for three years,
now we've grown estranged.

42
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,120
Having walked for so long, aren't you thirsty?

43
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,319
Sit down and have some tea.

44
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,120
I think, in order to deceive Prince Ning,

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,000
making Cheng Lang come here
and suffer from all the disdain

46
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,000
is really wronged him.

47
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,240
Serving the country and Your Majesty

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,304
is my pleasure.

49
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,576
Your Majesty.

50
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,800
Mr. Third. You are the one who suffer,
putting on performances in Chang'an every day.

51
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,560
Me too.

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,839
Why don't you comfort me?

53
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,560
When you were Your Majesty's reading companion,

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,680
you were always acting wildly.

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
Only you could be

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
the notorious Floral Envoy.

57
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,480
Without being detected by others,

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,879
and you can find joy in it.

59
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,319
Still, you understand Suizhi well.

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,839
The Chen family's reach
extends to all six ministries.

61
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,040
All thanks to Prince Ning.

62
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,120
Cui Mao also revealed

63
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,720
many details of the Chen family
acting as the intermediary,

64
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,920
assisting Prince Ning
of buying and selling official positions.

65
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,279
And most of the money and land he embezzled

66
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,759
were offered to Prince Ning.

67
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,519
If we are to remove Prince Ning,

68
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,839
we must first take down the Chen family.

69
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,360
The more important the Chen family is,

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
the less we can act rashly.

71
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,279
We must wait for a reliable opportunity
to capture them all in one fell swoop.

72
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,839
We can't give Prince Ning any chance
to meddle or to overturn the case.

73
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,920
Keeper Chen gets so much bribe
and doesn't want to stop at all.

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
The Ministry of Revenue has future troubles.

75
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,040
Perhaps it won't be long

76
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,480
before we can take actions.

77
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:30,560
<i>[Fuyun Temple]</i>

78
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,360
My visit this time

79
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
is to encourage all the students.

80
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,720
The new policies have been issued.

81
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm awaiting your distinguished success

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,040
to unfold a grand plan and prosper the country.

83
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,240
We shall remember it well.

84
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,800
Your sister once served
as a maid for writing supplies,

85
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,040
so she could teach you how to read.

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,639
I usually deal with flowers
and medicinal herbs.

87
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,319
How about teaching you something else?

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,560
Look. This is

89
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,720
called lithospermum.

90
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,360
Right, that one is goosefoot vegetable.

91
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
Both of these are edible.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,519
We can rely on them
to fill our stomachs in the future.

93
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,720
However, in here, soldiers often come.

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,439
We need to be cautious.

95
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,959
Come on, look.

96
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,879
Did you see these yellow ones?

97
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,879
This is called buttercup.

98
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,360
There's more over there.

99
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Look, although they look like water celery,

100
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,560
the whole plant is poisonous. It's not edible.

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,920
If you eat it,

102
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,199
it will upset your stomach and cause blisters.

103
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,896
Remember?

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,048
There's some more over here.

105
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,519
This is called pea leaf.

106
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,560
You can make a sound with it.

107
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,584
Look.

108
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,519
From now on, whenever you blow on this,

109
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,720
I'll know you're calling me. Give it a try.

110
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,912
Extract the arrow.

111
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,592
Mount the bow.

112
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,832
Draw the bow.

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,776
Release the arrow.

114
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,720
Archery skills are to be inspected
once every five days.

115
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,560
It is for you to practice diligently
and improve accuracy.

116
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,704
What have you all done?

117
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,159
Your hands are fine.

118
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,039
How can you be good at archery?

119
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,840
How can you go into battle
and kill enemies in the future?

120
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,896
Bring them here.

121
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,712
Since you can't concentrate on
shooting the straw men.

122
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:52,759
Hurry.

123
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,840
Then let's see the real people
next to the straw men.

124
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,159
Hurry.

125
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,159
Either be warriors skilled enough
to shoot well,

126
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,000
or be murderers who kill the innocent.

127
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,480
Hurry, get in position.

128
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,576
Shoot.

129
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,600
Otherwise, you will be discharged
from the military and get out of here.

130
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,080
Prepare.

131
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,032
Extract the arrow.

132
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,312
Mount the bow.

133
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,399
Draw the bow.

134
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,096
Draw the bow.

135
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,304
Release the arrow.

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
How are you? Let me see.

137
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,816
Bear with it.

138
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,360
Soldiers and generals shall
protect the nation and the people.

139
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,639
You do not protect the people,

140
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,559
yet you are killing the innocent here.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,840
I am here to protect the people
with decent household register.

142
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,679
But you slaves, worth no more than livestock.

143
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,200
It's an honor for you slaves to die here.

144
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,000
Did your sister die the same way?

145
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,136
Take them away.

146
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,440
Mr. Third is used to sitting
in a carriage every day.

147
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,080
Today he rides a horse himself,

148
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,320
you must take good care of him.

149
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,279
If he gets bumped or bruised,

150
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll have to come up with an excuse for him
lying to his elder brother.

151
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,360
If you're not at ease,

152
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,679
might as well come along with me.

153
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,528
Let's go.

154
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,320
What makes you

155
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,240
to stay for one more day to make purchases?

156
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,879
Luoyang's bright stars and moon?

157
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,440
The bright moon here does not belong to me.

158
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,600
Protect His Majesty well.

159
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,616
Yes.

160
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,840
Why didn't they wait for us to come back?
Let's go.

161
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,112
My father taught me to distinguish herbs

162
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,563
for saving people.

163
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,159
But now that I've made my choice,
I won't regret it.

164
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,360
We can't live in constant fear of being shot,

165
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,200
nor can we indulge them to kill randomly.

166
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:20,600
I am not strong enough,
and this is the only resort I can do.

167
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,200
<i>Will it work?</i>

168
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,159
Definitely.

169
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,488
How is it?

170
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:55,159
What's going on?

171
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,840
General, the new soldiers
ate night snack secretly.

172
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,519
And they mistakenly ate
poisonous wild vegetables.

173
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,840
No wonder they can't practice archery well.

174
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,159
Gambling and drinking all night,

175
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,000
you deserve to die from the poison.

176
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,039
Hurry up and brew the medicine to save them.

177
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,320
General, many are poisoned.

178
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,639
There is not enough medicine.

179
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,840
Who has a stomach ache?

180
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,120
The wild vegetables are poisonous.

181
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,120
Who has a stomach ache?

182
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,200
The wild vegetables are poisonous.

183
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,159
Who has a stomach ache?

184
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,879
The wild vegetables are poisonous.

185
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,360
Who has a stomach ache?

186
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,759
The wild vegetables are poisonous.

187
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,279
I-I feel terrible.

188
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,399
- Hurry.
- Save me.

189
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,000
Come on, hurry.

190
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,759
There is insufficient
porridge and rice provided.

191
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,200
So I often go to the back mountain
to dig wild vegetables to fill the stomach.

192
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,559
I went tonight
and found a piece of buttercup dug up,

193
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,320
fearing someone in the camp
might eat it by mistake.

194
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,559
So I hurried back to make this medicinal soup.

195
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,920
You can treat people?

196
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,080
My mother family once ran a pharmacy,
so I know some of it.

197
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,879
Kuh-seng, lycoris leaf.

198
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,320
They can indeed detoxify and induce vomiting.

199
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,039
You dug them up from the back mountain?

200
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,120
Yes.

201
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,840
Use what's available locally.

202
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,920
Very good.

203
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,344
General.

204
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:30,440
General.

205
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,519
- General.
- General, save me.

206
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,576
General, save me.

207
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:34,176
Save them.

208
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:35,200
Yes.

209
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,600
- General, save me.
- Save me.

210
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,639
- General.
- General, save me.

211
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,720
- General, save me.
- General, save me.

212
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,304
Feed them this.

213
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,919
Thank you for your help, lady physician.

214
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,159
I owe you this favor.

215
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You're welcome.

216
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,600
I remember you, a lowly slave.

217
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,360
You're not doing this out of kindness, right?

218
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
Indeed.

219
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,120
What exactly are you up to?

220
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,120
I want to live on.

221
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
General, you are discerning.

222
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,960
I dare not hide anything from you.

223
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,759
When I saw the buttercup got dug up,

224
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,759
the first thought that came to my mind
was not worry,

225
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,480
but joy.

226
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,960
I am glad
that perhaps I am not destined to die.

227
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,399
Heaven has given me another chance.

228
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,799
If I die for your training,

229
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,039
of course, I deserve it.

230
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,120
But General, you have seen it.

231
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,360
The new soldiers are slacking off
and negligent in training.

232
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,960
If I die by a stray arrow,

233
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,000
I would never accept it.

234
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,359
I want to prove to you,

235
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,920
apart from being a useless target,

236
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,599
I can do more for you.

237
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,440
I know pharmacology, am familiar with herbs,

238
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
skilled in writing, and can keep accounts.

239
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,720
General,

240
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,680
please let me and her
to work at the physician's.

241
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,440
I will surely work diligently.

242
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,000
General, if it weren't for these two
delivering the medicine in time,

243
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,559
I'm afraid the entire new soldier camp
would have fallen ill en masse.

244
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,480
By then, if the Ministry of War
places the blame,

245
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,720
you couldn't escape the blame.

246
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,279
I just happen to be short of hands.

247
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,359
I see these two slaves are smart and resolute.

248
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,960
Why not grant her request?

249
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,839
Fragile girls struggle to survive
in desperate situations.

250
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,640
General Yuan, we were wrong.

251
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,599
We should not have been slacking off.

252
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,640
Not only harmed others,
but also harmed ourselves.

253
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,319
General Yuan, please grant her request.

254
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Let's temporarily suspend
the archery skills inspection.

255
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
After recuperating,
train the military discipline first.

256
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,808
If there are some who are slacking off,
they will be dealt with by military law.

257
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:20,880
Yes.

258
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

259
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,880
Your request

260
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,600
is granted.

261
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,079
Thanks, General.

262
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,304
Your starched noodles.

263
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,200
The starched noodles mentioned by Lady He

264
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,839
doesn't look anything special.

265
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,039
Since we're here, have a taste.

266
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,640
Get a bowl, let's eat it together.

267
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,704
Thank you, my lord.

268
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:06,920
Shopkeeper, a bowl of starched noodles.

269
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,559
You're out of luck today.

270
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,039
The last bowl has already been
bought by this gentleman.

271
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
Sir, I am willing to pay three times the price.

272
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,039
Could you please give up
this bowl of starched noodles for me?

273
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,720
May I ask you the reason for this?

274
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,240
He is a glutton,

275
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,079
if you don't have a decent reason,
he surely won't give it up.

276
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,759
To be honest,

277
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,799
I have a daughter,

278
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,279
who was harshly treated by her husband
and ran away.

279
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,880
Unfortunately,
she fell to her death from a cliff.

280
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,759
Until now, her remains have not been found.

281
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,319
And her husband showed no concern about it,

282
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,759
and arranged a new marriage
before the mourning period was over.

283
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,319
I worry my daughter will become

284
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,160
a lonely soul with no one to care for.

285
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,200
So I thought to buy some of her favorite foods.

286
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,240
This is one of them.

287
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,839
And her favorite Hu cakes,

288
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,000
the hairpin flowers my wife made for her.

289
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,359
I hope her to be born into a good family
in her next life

290
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,799
and marry a kind and harmonious husband,

291
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,960
living in comfort till old age
with children all around.

292
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,440
<i>Back then, in Luoyang,
the baked Hu cakes you sent me</i>

293
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,799
<i>also had a layer of honey brushed on it.</i>

294
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,839
<i>This is my family's exclusive roasting method.</i>

295
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,640
<i>I don't usually pass it on to outsiders.</i>

296
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
<i>You're in for a treat today.</i>

297
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,880
The color of this cake
is different from others.

298
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,736
Where did you buy it?

299
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,880
It's not bought,

300
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,519
but I made it myself.

301
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,519
This is my family's exclusive roasting method.

302
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,519
Brush a layer of honey before roasting,

303
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,559
and brush another layer
after it comes out of the oven.

304
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,839
It's crisp and sweet, with excellent flavor.

305
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
I can give you the noodle.

306
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,160
But without it, I have nothing to fill me up.

307
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:04,039
May I

308
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,279
ask you to exchange a few pancakes with us?

309
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,720
Of course.

310
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,519
You are willing to give it to me.

311
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,440
I really thank you.

312
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,200
My daughter is still waiting.

313
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,680
I take my leave.

314
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,720
Sir.

315
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Do not worry.

316
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,920
Since your daughter's remains
have not been found,

317
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,880
perhaps she was saved by some divine physician

318
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,359
and is now living a carefree life.

319
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,920
If you pull yourself together
and enjoy each day with an open heart,

320
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,480
perhaps, you two could reunite.

321
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,319
Thank you for your blessings.

322
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,799
If my daughter knows it,

323
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,640
she would certainly be grateful to you.

324
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,720
This Master He
wishes for his daughter to marry well,

325
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,359
if he were to know of
Lady He's current situation,

326
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,720
I wonder what he would think.

327
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,880
His love for his daughter is genuine,

328
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,680
but he really doesn't understand his daughter.

329
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Take it and go.

330
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,432
Yes.

331
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,696
Bear with it.

332
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,616
Bear with it.

333
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,032
Alright.

334
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,119
After you were shot by the arrow,
you contracted lockjaw from the metal wound.

335
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,200
This is the wound medicine I obtained
from the physician.

336
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,559
Apply it several times a day,

337
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,440
and you will get better soon.

338
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,000
The day after tomorrow, the physician
will go into town to make purchases.

339
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I can go with him as an assistant.

340
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,559
At that time, I will try
to notify my friends in Chang'an

341
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,000
to come to save us.

342
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,680
My lord.

343
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,799
How is it going?

344
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,240
Those officials, upon hearing the name
of the Stables Bureau,

345
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
showed cold shoulder.

346
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,160
Not to mention going
to the military camp to save someone.

347
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,920
Qiushi, deliver this letter
to the military camp

348
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,559
and tell Mudan
that I am thinking of ways to save her,

349
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,680
and to make sure she takes care of herself.

350
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,440
Once she's out of the military camp,

351
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,279
I will get her a decent household register
and marry her.

352
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,000
And I will surely protect her well.

353
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,200
Let her wait for me.

354
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,079
Moreover, this is the peace amulet
I got from Mount Zhongnan.

355
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,119
Take it to her as well.

356
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,680
Yes.

357
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,519
Shred the letter
and return it to the Liu Mansion.

358
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,480
I guess I don't need
to teach you what to say, right?

359
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,319
I understand.

360
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,559
Regarding He Weifang…

361
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,160
Rest assured, Your Highness.

362
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,519
I will make her pay for the pain you endured.

363
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,320
Stop!

364
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,039
She has done nothing wrong,
why are you beating her?

365
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,720
This slave acts suspiciously,

366
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,079
and she even has the wound medicine.

367
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,960
She must have stolen such a precious medicine.

368
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,680
Naturally, she must be beaten
to death as punishment.

369
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,248
She did not steal it.

370
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,759
The medicine was a reward
from the military physician.

371
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,880
If you don't believe it,
you can just go ask him.

372
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,680
Don't be afraid.

373
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,519
I will take you to see the physician.

374
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,640
Don't be afraid.
I will take you to see the physician.

375
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,359
Let's go. I'll carry you.

376
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,880
Another one dead. Later,
carry them all out and dispose of them.

377
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,599
Why was this person beaten like this?

378
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,480
What mistake did she actually make?

379
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,240
She did not make a mistake.

380
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,720
She never knew her name or surname,

381
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,160
and never knew who her parents were.

382
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,359
From the time she could remember,
she was sold off with her sister.

383
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,920
Just because she offended
someone of high status,

384
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
then she was poisoned to mute
and driven out of the mansion.

385
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,799
When she was almost starved to death,

386
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,799
the two of them simply because
they stole a bowl of rice porridge,

387
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,799
then were taken to the yamen
and sentenced here.

388
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,519
She didn't get enough to fill her stomachs.
What crime is there?

389
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,880
Seeking medicine for treatment,
why should she be criticized?

390
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,160
The world has treated her unfairly.

391
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,279
She didn't deserve to be left here
in the hemp clothes of a criminal slave

392
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,400
and have her body exposed in the wilderness.

393
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,319
I can't save her.

394
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
I just hope my clothes

395
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,319
can give her a last shred of dignity.

396
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,440
Later, we will send them out of the camp.

397
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,544
You come along too,

398
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,240
as a send-off for your friend.

399
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,472
Thank you.

400
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,519
He Weifang, right?

401
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,880
General said

402
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,440
that a banquet be held in the army today,

403
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,839
but there is a shortage of kitchen staff,

404
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,079
so you are ordered to go and assist.

405
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,680
There's a pretty young lady hidden here.

406
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:17,720
Young lady, stop working.

407
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,559
Come play with us.

408
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,240
Sirs, you're under General Yuan, aren't you?

409
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,359
Leaving the ranks without permission.
It seems that you are drunk.

410
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,720
I'll go ask General Yuan to come.

411
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,359
What's the hurry?

412
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,880
Wait until we've had our fun,

413
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,799
naturally, we'll ask him to join us.

414
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,688
Resist us?

415
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,440
Don't come over.

416
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,096
Who are you?

417
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,320
Stop.

418
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,600
<i>Jiang Changyang.</i>

419
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,968
<i>Thank you.</i>

420
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
No way.

421
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,160
You're so cunning.

422
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,200
How could you…?

423
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,680
Sir, this slave died a terrible death.

424
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,240
And she had a serious illness.

425
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,880
I'm afraid she'd dirty you.

426
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,880
Hurry! Something's wrong
with the lady physician.

427
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,079
Go help.

428
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,839
Who dares to bully the lady physician?

429
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,359
I'm the first to punish him.

430
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,400
I can't catch my breath.

431
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,279
S-Save me.

432
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,559
If you can't catch your breath,

433
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,880
slit your own throat, then you could breathe.

434
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,880
Lady physician, are you all right?

435
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,599
I'm fine.

436
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,200
These soldiers took advantage
of me being alone in the kitchen,

437
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,799
wanting to act indecently to me.

438
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,359
Fortunately, they suddenly
suffered from paralysis,

439
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,480
so I could escape.

440
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,880
Rascals!

441
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,839
How dare you to lay a hand
on the lady physician!

442
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:38,039
Bros, beat them hard.

443
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,319
How dare you to lay a hand on her!

444
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,640
Act indecently? How dare you!

445
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,039
Stop it.

446
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,200
Stop beating, stop!

447
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,080
Still laughing?

448
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,799
If you weren't that lucky,

449
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,440
they suddenly suffered from paralysis,

450
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,880
then you would have met your end here today.

451
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,920
I've never been lucky.

452
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,640
The reason I'm alive to see you

453
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,079
is that someone risked her life to inform me.

454
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,640
<i>He Weifang will come
to help in the kitchen tonight.</i>

455
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,519
<i>General Yuan has ordered
to torture her to death.</i>

456
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,680
<i>Yes, rest assured.</i>

457
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,759
<i>Who is it? Chase her.</i>

458
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,808
<i>Yes.</i>

459
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,784
<i>Yuan… Harm…</i>

460
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,272
<i>You…</i>

461
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,840
<i>Is the soup ready?</i>

462
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,000
<i>The soup's not ready yet.</i>

463
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,559
<i>Maybe you go serve the other dishes first.</i>

464
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,680
<i>Okay, then hurry up.</i>

465
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,599
She was in imminent danger,

466
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,200
but at the crucial moment,
she still thought to warn me.

467
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,240
I can never

468
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,119
repay her grace and favor in my life.

469
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,440
Now that you are safe and sound,

470
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,112
then her efforts

471
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:00,920
have not been in vain.

472
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,400
But some people are different.

473
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
He Weifang is the floriculturist of my mansion,

474
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,599
if you killed her,

475
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,199
who would manage the flowers of my mansion?

476
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,079
She was convicted and sent to my camp,

477
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,639
naturally, she's under my command.

478
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,280
You are a mere Floral Envoy, what right
have you to meddle in my military affairs?

479
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,960
And you have no authority to punish me.

480
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,519
You said I am a Floral Envoy.

481
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,199
Favored by His Majesty,

482
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,000
I naturally beat whoever I please

483
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,360
and kill whoever I desire.

484
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,960
I am an official, and she is a slave.

485
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,880
I don't believe
that you would dare kill me for her.

486
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,280
It's not for her,

487
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,880
I do it for the flowers of my mansion.

488
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,920
How arrogant!

489
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,400
Do you know How many generals
are there in Chang'an?

490
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,159
And how many Floral Envoys are there?

491
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,159
Will the person behind you protect you,

492
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,519
or will he respect His Majesty?

493
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,400
General Yuan, now I finally understand

494
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,599
what suffers the official slaves would face.

495
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,559
They live in fear
of getting their throats be pierced

496
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,119
and die silently one day.

497
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,320
Now, do you want to die

498
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:37,719
or to survive?

499
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,079
I want to survive.

500
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,344
I want to survive.

501
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,079
Why do you want to kill me?

502
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,519
He is a person promoted by His Highness.

503
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,519
Who has the capability to order him around?

504
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,599
Send him to the Ministry of War

505
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:13,360
and ask Mr. Zhang
how the Ministry of War manages people.

506
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,320
He can't keep the army discipline well
and makes cruel actions.

507
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,719
He dares to defy me!

508
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Don't you even respect His Majesty?

509
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,519
If Mr. Zhang asks how to deal with him…

510
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:27,599
Let him decide on his own.

511
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,079
Anyway, if I don't vent this anger,

512
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,880
I would go tell His Majesty about it.

513
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,968
Yes.

514
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,120
Take him away.

515
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,720
It's County Princess.

516
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,440
County Princess took action against you,

517
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,192
are you surprised?

518
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,960
She knows I don't fall for Liu Chang at all.

519
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,679
Why did she do so?

520
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm afraid Liu Chang did something again

521
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,519
that made her utterly hate you.

522
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,760
Even going to the Ministry of War, General Yuan

523
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,280
won't confess that it's County Princess
who asked him to do so, right?

524
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,480
Of course.

525
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,840
Unless he doesn't want
his whole family to survive.

526
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,960
Whether it's Yulu, or the mute girl,

527
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,880
I can't let the instigator be punished.

528
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,719
Enslaved in the army,

529
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,119
it was a near-certain death.

530
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:49,199
But you still fought for a glimmer of hope.

531
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,320
Ants are tiny and can be crushed.

532
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,079
But if ants swarm,

533
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,360
they can gnaw through a high platform.

534
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,400
I don't even know your name.

535
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,719
How shall I pay tribute to you in the future?

536
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,719
Never forget her is the best way
to pay tribute to her.

537
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,320
Prince Ning has controlled
the Ministry of War for years.

538
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,280
And I have been waiting for an opportunity
to take this down.

539
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,440
I broke into the military camp at night
and saved a woman.

540
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,920
This news will soon be
spread throughout Chang'an.

541
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,880
Just using you as a reason

542
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:48,079
to cleanse the filth of the Ministry of War

543
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,000
and replace with
a kind and stern leader to take over.

544
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:56,719
It's just a pity I didn't arrive a bit earlier

545
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,440
and save the life of this mute girl.

546
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,000
But you have already saved
the lives of other slaves.

547
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,760
I thank you on behalf of them.

548
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,440
All the pods are here.

549
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:39,760
May you in the next life

550
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,239
have an abundance of food

551
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,960
and make a bright sound.

552
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,920
Jiang Changyang.

553
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,440
How did you know that I'm in the military camp?

554
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,960
After you returned, was it Fu who told you?

555
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,239
How are they doing? Are they alright?

556
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,559
There was no time to return.

557
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:38,239
It was Mr. Xu who asked Yunniang
to pass the message to me.

558
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,679
You suddenly had trouble,

559
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,719
yet you still remembered
to let him avoid disaster.

560
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,639
In the court, you didn't mention
the Wanguan Hall.

561
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,320
They naturally thank you for that.

562
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,920
Yunniang has found out
it was the County Princess behind all this.

563
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,280
She knew that saving you is no easy task.

564
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,599
Mr. Xu wrote to me,

565
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,079
telling me to hurry back.

566
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,280
He said if I fail to save you,

567
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,480
I won't need to go back to see him.

568
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,679
Please thank Mr. Xu and Yunniang for me.

569
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,280
I'm the one who hurried over.

570
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,856
Aren't you going to thank me?

571
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,648
Thank you, Mr. Jiang,

572
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,360
With your thanks,
my coming here was not in vain.

573
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,119
I'll take my leave here then, I'm off.

574
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,848
Mr. Jiang.

575
00:41:48,595 --> 00:41:54,869
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫</i>

576
00:41:56,723 --> 00:42:03,407
<i>♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫</i>

577
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:11,281
<i>♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫</i>

578
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:20,627
<i>♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫</i>

579
00:42:20,627 --> 00:42:28,170
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

580
00:42:28,824 --> 00:42:37,011
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

581
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:44,822
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

582
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:52,719
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>

583
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:20,278
<i>♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫</i>

584
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:28,273
<i>♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫</i>

585
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:36,332
<i>♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫</i>

586
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:45,325
<i>♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫</i>

587
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:52,756
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

588
00:43:53,587 --> 00:44:01,843
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

589
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:09,267
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

590
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:17,721
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>
