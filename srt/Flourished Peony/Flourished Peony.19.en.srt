1
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:35,917
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:38,744
(Episode 19)

3
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,860
I've never seen a play that uses flowers

4
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:04,020
to depict Zhu Rong striking stones to create fire.

5
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,941
Miss Mu Dan,

6
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,593
this is such an excellent idea.

7
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,479
You flatter me.

8
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,821
The flower in the middle must be the Moutan peony.

9
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,080
It does look like a raging fire. It's very captivating.

10
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,620
Moutan peony is extremely delicate.

11
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,771
One must devote a lot of effort to it.

12
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
I've written down the instructions.

13
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,061
San, she's reminding you to pay up.

14
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,669
- That's not true. - I almost forgot about it.

15
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,520
I won't stand on ceremony, then.

16
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,159
Chuan Yu.

17
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,097
Thank you.

18
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,963
Your spouse's birthday is nearing.

19
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,443
This is the perfect time to give her this as a gift.

20
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:51,060
All women love flowers after all.

21
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,366
Shopkeeper, I want one pot as well.

22
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,855
I want the one with the crimson hue.

23
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,140
The top courtesan of Huanyun Pavilion will surely be happy to have this.

24
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,661
I want two pots so that my spouses won't get jealous.

25
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,239
Unfortunately,

26
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,541
Lord Jiang has bought the last batch.

27
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,781
Miss Mu Dan, you're so biased.

28
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,381
This variety is very popular. Why does he get to choose first?

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,060
Lord Jiang frequents our shop.

30
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,260
Naturally, we have to prioritize our regulars.

31
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,400
Please visit Blooming Abode when you're free.

32
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,016
We have plenty of rare varieties there.

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,840
No matter if you buy them as gifts for your mother, wife, or mistress,

34
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,479
they'll definitely be happy with them.

35
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,279
If so, do you still sell this variety there?

36
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,060
What she meant was,

37
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,720
if you guys visit her shop and become regulars,

38
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,940
you guys get to buy all kinds of varieties.

39
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,613
I've already divided and preserved the Moutan peony's seedlings beforehand.

40
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,987
They'll bloom in the coming spring.

41
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,180
If anyone desires them,

42
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,119
please reserve them in advance.

43
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,249
All right! I'll head to your shop tomorrow.

44
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
All right.

45
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,380
Seems like you do frequent her shop.

46
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,661
You even understood

47
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,461
what she was implying.

48
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,441
It's the same thing when it comes to making money, you know?

49
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,701
I saw what you did just now.

50
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,582
It's not like the dance started a real fire.

51
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,461
Why were you avoiding it?

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
That flower of yours has a strong scent.

53
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,380
If it's too near, I won't be able to savor the liquor.

54
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,000
No wonder you were egging me on.

55
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,319
You hired a performing troupe and set up a banquet.

56
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,679
You did everything to promote your flowers.

57
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,141
You mustn't put it that way.

58
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,696
Lord Jiang, you get a share of the profit from the flowers I sell.

59
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
This is a win-win situation.

60
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,439
But you filled up my courtyard with your flowers without telling me.

61
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,377
How could you force me to do this deal?

62
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,221
Lord Jiang, you said this yourself.

63
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,341
The flowers in Jiang Residence will be supplied by Blooming Abode.

64
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,620
Back then, with a grand gesture, you spent money like water.

65
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,341
It was charming and elegant.

66
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,541
That was an unforgettable sight.

67
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,820
No thanks. My hand is injured. I cannot take alcohol.

68
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,198
Come and take a look!

69
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,279
I want two pots of this.

70
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
It smells great.

71
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,759
I want a bottle of that.

72
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,033
- I want a bottle too. - Let's check out the flowers.

73
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,100
Over here.

74
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,559
Are all of these fragrant powders?

75
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,759
I want ten sets of this.

76
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,839
All right.

77
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,410
Xiao Chun, I misunderstood you.

78
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:27,624
Sorry about that.

79
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Please forgive me.

80
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,336
But the deed was done by someone from the flower trade indeed.

81
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,661
Da Fu, I don't blame you at all.

82
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,375
I'm sure you've swallowed a lot of grievances.

83
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,119
What about this? You should punch me twice.

84
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,864
Da Fu, it's fine.

85
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,118
It's fine. Just vent it out. It'll be fine after that.

86
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,221
Da Fu, it's fine.

87
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,560
What about this? Stab me with your needles.

88
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,060
I'd rather punch you instead.

89
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,759
Sure.

90
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
You're forgiven.

91
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,279
Is that all?

92
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,096
All right! You're straightforward as well.

93
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,840
From now on, we're a family.

94
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,021
Anyone who tries to bully you will have to get through me first!

95
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,486
Luckily, she only said that she wanted you to punch her.

96
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,470
I was afraid she might stab herself with a knife.

97
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,260
I won't do that.

98
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,359
Mu Dan, speaking of cut wounds,

99
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,360
a patient of mine got his leg cut.

100
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,896
I've tried several dressings on him.

101
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,661
However, his wound kept festering without getting better.

102
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,025
I've written down all of the symptoms.

103
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,021
Mu Dan, can you help me pass it to Physician Fu?

104
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,863
(To Physician Fu)

105
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
No problem.

106
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,519
Take care.

107
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,140
Shopkeeper, how much is this?

108
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,521
Xiao Chun!

109
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:39,647
Please give me a moment.

110
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,342
This is a fragrant powder I specially crafted for you.

111
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,133
It has an elegant scent.

112
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:53,804
It suits you perfectly.

113
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,984
I hope you can forgive me for what I said before.

114
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,701
It's fine. It's all in the past now.

115
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,380
Moreover, I don't use fragrant powder often.

116
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,151
It'll affect my diagnosis if I put on fragrant powder.

117
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,319
Therefore, you can keep it with you first.

118
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,731
Two of my patients are still waiting for me. Farewell.

119
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,301
She shouldn't just refuse my good intentions like this.

120
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,913
She's pretty dense. She can't take a hint at all.

121
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,981
Don't hold it against her.

122
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,239
This is the hand cream from Youshi Hall.

123
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,895
You have to manage the shop and tend to the plants every day.

124
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,060
I'm sure it's tough.

125
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:49,071
This cream can moisturize your hands.

126
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,639
You're being overly attentive without any reason.

127
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,759
What are you doing here out of the blue?

128
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,323
I reflected deeply on my actions after you reprimanded me last time.

129
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,799
I spent a lot of time on it.

130
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,780
I did treat you badly in the past.

131
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,421
Now, I've quit drinking. I'm no longer the scoundrel I was.

132
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,341
I'm here to ask you this.

133
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,555
Wu Niang, have you found someone you fancy?

134
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,941
What has that got to do with you?

135
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,724
Do you still remember the blind old lady who lived behind our tavern?

136
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,806
- When she was young... - Excuse me.

137
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,900
She also did business when she was young.

138
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,481
She showed her face in public and was despised by people.

139
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,981
She never got married.

140
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,551
She had no children, and she was lonely all her life.

141
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,793
She passed away last month, and there was no one to see her off.

142
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,605
Why did you mention her all of a sudden?

143
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,860
Because she reminded me of you.

144
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,581
I don't want you to end up like her.

145
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,981
Wu Niang, can you please give me another chance?

146
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,280
We once had good days as well...

147
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,280
Back then, you stirred up trouble for no reason.

148
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,421
You almost caused us to lose our business.

149
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,301
Now, our shop is operating well.

150
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,221
You came here to tell me this when I'm leading a good life?

151
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,119
Do you think I'll believe you?

152
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,140
That's because Mu Dan took you away from me.

153
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,221
I only did so out of spite.

154
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,900
I suppose I was abrupt today.

155
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,880
It's just that I've been missing you ever since you left me.

156
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,559
Wu Niang,

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,101
have you never thought of me even once all this while?

158
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,667
Have you never felt lonely even for a moment?

159
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,895
This is the lily essence. It has a fragrant smell.

160
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,919
It costs 240 coins.

161
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,159
Come. Great timing.

162
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
All right.

163
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,919
Where's Sheng Yi?

164
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
She went out.

165
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,279
Here you go. Take care.

166
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,880
Now that you're leading a good life,

167
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
I can rest at ease.

168
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,888
If you follow me, you have to suffer again.

169
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,255
Did you owe gambling debts again?

170
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,279
No.

171
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,519
I've already repaid all of my previous debt.

172
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,260
I didn't come to you because of money.

173
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,701
I just miss you.

174
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,798
In the future, I'll treat you well.

175
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,660
Is that Sheng Yi's ex-husband?

176
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,140
You shouldn't waste your money on such items in the future.

177
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,577
- As for other things... - You scoundrel!

178
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:22,816
How dare you come and ask Sheng Yi for money?

179
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,719
Da Fu! He's not here to ask me for money!

180
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,540
He's here to deliver a present to me.

181
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,140
This doesn't cost much.

182
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,056
You're the second shopkeeper of Blooming Abode!

183
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,336
You can buy whatever you want yourself!

184
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,615
Why would you need him to buy it?

185
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,559
He's trying to trick you with these trinkets.

186
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,640
I'm sincere in rekindling our old flame.

187
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,799
Stop lying! The legends say

188
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,655
that the words of a heartless lover can never be trusted!

189
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,920
Today, I shall uphold justice!

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,360
I'll beat you up!

191
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,600
You can beat me up if that'll prove my sincerity!

192
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,240
Just look. He'll surely avoid my punch.

193
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,260
Are you hurt?

194
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,380
It's fine even if I'm hurt.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,720
Wu Niang, it's fine as long as you're fine.

196
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,780
Excellent!

197
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,620
Excellent!

198
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,240
I don't understand at all.

199
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
How did that scoundrel manage to bewitch Sheng Yi?

200
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,701
A person like Wang Qing should be taught a lesson.

201
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,720
There's no need to waste your breath on him.

202
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,072
Did you beat Wang Qing up because he offended you?

203
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,581
I don't know him.

204
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,959
I did so because I didn't want Sheng Yi to be deceived.

205
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,020
So, you beat up Wang Qing for the sake of Sheng Yi.

206
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,341
But in the end, you hurt her by accident, huh?

207
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,821
If so, what should you tell Sheng Yi?

208
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Sheng Yi,

209
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,341
I was too impulsive today.

210
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,301
What else should you say

212
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
besides that?

213
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,701
You should say

214
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,165
that you'll teach Wang Qing another lesson if you see him again.

215
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,655
People like him need to be taught a lesson every time we see them!

216
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,439
That's right! That's what I thought as well!

217
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,581
I know you guys are worried about me.

218
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,620
But Da Fu, you don't understand the intricacies of a relationship.

219
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,160
This time, Wang Qing isn't here to stir up trouble.

220
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,380
He's only here to care for me.

221
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,981
Maybe he has realized the error of his ways.

222
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,240
Wang Qing has committed a lot of evil deeds.

223
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,720
Can a person like him truly be able to turn over a new leaf?

224
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,581
I know that Wang Qing isn't a good person.

225
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,540
But we show ourselves in public often.

226
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,860
No good men are willing to marry women like us.

227
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,040
Now, we're still young. We still have the privilege to choose our mate.

228
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,821
But once we grow old,

229
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,160
and when we're no longer able to operate our business,

230
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,140
won't that make us old and lonely?

231
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,860
How could that be?

232
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,660
You still have us, you know?

233
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
That's right.

234
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,981
My mother raised me by herself as well.

235
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,320
We still led a good life without a man in the family.

236
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,020
But how could you exist without men?

237
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,461
How could your mother give birth to you if she was alone from the start?

238
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,461
To you guys,

239
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,660
is it enough to make a fortune

240
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,421
with our business

241
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,599
without getting a husband and children?

242
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Sheng Yi,

243
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,421
people change.

244
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,775
If other people provide you with happiness,

245
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,461
they can take it away as well.

246
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,790
The only thing that'll last is the thing that you strive for yourself.

247
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,061
Excellent!

248
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,101
Some like to drink mutton soup by itself.

249
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,860
But I don't think it's good enough

250
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,620
without a flatbread.

251
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,260
Maybe I'm too greedy.

252
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,981
I want to lead a good life

253
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,260
and get a husband

254
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,860
and children.

255
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,140
You're not greedy.

256
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,860
There's nothing wrong about desiring them.

257
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,500
It's reasonable.

258
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,775
It's not that I'm stopping you from getting married.

259
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,500
However, it mustn't be Wang Qing.

260
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,620
Did you forget how he treated you in the past?

261
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,135
You've only escaped from this hellhole not long ago.

262
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,221
Sheng Yi, you must think twice.

263
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,020
Now, you're the second shopkeeper of Blooming Abode.

264
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,780
You're beautiful and wealthy.

265
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,479
You'll definitely be able to get a good husband.

266
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,981
Compared to getting married,

267
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,586
it's more important to find a mate

268
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,181
who understands you well.

269
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,740
Shopkeeper, get us two flatbreads.

270
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,621
Coming, miss.

271
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Thank you.

272
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,559
Please enjoy your meal.

273
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,580
Excellent!

274
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,136
Your Highness, I heard that you were coming.

275
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,780
I made these snacks myself.

276
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,740
I made them with top-quality ingredients.

277
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,461
Your Highness, please try them.

278
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,540
I've also prepared a gift for my visit.

279
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,580
This is purple bamboo shoot tea from Mt. Guzhu, Huzhou.

280
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,015
It's known as the celestial nectar of the imperial garden.

281
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,959
Her Highness and Lord Xu will get married soon.

282
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,696
Esteemed guests will visit your residence eventually.

283
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,701
Only this tea is worthy of serving to match the status of the Liu family.

284
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

285
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,461
Time is essential when it comes to the purple bamboo shoot tea.

286
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,381
It'll only retain its fragrance if you consume it within two months.

287
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,780
It won't taste as good after that.

288
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,260
Your Highness, you have a point.

289
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,941
Such fine tea should not be stored for long.

290
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,340
Master and I have hired someone to come up with the best date.

291
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,360
The sixth day of the upcoming month

292
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,060
is a rare auspicious day.

293
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,500
It's suitable for marriage.

294
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,519
Mother,

295
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,095
many personnel of the Ministry of Revenue have applied for leave lately.

296
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,119
I'm busy with work.

297
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,100
Let's put it aside for now.

298
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,559
State affairs aren't as important as our wedding.

299
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,959
Since it's important, we have to prepare for it meticulously.

300
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,340
We mustn't rush things.

301
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Now, I finally have something substantial to do at the Ministry of Revenue.

302
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,279
Why don't we hold our wedding later?

303
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,060
We can discuss the wedding date later.

304
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,440
The flowers in the garden are blooming.

305
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,580
Zi Shu, why don't you admire them together with Her Highness?

306
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,020
All right now. Stop being angry.

307
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I'll heed your will.

308
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,941
We can get married after you're done with work.

309
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,599
Thank you.

310
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,540
Besides that, you have to thank me for one more thing.

311
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,060
Do you know why the officials of the Ministry of Revenue applied for leave?

312
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,181
They disrespected you.

313
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,901
Therefore, I sent my men there to teach them a lesson.

314
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,901
After this incident,

315
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,999
they'll surely reflect upon their actions.

316
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,181
They won't show you the cold shoulder again.

317
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,840
Why did you act on your own initiative

318
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,221
without asking for my opinion?

319
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,580
You were the one who told me that you had nothing to do.

320
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,701
I merely wanted to give you a surprise.

321
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,952
Now, they're gone. Isn't that what you want?

322
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,160
I did so for your own good.

323
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,200
Why aren't you appreciating my intention? Why are you angry at me instead?

324
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,839
Qiu Shi!

325
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,981
Your Highness, His Lordship granted them this dog.

326
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,216
Master was grateful to His Lordship's grace.

327
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,461
He has spoiled it utterly.

328
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,655
That's why it was allowed to roam free in the residence.

329
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:13,799
But it scared you.

330
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,720
Your Highness, please forgive it.

331
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,199
So, Father granted the dog to them, huh?

332
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,661
Bring it here. Let me take a look.

333
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Come.

334
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,661
A dog does rely on its master indeed.

335
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,936
Since this dog was granted by King Ning,

336
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,680
it's fine even if it offends Your Highness.

337
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,381
If this dog belonged to someone else,

338
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,547
I suppose it would've been beaten to death by now.

339
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,141
What's wrong with you today?

340
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,999
You just have to pick a fight with me, huh?

341
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,891
I just feel that I'm no different from a dog.

342
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,500
My value

343
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,020
depends on my master.

344
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,500
Zi Shu, you're belittling yourself by saying so.

345
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,239
You're also looking down on Father's effort in nurturing you.

346
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I know.

347
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,381
You're upset that I'm urging us to get married.

348
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,141
But how long do I have to wait?

349
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,901
I've done so much for you. I never expected you to be moved by my actions.

350
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,633
But at least you shouldn't say such hurtful words.

351
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,239
Could it be that you still have feelings for Lady He?

352
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,205
Impossible.

353
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,461
She's just a commoner.

354
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,500
What's there to miss about her?

355
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,621
Moreover, she's already dead.

356
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:03,967
Do you truly think that I don't know how she died?

357
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,320
Didn't she die after falling off a cliff?

358
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,759
Since you want to be married to me,

359
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,540
she has no choice but to die.

360
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,141
Although you didn't do it yourself,

361
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,340
she died because of your desire.

362
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,960
She slipped and fell off the cliff. What has that got to do with me?

363
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,701
Zi Shu, you're arguing with me because of a woman.

364
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,656
You were the one who promised me that you would marry me.

365
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,100
Now, you're blaming me for it.

366
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,500
I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming myself.

367
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,759
I blame myself for being inept.

368
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,260
I can't hold onto anything at all.

369
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,981
You influence all of my emotions.

370
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:06,701
You're the only person who can hold onto me.

371
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,160
Why are you pushing me away time and time again?

372
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,100
You Zhen, how could you still not understand?

373
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,400
It's not that I don't appreciate the things you've done for me.

374
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,740
It's just that your actions are suffocating me.

375
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,799
Everyone fears me and stays away from me because of what you did.

376
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,735
I won't have any peers or friends in the future.

377
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,500
You don't need anyone else. I'm the only person you need.

378
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,621
Zi Shu, don't you understand?

379
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,255
Without me, there was no way you could join the Ministry of Revenue.

380
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,879
You just need to cherish me and love me.

381
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,241
If so, Father will give you all the positions you desire.

382
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,020
Are you saying that my career is built upon a woman?

383
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,901
How could you say something like that?

384
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,199
By being my husband, you won't need to get involved in political trifles.

385
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
What's so bad about that?

386
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,839
Pleasing me

387
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,060
is much easier than doing tedious paperwork.

388
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,719
This is a blessing that others seek but cannot obtain.

389
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,000
Why are you avoiding it as if it's the plague?

390
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,679
So, to you, my dreams and aspirations are cheap, huh?

391
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,119
They're insignificant to you, huh?

392
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,359
Blessing?

393
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,471
Do you expect me to kneel and thank you for that?

394
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,480
Mu Dan never saw me in this light

395
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,421
when she was still in the Liu Residence.

396
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,400
However, I didn't know how to cherish her.

397
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,461
I knew you still couldn't get over He Wei Fang.

398
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,260
Do you think she's better than me?

399
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,941
- She's just a wretch... - She's innocent!

400
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,221
You shouldn't insult her like that.

401
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Innocent?

402
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,760
Back then, in Shuiyu Pavilion, Luoyang,

403
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,181
she was the one who requested me to stage an act with her

404
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,461
so that we could use the momentum to be engaged.

405
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,340
He Wei Fang wanted to divorce you long ago.

406
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,500
She even resorted to such a plot.

407
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,679
Do you still think that she's innocent?

408
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Impossible.

409
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,981
He Wei Fang isn't someone like that.

410
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,740
Both of you are women.

411
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,820
Why would she sacrifice your reputation in order to get her way?

412
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,079
That's right.

413
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:22,981
As a woman,

414
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,060
I'm willing to cast away my reputation in order to be with you.

415
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,232
But when you heard that, the only thing you were thinking

416
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,096
was that He Wei Fang wasn't someone like that.

417
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
What about me?

418
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,799
How could Father agree to our marriage

419
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,100
if I didn't do so?

420
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,559
Zi Shu,

421
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:49,020
for your sake, I'm willing to join hands with that wretch.

422
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,740
I even plotted against my own father.

423
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,540
Do you still not understand my feelings for you?

424
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,901
You must've lost your mind.

425
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,621
So, you deceived me from the start.

426
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,079
You stood idly by as people looked at me as if I was a circus clown.

427
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,901
I was called an adulterer because of you.

428
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,340
I felt guilty to you because of that.

429
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,661
Due to the scandal, my family couldn't reject the marriage.

430
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,020
And now, you want me to pretend to be ignorant

431
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,500
and proceed with our marriage?

432
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,461
What do you mean by that?

433
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,359
Liu Zi Shu,

434
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,481
I've already swallowed a lot of grievances for your sake.

435
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,141
Now, you're pushing me away?

436
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,381
I'm the county princess, yet I'm willing to coax you and please you.

437
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,060
Do you truly think I don't have a temper?

438
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,080
I was the one who went out of my league.

439
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,319
Your Highness,

440
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,481
there are already plenty of unhappy couples in the world.

441
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
There's no need to add one more pair to the count.

442
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:37,079
Excellent!

443
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,020
Miss Yun is truly a great businesswoman.

444
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,939
She organized the selection for the top courtesan

445
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:43,580
with such great excitement.

446
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,600
Your trip wasn't in vain, huh?

447
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,941
Yeah.

448
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,780
Today, only VIPs may enter Huanyun Pavilion.

449
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,901
Lord Jiang, thank you for taking me here.

450
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,120
There's no need to thank me.

451
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm willing to take you here

452
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,260
because you said you wanted to learn her business strategies.

453
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,300
As long as you apply what you've learned and make more money for me,

454
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,020
I'll be happy about it.

455
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,020
Lord Jiang, don't worry.

456
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,780
I've already committed this strategy to my memory.

457
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,661
I'll definitely apply it to our shop in the future.

458
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,599
Huanyun Pavilion started today's event

459
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,500
with a grand and dramatic performance.

460
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,221
And, they even distributed different masks to the guests.

461
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,780
This is interesting indeed.

462
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,559
My Lord,

463
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,540
that's not our liquor.

464
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,965
Change the drinking set.

465
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,039
Yes, My Lord.

466
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,839
What's wrong?

467
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,335
I'm afraid the waiter served us with the wrong set.

468
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,359
Or,

469
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,280
someone might have placed this on my table amidst the commotion.

470
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,119
Even so, you don't need to pour it away.

471
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
It's such a waste.

472
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,540
We have to be wary.

473
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,141
Miss He, you might not know,

474
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,300
but people have tried to poison Lord Jiang more than once.

475
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,661
A few years ago, he fell for their trick.

476
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,060
He even threw up blood.

477
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,599
It was that serious?

478
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,540
I'm notorious after all. I have to be extra careful.

479
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,421
When we were in Luoyang,

480
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,421
you encountered assassins.

481
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,679
Even so, you acted nonchalantly, just like how you're acting now.

482
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,300
It's as if you're already used to being in danger.

483
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:33,300
If one encounters the same situation time and time again,

484
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,600
everyone will get used to it.

485
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,580
Lord Jiang, seems like it's tough

486
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,000
being a corrupt official as well.

487
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,621
You don't need to worry about me.

488
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,141
Excellent!

489
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,100
Today is a rare event.

490
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,679
Why don't we enjoy ourselves?

491
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,661
Excellent!

492
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
All right.

493
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,580
Zi Shu, don't you understand?

494
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,680
Without me, there was no way you could join the Ministry of Revenue.

495
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,840
You just need to cherish me and love me.

496
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,201
If so, Father will give you all the positions you desire.

497
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,160
Pleasing me

498
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,340
is much easier than doing tedious paperwork.

499
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,560
This is a blessing that others seek but cannot obtain.

500
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,879
Why are you avoiding it as if it's the plague?

501
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,820
The slanderers boast loudly,

502
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,020
while the virtuous remain nameless.

503
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,740
Alas, in silence,

504
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,879
who knows of my integrity and steadfastness?

505
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,661
Liu Zi Shu, just look at you right now.

506
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,740
Lonely and standing alone, my shadow and I keep each other company.

507
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,580
Drinking alone beneath the moon.

508
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,141
What a tragic sight.

509
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,540
What a tragic sight!

510
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,519
Mister,

511
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
are you okay?

512
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
I'll retrieve it for you.

513
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Thank you.

514
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,239
To address the flood issue, start with the people's livelihood.

515
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,301
The homes and farmlands of the common people should be the top priority.

516
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,839
There are even ideas of building fields by enclosing water

517
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,461
and controlling water to combat sand.

518
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,359
This is a long-term solution

519
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,620
for the flood issues the state is facing.

520
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,500
This is an excellent approach to water management.

521
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,821
I suppose he has devoted a lot of effort to it.

522
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,381
Every day, officials send over flattering articles and poems.

523
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,159
His Lordship ordered us to burn them periodically to make space.

524
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,159
Mister, here's your policy proposal.

525
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Thank you.

526
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,175
In the vast world with high mountains and flowing rivers,

527
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,439
a bosom friend is hard to find.

528
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,519
Are you okay?

529
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Mu Dan?

530
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,199
Mu Dan.

531
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,880
- Mu Dan. - Liu Chang?

532
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,760
You are the wife I wish to honor, cherish, and love!

533
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,620
What nonsense are you spouting?

534
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Mu Dan,

535
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,941
I've already found out about the act

536
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,840
you staged together with Her Highness.

537
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,119
So?

538
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,140
The Liu family and I had let you down in the past.

539
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,200
I don't blame you for what you did.

540
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,901
Now, can you please give me another chance?

541
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,941
Let's rekindle our old flame.

542
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
I'll definitely...

543
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,500
I didn't know that you were behind the mask.

544
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,220
Secondly, there was no old flame between you and I.

545
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Fine.

546
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,119
Fine. Let's drop the past, then.

547
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Let's not bring it up.

548
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,316
At this moment...

549
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,936
At this moment, this should be considered our first encounter.

550
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,600
You and I are getting to know each other for the first time again.

551
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,999
I've already requested Her Highness to cancel our engagement.

552
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,861
I'm willing to give up on my title and fame for you.

553
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
Okay?

554
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Liu Chang,

555
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,079
I suggest you hire a physician to check your brain

556
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:16,261
before it's too late.

557
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,901
So, do you look down on me just like the others?

558
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,159
That's right.

559
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,020
I'm just a pitiful dog that follows King Ning and Her Highness.

560
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,220
Why would anyone respect a dog?

561
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,261
But even dogs can bark and bare their teeth.

562
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,039
Why must I restrain myself?

563
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:46,279
When have you ever restrained yourself in front of me?

564
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,480
Don't you think you're the one who landed yourself in this plight?

565
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,060
You pestered me time and time again

566
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,741
not because you had feelings for me.

567
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,639
You just wish to derive a sense of existence from me

568
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,821
so that you won't feel as terrible.

569
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,759
You want to make your family honorable and have a great career,

570
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,919
but you can't let go of your prideful self.

571
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,500
You complain about your plight endlessly,

572
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,700
pushing all the blame

573
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,519
to your parents and your surroundings.

574
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,741
But what about you?

575
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,941
You've never changed at all.

576
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,319
You kept feeling that everyone was looking down on you.

577
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,079
To me,

578
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,639
you're the person who looks down on you the most.

579
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,515
You don't even know what you're seeking.

580
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,519
No.

581
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's not true.

582
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,461
Even if I do desire something else,

583
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,620
the honor of the Liu family

584
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,660
falls upon my shoulders.

585
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,301
How could I cast that away?

586
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,039
If you wish to be aloof and prideful, then follow the path of poverty.

587
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,461
If you decide to submit,

588
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,719
then you must bear the shame of kneeling.

589
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,540
But you insist on seeking both.

590
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
In the end,

591
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,580
it'll only lead to mutual sabotage.

592
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,941
It'll ruin you.

593
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Liu Chang,

594
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,421
first, become a person.

595
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,560
After that, you can bear the burden of your surname.

596
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,220
First, become a person?

597
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,180
Become a person, huh?

598
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,100
Is it fun to eavesdrop on us?

599
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,620
You could recognize me even with this disguise?

600
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,880
It's hard not to recognize you when you're sticking out like a sore thumb.

601
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:57,739
Moreover, I can see your cunning eyes behind the mask.

602
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,901
Did you forget who brought you here?

603
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,917
I was wrong.

604
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,409
I mean, behind the mask,

605
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,399
I can tell how knowledgeable,

606
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,519
talented,

607
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,079
wise,

608
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,341
virtuous,

609
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,700
- cool... - Seems like I'll never get

610
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:18,301
to hear something truthful from you in this lifetime.

611
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,580
It's cold outside at night.

612
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,680
You shouldn't be too engrossed in your conversation with your old flame.

613
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,488
Did you come out and eavesdrop on us just so you could help me put this on?

614
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:30,573
And, the hour of Hai has already passed.

615
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,640
We cannot leave the building.

616
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,781
I'm afraid you have to spend the night here.

617
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,040
It's the second watch already?

618
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,341
There's only one room left.

619
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,976
Due to the top courtesan selection, we have plenty of guests tonight.

620
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,901
There's no extra guest room.

621
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:47,090
This is the only room left.

622
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,794
And, it's meant for Lord Jiang when he wishes to take a break here.

623
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,599
Lord Jiang is very resourceful.

624
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:55,439
He's not confined to the curfew.

625
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,741
Even if he leaves the building and heads home now,

626
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,320
no one will dare to stop him.

627
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,320
Why don't you let me have the room?

628
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:06,421
What if I insist on being a law-abiding citizen tonight?

629
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,100
What will you do, then?

630
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,381
Since that's the case,

631
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,840
I suppose there's only one way left.

632
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,999
No wonder the business of Huanyun Pavilion is always good.

633
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,901
The bed is so comfortable.

634
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,821
Actually, tonight,

635
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,381
I've been wanting to find an opportunity

636
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,861
to have a good chat with you.
