<i>[Flourished Peony]</i>

2
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,446
<i>[Episode 16]</i>

3
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,599
I was only 18 when my husband died.

4
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,439
Since then, I never remarried.

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,640
Over the years, I have maintained a fleet,

6
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
trading in all places.

7
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,680
I've even been to foreign lands.

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,640
I've heard all sorts of rumors and slanders.

9
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,719
If it weren't for my ability
to discern truth from falsehood

10
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,640
and not fear unconventional judgment,

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,120
how could I have survived to this day?

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,239
In this world,

13
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,040
life for women is truly not easy.

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,199
We should help and understand each other.

15
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,599
What do you say?

16
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,159
Would you consider

17
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,599
becoming my niece-in-law?

18
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,000
Even if you spend all his money

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
and make him work every day,

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,680
I would be happy to see it happen.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,039
A woman's destiny

22
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,479
is marriage.

23
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,759
Without a family or status,

24
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,919
one will ultimately be taken advantage of.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,879
If so,

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,919
why haven't you remarried?

27
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,360
Because I am well-off enough

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,560
to live well on my own

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,319
and I'm even able to help

30
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,319
many handsome young men.

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,599
If you are strong and wealthy enough,

32
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,560
naturally, you won't need to depend on anyone.

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,439
Otherwise, you still need to find someone

34
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,800
worthy of entrusting your life to.

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,439
I see.

36
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,159
I still have to work hard on my own.

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,319
Mudan.

38
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,520
My nephew is handsome and clever.

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,479
Do you not feel anything for him?

40
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,479
Then tell me,

41
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,000
what kind of man

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,319
- Do you fancy?
- I think…

43
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,240
Don't tell me you will never marry.

44
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,712
I won't believe that.

45
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,199
I think if one day,

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,319
I find myself unexpectedly in a dire situation

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,960
and someone descends
from the sky clothed in rosy clouds,

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,080
coming to my side

49
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,080
to help me dispel the gloom,

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,319
perhaps, I would be touched.

51
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,280
But it's not that I need him

52
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,439
to rescue me.

53
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,680
I hope this person

54
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,039
can understand me better than I do myself.

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,840
Even if I don't say a word,

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,439
he knows all my likes, dislikes,

57
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,080
decisions, and dreams.

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,960
No matter what desperate situation I fall into,

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,680
he can face it with me together.

60
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,120
My nephew

61
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,439
is indeed quite far

62
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,439
from your expectations.

63
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,839
I also know that this kind of mutual
understanding and affection

64
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,079
is rare in this world.

65
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,439
So I have never expected it.

66
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:37,056
<i>[Jiang Mansion]</i>

67
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,920
I have clearly said no to Madam Feng.

68
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,600
And she has accepted it.

69
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,639
Madam Feng is persistent.

70
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,720
She retreats to advance again.

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,519
She is currently coming up with a new plan,

72
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,240
and my lord wishes to discuss
strategies with you

73
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
to present a united front.

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,120
He is inside.

75
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
That's an odd arrangement
for a strategy discussion.

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,792
Jiang Changyang.

77
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,279
If we're just discussing, why close the door?

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Lady He.

79
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,680
My lord said it must be kept confidential.

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,279
Jiang Changyang.

81
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,480
If we are discussing strategies,

82
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,800
why have you arranged the room like this?

83
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,279
There's no need for such a big fuss, right?

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,728
He Weifang.

85
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,959
Jiang Changyang.

86
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,560
He Weifang.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,560
Don't scare me, Jiang Changyang.

88
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,824
He Weifang.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,759
What? What are you doing?

90
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,079
What happened?

91
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,759
Let me down quickly.

92
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,879
I… How should I put you down?

93
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,439
Over there, that way.

94
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,680
Pull, pull it.

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,816
This one?

96
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
Jiang Changyang.

97
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,759
What is all this?

98
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,920
He Weifang.

99
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,439
Isn't this what you told my aunt?

100
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,560
Your beloved one

101
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,279
needs to descend from the heavens in darkness

102
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,240
clothed in rosy clouds.

103
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,759
Are you happy

104
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,720
about this?

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,120
But I was lying.

106
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,680
What about Chuanyu?

107
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,959
Don't mention that traitor to me.

108
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,279
What's going on here?

109
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,279
He Weifang.

110
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,639
Untie me first.

111
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,639
Madam Feng.

112
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,920
Madam Feng.

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,199
Even if Jiang Changyang meets

114
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,040
all the requirements I've set,

115
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,800
it's impossible for me to like him.

116
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Just let us out.

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,920
Mudan.

118
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,639
I have already thoroughly reformed Suizhi

119
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,879
to meet the standards

120
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,879
of your beloved.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,439
I will give you four hours

122
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,560
to listen to his confession.

123
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,680
If you still do not change your mind,

124
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,879
I will not force you.

125
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,879
After all, I've prepared

126
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,960
the betrothal gifts and apology gifts.

127
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,199
Lady He.

128
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
My lord.

129
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,639
I… I sincerely apologize to you.

130
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,800
How can you be so superficial?

131
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,360
If they really end up married

132
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,800
because of this,

133
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,319
they would be thanking you.

134
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,480
I have indeed been superficial, Madam.

135
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,199
Suizhi.

136
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,319
Be sure to correct your attitude

137
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,639
and behave well.

138
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,720
Otherwise, on returning,

139
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,759
you will kneel before the tablet
and face the whip again.

140
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,839
Traitor.

141
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,680
Chuanyu really is a traitor.

142
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,639
You wanted to face desperate

143
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,279
circumstances with another person, right?

144
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,519
So Aunt tried to satisfy you.

145
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,392
Untie me.

146
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,279
With your level of ability,

147
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,160
you can't compete with my aunt.

148
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,319
I really overestimated you.

149
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,488
Compensate me.

150
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,240
That's not the deal.

151
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,800
I worked hard to reject you.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
And now,

153
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,160
you want to kick down the ladder?

154
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,360
Have you thought about the consequences?

155
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,319
Your aunt hasn't left yet.

156
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,519
Since Mr. Jiang is so fond of me,

157
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,759
having no way to repay,
shall we fulfill Aunt's wishes?

158
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,759
Fine, no compensation.

159
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,480
You little scoundrel.

160
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
One day a lump of gold will smash you to death.

161
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,128
Thank you for your kind words.

162
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
What's all this clanging and banging?

163
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,200
You told Aunt

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,679
that your beloved needs to understand

165
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,200
all your likes, dislikes, and decisions.

166
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
She tortured me severely

167
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,279
and forced it out of me.

168
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,279
What could I do?

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,360
How do you know

170
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,159
<i>[Likes to drink osmanthus wine]</i>
I like to drink osmanthus wine?

171
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,559
<i>[Likes to eat dried fish]</i>
And that I like to eat dried fish?

172
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,559
You've invited me to eat it several times.

173
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,840
My taste buds haven't gone bad.

174
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,000
My foot is eight and a half inches long.

175
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,080
You know this too?

176
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,120
I've never seen anyone
with feet bigger than yours.

177
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,320
Naturally, it's hard to forget.

178
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,799
Your aunt probably wants us

179
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,799
to share our preferences.

180
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,639
<i>[Afraid of cockroaches]</i>
I never expected Jiang Suizhi

181
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,279
to actually be afraid of cockroaches.

182
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,879
That's not true. She's making it up.

183
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,480
Then do you know that cockroaches are edible?

184
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,200
Once we're out,
I'll cook you a full insect feast.

185
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,639
If you have the guts, eat it all.

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
Let me see.

187
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,200
What else would Jiang Changyang be afraid of?

188
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,440
- Don't look.
- Didn't you say she made it up?

189
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
If so, what are you afraid of?

190
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Why pull them down?

191
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,960
Let me see.

192
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,200
Why are you afraid?

193
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,399
I want to see what's written.

194
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,504
You can't look.

195
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,600
Jiang Changyang wet the bed when he was little.

196
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:28,256
<i>♫ If the heart is like frost ♫</i>

197
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:32,192
<i>♫ Congealing so much of the past ♫</i>

198
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,762
<i>♫ It sinks into your gaze ♫</i>

199
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:38,496
<i>♫ Melting and flowing with you ♫</i>

200
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,896
<i>♫ If love is like frost ♫</i>

201
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:45,280
<i>♫ Can this ten thousand miles
of roaming winds and waves ♫</i>

202
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:52,384
<i>♫ Finally touch a sunny day ♫</i>

203
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm full.

204
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,064
Sit down.

205
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,919
Last night's atmosphere was very good,

206
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,600
but how come Mudan hasn't agreed to you yet?

207
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,679
She is different from other women.

208
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,320
She's not interested in those flashy ornaments.

209
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,879
Aunt, please don't make things worse.

210
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,879
Just let us be.

211
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,720
I think

212
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,960
you're just too stubborn.

213
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,320
The people who surround you on a daily basis

214
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,840
are women from pleasure quarters.

215
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
Mudan is capable and intelligent.

216
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
Of course, she's different from them.

217
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,600
You ought to be more tolerant and gentle.

218
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,519
If you don't behave well,

219
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,159
are you expecting her to please you?

220
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,879
Before you came, Auntie,

221
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,399
she was trying to please me

222
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,559
because of my lechery.

223
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,399
I think your previous actions

224
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,000
are exactly the reason

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,440
why she doesn't dare to talk to you
about private matters of men and women.

226
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,759
Madam.

227
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,720
What is the traitor doing here
this early in the morning?

228
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,200
Did Mudan accept the apology gift?

229
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,600
She is stingy.

230
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,759
She wouldn't say no to money given for free.

231
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,720
Yes, Lady He has accepted the things.

232
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,519
She has asked me to pass on her regards.

233
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,559
Did she say anything else?

234
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440
When I was there,

235
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,360
Lady He's shop seemed to be
in some kind of trouble.

236
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,720
She hurried out

237
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,799
and said nothing else.

238
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,432
Trouble?

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,039
That's good.

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
That's the perfect opportunity
for you to show your merit.

241
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,679
Indeed, a woman's heart is the most venomous.

242
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,200
Fellow residents,

243
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,679
neighbors,

244
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,799
you must stand up for me.

245
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,159
Huamanzhu's

246
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,159
shopkeeper lady brings tough luck to husbands,

247
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,480
yet she still comes out
to do business in public.

248
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,039
You've caused my husband

249
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,799
to be sick and bedridden.

250
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,200
You must compensate for my husband.

251
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,279
Such nonsense could be charged
with the crime of slander.

252
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,399
That's punishable by caning.

253
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,799
It's not nonsense.

254
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,960
Ever since I bought this incense powder

255
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,080
from Huamanzhu,

256
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,200
every time I get close to my husband,

257
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
he gets dizzy and disoriented.

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,240
His limbs go weak. It's very strange.

259
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Later, after consulting
a geomancer, I came to know

260
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,320
that the incense powder from Huamanzhu

261
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,440
is tainted with malevolent energy

262
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,960
and it has overcome my husband.

263
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,200
Why would you speak of others in such a way?

264
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,440
Your husband has fallen ill,

265
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
and instead of seeking a doctor,

266
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,879
you found a practitioner of arcane arts.

267
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,440
Do you have a guilty conscience?

268
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,039
Shall I have a doctor

269
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,039
visit your home and take a look?

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,120
I, of course, I…

271
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
I sought out a doctor first.

272
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,440
But he couldn't discern any issue.

273
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,799
That's why I turned to a geomancer.

274
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,399
Geomancer, can you figure out

275
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,000
what exactly is the problem with her?

276
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,879
This woman

277
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,720
is destined to the Seven Killings,

278
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,159
bringing calamity and malevolence.

279
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,360
And recently she's even
been possessed by evil spirits,

280
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,480
drawing on the fortune
and prosperity of her neighbors

281
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,879
to increase her own wealth.

282
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
She is actually a demon!

283
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,399
- And to think we trusted her so much.
- It's all trickery.

284
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,759
Malicious slander.

285
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,360
You are spreading rumors and defamation.

286
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,399
I'll make you pay for your wild claims!

287
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,039
Fu, don't fall for his trickery.

288
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,720
If we injure them,

289
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,039
it would be our fault instead.

290
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,360
But we can't let them make a scene.

291
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,360
I advise the shop owner to quickly kneel down

292
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,919
and let me expel the evil spirit within you.

293
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,799
Otherwise, you'll bring harm to all around.

294
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,039
That's truly a sinful act.

295
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,879
Fine, in my entire life,

296
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,480
I've indeed never encountered any evil spirits.

297
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,519
I'll stand right here

298
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,480
and see what this evil spirit

299
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,279
you speak of looks like.

300
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,399
Let me reveal my true form then!

301
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,520
Come on.

302
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,840
This demon is using your body

303
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,320
to absorb others' fortunes.

304
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,120
It harms others,

305
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,559
and it's normal for you to be unaware.

306
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,360
I will now perform a ritual

307
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
to drive out the demon within you.

308
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,000
You will thank me for it.

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,544
Come on.

310
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:15,519
It's smoking.

311
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,720
Reveal your true form immediately!

312
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,559
The smoke in your hand

313
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
must be caused by the flint
you smeared in advance, right?

314
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,480
Do you dare to show your hand to everyone?

315
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,399
With death knocking at your door,

316
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,679
you still spout bewitching nonsense.

317
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,679
Evil spirit, reveal your true form immediately!

318
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,744
Break.

319
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,799
Broken. It's broken!

320
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,840
What on earth is this?

321
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,480
Ren!

322
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,639
- Ren!
- Ren.

323
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,879
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

324
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:08,799
- Quickly save him!
- How come he's vomiting blood?

325
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,200
Everyone, come take a look quickly.

326
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,600
This demon is too vicious.

327
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
In order to remain in her physical body,

328
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
she uses her helper

329
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,720
to withstand my magic.

330
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,600
Shopkeeper, your murderous aura is strong.

331
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,840
If you come any closer,
he won't live much longer.

332
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,120
Drop the act.

333
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,679
What kind of drug did you give my assistant?

334
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,799
I'm telling you,

335
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,159
if anything happens to him,
I won't let you off.

336
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,399
- Slandering!
- Fu, find a doctor.

337
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,600
- Okay.
- Go, quickly.

338
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,279
You've cursed my husband with illness,

339
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,200
and now you've struck down your own assistant.

340
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,840
I'm afraid it won't be many days

341
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,279
before all the people in Huamanzhu

342
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,200
are cursed to death by you.

343
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,759
Quickly, carry him away.

344
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,799
What are you doing?

345
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,000
Don't touch him.

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,039
Don't touch him!

347
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,960
By obstructing like this,
you're going to cost his life.

348
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,519
- Right.
- Saving him is what's important.

349
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,799
- Geomancer, save me!
- Get back.

350
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,519
Geomancer.

351
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,440
Geomancer, save me, sir.

352
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,960
Ever since I came to Huamanzhu,

353
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,120
my health has declined day by day.

354
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,679
Just now, when the bronze mirror shattered,

355
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
as if in a trance, I saw a demon attacking me,

356
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
then I lost consciousness.

357
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,319
Geomancer, sir, you must save me.

358
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,359
Geomancer, take me with you, sir.

359
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,519
Rest assured, I will definitely save you.

360
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,599
- Come on, take him away.
- Did you hear that?

361
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,119
You can't come to Huamanzhu.

362
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,559
It's dangerous.

363
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,160
I didn't lie.

364
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,519
A life is at stake.

365
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,960
I'll let you go for now today.

366
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,319
If the shop owner still has a conscience,

367
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,880
please close your shop.

368
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
Do not further torment the neighbors.

369
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,112
Evil spirit.

370
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,559
My lady, you can't seem to get pregnant.

371
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,839
Could it be because our shop

372
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,200
is right next to this Huamanzhu?

373
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,039
Let's leave now. Don't get
contaminated by the evil aura.

374
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,104
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

375
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:49,716
<i>♫ The world builds high walls for me ♫</i>

376
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,325
<i>[Huamanzhu]</i>

377
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:05,279
<i>♫ With a lowly status,
I have nothing to lean on ♫</i>

378
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,599
Madam, I don't believe a single word

379
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,160
of what the Geomancer said.

380
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,319
I will always follow you.

381
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,759
Mudan.

382
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,599
What are we going to do?

383
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,759
<i>♫ Ah, do not sigh for fate is unpredictable ♫</i>

384
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,888
Alright then.

385
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,000
Since the flower guild is so frowned

386
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,160
upon by us women doing business,

387
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,160
don't blame us for following suit.

388
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,279
Mother, this jade bracelet is so pretty.

389
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,960
It suits me very well.

390
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,920
If you like it, let's buy it.

391
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,720
You are the best, Mother.

392
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Lian'er.

393
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,480
I actually bought a special peony plant

394
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
to show you, Auntie.

395
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:51,079
Unfortunately, you came too late,
and the blooming season is over.

396
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,920
So I just have to find

397
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,160
another way to show my respect for you.

398
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,000
This color is not pretty.

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's too old-fashioned.

400
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,759
If you really wanted to show respect to me,

401
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,880
after eating breakfast,

402
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,559
you should have gone to save the beauty.

403
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,720
Shop owner.

404
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
None of your jingling hairpins

405
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
can match my auntie's beauty.

406
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,960
Bring out the best if there's any better.

407
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,279
Yes.

408
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,960
Why are you still using this?

409
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,319
Haven't you heard?

410
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,559
The Huamanzhu shop owner
is fated with an evil presence.

411
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,880
She has led to the death of three husbands.

412
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,039
And now she's even possessed by evil spirits.

413
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,279
The things she sells

414
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,759
are all tainted with evil aura.

415
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,640
If used for too long, at the least,
it can lead to marital discord.

416
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,359
At worst, it can bring about misfortune

417
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,640
and serious sickness.

418
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,240
Is that true? You can't just talk nonsense.

419
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,599
It's absolutely true.

420
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,359
The renowned geomancer Master Zhang

421
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,839
has just gone there to exorcise evils.

422
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,720
But the demon was too powerful.

423
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
A worker from Huamanzhu

424
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,119
vomited blood on the spot.

425
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,880
That's unlucky.

426
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,319
Gullibly believing in ignorant words,

427
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,119
spreading rumors and damaging reputations,

428
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
such behavior does not
befit a noble's household.

429
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,920
We're just chatting privately.

430
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,119
It's nothing serious.

431
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,440
I didn't know Floral Envoy was here.

432
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,720
We apologize for disturbing you.

433
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
We will leave right away.

434
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,056
Let's go.

435
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,440
Using such means against a woman,

436
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,519
it's really despicable.

437
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,880
The rumors are getting worse.

438
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,880
This is a good opportunity.

439
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,519
What are you waiting for?

440
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,920
If she can't handle it,

441
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,119
she will come to me.

442
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,599
Why should I be so eager?

443
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,680
It's as if I don't believe in her abilities.

444
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,079
Whether she seeks you out is her decision.

445
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,240
But whether or not
to take the initiative to help

446
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
reveals your intentions.

447
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,839
I thought you wanted
to show your respect to me.

448
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,319
Go.

449
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,720
Fine.

450
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
I'll send Chuanyu to scout, alright?

451
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,559
You made the rule.

452
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,559
Knock before entering.

453
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,319
You encountered such slander.

454
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,039
Not only is your complexion usual,

455
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,279
but it's even ruddy.

456
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,880
Are you really a fairy?

457
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,640
This shows that Huamanzhu's business is good,

458
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,119
obstructing others' path to wealth.

459
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,200
Such things are inevitable.

460
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,000
If I get upset about it,

461
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,599
I'm giving the rumormongers an advantage.

462
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,680
My aunt really should see

463
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,240
this heartless and unfeeling manner of yours.

464
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,480
She forced me to help.

465
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,599
Otherwise,

466
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,319
I won't bother with this trivial matter.

467
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,680
Yes, yes, I know.

468
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,200
The Floral Envoy is busy with noble matters.

469
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,359
If not for being lazy and gluttonous,

470
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,079
how would you deign to visit me here?

471
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,400
I will keep

472
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,559
this favor

473
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,000
on Madam Feng's account.

474
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,720
Has the sly flower merchant

475
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,680
thought of a way to solve the issue?

476
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,079
I have already set up the stage.

477
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,200
Now,

478
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,119
all that's missing is someone like you,

479
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,839
a famous actor

480
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,519
capable of bewitching people's hearts.

481
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,680
I should have named you Jiang Bold.

482
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,920
You dare to have the grand Floral Envoy

483
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,039
be your actor.

484
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,279
You are acting every day anyway.

485
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,319
It won't matter this one time.

486
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,240
Besides, my money is your money, after all.

487
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,920
Speak up, what's your plan?

488
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,559
If the evil spirits can possess someone,

489
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,200
they can be exorcised.

490
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,319
Since the other side can bribe a geomancer,

491
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,319
why can't I?

492
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,759
Besides Mr. Jiang,

493
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,559
I will also invite another

494
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,000
person with upright reputation to take action.

495
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
At that time, we'll attack from both sides,

496
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,936
ensuring there'll be no concerns.

497
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,799
Who else do you plan to get?

498
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,119
<i>[Cao's Flower Shop]</i>

499
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,880
These are all recently acquired goods.

500
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,160
Mr. Jiang, why didn't you

501
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,519
say anything in advance

502
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,880
so that I could clear out the other guests?

503
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,328
Please, browse away.

504
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Mr. Jiang.

505
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,359
If there's anything you fancy,

506
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,559
I will immediately send someone

507
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,680
to deliver it to your mansion.

508
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,319
- Mr. Jiang.
- Mr. Jiang.

509
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,920
- My lord!
- Mr. Jiang!

510
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,640
- My lord.
- Mr. Jiang.

511
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,480
- Mr. Jiang.
- Mr. Jiang.

512
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,680
- My lord.
- What are you waiting for? Get a doctor!

513
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,720
- Alright.
- My lord, my lord.

514
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,759
- Mr. Jiang.
- My lord.

515
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,519
<i>[Huamanzhu]</i>

516
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,200
What happened to the Floral Envoy?

517
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,279
Jiang Mansion has just bought
Herbaceous Peonies from Huamanzhu,

518
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,160
and my lord started coughing up
blood and getting weak today.

519
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,240
It must be your doing.

520
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,039
Geomancer, hurry and expel the evil spirits!

521
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,504
Alright.

522
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Could it be karma?

523
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,680
I had heard that Huamanzhu

524
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,799
was haunted by a malevolent spirit.

525
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,680
How strange indeed.

526
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,359
The shopkeeper does not have
a trace of malevolent aura.

527
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,440
But instead, there is an increase

528
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,119
of an auspicious aura.

529
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,359
Auspicious?

530
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,160
- Yes.
- An auspicious aura.

531
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,319
Impossible.

532
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,440
Then why has my lord
fallen gravely ill for no reason?

533
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,119
Even the imperial physician
was at his wit's end.

534
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,960
Do not worry, let me calculate carefully.

535
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,400
Indeed, Mr. Jiang has been harmed by evil aura.

536
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,960
But this evil aura

537
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,720
originates from the sachet

538
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,319
at Mr. Jiang's waist.

539
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,599
This, this isn't from our shop.

540
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,640
- The sachet?
- This isn't ours.

541
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,160
- What?
- This isn't.

542
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,960
Presumably, the shopkeeper
often did good deeds in the past,

543
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,920
so this demon could not

544
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,359
harbor evil aura in her body

545
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,039
to grow stronger.

546
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,720
Moreover, during these past few days,

547
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,279
there has been a great shift
in the celestial patterns,

548
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,160
so the demon had no means
to cause trouble here and has left.

549
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,000
Where did it go then?

550
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,519
Allow me to calculate carefully.

551
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,880
This demon

552
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,039
takes delight in the vitality of living beings

553
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,680
and enjoys the essence of plants.

554
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,599
Now it is at the largest flower shop

555
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,160
in the eastern part of the city.

556
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,039
In the East Market, the guild head Cao's

557
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,359
flower house is the most prosperous one.

558
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,400
Could it be…

559
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,519
This sachet of mine

560
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,880
was actually bought there.

561
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
See? It all adds up.

562
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,519
Quickly! Fu, Shengyi, hurry, hurry.

563
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to the matter of the evil spirit before,

564
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,400
I feared implicating everyone

565
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,160
so I fasted and meditated
in silence for three days

566
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,359
to make a batch of brocade sachets.

567
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I had the master
from Kaiyuan Temple bless them.

568
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,000
I will gift this item to Mr. Jiang.

569
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,200
I hope Mr. Jiang can recover soon.

570
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,480
Wait a moment.

571
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,232
Geomancer.

572
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,880
I have examined it, and this item truly can
ward off evil and bring fortune.

573
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,880
<i>[Warding Off Evil, Prosperity Sachet]</i>
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen.

574
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,119
Huamanzhu

575
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,319
has invited a master

576
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,880
to rearrange the Fengshui

577
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,079
and asked Kaiyuan Temple

578
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,599
to bless these Prosperity Sachets

579
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,880
with activating charms and blessings.

580
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,039
In order to compensate
for the loss of the neighbors,

581
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,680
I am willing to give away
these sachets for free.

582
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,200
And the remaining sachets
will be sold as usual.

583
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,400
I also hope that everyone can

584
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,799
support us generously.

585
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,440
Geomancer, is Huamanzhu free from trouble now?

586
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,000
Yes, indeed.

587
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,960
The shopkeeper has gone to great lengths.

588
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,880
This 'Hundred Fortunes Picture' matches
the shopkeeper's destiny perfectly.

589
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,160
The shop now

590
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,880
harbors fortune and accumulates prosperity,

591
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,119
bringing luck to the home
and glory to the people.

592
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,279
Everyone is welcome to visit in great numbers.

593
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,559
You will certainly be filled with good fortune.

594
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,880
No need to worry anymore.

595
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Good, good!

596
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,848
Wait a moment.

597
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,920
After wearing this sachet,

598
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,519
I do feel better.

599
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,359
And my limbs no longer feel as heavy

600
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,519
as they did before.

601
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,279
How great is that, huh?

602
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,640
Thank you for gifting me this item.

603
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,720
Mr. Jiang, you are welcome.

604
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,720
From now on, all flowers for the Jiang Mansion
will be bought from Huamanzhu.

605
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,799
If anyone in my mansion wishes
to buy incense powder for their wives,

606
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,200
they should also come to Huamanzhu.

607
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,599
Yes.

608
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,279
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

609
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,039
I will surely cultivate them with care

610
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,960
and will not disappoint you.

611
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,000
What a shoddy flower guild,
all show and no substance.

612
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,440
Throw this filthy thing far away from me.

613
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,608
Yes.

614
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,559
Come on.

615
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,680
Everybody, Prosperity Sachets

616
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,359
are available to all the neighbors around.

617
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,880
Come on, come on, just take
a prosperity sachet.

618
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,839
- Fu, quickly distribute to everyone.
- Come on, come on, have a try.

619
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,000
If you wish to buy a sachet,

620
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
you may also enter the store.

621
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,319
Come, this way, please.

622
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,799
- Please, inside.
- This way, please.

623
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,920
- Take your time, there's plenty.
- Come on, come on in.

624
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,960
This way, please.

625
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,720
Come on, please come inside.

626
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,640
Take it easy, there's enough for everyone.

627
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,720
It is full of good fortune.

628
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,319
Come, everyone, this way, please.

629
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,559
The teacher's lecture today
was truly interesting.

630
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,519
Indeed, thanks to the fragrance of the sachets,

631
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,839
I didn't feel sleepy today.

632
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,328
<i>[Imperial Academy]</i>
Yes, indeed.

633
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,240
It's full of fragrance.

634
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,200
Thank you, Wenqing,

635
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,599
for giving my sachet in advance

636
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,640
to those few

637
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,319
talented scholars.

638
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,640
Now they have passed the exam,

639
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,880
and I have also overcome the difficulty.

640
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,319
We are flesh and blood relatives.

641
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,400
There's no need for such formality.

642
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,680
Seeing you establish yourself in Chang'an now

643
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,064
brings me great comfort

644
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
I've heard that the sachets from Huamanzhu

645
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,000
are particularly effective.

646
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,279
In the Imperial Academy entrance exam,

647
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,559
students who wore the sachets

648
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,720
all got selected.

649
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,359
I've also heard that the Floral Envoy
who wore this sachet

650
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,559
got healed of all ailments.

651
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,880
And moreover, at the casino,

652
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,960
he won for three days and nights straight.

653
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Is that so?

654
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,359
Let's go buy one too.

655
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go.

656
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,383
<i>[Huamanzhu]</i>

657
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,680
- Take care.
- Thank you.

658
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,200
- Hello, which one would you like?
- This one is so beautiful.

659
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,839
- This sachet is for changing luck.
- Okay, thank you.

660
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,160
Madam, how much is this one?

661
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,240
Cao Yuying lifted a stone

662
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,720
and dropped it on his own foot.

663
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,799
Now, not a single person goes to his shop.

664
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,599
This is karma. Truly satisfying.

665
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:25,880
Now the whole of Chang'an

666
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,440
knows about Huamanzhu.

667
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,319
This time, a misfortune turned into a blessing.

668
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,119
It's also something I never expected.

669
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,039
We've not only gained male customers,

670
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,839
but also expanded our category of business

671
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,960
to spices and sachets.

672
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,039
It seems that our Huamanzhu branch will open

673
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,079
very soon.

674
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,960
- Come on, cheers.
- Come on.

675
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,240
Cheers.

676
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,599
I've consulted medical books

677
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,799
to specially prepare this ointment.

678
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,680
The hair nourished by this
will not only be black,

679
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,839
but also retain a long-lasting fragrance.

680
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,240
You are really thoughtful.

681
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,279
I know

682
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,160
that Jiang Changyang helped me

683
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,119
because you spoke for me in private.

684
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:19,960
I am very grateful.

685
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,680
Madam, you are about to embark on a journey.

686
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,480
I have specially selected three plants

687
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,039
of rare and famous peonies.

688
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,079
Madam, you must keep them.

689
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,799
With people taking meticulous care of them,

690
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,000
by next spring,

691
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
they will be able to bloom.

692
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,440
You are considerate in every aspect,

693
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,480
lovable and sensible.

694
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,039
You are a great match

695
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,279
with Suizhi.

696
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,359
Madam,

697
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,319
please stop joking with me.

698
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,160
I'm not worthy of the Floral Envoy.

699
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,559
I have always been reluctant

700
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,240
for him to be some Floral Envoy.

701
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,319
If he has a family he wants to protect,

702
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,039
perhaps then he can settle down,

703
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,296
changing his way of life.

704
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,039
Mudan, do you want to reconsider?

705
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,279
If you marry him,

706
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,079
there will be no in-laws to serve,

707
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,000
and Suizhi ignores rules.

708
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,920
In the days to come,

709
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,839
he will surely let you do as you please.

710
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,200
He can't let go of

711
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,799
his parents' old affairs.

712
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,200
With this knot in his heart,

713
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,680
I'm afraid he won't get married.

714
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,000
Did Suizhi

715
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,319
actually disclose such private matters

716
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,319
to you?

717
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
So, you see,

718
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,519
you should know

719
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,480
that his usual grins and banter

720
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,519
are all just a facade.

721
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,839
He harbors

722
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,839
pain in his heart.

723
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,240
Why is that?

724
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,000
Is it because of his parents?

725
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,519
When the right moment comes,

726
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,039
he will tell you.

727
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,119
Mudan,

728
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,079
even if you don't like Suizhi,

729
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,359
could you, when he is lonely and in sorrow,

730
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,480
spend more time with him?

731
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,599
Over the years,

732
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,160
he has been truly too lonely.

733
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,880
Madam.

734
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm afraid I can't

735
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,440
fulfill your request.

736
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,559
Actually, I have deceived you.

737
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,680
Jiang Changyang doesn't like me at all.

738
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,519
The reason we put on this act

739
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,960
is to make you give up

740
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,039
pressuring him to marry.

741
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,056
Besides,

742
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,039
I've received money for it.

743
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,279
I'm sorry, Madam.

744
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,480
You came to nourish my hair today.

745
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,400
Did you also get paid for that?

746
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,799
No, no.

747
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,680
You have been so kind to me, Madam.

748
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,720
It's my way of showing respect to you, Madam.

749
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,039
It has nothing to do with Jiang Changyang.

750
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,119
Good girl.

751
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,279
I have not misjudged you.

752
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,000
I have watched him grow up.

753
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,559
And I would not misread his thoughts.

754
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,119
Where is the Qiongtai Yulu?

755
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,119
Madam departs today,

756
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,480
and the flowers have been
moved onto the carriage.

757
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,920
My lord, Madam.

758
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,280
It's not a courtesy

759
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,480
to steal gifts back.

760
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,400
This plant is not easy to care for.

761
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,480
It'll be a loss if it dies.

762
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,320
Better to leave it with me,

763
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,000
and next spring, you can admire
its unmatched beauty again, Auntie.

764
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,639
But I heard

765
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,400
that Mudan cares deeply about this flower.

766
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,320
If you can't bear to part with it, just say so.

767
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I can't bear to part with you, my dear aunt.

768
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,519
I want to use it as a hook

769
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,239
to make you come back and see me more.

770
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,360
Okay, a kind person grants
other people's wishes.

771
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,519
For the grand wedding

772
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,519
of my beloved nephew,

773
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,679
I will definitely come back.

774
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:20,736
<i>[Prince Ning's Mansion]</i>

775
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,760
My family and I were only
able to move back to Chang'an

776
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,880
thanks to your thoughtful
arrangements, Your Highness.

777
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,760
I am deeply grateful.

778
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,719
I will certainly work diligently
for you in the future.

779
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,360
Come on, get up and speak.

780
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

781
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,039
Chang'an is different from Luoyang.

782
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,559
The Minister of the Imperial Treasury
is in charge of finances, goods,

783
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,960
the two capitals and four markets.

784
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,880
This position was envied by everyone,

785
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,280
but I overcame all objections

786
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,400
and left it to you.

787
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
Liu.

788
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,719
Do not disappoint me.

789
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,199
Stand up and speak.

790
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,880
We are catching up.

791
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,496
Don't bother with the formalities.

792
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,599
Everyone knows

793
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,719
that this position of mine

794
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,079
is made of gold.

795
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,719
You have cultivated me with great effort.

796
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,159
I must bear the weight.

797
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,400
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

798
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,719
Your Highness.

799
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,800
Before my trip,

800
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,119
the officials of Luoyang entrusted
me to bring respectful gifts.

801
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,808
Please take a look, Your Highness.

802
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,880
This is presented by officials
from the Chen family clan.

803
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,920
The rest is presented
by officials of other surnames.

804
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,280
So many land deeds.

805
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,599
Most of Luoyang's land is here, isn't it?

806
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,639
Those officials

807
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,679
obtained so many fiefdoms.

808
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,159
Did they occupy the lands of the common people?

809
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,840
If so,

810
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,400
I'm afraid it may tarnish your
esteemed reputation, Your Highness.

811
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,039
All under heaven is the king's land.

812
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,280
Don't worry about the lowly people.

813
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,440
Everyone even feels this chest is too small

814
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,760
to contain the heartfelt
devotion to His Highness.

815
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,119
Gold and silver are trivial matters.

816
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,079
The unity of the gentry is the most important.

817
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,960
His Majesty has a soft spot for flattery,

818
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,679
wishing to fulfill the dying
wish of Minister Xu.

819
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,079
But how can children of common families

820
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,559
compete with the glory
of the great scholarly families?

821
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,039
Your Highness is absolutely right.

822
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,599
The hundreds of officials of Luoyang

823
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,519
will certainly share your heart and virtue.

824
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,719
Youzhen has a good eye indeed.

825
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,519
Zishu,

826
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,239
with your guidance,

827
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,239
will surely

828
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,320
become a pillar of strength soon.

829
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,280
That's right.

830
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,119
It's your first visit.

831
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,840
I've also prepared a modest gift.

832
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,552
Ci.

833
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,239
Here.

834
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
This one

835
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,880
is called a Florican dog.

836
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,679
It's a tribute from foreign lands.

837
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,840
There are only two of them
in the palace of His Majesty.

838
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,239
I've heard that Master Liu
is very fond of dogs.

839
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,239
This dog

840
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,280
is my gift to you.

841
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

842
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,199
I shall take good care of it.

843
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,039
Good, good.

844
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,576
Stop.

845
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:52,320
Madam, we've arrived.

846
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,280
It's the sachets from this shop here

847
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,000
that will make one's official career prosperous

848
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,199
and wealthy.

849
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,880
What's the matter, Madam?

850
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,079
Look in the mirror.

851
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,880
Do you see the difference?

852
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,760
Isn't that the young lady?

853
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,800
But… I thought she died.

854
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,920
This matter must not be known to others.

855
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,119
Go to the office immediately
and ask the master to come home.

856
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,639
Say there are important
matters to discuss at home.

857
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,360
Yes, hurry back to the residence.

858
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,199
Crimson-purple seedlings are expensive.

859
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,360
Unexpectedly,

860
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,440
I found several wild ones today.

861
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,760
If I take them back and graft them
together with the Lovely Pair,

862
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,000
they will surely produce beautiful flowers.

863
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:22,000
Help! Help!

864
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,680
Help me!

865
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,079
Help!

866
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Help!

867
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:19,520
