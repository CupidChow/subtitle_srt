1
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:35,716
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,822 --> 00:01:38,720
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:42,880
There was Tao Qian, who wasn't willing to yield for five dou of rice.

4
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,920
Now,

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,430
there's the Flower Bird Envoy, who pledges his loyalty

6
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:49,360
for a leopard.

7
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:52,800
Flower Bird Envoy, seems like admiring flowers isn't your only hobby.

8
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,199
I suppose you like taming ferocious beasts even more.

9
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,720
Your thinking is too shallow.

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm a devoted man.

11
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:14,240
Money is the only thing I love.

12
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,480
What a coincidence.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
Money is also the only thing I love.

14
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,360
Lord Jiang, that's why we should make money together.

15
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,360
A 50-50 split for the profit?

16
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:36,360
In your dreams.

17
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,941
Lord Jiang, I'm only borrowing the capital from you.

18
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:44,480
I'll do all the dirty and tiring chores.

19
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,320
Lord Jiang, you don't need to do anything at all.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,360
A 50-50 split is a fair deal.

21
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:55,520
Moreover, Lord Jiang, I helped you to avert the engagement.

22
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,400
My head was almost shot because of that.

23
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,920
Lord Jiang, you should appreciate my effort somehow.

24
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,759
No matter if you were here or not,

25
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:06,360
I could avert the engagement myself.

26
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,781
And I also rescued you today.

27
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,400
- I... - However,

28
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,000
judging from your witty act today,

29
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,840
you do seem like a witty girl who can be a dirty merchant.

30
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,600
It's not that we cannot work together.

31
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,440
A 10-90 profit? If there are any losses,

32
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,720
I have to repay all of the capital to you?

33
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,320
Didn't you say so yourself?

34
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,919
It's a rare opportunity that's guaranteed to bring us profit.

35
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,640
I'll compromise with you a little.

36
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,920
Once you sign this,

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,320
you don't need to give me the 19 pots of flowers you owe me.

38
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,680
(Lackey Jiang, you dirty schemer.)

39
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:00,807
Don't think that I don't know you're insulting me in your head.

40
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,360
- That's not... - Forget it.

41
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,580
It's easier to buy some bonds with this money and earn some interest.

42
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:06,960
Don't!

43
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:08,374
Lord Jiang, I'll sign it.

44
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,840
I'll sign it right now.

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Lord Jiang, I'm grateful

46
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,200
that you've given me recognition.

47
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,280
In the future, I'll definitely work tirelessly

48
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:25,240
to make more money.

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Chuan Yu.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,320
- My Lord. - Come and pack our belongings.

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,600
- We'll be leaving now. - Yes, My Lord.

52
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,880
I'll join Chuan Yu in keeping your belongings.

53
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,040
The sooner we leave the mountain, the safer we'll be.

54
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,200
Your husband's mourning period isn't over yet.

55
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,318
And, the incident at Luoyang happened not long ago.

56
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:56,520
How dare you ride your horse here

57
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,278
instead of reflecting upon your actions at home?

58
00:04:58,302 --> 00:04:59,640
You're so unruly.

59
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,280
As for your next spouse, I've already made arrangements for it.

60
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,640
- You don't need to worry. - Father,

61
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:10,040
to you,

62
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,732
Jiang Chang Yang keeps His Majesty company all the time.

63
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:14,640
Forming an alliance with him will surely make things more convenient.

64
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,857
But he stood idly by when the incident at Luoyang occurred.

65
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,720
He has no intention to marry me at all.

66
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,319
He would have no say in the matter

67
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,320
had you not done such a disgraceful deed.

68
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:25,680
And now,

69
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,279
it became an excuse for him to call off the engagement.

70
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,160
Father, I was unfilial for bringing shame to the family.

71
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:35,672
Such indecency.

72
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:36,775
Stand up.

73
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Father,

74
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,360
everyone is talking about the incident at Luoyang.

75
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,680
If I get married to someone else,

76
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:51,760
people will think the rumors are true.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,799
But if I do marry into the Liu family,

78
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,360
it'll turn into a common encounter that no one can argue.

79
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,400
You've repeated that so many times.

80
00:05:58,695 --> 00:05:59,951
Aren't you tired of it?

81
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:02,478
Father,

82
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:03,915
I understand.

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,600
You think the Liu family isn't good enough for us.

84
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,336
But if you look across all of Chang'an,

85
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,541
the young nobles

86
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,560
are just like Jiang Chang Yang.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,800
They only indulge in pleasures all day long

88
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,480
due to their wealthy background.

89
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,751
Even if they marry a county princess who had remarried,

90
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:20,840
they won't be loyal to us.

91
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:24,080
Father, it's precisely because the Liu family isn't a noble family

92
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,560
that they will obey your every command.

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
If you can use them well,

94
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,600
they will still be of use to you.

95
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,760
I'm fine with it if it's another family.

96
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:38,920
But it's the Liu family.

97
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,560
Wouldn't they hold a grudge against me

98
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,568
over the demotion to Luoyang three years ago?

99
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,479
Father,

100
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,320
I know the Liu family very well.

101
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,160
All of them are trying to climb to higher ranks.

102
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:53,462
All of them are eager to pledge their loyalty to you.

103
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,781
Moreover, Liu Shen is good at amassing wealth.

104
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,560
He's very cautious as well.

105
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,260
There are some hidden deeds

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,701
that I need to entrust to someone I know.

107
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,600
That's right, Father.

108
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,818
Zi Shu has been diligent in his studies since young.

109
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:12,998
He has lofty aspirations.

110
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,999
Father, if you can promote him to a higher rank,

111
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,000
he'll definitely be an influential subject in the future.

112
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,920
He's the son-in-law of King Ning.

113
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:22,023
Of course he has to rise to the top.

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,280
You Zhen,

115
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,000
you were married for three years.

116
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,935
You have become much more clear-headed

117
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,480
when making decisions.

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,600
Now, you know how to look at the bigger picture.

119
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,519
Forget it.

120
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,440
You can do what you want.

121
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:43,320
Thank you, Father!

122
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,721
I'll write to the Liu family now.

123
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,216
I'll tell Zi Shu to come to Chang'an

124
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,880
and thank you personally.

125
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,760
Lord Jiang, with the valuables inside your carriage,

126
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:09,732
you can afford several properties in Chang'an.

127
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
Lord Jiang, thank you for the ride.

128
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,840
It has broadened my horizons.

129
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,120
Naturally, we have to complete the full act.

130
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:22,415
I, Jiang Chang Yang, am renowned for my elegance and refined taste.

131
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,661
It'll be terrible

132
00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:27,560
if people find out that a messy woman like you

133
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,901
came out of my tent.

134
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,960
Wipe yourself clean.

135
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,663
Lord Jiang, do you want this?

136
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,320
If you keep harvesting the peonies with these junk,

137
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:02,040
your hands will be useless in a few more days.

138
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:05,880
Won't that make me incur losses?

139
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:07,520
Lord Jiang, don't worry.

140
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Since I've made some money, I can afford some proper farming tools.

141
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,599
In the future, I'll avoid the royal family's hunting ground as well.

142
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,439
I'll make sure you won't incur any losses.

143
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,640
Halt!

144
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

145
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:31,845
I didn't see you at the hunting ground.

146
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,663
Flower Bird Envoy, I heard that you left with a beauty.

147
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,380
I wonder which beauty

148
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,140
has caused you to hide her away so urgently?

149
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Her?

150
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:42,880
She fell for my heroic demeanor

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,120
after she met me for the first time.

152
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,400
At this moment, her face is flushed.

153
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,280
Could it be that she's a shy spirit of the forest?

154
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:52,240
Is that why she's so shy?

155
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,080
Your Highness, tell me, then.

156
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:55,707
She's so pure and adorable.

157
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,560
How can I not enjoy her myself?

158
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,160
However,

159
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:03,640
Your Highness, you're usually surrounded by guards.

160
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:06,320
You came here by yourself, and there's a smile on your face.

161
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,600
Seems like you got your wish granted.

162
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,172
A few days ago, I heard that Zi Shu's wife died after falling off a cliff.

163
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,840
Today, Father has permitted my marriage with Zi Shu as well.

164
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,520
There are no more obstacles between Zi Shu and I.

165
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,600
Flower Bird Envoy, I have to thank you for helping me out.

166
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,544
Let's depart.

167
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,800
Lord Jiang, what do you mean by this?

168
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:49,560
You looked like you saw a ghost when you heard Her Highness just now.

169
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:53,663
I suppose I'm the one seeing a ghost right now.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,600
So, He Wei Fang is dead?

171
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,040
You see,

172
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:03,759
I was lucky.

173
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,160
I was lucky enough

174
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,960
to survive the fall.

175
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:09,520
Forging a household register for you is one thing.

176
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,274
But it's another thing if I have to hide this secret

177
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,920
from Her Highness and King Ning.

178
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:15,400
Give me the agreement. I need to raise the price.

179
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,037
Man should keep their word.

180
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,880
Moreover, the agreement is already signed.

181
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,181
Lord Jiang, you have high integrity and a noble character.

182
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm sure you won't kick me when I'm down.

183
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:27,240
Moreover...

184
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,160
Moreover, He Wei Fang is already dead.

185
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,280
Jiang Xiao Hua will never cause you any trouble.

186
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm not at the receiving end here.

187
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,640
Liu Zi Shu is coming to Chang'an.

188
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,400
Good luck with that.

189
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:50,920
The Liu family has already obtained the wealth and power they desired.

190
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
They will no longer care about a commoner like me.

191
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Moreover,

192
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,341
no matter if the Liu family is coming to Chang'an

193
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,000
or when they're coming to Chang'an,

194
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,280
when the time is ripe,

195
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
I'll seek them out myself.

196
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,719
However, Lord Jiang, that has nothing to do with you.

197
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:18,550
In any case, my luck is your profit.

198
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:20,520
I'll earn them one coin at a time.

199
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:22,360
Lord Jiang, just look forward to it.

200
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:41,034
Following your advice,

201
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,615
I used cow and sheep dung that's thoroughly dried as the base fertilizer.

202
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,664
I've also added irrigation fertilizer to these three pots.

203
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:49,120
The ratio of water to fertilizer are 35%, 25%, and 20% respectively.

204
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:51,480
The roots have indeed become much stronger.

205
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
That's great.

206
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:55,120
Sheng Yi, look.

207
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,320
For the first pot, there's too much fertilizer for the root to absorb.

208
00:12:58,703 --> 00:13:00,782
For the third pot, the main root

209
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,400
has grown by less than one inch.

210
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,000
This is the second pot.

211
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,320
This is the main root. It has grown strong.

212
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:08,143
It has also developed side roots as well.

213
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
However, it hasn't sprouted or developed buds yet.

214
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,440
Here. Let's put this back first.

215
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,879
Remember this.

216
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:19,920
Acquire a balance between the first pot and the second pot.

217
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:21,976
The fertilizer-to-water ratio should be around 30%.

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,646
Use irrigation fertilizer and it'll be fine.

219
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,452
Will the flowers bloom soon if I follow this method?

220
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,020
There's no rush. Let's put them under the sun for now.

221
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,320
We can move them indoors during night time.

222
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,340
However, we need to chill the roots when we change the fertilizer.

223
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm afraid we cannot start a fire tonight.

224
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,440
It's fine.

225
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,999
Dwarf peonies are delicate and precious.

226
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,040
Naturally, we have to compromise with it.

227
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,080
Okay. If it's too cold at night,

228
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:50,720
we can sleep while hugging each other.

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay.

230
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,640
It's raining.

231
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,023
Sheng Yi, you're awake.

232
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:38,848
How are the flowers?

233
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
Since you're awake, let's check on the flowers together.

234
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,400
Come.

235
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:55,720
They're fine. They aren't drenched.

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
Sheng Yi.

237
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,960
The peonies...

238
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,480
We did it.

239
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,840
We did it?

240
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:29,800
We did it!

241
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:33,560
Look!

242
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,280
Sheng Yi,

243
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,000
do you know something?

244
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:44,160
Most peonies have fancy and elegant names.

245
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:47,360
For example, Ningyan Purple Peony and Jade Orchid.

246
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,286
The names will either describe their colors

247
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,800
or the postures.

248
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:53,678
Why don't we name the dwarf peonies as well?

249
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,639
I'm not well-versed in literature.

250
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,400
I don't know any fancy words.

251
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,461
To me, although the flower is tiny, it has a rich fragrance.

252
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:06,727
I was busy tending to it the entire day.

253
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,069
And now, my sleeves have caught its scent.

254
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,360
It soothes the heart.

255
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,160
Wait here.

256
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,040
Its fragrant scent hides beneath the sleeves.

257
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:24,000
Why don't we call it...

258
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:29,678
Fra-

259
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,240
-grant

260
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:39,920
Sleeves.

261
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,800
Fragrant Sleeves.

262
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,600
It represents

263
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,480
the small and delicate buds

264
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,216
that are small enough to hide in one's sleeves.

265
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,960
It's also a praise for its fragrance.

266
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,640
Royal families and aristocrats often enjoy fragrances.

267
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,320
With Fragrant Sleeves,

268
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,611
even commoners will be able to enjoy the same pleasure.

269
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,239
Everyone, take a look!

270
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,548
Affordable peonies, Fragrant Sleeves for sale!

271
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:20,888
There are different pot sizes.

272
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:22,278
The flowers have a rich fragrance!

273
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
One pot for 80 wen! Two for 150 wen!

274
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,280
Come and take a look!

275
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:28,040
80 wen for a pot of peony?

276
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,040
Any mainstream peony

277
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,679
will cost at least a few hundred wen.

278
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,960
That's right.

279
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,920
I've never heard of a peony

280
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,920
called Fragrant Sleeves.

281
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,701
All peonies only bloom in gardens.

282
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,160
They come in huge clusters.

283
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,680
Your pot is so small. Can they actually bloom?

284
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,519
Don't tell me you're just selling the bark?

285
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,240
Don't worry. As businesswomen, we prioritize credibility.

286
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,360
The price is 80 wen, and that won't change.

287
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:54,600
Sheng Yi.

288
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,999
All of these are genuine peonies.

289
00:17:58,103 --> 00:17:59,680
All of them are blooming.

290
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:01,511
- So beautiful. - Madam, come.

291
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:04,357
Tong, take a look. Aren't they genuine peonies?

292
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:05,760
Yes, they are.

293
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,759
Although Fragrant Sleeves is kind of small,

294
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:11,408
its color and shape are still one of the best among peonies.

295
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,609
Its scent is unique too. Take a sniff. Don't you agree?

296
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,200
These are genuine peonies indeed.

297
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,431
- They smell great, right? - They're dwarf peonies.

298
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,295
- They smell great. - They actually bloom, huh?

299
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,760
And, the shape looks great too.

300
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,440
This is truly a rare sight.

301
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,080
Not only did it have a new name,

302
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,840
but the presentation is also entirely different now.

303
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,279
Before this, the short and ugly dwarf peonies cost 50 wen per plant.

304
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,664
Now, it's completely revamped.

305
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,760
And, it only costs 80 wen?

306
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,310
It was hard to nurture these plants.

307
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,735
We only sell a limited number of them.

308
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,535
Please do not hesitate if you wish to buy them.

309
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,840
First come first served!

310
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,831
- I'll buy two pots. - Madam, do you want some?

311
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,120
- Yes! - All right.

312
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,400
I'll buy one.

313
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:46,530
I'll buy one too.

314
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,815
Can you give me a discount if I buy a lot of them?

315
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,279
- Sure. - I want to book ten pots.

316
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,560
Will you resupply them tomorrow?

317
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:53,160
Of course. Write down your name if you wish to book them.

318
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,840
You'll get your goods within three days.

319
00:18:55,463 --> 00:18:56,904
- Tong, can you hold this? - Yes.

320
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:58,126
Here.

321
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,480
You're strong!

322
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,480
- I'll buy one pot. - Okay.

323
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,568
- I want one too. - I want to book ten pots.

324
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,960
- Okay. Ten pots, right? - That's right.

325
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,855
Come and find me if you want to book them.

326
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,478
I'll get the ten pots by tomorrow, right?

327
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:11,336
- All goods will be supplied in three days. - Okay.

328
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,480
Ten pots.

329
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:35,520
I do feel much better after taking some cold medicine.

330
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,520
You must take care of yourself too.

331
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,680
Don't forget to take your medicine.

332
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,320
All right. I'll take it later.

333
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,600
I never expected us to earn more selling flowers compared to liquor.

334
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,440
We only sold our first batch today.

335
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,760
We'll earn 100 strings of coins in just a few more days.

336
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,520
However, we don't have much after paying out

337
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:00,568
90% of our profit.

338
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,600
Sheng Yi, why don't we rent a unit first?

339
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,000
But we haven't paid Flower Bird Envoy his part of the profit yet.

340
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:12,560
There's no rush. It's not the end of the month yet.

341
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,679
We need to spend the most money during the early stages of a business.

342
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:18,000
We need to buy more flowers and tools.

343
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,320
I've made the calculations.

344
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:20,880
We have enough to rent a house

345
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,520
after including our expenditures.

346
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:25,881
The properties in Chang'an are expensive.

347
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,160
Renting a house costs quite a lot.

348
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,920
And, we just started our business today.

349
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:33,451
Isn't it too extravagant?

350
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,144
This house is situated in a low-lying area right by the riverbank.

351
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,708
It's too damp.

352
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,640
And, there's a leak

353
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,200
whenever it rains.

354
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,760
The peonies can't survive for long under such circumstances.

355
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,531
Besides, even if the peonies can survive,

356
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:50,200
I can't bear for you to suffer together with me.

357
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:54,360
If we're sick, we won't have the fortune to enjoy spending our money.

358
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,640
As long as we stay united,

359
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:59,920
we'll be able to earn it back eventually.

360
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,040
Ladies, you guys have viewed all of the best units

361
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:05,640
that I have.

362
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,840
Did you guys not like any of them?

363
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,960
Mister, we've already told you what we wanted.

364
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,760
But the units you brought us to

365
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,880
weren't the units we desired.

366
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,360
Actually, they're pretty good.

367
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,999
But they're near rivers or ponds.

368
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:22,374
Although the view is great, it's damp.

369
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,263
It's situated in a low-lying area. It'll get flooded easily.

370
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,520
Although standalone units are clean and refreshing,

371
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,720
they lack sufficient space or soil.

372
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:31,160
Units near the streets

373
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,719
are too busy for my liking.

374
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:35,440
Convenience is our priority when it comes to looking for units.

375
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:37,760
The conditions you've set are tough to meet.

376
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,040
Do you intend to live on a stinky mudflat?

377
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:43,685
Are you sure you don't have a unit that fits our descriptions?

378
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,680
I think there's one.

379
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
Be careful.

380
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:24,000
The soil is filled with decaying leaves.

381
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,440
It's not too dry or too damp.

382
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,680
It's free fertilizer.

383
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:29,256
Let's rent this unit, then.

384
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,200
Don't be impulsive.

385
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,600
Let's wait a little longer.

386
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,160
Although the unit is huge,

387
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,520
it's too worn-out.

388
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,320
How can we live here?

389
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,800
Although it's worn-out,

390
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,400
it's really cheap.

391
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,800
Moreover,

392
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,054
this is right next to the Flower Bird Envoy's residence.

393
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:55,936
With such an influential figure living beside you,

394
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,760
I'm sure no crooks dare to come.

395
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:02,320
The Flower Bird Envoy is reckless with a tarnished reputation.

396
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:05,320
His notoriety rivals even that of bandits.

397
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,572
No one wants to be his neighbor.

398
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,160
Through extravagant and arrogant,

399
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:16,040
he has never done anything terrible like abducting women.

400
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,080
Moreover, it's right next to the backyard of Jiang Residence.

401
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,120
It's quite far from the main residence.

402
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:23,000
It's definitely secure and quiet.

403
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,400
Ladies, you two don't need to worry.

404
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,960
It won't affect you two.

405
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,200
This is a huge deal.

406
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,160
Please let us discuss it first.

407
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:37,640
If we do become neighbors with Jiang Chang Yang,

408
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,480
as long as we maintain a good relationship with him,

409
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:43,199
it'll be more convenient for us to borrow money

410
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:44,822
or default our payment in the future.

411
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,799
Let's go.

412
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,359
You see,

413
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,540
two women like us are living right next to a corrupt official.

414
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,278
We're quite scared.

415
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,359
That's right.

416
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,421
Unless the rental is dirt cheap.

417
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
That's right.

418
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,400
Leave it to me. I'll make sure it's dirt cheap.

419
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
Greetings, Your Highness.

420
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Zi Shu.

421
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

422
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,640
You came here in a hurry. It was a long trip as well.

423
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,079
You must be tired.

424
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,319
I'm fine.

425
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,560
I will settle at the inn first. I'll head to King Ning's Residence later.

426
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,120
You didn't need to come all the way here.

427
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,740
One's promise should be kept at all costs.

428
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,640
I said that I would wait for your return.

429
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,839
I hoped that I would be the first person you see when you enter Chang'an.

430
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,580
Let's head to King Ning's Residence.

431
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,439
You're already here. Aren't you going to check it out?

432
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:35,015
Come on.

433
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,656
(Liu Residence)

434
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,870
I know you missed your old residence.

435
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:58,311
You'll definitely pass by the place upon entering Chang'an.

436
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,640
That's why I came here to wait for you.

437
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,381
Your Highness, Young Master, welcome home.

438
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,680
Didn't we sell the residence upon leaving Chang'an?

439
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:21,404
Before this, I told you

440
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:22,919
the scenery of Chang'an is just as it was in the past.

441
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:24,663
And, my feelings for you remained the same.

442
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:26,920
As long as you're willing to return,

443
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:29,405
we can start anew.

444
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,799
You Zhen, thank you.

445
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,759
Zi Shu, it's fine as long as you're happy.

446
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,520
The inn they had arranged for you is cheap and lowly.

447
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,976
You'll be more carefree if you live in your old residence.

448
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,540
I can have peace of mind as well.

449
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,880
As for the Ministry of Revenue, Father has already spoken with them.

450
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,960
Right now, there aren't many vacant positions.

451
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:04,404
Your position as a vice director is only a temporary solution.

452
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:06,925
We'll definitely promote you in the future.

453
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:13,400
You Zhen, I've already told you in the letter.

454
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,896
This year, I'll surely pass the imperial exam with flying colors.

455
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,160
I shall obtain an official position through legal means.

456
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,295
I began my education at five years old.

457
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,160
I rely on the imperial exam and my talent to carve out my career.

458
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,360
Only then will I be able to live with peace of mind.

459
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:28,055
If I just enjoy the position that was given to me,

460
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,540
how could my peers acknowledge my skills?

461
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,539
Zi Shu, I know you have lofty aspirations.

462
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,904
But even if you do pass the imperial exam with flying colors,

463
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:39,560
you have to start out as a minor local official.

464
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,160
You would be in a humble position with no way to realize your aspirations.

465
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:46,255
The higher your position is, the easier it is for you to show your talent.

466
00:27:46,303 --> 00:27:47,360
Don't you agree?

467
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,367
Zi Shu, you're very talented.

468
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,060
I think the vice director is an inferior position for you.

469
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:56,640
Besides,

470
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,320
I don't wish to part with you again.

471
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,160
You can have this.

472
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,075
With this, you may enter or exit King Ning's Residence at will.

473
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:21,959
Zi Shu.

474
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,120
You're finally back.

475
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,680
The days I'm looking forward to

476
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,300
are finally coming.

477
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:50,960
(Ministry of Revenue)

478
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,580
Lord Liu, please.

479
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:56,080
Vice Minister Hu, please.

480
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,400
I've instructed my men to clean the place.

481
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:09,107
We've also added some items to the room.

482
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,780
Lord Liu, please see if you're satisfied with them.

483
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,400
Vice Minister Hu, you're my superior.

484
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:16,520
I dare not accept such a title from you.

485
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:19,165
I'm just a sixth-rank vice director.

486
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,719
I should be sharing a room with my fellow vice directors.

487
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,780
This is inappropriate.

488
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,120
Zi Shu, you're King Ning's future son-in-law.

489
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,800
There's nothing inappropriate about calling you Lord Liu.

490
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,720
The Ministry of Revenue doesn't have a nice and vacant room.

491
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,040
This was my room previously.

492
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:39,960
Lord Liu, I hope you won't mind how worn-out it looks.

493
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,600
Please put in a few words for me in front of His Lordship.

494
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:46,083
Vice Minister Hu, you don't need to do this.

495
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm new to the place. I'm here to learn.

496
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,350
I'm here to work together with my peers.

497
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:54,916
I need you guys to guide me if I encounter any issues in the future.

498
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,461
Lord Liu, His Lordship said you were knowledgeable and intelligent.

499
00:29:59,606 --> 00:30:01,206
He said we mustn't treat you ordinarily.

500
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,580
Lord Liu, you're putting me on the spot here.

501
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,440
If so, Vice Minister, if you have any other tasks,

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,320
please assign them to me.

503
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:13,800
Lord Liu, you must be joking.

504
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,080
We shouldn't trouble you.

505
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,600
Just make yourself at home and work at your own pace.

506
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:21,680
You can do whatever you want here.

507
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:26,477
Vice Minister Hu, I'm not a good-for-nothing who relies on power.

508
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,857
Although His Lordship acknowledges my talent,

509
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:31,600
I still wish to do my best to serve the court.

510
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:35,120
Vice Minister Hu, can you please retrieve last year's documents for me?

511
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:37,640
I wish to familiarize myself with my job scope.

512
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:40,440
All right. I'll retrieve them now.

513
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,260
Lord Liu, please wait here.

514
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,079
Thank you.

515
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,840
What's the point of working like this?

516
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:08,720
Now, I'm just like a cuckoo who has occupied another bird's nest.

517
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,856
Young Master, you've become King Ning's son-in-law.

518
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,280
And, you're taking office as well.

519
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,240
The others are just jealous of you.

520
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,359
Young Master, you can choose to ignore them.

521
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,080
Qiu Shi,

522
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,720
I'm not doing for the sake of other people.

523
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm just not willing to cast away my aspirations.

524
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,840
I received a position in a dishonorable manner.

525
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,360
However, if I achieve some results,

526
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:44,605
the hate speech and gossip will stop automatically.

527
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:53,972
In the future, I must rely on my talents to achieve success.

528
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,880
It's quite boring after work, don't you think?

529
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:03,012
Luckily, Vice Minister Hu invited us to Huanyun Pavilion.

530
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,720
Should we call Liu Chang to join us?

531
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:12,716
He already took over Vice Minister Hu's room.

532
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:14,846
He doesn't need us to lick his boots.

533
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:15,927
Yeah.

534
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,000
It's already tiring enough to work alongside him.

535
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:23,703
I don't want to keep up the act after work.

536
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,400
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

537
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,220
- Come on. - Let's go.

538
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:02,799
Come.

539
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,519
Let's go.

540
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Sheng Yi!

541
00:33:34,801 --> 00:33:35,880
Sheng Yi!

542
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:37,080
Come here!

543
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,120
Look! We have furniture here!

544
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,000
That's a lot of them!

545
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:45,600
This is great.

546
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,960
Are all of them usable?

547
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:50,560
Yeah.

548
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:53,238
Sheng Yi, don't discard the mats.

549
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,960
We can use them as shade for the sun.

550
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,359
- Let them lie on the ground. - Okay.

551
00:33:58,497 --> 00:33:59,760
Be careful.

552
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,360
Just leave it on the floor.

553
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,319
Come.

554
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,800
There are plenty of them.

555
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,239
Sheng Yi, help me out.

556
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,360
Be careful.

557
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:15,400
Move aside.

558
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:19,880
What is this?

559
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:24,400
Can I unlock this?

560
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:36,520
Wait...

561
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,200
So, our unit isn't right next

562
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,421
to the Jiang Residence's backyard.

563
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,320
Our unit is the Jiang Residence's backyard.

564
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:52,280
I gave you capital for your business.

565
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,640
You haven't even made a single cent yet.

566
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,800
And now, you're changing your unit?

567
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:01,280
I'm changing it so that I can make more money.

568
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:03,360
Lord Jiang, look.

569
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,280
The soil bed is perfect for flowers.

570
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:10,920
Don't worry. I'll pay out your profit at the end of the month.

571
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,679
Mu Dan!

572
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,160
- We're in trouble. - What happened?

573
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,760
We're in trouble. The property agent had run away.

574
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:19,760
I'm sure he ran away with our money.

575
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:21,880
That darned property agent.

576
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,911
A lone woman traveled all the way to Chang'an.

577
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:26,715
But she was scammed before she could make a name for herself.

578
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:29,764
What a tragic story.

579
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,280
Mu Dan, you mustn't give up.

580
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:34,840
You have to learn from your lesson.

581
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,680
You have to work harder to make more money.

582
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,760
After all, you must make sure to pay out

583
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,920
every single cent of my 90% profit.

584
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:43,480
You're right.

585
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,301
Chuan Yu, let's take pity on the ladies.

586
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:50,376
There are only two of them. It'll take them ages to move all of these.

587
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,301
Bring some men and move these things out of the residence.

588
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:56,200
Yes, My Lord.

589
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,680
Chuan Yu, please wait.

590
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,959
Lord Jiang, it's partly my fault that I was scammed.

591
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,760
But the Jiang Residence has to bear responsibility for this as well.

592
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:09,080
The property agent was familiar with the place when he brought us here.

593
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,261
And, I never saw any guards overseeing the residence.

594
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:13,919
Indeed.

595
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:15,280
Don't you agree?

596
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,142
My Lord, you must've forgotten about it.

597
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,800
Two years ago, you took a liking to brewing liquor.

598
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:25,520
You bought this unit so that you could use it as your cellar.

599
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,160
But after a few months, you felt like rearing deer.

600
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:29,831
Thus, you forgot about the place.

601
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:32,720
Over time, I suppose the servants have become lazy as well.

602
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,839
That's why they didn't tend to the place.

603
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,840
You see?

604
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,560
It's not entirely my fault, right?

605
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,720
No matter whose fault it is,

606
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,880
that's my house affair.

607
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:45,320
Now, you're occupying my land.

608
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,353
Who's daring enough or is capable enough

609
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:49,960
to occupy your land, Lord Jiang?

610
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,080
Lord Jiang, you see,

611
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,095
this courtyard was abandoned in the first place.

612
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,840
It's useless to you.

613
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:59,480
But if you rent it to us, we can make something out of nothing.

614
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,069
And, you can earn twice the profit.

615
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:03,680
That's right.

616
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,880
Lord Jiang,

617
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,040
both of us love money.

618
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:13,036
I'm sure you don't want your investment to go down the drain, right?

619
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:14,880
Are you blackmailing me?

620
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,821
That's definitely not true.

621
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:20,163
Anyway, I'll pay my rent on time.

622
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,423
By the way, Lord Jiang,

623
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:23,800
have you moved the Jade Orchid to your residence?

624
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,440
I was too busy to tend to it as I was busy moving house.

625
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,304
- I wonder if it has bloomed. - That's right.

626
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:33,480
Mu Dan was supposed to tend to the Jade Orchid periodically.

627
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:35,223
Now that we're neighbors,

628
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:38,680
Mu Dan can tend to it immediately if there's any issue with it.

629
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,600
Isn't that great?

630
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:44,040
That's right. If we leave, it'll be a lose-lose situation.

631
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,200
If we stay, it'll be a win-win situation.

632
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,060
Firstly, you can oversee our business directly.

633
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,461
This way, you can rest at ease.

634
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:53,800
Secondly, I promise

635
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,480
that your backyard will be filled with blooming flowers.

636
00:37:56,646 --> 00:38:00,360
I'll also revitalize your abandoned courtyard for you.

637
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,560
Lord Jiang, you're smart. I'm sure you won't reject such a great deal.

638
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,480
Since you said

639
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:15,400
that it's a win-win situation and that I can make twice the profit,

640
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:18,720
seems like paying out 90% of the profit to me isn't an issue for you.

641
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:20,760
No problem at all!

642
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:24,336
Chuan Yu will come and collect the payment at the end of the month.

643
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,558
Not a single coin should be missing,

644
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:26,751
and not a single day should the payment be delayed.

645
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:29,440
If not, I'll ask my men to chase you out.

646
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:30,711
Understood.

647
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,520
If so, may you have a pleasant stay here.

648
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,537
Now, I'm both your debtor and your landlord.

649
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,880
Jiang Xiao Hua,

650
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,480
you better work hard.

651
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:52,200
Lord Jiang, take care.

652
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,946
Who's the one daring enough to scam people using my property?

653
00:38:57,687 --> 00:38:58,993
Report him to Magistrate Ren.

654
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:02,200
Arrest him in three days and make sure he coughs up the money.

655
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:03,734
Make sure he receives punishment.

656
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,758
Yes, My Lord.

657
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:16,240
Sheng Yi.

658
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,447
I thought we were hiring people to get rid of the weeds.

659
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:20,880
Why are you doing it yourself?

660
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,920
It's a laborious chore. And employing labor costs a lot.

661
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:26,600
We don't have much money either.

662
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:29,048
- I should do it myself. - Indeed.

663
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:34,332
We've spent a lot on the house's renovation and the gardening tools.

664
00:39:34,574 --> 00:39:37,108
We don't have any spare cash.

665
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,720
Let's do it ourselves.

666
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,450
I'm fine with laborious chores.

667
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:41,735
You should tend to the flowers.

668
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,640
- Just leave this to me. - This won't do.

669
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:45,928
Now, I have infinite energy.

670
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,159
Let's do it together.

671
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,000
Isn't this common purslane?

672
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,760
That's all you got? Look at mine.

673
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,304
- You're carrying another basket. - It's so cheap.

674
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:28,448
The more I harvest, the more profitable it is for me.

675
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,440
Mu Dan,

676
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,920
have some food.

677
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:39,047
Okay.

678
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:56,559
What's wrong?

679
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:00,640
There's one thing I don't understand.

680
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,856
I don't know if I should ask you this or not.

681
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Ask away.

682
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:08,119
Since common purslane can be sold as a herb,

683
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,600
and since we lack money,

684
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:11,615
why don't we harvest them and sell them ourselves?

685
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,497
You're allowing people to harvest them as many as they want for 10 wen.

686
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,360
Isn't this a terrible deal for us?

687
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,640
Although common purslane can be sold as a herb,

688
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,201
peonies are much more valuable than them.

689
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:24,655
It may seem like we're losing out on some profits here,

690
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:27,598
but in reality, it's providing us with more time.

691
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:29,615
This way, we can make a profit as soon as possible.

692
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,977
I've been doing business together with my father since young.

693
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,821
The first lesson I learned

694
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:38,000
was that time is more valuable than money sometimes.
