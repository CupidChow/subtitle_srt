1
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:35,880
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:39,000
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,610
Greetings, Lord Jiang.

4
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,651
You were still scolding me last night.

5
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,785
Did you take the wrong medicine today?

6
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,571
It was the right medicine.

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,370
Thank you for delivering the dendrobium last night.

8
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,470
Sheng Yi is looking better after eating it.

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,002
I'm here to give you a gift as thanks.

10
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,610
I only get these few cakes

11
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,953
in exchange for the expensive nourishing herbs?

12
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,671
Enjoy, Lord Jiang.

13
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:08,407
I'm leaving.

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Wait.

15
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,732
His Majesty is sending me to Luoyang for a mission.

16
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,120
If there's anything you want from back home,

17
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,319
make a list.

18
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,890
I'll pick it up for you,

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
but you'll have to pay for it.

20
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,680
In that case, I won't hold back then.

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,890
I'd like dried apricots from Liao's in the eastern part of the city,

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,519
silk from Yuecui Pavilion,

23
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,760
brushes and ink from Tingshui Pavilion,

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,560
and a redwood jewelry box handcrafted by

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,601
the limping carpenter Mr. Huang from 18 Mile Alley...

26
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,839
That's too many, Miss He.

27
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,490
Do you really think Young Master has a lot of free time?

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,851
I only said four things.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,131
Besides, Lord Jiang can just pick up as much as he has time for.

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,490
I'm just listing them first.

31
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,170
They're all easy to carry.

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,450
What I really, really want can't be brought back anyway.

33
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,599
What is it?

34
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,930
Zhang's handmade wheat noodles.

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,610
I grew up eating them.

36
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,920
They're absolutely delicious.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,411
You should try them when you have some free time.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,571
If you have any friends or family you're worried about, let me know.

39
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,450
I can check on how he's doing for you.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,650
You must be joking.

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,358
The He family's daughter is dead.

42
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,851
I'm on my own now.

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,330
I have no family or friends in Luoyang.

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,360
The flowers in Luoyang are beautiful.

45
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,359
When you're there running errands,

46
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,170
please enjoy them on my behalf.

47
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,291
Jiang Chang Yang, let me make one thing clear.

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,041
You only asked me to see you off,

49
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,811
you didn't say anything about beating the drum

50
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,371
to wish you a smooth journey.

51
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,866
That kind of service isn't free, you know.

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,520
Don't worry,

53
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,770
you won't regret this.

54
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,251
Is that San Lang's kite?

55
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I borrowed it from him.

56
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,251
W-Where did all these flower petals come from?

57
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,586
When I went to the palace earlier to bid farewell,

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,251
I noticed the fallen petals in the back garden had piled up.

59
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,491
So I thought they'd come in handy.

60
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,090
Though the daughter of the He family is gone,

61
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,290
there's now a Miss Xiao Hua

62
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,090
free to roam Chang'an,

63
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,571
experience the world's diversity,

64
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,290
and witness its splendor.

65
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,546
Doesn't that sound carefree and unrestrained?

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,811
You brought me here

67
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,450
to comfort me, didn't you?

68
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,051
Life is full of long nights.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,611
Only the bright moon stays with us.

70
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,251
Today, I'll lend it to you.

71
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,011
From now on, wherever you are,

72
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,850
as long as you see it,

73
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,251
you'll never be truly alone.

74
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,759
Young Master!

75
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,290
It's time.

76
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,759
I should get going.

77
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,879
Jiang Chang Yang.

78
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,519
Thank you.

79
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,571
Jiang Chang Yang!

80
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,491
Jiang Chang Yang!

81
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,750
How am I supposed to take the kite back?

82
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,530
Unbelievable.

83
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,160
Dusk!

84
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
It's already the hour of Xu.

85
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,559
I should be going.

86
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,050
We've only just got back together.

87
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,290
Why won't you stay a little longer?

88
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,530
Mu Dan is just a spinster

89
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,770
with an odd character,

90
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,240
which is why she keeps so many women under one roof.

91
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,331
Why don't you move back here with me?

92
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,170
Don't say that.

93
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,618
Mu Dan is is generous and well-mannered.

94
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:04,870
Nothing's wrong with her character.

95
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,890
She used to have a husband back in Luoyang.

96
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
What?

97
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,211
You mean she was married?

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,919
And yet she's still entangled with all those nobles?

99
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,690
She only tends to their gardens.

100
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,320
She maintains a strictly professional relationship with her customers.

101
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,890
You better not go spreading any rumors.

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,331
Even if there's nothing improper,

103
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,690
isn't it true that she's always mingling with men?

104
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,211
She's living her best life while keeping you from seeing me.

105
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,600
She is afraid that if you get married and leave the shop,

106
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,620
she'll lose her most dependable worker at the shop.

107
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,650
I don't think you and she are on the same path.

108
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,593
You'd be better off starting your own business.

109
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,170
Mu Dan treats me like her sister.

110
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,851
I would never leave her.

111
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,890
If that's what you're after,

112
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,770
maybe it's best we go our separate ways.

113
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,091
I just didn't want you to be taken advantage of.

114
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,611
If you like being with her, so be it.

115
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,050
I just want us to have a happy life together.

116
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,690
There's an auspicious date a few days later.

117
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,930
Let's get married then.

118
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,879
We'll stay together and never part.

119
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,530
Mu Dan still holds some prejudice against you.

120
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,690
I'm afraid she won't agree to it.

121
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,570
She seems to have her guard up against men.

122
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,331
Could it be that her previous husband broke her heart?

123
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,451
Tell me about it,

124
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,290
so I can think of a way to convince her to accept us.

125
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,371
I don't want our relationship to create a rift between you two.

126
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Your Highness.

127
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
It's late.

128
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Please rest.

129
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,690
Let me copy the sutra for you.

130
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,360
Copying the Lotus Sutra by moonlight with incense burning

131
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,159
is said to bless one for a harmonious marriage.

132
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,851
How could I let someone else do it for me?

133
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,491
But you've been copying sutras for several nights without rest.

134
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,050
You're looking so worn out.

135
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,810
If Young Master Liu saw you, he'd be heartbroken.

136
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,410
How is he doing lately?

137
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,091
The servant we sent says the stables

138
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,290
are keeping him extremely busy.

139
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,971
Young Master Liu is exhausted.

140
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,039
Before going home,

141
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,851
he occasionally stops by a tavern in the western market for a few drinks.

142
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,240
A few days ago, on his day off,

143
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,011
he even visited Mount Zhongnan.

144
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,851
Since when has he been interested in hiking?

145
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,760
I heard there's a Buddhist temple on the mountain,

146
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,690
known for its blessings for marriage.

147
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,650
Perhaps Young Master feels regret

148
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,451
and is seeking divine help

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,770
to rekindle your bond.

150
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,690
This mystical method seems to be working.

151
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,199
When I finish copying this scroll,

152
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,930
I will show him.

153
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,690
Insolent fool! How dare you disturb Her Highness!

154
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,039
- Drag her out and slap her! - Yes.

155
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,719
Please show me mercy!

156
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,799
Never mind.

157
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Yes, Your Highness.

158
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,011
Zi Shu has always disliked it when I'm harsh with the servants.

159
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:29,131
Since he's seeking blessings from Buddha,

160
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,050
I should be more forgiving.

161
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,318
You are very kindhearted, Your Highness.

162
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,770
With such virtue and good deeds,

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,690
your wishes are sure to come true.

164
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
Your Highness.

165
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,519
What is it?

166
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,091
Did something happen to Zi Shu?

167
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,519
Your Highness,

168
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,770
a servant has reported

169
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,999
that across from the tavern Young Master Liu often visits,

170
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,133
there's a flower shop.

171
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,331
And the owner of that shop is...

172
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,170
He Wei Fang.

173
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,650
I've only found out not long ago that He Wei Fang faked her death.

174
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,360
I didn't mean to deceive you, Your Highness.

175
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,971
Please forgive me.

176
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,241
I'll send someone to get rid of with her immediately

177
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,810
and make her disappear for good.

178
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,650
Lord Liu, watch your words.

179
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,290
Her Highness is kindhearted. She wouldn't force you to kill anyone.

180
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,890
Since Miss He is still alive,

181
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,410
Her Highness wants her reinstated to her original identity.

182
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,611
If He Wei Fang isn't dead,

183
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,131
her current identity must be false.

184
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,890
And since it's false...

185
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,050
She's guilty of falsifying household records.

186
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,199
If convicted, her status as a free citizen will be revoked.

187
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,611
She'll be expelled from Chang'an.

188
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,333
With those of free status forbidden from marrying those of servile status,

189
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,930
Zi Shu and she can never be together.

190
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,958
The Chief Magistrate of the capital is skilled at handling such matters.

191
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,570
Simply ride the carriage from King Ning's Residence to see him.

192
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,530
Given the vast difference in their statuses,

193
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,050
he will naturally know how to render a fair judgment.

194
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,611
As for what happens afterward...

195
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,251
I will persuade Zi Shu to come

196
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,091
and apologize to you personally

197
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,331
so that you can mend your relationship.

198
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,770
Please forgive him, Your Highness.

199
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,690
If this matter is handled by you two directly,

200
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,491
Zi Shu will inevitably grow suspicious and blame you.

201
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,491
But if you are not the ones suing her

202
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,770
and are instead summoned as witnesses,

203
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,491
no matter the outcome,

204
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,810
Zi Shu will have no reason to blame you.

205
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,851
Rest assured, Your Highness.

206
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,159
That woman has caused plenty of trouble and offended many people.

207
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,731
I'll find someone unrelated

208
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,213
to bring the case against her in court.

209
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,611
I'll go to the authorities to register for our marriage.

210
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,050
Wait for me at home.

211
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,851
When we obtain the documentation,

212
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,170
we'll go together to explain everything to He Wei Fang.

213
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,810
Mu Dan discusses all her decisions with me beforehand,

214
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,690
yet here I am keeping this from her and acting without her knowledge.

215
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,410
Will she blame me for it?

216
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,851
Best friends

217
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,530
wouldn't fuss over such things.

218
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,491
Besides, I'll go with you to tell her how much I care for you.

219
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,650
I'm sure she will give us her blessings.

220
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,650
It's our wedding day.

221
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,331
Let's not dwell on these worries.

222
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,371
Drink this wedding toast with me,

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and I'll be on my way.

224
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,410
Sheng Yi, hand me the trowel. I'm turning the soil.

225
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,279
She's not here.

226
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,760
She left early this morning

227
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,560
and said she will be gone for four hours.

228
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,731
I have no idea what she's up to.

229
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,050
Why has she been out so often these past few days?

230
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,166
I will ask her about it when she gets back.

231
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,060
- This is so sweet! - It's good, right?

232
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,253
So good.

233
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,519
Have another one.

234
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,566
Let's save some for Sheng Yi.

235
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:48,731
Don't finish them.

236
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:49,812
Alright.

237
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,639
You can have one more.

238
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,331
Open the door! Open up!

239
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,491
The Magistrate's Office is on a case! Who is He Wei Fang?

240
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Come out now!

241
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,479
- Open the door! - Go. I'll deal with them.

242
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,079
- Open up! - The officers are here for me.

243
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,760
Da Fu, go out the back door.

244
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,800
Go to Blooming Abode and tell Mr. Xu to leave immediately!

245
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,719
Why does Mr. Xu need to leave?

246
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,160
I don't have time to explain! Just go!

247
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,839
What about you? You can go hide in Jiang Residence.

248
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
Jiang Chang Yang isn't at home.

249
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,720
Even if I hid there, it wouldn't help.

250
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
Open the door! Open it!

251
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,239
If you don't go now, it'll be too late! Hurry!

252
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,319
I'm going.

253
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,799
Quickly, Da Fu!

254
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Open it!

255
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,651
Open the door!

256
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Open up!

257
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Go!

258
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,850
Are you He Wei Fang?

259
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,839
Faster!

260
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,040
(Jingzhao Fu)

261
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,119
Wang Qing.

262
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,451
Yes, My Lord.

263
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,090
You are accusing the owner of Blooming Abode

264
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,050
of falsifying household records,

265
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,560
asserting that Jiang Xiao Hua is actually He Wei Fang,

266
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,920
an official's wife from Luoyang.

267
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,050
Is that correct?

268
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,359
Yes.

269
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,411
He Wei Fang is deceitful and cunning.

270
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,560
Using a falsified identity,

271
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,530
she conducts business in the city to amass wealth.

272
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,491
I personally witnessed her selling damaged flowers to her customers.

273
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,090
I couldn't bear to see her continue these schemes,

274
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,770
so I've come forward to report her.

275
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,651
How did you discover this?

276
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,810
Qin Wu'er, the second shop owner of Blooming Abode,

277
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,290
is my wife.

278
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:41,810
She was deceived by He Wei Fang into leaving our home.

279
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,279
Not long after,

280
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,610
she uncovered He Wei Fang's false identity

281
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,290
and conniving nature.

282
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,011
She sought me out to stand up for her.

283
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,971
What utter nonsense!

284
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,810
Back at Huanyun Pavilion,

285
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,199
you abused your wife and tried to sell your wife.

286
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,610
You even wrote her a divorce letter.

287
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,770
Everyone present can testify to this.

288
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,610
How could she possibly return to someone as despicable as you?

289
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,211
That's ridiculous.

290
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,651
Wu'er and I love each other.

291
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,491
We've gotten back together already.

292
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,330
Here are our marriage certificate and household registration papers.

293
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,931
Magistrate Ren, please take a look.

294
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,770
Even if he has a marriage certificate,

295
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,480
it doesn't prove that what Wang Qing says is true.

296
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,971
His malicious accusations are clearly

297
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,491
an attempt to seize my property and business for himself.

298
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Grand Treasurer.

299
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,691
Do you recognize this woman?

300
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,330
Are Wang Qing's claims true?

301
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,570
This woman is indeed my daughter-in-law.

302
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,321
However, we thought she had fallen to her death,

303
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,971
which is why my son re-engaged.

304
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,239
There are official documents

305
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,171
from the Luoyang authorities to prove her household record was nullified.

306
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,770
Everyone in my residence, dozens of people,

307
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,330
can testify to her true identity.

308
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,290
When she was in our family,

309
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,718
He Wei Fang often paraded herself in public

310
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:15,045
and neglected her duties as a wife.

311
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,498
My son had no choice but to divorce her.

312
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,090
Yet before the division of assets was settled,

313
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,800
she fled with money.

314
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,891
Looks like she changed her name and came to Chang'an

315
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,530
to avoid returning our money.

316
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,891
Merchants are naturally cunning and profit-driven.

317
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:35,130
It's even rarer for a woman to run a business.

318
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,330
Your thriving shop must have been built on ill-gotten gains.

319
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,610
Our dynasty has always strictly investigated vagrants

320
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
and prohibits those without proper household registers from working,

321
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,171
let alone running a business.

322
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:48,251
Now, with both witnesses and evidence presented,

323
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,731
do you plead guilty?

324
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,050
If you continue to deny it,

325
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,491
I will launch a full investigation into Blooming Abode

326
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,491
and the origins of your household register.

327
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,370
Everyone involved will be brought in for questioning.

328
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,773
Jiang Chang Yang holds a high position and would naturally remain safe,

329
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,770
but he's not in Chang'an right now.

330
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,530
If I drag him into this,

331
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,050
it might expose Wanguan Hall.

332
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,171
And I can't let

333
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,931
Da Fu and Chun be implicated.

334
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,651
I admit that I concealed my true identity.

335
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,411
I obtained my household register from the black market.

336
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,799
- No one else was involved. - Magistrate Ren!

337
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,731
- She has confessed! - But I only did it because I had no choice.

338
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,610
Back in Luoyang,

339
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,370
the authorities had ruled my divorce from Liu Chang.

340
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,251
Yet the Liu family was intent on seizing my dowry,

341
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,850
even resorted to murder to silence me.

342
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:49,850
To save myself,

343
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,610
I had to fake my death, change my name, and flee.

344
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,320
Even after escaping to Chang'an,

345
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,211
they refuse to leave me alone.

346
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,850
They have hired assassins to kill me again and again.

347
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,891
I, He Wei Fang,

348
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,600
formally accuse Master Liu and Madam Liu

349
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,891
of stealing my property and attempting to kill me.

350
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,600
Magistrate Ren, I beg you to investigate this matter thoroughly.

351
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,160
What murder and silencing?

352
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,370
You're slandering us!

353
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,931
It's your word against theirs. Do you have proof to support your claims?

354
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,411
There's a servant in the Liu family named Tian Er.

355
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,171
Back in Luoyang,

356
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,810
he tried to kill me once.

357
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,960
And just recently, when I went flower-picking,

358
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,330
he attempted to kill me again.

359
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,610
Fortunately, I was rescued by a noblewoman.

360
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,570
That's how I'm still alive.

361
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,251
Tian Er was shot in the shoulder by her guards,

362
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,759
and was cut in the arm by a knife.

363
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,839
If you don't believe me,

364
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,079
bring him in for questioning, and the truth will come out.

365
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,211
Grand Treasurer, do you have a servant named Tian Er?

366
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Tian Er?

367
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,479
There is no such person in my residence.

368
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,691
I knew the Liu family would try to hide him.

369
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,931
But I have another piece of evidence.

370
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,290
His injuries were severe,

371
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,491
and he couldn't recover without medical treatment.

372
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,090
So I searched all the clinics in the capital

373
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,810
and finally tracked him down.

374
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,891
The physician treating him can testify for me.

375
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,411
Right now, Tian Er is recuperating outside the city.

376
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Mu Dan,

377
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,971
we treated you with nothing but love and care.

378
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,850
It's one thing that you're ungrateful,

379
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,800
but I never imagine you would dare to speak such slander

380
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,971
and scheme to frame us!

381
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,411
I'm framing you?

382
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,691
You've tried to kill me time and time again.

383
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,610
Why should I keep tolerating you?

384
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,319
Today,

385
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,251
I want everyone to see the truth,

386
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,239
the Liu family is full of hypocrites with no virtue,

387
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,931
beasts in human clothing!

388
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,530
Nonsense!

389
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,971
Magistrate Ren, don't be fooled by this vile woman!

390
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,171
Magistrate Ren, I implore you to deliver justice for me!

391
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,610
He Wei Fang,

392
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,279
accusing a third-rank official is a grave matter,

393
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,211
beyond the authority of the Jingzhao Fu to judge.

394
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,161
But the evidence of your falsified household registration is undeniable.

395
00:23:58,241 --> 00:24:00,160
This cannot go unpunished! Guards!

396
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Yes, My Lord!

397
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,530
Why can't this case be tried?

398
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,640
I have presented both witnesses and evidence.

399
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,251
Why am I the only one being punished while they go free?

400
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Get on your knees!

401
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,691
How can Jingzhao Fu ignore

402
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,171
their crimes of theft and attempted murder?

403
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,050
He Wei Fang,

404
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,199
you falsified household registration, violated commerce regulations,

405
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
and deceived the public. These offenses are unforgivable.

406
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,211
You are hereby sentenced to sixty flogs,

407
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,200
confiscation of personal assets, and demotion to government servitude.

408
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,491
You will be sent to labor at a military camp outside the city.

409
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,610
I refuse to accept this verdict!

410
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,090
Magistrate, your judgment is wise.

411
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,691
Since she has been convicted,

412
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
her shop and assets should now be transferred

413
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,090
to someone more suitable to manage them.

414
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,050
You've finally revealed your true intentions.

415
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,570
You are bad-hearted.

416
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,451
Even if you take after Blooming Abode,

417
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,530
you'll lose it all in the end.

418
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,719
Magistrate Ren, there's one more matter.

419
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,691
- Speak. - A woman who disregards

420
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,319
the Rules For Woman and brings disgrace to her virtue

421
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,370
should be expelled from our family

422
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,290
and made to return the money she stole from us.

423
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,800
Both of your requests are justified.

424
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,810
Approved.

425
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,451
I see it clearly now.

426
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,971
This entire trial

427
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,810
was nothing but a setup!

428
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,959
Jingzhao Fu is colluding with the Grand Treasurer,

429
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,411
trampling over justice and the law.

430
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,800
I want to take this to a higher court!

431
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,931
How dare you!

432
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,691
Speaking such slander here in court

433
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,520
only proves how deceitful and unrepentant you are.

434
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,850
Take her away

435
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,319
and execute the punishment!

436
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,719
- This is unjust! - Walk!

437
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,691
Jingzhao Fu is colluding with the Grand Treasurer,

438
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,570
trampling over justice and the law!

439
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,050
I want to take this to a higher court!

440
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
One!

441
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Two!

442
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,679
Three! Four!

443
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,000
Jingzhao Fu is trampling over justice and the law!

444
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,451
- Six! - They are killing me for my money!

445
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,840
- Eight! - This is unjust!

446
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Nine!

447
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,599
Ten!

448
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,759
- Eleven! - Jingzhao Fu...

449
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,680
Twelve! Thirteen!

450
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,840
...is trampling over justice and the law!

451
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Fourteen!

452
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,891
They are killing me for my money!

453
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,119
Sixteen!

454
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,160
- Seventeen! - This is unjust!

455
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Eighteen!

456
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,891
We're almost at Luoyang.

457
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,106
Finally, I can let someone else drive the carriage.

458
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,090
And I get to sit here and rest,

459
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,651
playing the role of a corrupt official like you.

460
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,090
Young Master, are you divining if our trip to Luoyang will go smoothly?

461
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,891
Have I ever failed in my plans?

462
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,810
No need to divine the obvious.

463
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,330
Then, what are you divining?

464
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,130
Whether the carriage outside can overtake ours.

465
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,011
Xiang, how are you handling the reins?

466
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,011
I'd better take over...

467
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,039
Don't move!

468
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,451
How did I fall asleep?

469
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Wang Qing?

470
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,491
Why is this door locked?

471
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Wang Qing!

472
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,931
Is there anyone around?

473
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,290
Wang Qing!

474
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,559
- Go! - Let go!

475
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,330
Let go of me!

476
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,971
Enough with the nonsense!

477
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,411
You scoundrels!

478
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,519
This is Mu Dan's shop!

479
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,090
If you want to take it, you'll have to get through my fists first!

480
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Stop! Stop!

481
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,050
He Wei Fang is now a convict.

482
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,773
Her private property has been confiscated,

483
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
The shop and flowers

484
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,770
have been handed over to Wu Niang.

485
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,330
Take a good look.

486
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,330
Her name is right here as the co-owner of the shop.

487
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,130
And as her husband,

488
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,211
naturally, her shop is my shop.

489
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,319
My dear, look.

490
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,850
Does the new decoration

491
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,411
suit your taste?

492
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,171
How did Blooming Abode become yours?

493
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:37,530
Where is Mu Dan?

494
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,971
Did you really get back together with him?

495
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,370
He is

496
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,971
my husband now.

497
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,211
Mu Dan treated you so well.

498
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,211
How could you betray her?

499
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,530
I didn't!

500
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,810
Wang Qing,

501
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,920
you promised me we would explain everything to Mu Dan together.

502
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,651
How did things end up like this?

503
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,679
What did you do to her?

504
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,530
How did she become government slave?

505
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,130
Didn't you tell me her true identity

506
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,130
and say you wanted to take over Blooming Abode with me?

507
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,651
I simply did as you wished and reported her to the authorities.

508
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,720
She has now become a government slave and sent away.

509
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,411
Fortunately, you and He Wei Fang had separate household records,

510
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,810
so only her property was confiscated.

511
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,599
Your half of the money wasn't touched.

512
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,691
From now on, the business

513
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,491
is all ours.

514
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,570
He... He only said that to drive a wedge between us!

515
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,839
Lie!

516
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,090
Mu Dan only told her story to you and I.

517
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:43,451
If you didn't tell him, how else would Wang Qing know?

518
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,959
- I... - You've given up being a decent human being just for a shop!

519
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,039
No...

520
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,530
I made a mistake,

521
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,130
but I never intended to hurt.

522
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,290
- Da Fu... - Don't touch me!

523
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,160
He Wei Fang was convicted for falsifying her household registration.

524
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,451
She brought that on herself.

525
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,600
Those military camps are a ruthless place.

526
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,880
She'll be lucky to stay alive,

527
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,050
let alone rebuild her life.

528
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,439
I'd suggest you stop playing

529
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,251
this charade of sisterly devotion

530
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,570
and start thinking about your own future.

531
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,050
If Mu Dan dies,

532
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,651
I will make you pay!

533
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,559
Stop it!

534
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,290
Stop it!

535
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,171
No!

536
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,090
No!

537
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,039
Stop!

538
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,999
Stop it! Stop! Stop!

539
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,290
If you keep beating her,

540
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,810
she will be disabled.

541
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,810
Crippling someone is a serious crime.

542
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,880
Do you all want to be punished?

543
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,330
You scoundrels! I'll fight you to the death!

544
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,931
You have to save your strength

545
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,680
if you want any chance of rescuing Mu Dan.

546
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,319
Let's get your wounds treated first. Come.

547
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Come.

548
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,570
I, Zhu Fu, would rather break our sworn sisterhood

549
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,011
than stand by your betrayal.

550
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,171
From this moment on...

551
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,651
We are no longer friends.

552
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,610
I have to work if I want to eat.

553
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,650
Survival comes first.

554
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
The soaps are here.

555
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:16,530
It doesn't matter if we didn't get the soap pods.

556
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,530
We can burn those wild weeds instead.

557
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,811
Once they're turned into ash,

558
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,640
they'll work just as well for cleaning.

559
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,199
Let's go.

560
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Come on.

561
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,360
- Please give me a little more. - Scram!

562
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,159
Hurry up!

563
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Go!

564
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
My porridge!

565
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,360
Officer, he stole my porridge!

566
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,610
This isn't the place to complain.

567
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,519
If you can't hold onto your food, then starve.

568
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,599
- Now move along! Move! - But...

569
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
But...

570
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,170
They are the ones who did wrong.

571
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
This isn't fair.

572
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,460
Why should I have to go through this?

573
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,811
Why are you so kind to me?

574
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,600
(Sister)

575
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,559
You can read and write?

576
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,891
You're saying

577
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,411
my eyes remind you of your sister?

578
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,039
Where is your sister?

579
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,730
From now on,

580
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,851
we'll look out for each other.

581
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,971
We'll find a way to make it through this.

582
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,011
Lord Jiang, thank you for putting in a good word for my son

583
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,291
and helping him secure the position in the granary office.

584
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,200
You must stay at my humble residence when you are in Luoyang

585
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,771
so I can extend my hospitality to you.

586
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:04,050
The last time I stayed at the Liu estate,

587
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:05,730
things were was noisy and chaotic,

588
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,331
with plenty of mishaps.

589
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,530
This time, I specifically chose a quiet mountain retreat.

590
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,130
Staying alone is much more peaceful

591
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,480
and convenient for doing certain things.

592
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,380
Lord Chen, you get what I mean.

593
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,130
Yes. As you wish, Lord Jiang.

594
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,730
If you find anything lacking in the mountains,

595
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,011
I'll have someone send it over.

596
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,773
Though I'll be staying in the mountains alone,

597
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,559
I wouldn't dare refuse your kindness.

598
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,811
However, I left in such a rush and only brought two carriages.

599
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,199
I'm not sure

600
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,690
if they'll be enough to carry all your generous gifts.

601
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,291
If two carriages aren't enough,

602
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,530
I'll gladly add a few more for you.

603
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,239
Lord Chen.

604
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Chen Zhang.

605
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,719
Chang Yang.
