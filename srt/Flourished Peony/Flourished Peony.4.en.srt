1
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,744
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:38,840
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,456
The flowers are blooming even more beautifully today.

4
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,101
Just yesterday, this one still had a few unopened buds.

5
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,400
Even our fish seem to obey you, Lord Jiang.

6
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,599
Father.

7
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,840
Gentlemen.

8
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,880
They've come over again.

9
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,719
Especially this one, it's the most obedient.

10
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,000
This jade...

11
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:11,600
How did this jade pendant end up with you?

12
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
Is there something special about that jade?

13
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,320
Lord Jiang,

14
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,040
this jade pendant was a birthday gift I gave to Yu Lu.

15
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:24,151
Once, Mother saw it and said it was too ostentatious for a servant,

16
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:25,317
so she took it back.

17
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:28,200
- What's she up to now? - She said it would be returned to Yu Lu

18
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,960
when she got married.

19
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,040
Mu Dan, enough nonsense.

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,800
- Leave at once. - Father, I am not talking nonsense.

21
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,301
Yu Lu is gone.

22
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,840
How is my maid's jade pendant now

23
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,900
in the possession of Lord Jiang's guard?

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,320
I've never stolen jade pendants,

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,040
especially not something belonging to a servant.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,359
This piece was a gift from Chen Zhang.

27
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:54,462
I...

28
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,280
Chen Zhang, did you...

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,080
- I... - Explain this!

30
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,920
I found that in one of the gift boxes

31
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,181
personally delivered to my residence by your butler.

32
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,840
- I... - Father.

33
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,440
If you're short of money, you can tell me.

34
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,160
It was bad enough when you secretly sold off my dowry shops,

35
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,640
but now you won't even spare my maid's keepsake?

36
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,040
This jade pendant...

37
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:21,749
It's not even worth much.

38
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:23,040
A keepsake?

39
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,735
That's bad luck!

40
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,400
Mu Dan, this is just a misunderstanding.

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,080
The evidence is as clear as day.

42
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,560
How is this a misunderstanding?

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Master Liu, you'd better explain yourself.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,496
No money, yet you still host banquets every day to keep up appearances,

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,400
even dipping into your daughter-in-law's dowry.

46
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:42,140
And you call yourself a noble and upright official?

47
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,222
- There's no such thing! - Even stealing from a servant?

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,510
Master, the banquet is ready.

49
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,463
Ladies and gentlemen, you may take your seats.

50
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,160
I instructed you to buy fine jade to send to the Chen family,

51
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,420
and yet you kept the money to yourself

52
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,221
and stole Mu Dan's belongings from the storage to gift instead.

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,800
You disloyal, thieving scoundrel!

54
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:07,000
It was all my fault.

55
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:08,560
Please forgive me, Master!

56
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,640
Was it really your doing alone?

57
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:15,480
If you admit your guilt,

58
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,120
I will show leniency

59
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:20,299
and ensure no blame falls on your son.

60
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,660
But if you dare utter a single lie,

61
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:25,080
I will not spare you.

62
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,955
Yes, it was all me.

63
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:30,717
It's all my fault.

64
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:33,200
I was driven by greed.

65
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:35,237
This happened because I failed

66
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,760
to manage my servants well.

67
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,079
I ask for your forgiveness.

68
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:41,880
Quick to confess, I see.

69
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:43,640
You really know

70
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,583
how to maintain order under your roof, I see.

71
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,160
Now that he's confessed,

72
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,058
how do you plan to punish him?

73
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:54,800
He betrayed and stole from his master.

74
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:55,895
Guards!

75
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:59,905
- Flog him 60 times, and throw him out! - Yes, Master.

76
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:02,360
No, Master!

77
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:05,280
Please forgive me, Master!

78
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,400
Please show me mercy!

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,701
No!

80
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:11,224
Please don't make me leave!

81
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,320
If my household matters have ruined your mood,

82
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,800
I apologize.

83
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:17,614
Please move to the main hall and enjoy some fine wine.

84
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,840
Let's have a wonderful time today.

85
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,454
Please come.

86
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:25,495
Chang Yang.

87
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:30,175
Please come.

88
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:32,440
Please.

89
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:40,160
This matter will soon spread across Luoyang's official circles.

90
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,480
Master Liu's reputation is bound to be ruined.

91
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,520
His accomplices

92
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:46,320
have received their punishment.

93
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:48,960
Yu Lu's revenge has been served.

94
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:51,640
Aren't you happy?

95
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,320
The powerful treat their servants as disposable objects.

96
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:05,560
Seeing him meet this end

97
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,720
doesn't bring me any joy.

98
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,440
It makes me feel pity.

99
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,280
I am weak and powerless.

100
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,367
All I could do for Yu Lu

101
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:20,282
was tarnish the reputation of the one responsible.

102
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:23,800
How could I call that

103
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,135
revenge?

104
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:32,640
Though you couldn't bring him down today,

105
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,960
you've done everything you could.

106
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:37,960
That's more than enough.

107
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:39,880
As for the future,

108
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:43,400
who knows what it may hold?

109
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,104
Thank you, Lord Jiang.

110
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,640
How's the game?

111
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,400
This is so fun.

112
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,240
- Come on. - Here.

113
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,720
Lord Jiang, you're getting really close!

114
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:24,000
- Try again! - You try it.

115
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:27,272
Your Highness.

116
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:30,200
Please.

117
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:34,840
Master Chen, you hold your liquor well.

118
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,840
I must ask for your continued favor, Your Highness.

119
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:43,135
- I understand. - Here's to everyone.

120
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:44,520
Master Liu, you're too kind.

121
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,800
Flower Bird Envoy.

122
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,800
Thank you for your generous hospitality.

123
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,920
- This wine is excellent. - Your Highness.

124
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:10,520
You mustn't feel upset.

125
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,160
Zi Shu didn't join us on the lake last night

126
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:15,574
because he didn't want to bring gossip your way.

127
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:18,480
He's the only son of the Liu family,

128
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:20,080
so naturally,

129
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:22,254
he's expected to entertain guests at such banquets.

130
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,635
He didn't mean to neglect you.

131
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:26,796
I know perfectly well

132
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:28,680
what's on Zi Shu's mind.

133
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,474
I don't need you to remind me.

134
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,720
Before we left, His Lordship specifically instructed me

135
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,996
to ensure you enjoy yourself.

136
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:39,360
I must fulfill that duty, after all.

137
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,720
Stop pretending to be oblivious.

138
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,685
Do you really not know what Father has in mind?

139
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,400
No matter what His Lordship hopes for,

140
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,280
I share the same understanding

141
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,000
with you.

142
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,015
Please excuse me, Chen Zhang.

143
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:18,360
Hearing that we share the same understanding,

144
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:19,920
it's a comfort.

145
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,320
Here, Master Liu.

146
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,760
- Please sit. - Alright.

147
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:30,080
Your Highness.

148
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:31,214
Where are you going?

149
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:33,040
Let's have more wine together.

150
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:34,535
The wine is intoxicating.

151
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:37,182
I'd like to take a walk to the Shuiyu Pavilion to clear my head.

152
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:39,897
I heard the Shuiyu Pavilion at the Liu residence is tranquil and elegant.

153
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:43,162
- Let's accompany Her Highness for a stroll. - Sure.

154
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:45,000
Why go to the Shuiyu Pavilion?

155
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,800
We haven't settled our pitch-pot game from earlier.

156
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:50,894
Without the ladies here to cheer us on,

157
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:53,215
what's the fun in competing?

158
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:56,080
You must stay

159
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:58,000
and witness my victory.

160
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,155
Let's keep drinking and continue the game!

161
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,200
Please, Master Chen.

162
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:15,326
Please.

163
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:16,720
Young Master,

164
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:19,891
helping Her Highness secretly meet with a married man.

165
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,600
Don't you think that's immoral?

166
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,240
That's not true.

167
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm just helping others find happiness.

168
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:28,215
Her Highness is happy, Liu Chang is happy,

169
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:29,640
and I'm happy too.

170
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,520
Everyone gets what they want.

171
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,327
But Young Madam Liu certainly won't be happy about it.

172
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,156
Can't you tell?

173
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:42,480
Young Madam Liu

174
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,960
only cares about her peonies and money.

175
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:47,120
She has no affection for Liu Chang whatsoever.

176
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,200
She couldn't care less.

177
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:55,814
Great shot, Chang Yang! Great shot!

178
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:57,320
Yes!

179
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:30,614
Your Highness.

180
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,760
Zi Shu, do you remember this?

181
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:45,720
When we first met,

182
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:47,515
you were wearing this very dress.

183
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,975
What did you ask me here to talk about?

184
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:55,086
There's no rush.

185
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,155
Will you play a tune for me,

186
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,880
just like how you used to?

187
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:26,760
When you gave me the jade linked rings back then,

188
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:30,080
you said the rings could break,

189
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,880
but we would never be separated.

190
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:36,240
Even after I got married,

191
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,600
I've never parted with it, not even for a moment.

192
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,320
The past cannot be undone.

193
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:45,478
You Zhen,

194
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,600
there's no point

195
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:48,735
in dwelling on the past.

196
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:53,680
Are you distancing yourself

197
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,080
because you still blame me for breaking our promise?

198
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,436
Back then, Father threatened me.

199
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,707
He said he'd destroy your family if I didn't get married.

200
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:06,080
How could I let that happen to you?

201
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:19,720
I was too young and too weak

202
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,000
to stand my ground.

203
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:25,760
Seeing how all the daughters of noble families

204
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:28,436
married into suitable matches,

205
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,600
I thought I would just accept it.

206
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:35,320
I accepted my fate for your sake.

207
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:40,440
It was only after I got married that I realized

208
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,440
a loveless marriage is pure torment.

209
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:48,800
Every time Wu Ping Zhi touched me,

210
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,160
I felt nothing but revulsion.

211
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,840
I understand the position you were in.

212
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,680
I've never blamed you

213
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,040
But the truth is, we've missed our chance.

214
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:10,240
Let's just leave it all in the past.

215
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:12,920
My love for you has never been in the past.

216
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:15,294
You Zhen,

217
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm married. I can't reciprocate your feelings.

218
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,920
Just divorce He Wei Fang. I don't mind.

219
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:28,680
How have you become like this?

220
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:30,116
What you just casually said

221
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,400
could ruin another woman's life.

222
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:35,018
Everything I'm doing is for us.

223
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:37,015
Shouldn't people fight for what they want?

224
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:40,040
The fight you speak of is built on someone else's suffering.

225
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:42,480
And you don't even see the harm you're causing.

226
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:48,831
The You Zhen I knew would never have abused her status as a county princess

227
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,240
to oppress others.

228
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,000
I was

229
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,520
too naive back then.

230
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:02,062
Do you even know what I've been through these past three years?

231
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,160
The Wu family is powerful and influential.

232
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:09,600
My father relies on their support.

233
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:14,000
Every day, I had to deal with my mother-in-law,

234
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:15,600
sisters-in-law,

235
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:18,032
and even his favored concubines.

236
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:22,294
Because I love you,

237
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,160
I refused to get intimate with him.

238
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:28,320
If I weren't a county princess,

239
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,320
the Wu family would have crushed me long ago.

240
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:37,520
After everything I went through,

241
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:39,560
I finally understand

242
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,280
how important power is.

243
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,320
Without it,

244
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,680
a person can be destroyed so easily.

245
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:49,880
Zi Shu,

246
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:52,760
you have talent and ambition.

247
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,502
I can use my influence to help you.

248
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,162
He Wei Fang has nothing.

249
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:57,840
She'll only hold you back.

250
00:15:58,654 --> 00:15:59,960
Divorce her.

251
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,120
Come to Chang'an with me.

252
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:10,520
Back then, my parents controlled my life

253
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:12,960
and forced me to marry He Wei Fang.

254
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,040
Now you're trying to force me to divorce her.

255
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,800
Each of you claims to have my best interests at heart.

256
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:23,720
But do you know what I despise most in life?

257
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:25,480
Being controlled by others.

258
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,680
- I'm not... - You Zhen.

259
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:29,880
There's no going back for us.

260
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:31,920
Let it go.

261
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:34,264
If this continues,

262
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,560
even the beautiful memories we once had

263
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,480
will be worn away.

264
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,240
Zi Shu!

265
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:46,920
Are you hurt?

266
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,640
Are you hurt anywhere?

267
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:05,320
Let me help you up first.

268
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:07,015
You...

269
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,960
- That's right. - Esteemed guests,

270
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:37,440
the twin peony I've nurtured for a year has finally blossomed.

271
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,440
This flower is extremely rare.

272
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:40,676
In all of Luoyang,

273
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:43,057
the Liu Residence is the only place where you'll find one.

274
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:46,595
Please follow me to the Shuiyu Pavilion to admire it.

275
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:50,055
Liu Chang and Her Highness are in the Shuiyu Pavilion.

276
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:52,054
What is Young Madam Liu trying to do?

277
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:54,075
Such a rare and precious sight,

278
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:56,040
it's an opportunity not to be missed.

279
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:58,054
Flower Bird Envoy, after you.

280
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:01,375
- Let's go. - Looks like she has prepared more than just a spectacle.

281
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:02,640
This way, please.

282
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:04,400
Please follow her.

283
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:05,960
This way.

284
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:10,040
To convince Father to approve of our relationship back then,

285
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:13,200
I fought with everything I had.

286
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,480
Do you know how painful it is to starve yourself?

287
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:21,035
Whenever I couldn't bear it anymore,

288
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:23,000
I'd cut myself here

289
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:26,040
to remind myself

290
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,160
that no pain could ever compare to

291
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:31,240
losing you.

292
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:41,320
You Zhen, why were you so foolish?

293
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,159
Zi Shu,

294
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,200
no one in the world will ever love you more than I do.

295
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,840
Without you,

296
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm nothing but an empty shell, worse than dead.

297
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:00,600
Can you really be so heartless to me?

298
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:11,800
The rings may break,

299
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,040
but we will never be separated.

300
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,496
Don't leave me again.

301
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,594
The bridge is narrow.

302
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:51,440
I'll bring the flowers over instead.

303
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,400
Please wait here,

304
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,000
and prepare to be amazed.

305
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,280
Alright.

306
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,372
He Wei Fang, what are you doing here?

307
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,982
Madam? Madam!

308
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:46,600
Madam Liu!

309
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,400
Did you bring them here?

310
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:49,920
Are you out of your mind?

311
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:53,200
- Madam. - Maybe you should worry about Her Highness first.

312
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:56,120
You two are seen disheveled

313
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,840
and intimate

314
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,520
in public.

315
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:01,440
How do you plan to explain this?

316
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,521
You...

317
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:06,920
Father! Mother!

318
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:11,187
Mu Dan, didn't you say we were coming to the pavilion to see the peonies?

319
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:12,560
What is this?

320
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,560
Father, Mother, forgive me.

321
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,760
I didn't know...

322
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:20,200
I had no idea this was happening in the pavilion.

323
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:23,240
In broad daylight,

324
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:26,916
my husband is lying on the couch

325
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:28,870
with the county princess!

326
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:30,046
And I...

327
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:33,200
I was so foolish

328
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:35,000
to be completely unaware

329
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,080
of their affair.

330
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:40,116
Someone, go to the pavilion

331
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:41,655
- and get them out of here! - Yes, Master.

332
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,119
Everyone, please move along.

333
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,255
Move along. Please move along.

334
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:47,320
Let's not stand around gawking.

335
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,000
Looks like the Liu family

336
00:21:49,214 --> 00:21:50,800
will be hosting another wedding soon.

337
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,800
Lord Jiang, please don't joke about such things.

338
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:55,720
As a wife,

339
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,680
I've failed so miserably.

340
00:21:58,462 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm too ashamed to continue living!

341
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,480
I might as well...

342
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:05,640
I might as well just die now!

343
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:06,896
Mu Dan!

344
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,716
Mother, don't stop me!

345
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:10,774
Please don't stop me!

346
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:12,640
I know you've been wronged.

347
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,560
But we have guests here.

348
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:16,000
Stop crying and making a scene.

349
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:19,600
I will make Zi Shu apologize to you later.

350
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:21,640
Mother,

351
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,920
I've been married into your family for a whole year.

352
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,661
No matter how Zi Shu has treated me,

353
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:29,963
I've never once complained.

354
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:32,400
I've compromised again and again.

355
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,840
And yet I've been repaid with humiliation today.

356
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:37,654
And now...

357
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:40,375
Now I'm not even allowed to cry?

358
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:42,895
- That's not what I meant. - I understand.

359
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,680
As someone from a merchant family,

360
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:47,760
my words carry no weight.

361
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,960
So, I implore you all,

362
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,760
esteemed guests, I beg you all to stand up for me!

363
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,871
- Please say something for me. - Your Liu family

364
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,040
really are something.

365
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:04,880
- Get up. - Princess Ji'an is of such noble status,

366
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:06,988
and yet Liu Chang, already a married man,

367
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:09,160
dares to pursue her?

368
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:11,760
The one your family owes an explanation to

369
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:13,200
isn't He Wei Fang,

370
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,520
but King Ning.

371
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:18,320
Chen Zhang, you're being too harsh.

372
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:21,960
Her Highness and Chen Zhang haven't seen each other in years.

373
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:24,320
Their reunion was bound to stir old feelings.

374
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:26,660
Such deep affection

375
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,080
is rare.

376
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:31,520
Why don't we just let them be together?

377
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:32,734
How to let them be together?

378
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:34,615
He Wei Fang is his legitimate wife.

379
00:23:34,695 --> 00:23:36,750
Yes, Her Highness would never accept being a concubine.

380
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:38,080
Well then...

381
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:41,423
It seems He Wei Fang might just have to step aside.

382
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,760
Since Her Highness and Zi Shu are clearly in love,

383
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,920
why should I stay here and get in their way?

384
00:23:54,135 --> 00:23:56,555
What does that mean, Mu Dan?

385
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:00,520
I ask everyone here

386
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:03,520
to bear witness.

387
00:24:08,175 --> 00:24:09,680
Father, Mother,

388
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:12,000
please grant me a mutual divorce.

389
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:28,680
Your Highness,

390
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:30,520
He Wei Fang seeks an audience.

391
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:39,534
Come in.

392
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

393
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,360
Quite the clever move.

394
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:56,720
You convinced Zi Shu not to go on the lake outing with me.

395
00:24:57,015 --> 00:24:58,920
Now you've come to see me,

396
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:00,920
are you here to gloat?

397
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:03,960
I don't know anything about the lake outing.

398
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:07,534
Oh?

399
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:09,880
So, Zi Shu didn't turn me down

400
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:12,803
because he had made plans with you?

401
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:15,120
I never arranged to meet Liu Chang,

402
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:18,346
nor have I ever thought about going on an outing with him.

403
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:22,200
Why are you here then?

404
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:25,720
Aren't you worried I might see you as a threat

405
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:27,840
and get rid of you?

406
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:31,080
Liu Chang cherishes

407
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:33,014
the innocent and pure, unworldly memories

408
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,120
he once shared with you.

409
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:38,280
If you were to harm me without reason,

410
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:41,680
it would only make him think you've become cruel and overbearing.

411
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:43,760
You're smart.

412
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:46,080
Surely you won't want to push him further away.

413
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:48,640
You don't need to see me as a threat.

414
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,680
My heart has never been

415
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:53,436
set on Liu Chang.

416
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,000
I've made up my mind

417
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,156
to seek a mutual divorce.

418
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

419
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,390
Given your background,

420
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,050
the Liu family is the best match you could hope for.

421
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,236
Why would you want to give up the position of a nobleman's wife?

422
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:24,720
He Wei Fang,

423
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,920
I'm not a child you can fool.

424
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:29,531
Your former husband's family

425
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,880
was far more prominent than the Liu family,

426
00:26:32,646 --> 00:26:34,440
but were you ever

427
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:36,000
truly happy there?

428
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:39,655
Go on.

429
00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:43,960
King Ning wants the Flower Bird Envoy as his son-in-law,

430
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:46,680
yet here you are in Luoyang.

431
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:50,275
Clearly, you have no desire to let others dictate your marriage.

432
00:26:51,495 --> 00:26:53,200
You're someone of high status,

433
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:55,320
yet even you can't live freely.

434
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,000
Forgive me for overstepping,

435
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:00,320
but are we really

436
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,275
so different?

437
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,960
I came here today

438
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:10,120
because I want to fight for my freedom,

439
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,840
to escape this misery.

440
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:22,880
If you really want a divorce,

441
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:25,440
you should be talking to Zi Shu.

442
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:27,160
Why have you come to me?

443
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,960
Liu Chang doesn't have a voice in the Liu family.

444
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:33,280
If I want a divorce,

445
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:36,040
it must be approved by Master Liu.

446
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:39,280
You wouldn't have come to me

447
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:41,040
unless you already had a plan.

448
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:44,302
To solve this,

449
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:46,880
we first need to undo what the fortune-teller said.

450
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:48,614
Fortune-teller?

451
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:51,651
Master Liu is very superstitious.

452
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:53,368
The fortune-teller claimed my horoscope

453
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:55,160
would bring prosperity to the Liu family.

454
00:27:55,614 --> 00:27:58,160
That's why Master Liu forced Liu Chang to marry me.

455
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,440
In this household,

456
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm not so much the daughter-in-law

457
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:04,040
as I am a good-luck charm for their feng shui.

458
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:05,920
The fortune-teller, a man named Yuan,

459
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:07,720
appears otherworldly,

460
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:11,436
but he's actually a master of flattery and manipulation.

461
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:13,720
With your status,

462
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:17,160
all you'd need to do is order him to tell Master Liu

463
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:21,240
that their family's lucky star is no longer a merchant's daughter like me,

464
00:28:21,854 --> 00:28:24,200
but a royal lady of noble blood like you.

465
00:28:24,893 --> 00:28:27,893
That would open up the position of Liu Chang's wife.

466
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:33,200
He Wei Fang,

467
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:37,275
you really are not as simple as you appear.

468
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:41,396
How dare you try to use me!

469
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,320
Our goals align,

470
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,200
so how can it be called "using"?

471
00:28:48,054 --> 00:28:49,200
Your Highness,

472
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,920
I have never been your enemy.

473
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:54,160
This is a win-win strategy.

474
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:57,716
It allows the Liu family to send me, their false lucky star, away quickly,

475
00:28:58,046 --> 00:29:00,000
while paving the way for you and Liu Chang

476
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:01,680
to be together.

477
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:05,000
You really live up to your merchant background,

478
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:06,916
calculating

479
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:08,916
and thorough.

480
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,040
I'm just a woman

481
00:29:15,655 --> 00:29:18,315
who wants to take control of her own fate.

482
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:22,476
Aren't you the same?

483
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:27,320
If we're going to do this,

484
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:29,560
it must be swift and decisive,

485
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,075
leaving no room for anyone to refuse.

486
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,040
Your Highness, please reconsider.

487
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:41,560
If we proceed as you suggest,

488
00:29:41,783 --> 00:29:44,080
it could damage your reputation.

489
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:47,151
I can think of another way that's better for everyone.

490
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:48,560
This is the only way

491
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:50,655
to leave everyone with no choice but to accept it.

492
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,256
Your Highness,

493
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:59,308
this is too...

494
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:01,680
This is too crazy.

495
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:05,480
I would throw

496
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:07,720
everything away for Zi Shu.

497
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:15,035
Once this is over and word spreads about our engagement,

498
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:17,600
no one will dare speak ill of me.

499
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,720
My reputation

500
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:22,636
will no longer be an issue.

501
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:27,160
Alright then.

502
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,436
May your wish come true.

503
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:33,440
I wish you and Liu Chang

504
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,160
a lifetime of love and happiness,

505
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:36,636
never to be apart.

506
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,747
If He Wei Fang leaves,

507
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:11,795
won't our family's fortune go with her?

508
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:14,790
But we can't afford to offend the county princess either.

509
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:17,455
Master, please save our family!

510
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:20,960
Just as I thought.

511
00:31:21,103 --> 00:31:22,960
This is meant to be.

512
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:26,120
Master, what do you mean?

513
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:29,325
In just one year since He Wei Fang married into your family,

514
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:31,880
she has altered your family's fortunes.

515
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:33,775
Her presence stabilized the household,

516
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,040
drawing the county princess,

517
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:39,760
who embodies wealth, power, and prestige, into your family's orbit.

518
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:42,815
You're saying

519
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,354
my son and Her Highness are destined to be married?

520
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:50,120
Not just destined,

521
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,775
this union is written in the stars across three lifetimes.

522
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:55,275
They are fated to be husband and wife in this life.

523
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,840
Moreover,

524
00:31:56,935 --> 00:31:58,760
your son's strong horoscope

525
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:01,835
can only be complemented by Her Highness's superior destiny.

526
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:05,716
Together, she will elevate him to great heights.

527
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:11,035
What about He Wei Fang?

528
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:13,320
She can attract blessings,

529
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:15,240
but she cannot coexist with them.

530
00:32:15,574 --> 00:32:19,040
Her horoscope is now in conflict with your family's.

531
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:21,240
You must send her away as soon as possible.

532
00:32:22,534 --> 00:32:24,595
No wonder her temperament changed so drastically

533
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,080
after Her Highness arrived.

534
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:27,560
So that's the reason.

535
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:30,360
There's one more thing

536
00:32:30,814 --> 00:32:32,440
you must remember.

537
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,560
When He Wei Fang married into your family,

538
00:32:35,695 --> 00:32:38,615
I told you to treat her as a mere feng shui ornament,

539
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:40,120
keep her around

540
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:42,360
but don't spoil her.

541
00:32:43,054 --> 00:32:44,320
That's simply because

542
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:46,415
she is low-born but she brings good fortune,

543
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:47,920
wealthy but not noble,

544
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:50,755
and she cannot endure the favor of a high-ranking household.

545
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:54,537
Though when the time comes to marry Her Highness,

546
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:56,520
you must not repeat the same treatment.

547
00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:59,243
She is incomparable in nobility

548
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,520
and requires the utmost care and reverence.

549
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:04,036
Only when she is content and pleased

550
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,080
will she bring your family

551
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:09,075
to the heights of prosperity.

552
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:11,280
Of course.

553
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:12,743
Thank you, Master.

554
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:39,575
Your Highness, the carriage is ready.

555
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,040
We can leave at any time.

556
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:42,520
Where is Zi Shu?

557
00:33:42,903 --> 00:33:44,040
Your Highness,

558
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:46,861
Young Master Liu is still pacifying the guests from today's banquet.

559
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:49,760
After all, it concerns your reputation.

560
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,095
What happened today

561
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:54,196
has been seen by all of Luoyang's elite.

562
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,560
Within three days,

563
00:33:56,814 --> 00:33:58,835
it will be the talk of the entire city.

564
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,360
Zi Shu has always been soft-hearted.

565
00:34:02,534 --> 00:34:04,560
I had to make this decision for him.

566
00:34:05,255 --> 00:34:06,600
This way,

567
00:34:06,854 --> 00:34:09,235
Father won't marry me off to someone I don't love.

568
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:16,447
Your Highness.

569
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,125
Come in.

570
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:22,440
Yes, Your Highness.

571
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:30,586
Are you here to blame me?

572
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,640
How could we?

573
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:36,320
What happened today was due to our poor hospitality.

574
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:38,200
We deeply regret that you were alarmed.

575
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:40,316
We're here to offer my apologies.

576
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:47,763
Her Highness was gracious enough

577
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:50,555
not to pursue the matter of the assassin at the flower banquet.

578
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,600
But this time, it concerns the royal family's reputation.

579
00:34:54,975 --> 00:34:57,280
If word of this reaches King Ning,

580
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,440
the consequences could be disastrous.

581
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:01,520
Knowing His Lordship's temperament,

582
00:35:01,855 --> 00:35:04,120
he might punish Young Master Liu

583
00:35:04,214 --> 00:35:05,840
for seducing Her Highness.

584
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:10,920
I wouldn't want Zi Shu to face such punishment.

585
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:14,400
But we'll need a legitimate explanation

586
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:16,320
to smooth this over

587
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:19,476
before I can plead with my father to spare him.

588
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:24,756
Zi Shu has been devoted to you for years.

589
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:27,442
Heaven has finally rewarded you two.

590
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:30,155
Such a joyous union

591
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:34,600
should not be tarnished by idle gossip.

592
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,720
If you're willing,

593
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,280
our family can immediately proceed with the formal marriage proposal.

594
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:42,400
Once the wedding is set,

595
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:45,276
all the rumors will naturally die down.

596
00:35:46,174 --> 00:35:49,075
The formal marriage proposal

597
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,720
is essential for a proper marriage.

598
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,280
But what about He Wei Fang?

599
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:55,987
She's just a merchant's daughter.

600
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,242
Rest assured, I'll handle her appropriately.

601
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:03,515
- You may rise. - Thank you, Your Highness.

602
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:12,574
Your Highness.

603
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:15,694
Zi Shu, come in.

604
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:23,195
I'm leaving soon. Why are you so late?

605
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:34,574
Your Highness,

606
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:36,080
the journey back is long,

607
00:36:36,254 --> 00:36:38,720
so I had extra cushions placed in the carriage.

608
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:41,436
I hope it makes the trip more comfortable for you.

609
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,560
Zi Shu,

610
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:45,360
you've come at the perfect time.

611
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:47,654
You've admired Her Highness for years,

612
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:50,276
and now your wish is about to come true.

613
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,720
You want me to remarry just to cover up this scandal?

614
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:01,640
What nonsense are you saying?

615
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:03,960
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

616
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:08,720
Don't worry, your father and I will take care of everything.

617
00:37:08,902 --> 00:37:10,400
See Her Highness off first.

618
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,975
We'll discuss the rest later.

619
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,575
Your Highness, please.

620
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:23,335
Please.

621
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:39,400
Zi Shu seems

622
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:42,240
reluctant about this marriage.

623
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:43,982
What if he...

624
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:45,960
Zi Shu has always been obedient.

625
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:47,440
He'll come around.

626
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,471
The bigger problem right now is

627
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,880
that He Wei Fang is determined to pursue a mutual divorce.

628
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:53,814
Doesn't her wanting a divorce

629
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:55,595
align perfectly with what the master said?

630
00:37:56,614 --> 00:37:59,196
She does need to be sent away,

631
00:37:59,686 --> 00:38:00,960
but her dowry...

632
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:05,710
Funds are needed for smoothing things over in the official circles

633
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:07,560
and arranging the wedding.

634
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:10,015
I think

635
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,880
it's better to cast her out instead.

636
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:27,614
Zi Shu,

637
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,120
do you not want to marry me?

638
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:35,960
I made myself clear

639
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:37,520
at the pavilion.

640
00:38:38,174 --> 00:38:39,840
The love we once had was real,

641
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:41,640
but the years

642
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,360
have changed us both.

643
00:38:44,174 --> 00:38:45,440
There is no going back.

644
00:38:51,423 --> 00:38:53,000
But given what's happened,

645
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:54,855
the only way to restore our reputations

646
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:56,316
is for us to marry.

647
00:38:58,495 --> 00:39:01,675
Perhaps this is fate's way of giving us a chance to get back together.

648
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:03,956
Once we're together again,

649
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,851
I'll remind you of those days,

650
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,195
those were the happiest moments of our lives,

651
00:39:10,255 --> 00:39:11,440
weren't they?

652
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:22,840
I'll be waiting for you in Chang'an.

653
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,760
Night time!

654
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:10,884
Night time!

655
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:17,240
Young Madam.

656
00:40:18,295 --> 00:40:19,295
Enter.

657
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,080
Young Madam, your tea is ready.

658
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:28,440
I heard Her Highness has left.

659
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:32,715
What are Master and Madam up to now?

660
00:40:34,094 --> 00:40:35,600
I'm just a servant.

661
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:37,800
How would I dare inquire into the masters' affairs?

662
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:40,560
Don't try to brush me off.

663
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:42,800
Word has spread.

664
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,670
At this point, the Liu family has no choice but to marry Her Highness

665
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,320
to cover up the scandal.

666
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:49,640
If I'm not mistaken,

667
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:52,440
Master and Madam must be taking stock of the family assets

668
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,550
and preparing the betrothal gifts, aren't they?

669
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:56,887
Young Madam, please don't overthink this.

670
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:59,120
In the end, it's still up to Young Master to decide.

671
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:01,000
He will surely do right by you.

672
00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:03,080
Do right by me?

673
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:04,571
After being caught red-handed,

674
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,520
he doesn't get to decide what happens next.

675
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:08,416
But since Master and Madam

676
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:11,200
are already counting up the family assets,

677
00:41:11,654 --> 00:41:14,400
this is the perfect time to settle things once and for all.

678
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:20,320
You may go.

679
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:30,134
Young Master, Young Madam has packed up her belongings.

680
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,436
I didn't dare stop her.

681
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,776
You may leave.

682
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:40,840
From the looks of it,

683
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:42,595
she's determined to leave.

684
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,030
Young Master,

685
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:48,134
what happened today was just a misunderstanding.

686
00:41:48,254 --> 00:41:49,670
After all, you are husband and wife.

687
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:51,560
She must be upset and heartbroken.

688
00:41:52,295 --> 00:41:53,400
Young Master,

689
00:41:53,495 --> 00:41:54,935
why don't you explain things to her?

690
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:57,694
You're right.

691
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:02,880
Even a snarling rabbit

692
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:04,960
is still just a rabbit.

693
00:42:07,455 --> 00:42:09,200
I suppose I should go smooth her fur.
