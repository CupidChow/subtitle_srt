1
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:36,184
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,011
(Episode 28)

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,021
The Chen family's fall

4
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,181
has left the position of Vice Commissioner of Transport vacant.

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,360
His Majesty has entrusted me to recommend someone capable.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,700
I was hoping you could help me identify suitable candidates.

7
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,759
But if this marriage is called off,

8
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,799
I fear

9
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,559
the reward may also be rescinded.

10
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,220
His Majesty sees you as a brother.

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,981
He has always hoped for a dependable woman to take care of you.

12
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,300
We can't disappoint him.

13
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,199
Here's an idea.

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,781
You can choose another woman, someone beautiful and virtuous,

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,800
and take her as your concubine instead.

16
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,101
His Majesty has seen He Wei Fang before when he visited my residence.

17
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,541
In fact, sending her to learn the Luyao Dance was his idea.

18
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,959
Earlier today at Xingqing Palace, Consort Shu was also present.

19
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,981
If I were to replace her,

20
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
wouldn't that be considered deceiving His Majesty?

21
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,661
What the county princess wants is Zi Shu's heart.

22
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,015
By taking He Wei Fang as my concubine,

23
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,895
I sever any lingering thoughts Zi Shu has of her

24
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,381
and solve Her Highness's biggest worry.

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,376
If anything were to happen to He Wei Fang,

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Her Highness's engagement

27
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,747
might end up getting ruined too.

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,821
Her Highness's injury is irreversible,

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
and I certainly don't want her to suffer a heartbreak.

30
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:05,300
Nor do I want His Majesty's goodwill to go to waste.

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
So, My Lord,

32
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,319
what do you think now?

33
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,039
Stay.

34
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,501
My Lord, what are you going to tell Her Highness?

35
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,860
You Zhen's injuries are irreversible.

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,620
Killing He Wei Fang won't change anything.

37
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,319
Instead, we might as well

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,941
do the Flower Bird Envoy a favor

39
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,000
and use this to gain something in return.

40
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,496
I'm reserving the Vice Commissioner of Transport position

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,280
for her future husband.

42
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Yes, My Lord.

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Go!

44
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Come on.

45
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,940
Let's go check on my soon-to-be concubine.

46
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,999
This whole taking-a-concubine plan

47
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,480
was a spur-of-the-moment decision.

48
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,319
I wonder if she...

49
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
He Wei Fang.

50
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Thank you, Lord Jiang.

51
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,141
Everyone knows King Ning cherishes the county princess,

52
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,141
but no matter how deeply he loves her,

53
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,919
his own interests will always come first.

54
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,101
But you're different.

55
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,720
To save my life,

56
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,160
you had to sacrifice yourself to take me as your concubine.

57
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,599
You're a very loyal friend.

58
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,461
I am truly grateful for it.

59
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,341
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about this place.

60
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,176
Marriage is a serious matter that affects a woman's reputation.

61
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,375
You've been thrust into becoming my concubine without a choice,

62
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,399
doesn't that bother you?

63
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,420
What's reputation compared to staying alive?

64
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,239
Besides, this is just a second marriage for me,

65
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,341
but this is your first time taking a concubine.

66
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,600
To outsiders, you're marrying a notoriously difficult merchant,

67
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,060
not someone you really love.

68
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,701
If anyone's losing out here, it's you.

69
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,159
If I were to fuss over trivial matters,

70
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,120
wouldn't that make me ungrateful?

71
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,800
You're remarkably open-minded about it.

72
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,661
I overheard you promising

73
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,500
the Vice Commissioner of Transport position to King Ning.

74
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,541
You've paid such a steep price.

75
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,701
I really don't know how I'll ever repay you.

76
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Don't worry about it.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
No one understands the art of giving and receiving better than I do.

78
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,141
This grand gift I've given today serves my own purpose.

79
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,639
Don't worry,

80
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,359
I won't come out on the losing end.

81
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,320
All this maneuvering with King Ning has worn me out,

82
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,439
I'm starving.

83
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,920
Got it. I'll grill some fish for you.

84
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Let's go.

85
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,799
Since I've taken it upon myself to marry you,

86
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,581
I won't let you be slighted when it comes to the wedding.

87
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,600
Whatever grandness other brides enjoy,

88
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
you'll have too.

89
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,760
The betrothal gifts, wedding attire, jewelry,

90
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,860
banquet, and ceremony,

91
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,920
you can decide how you want everything.

92
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
Whatever the treasury has, it's yours to use.

93
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,415
If there's anything missing, just say the word,

94
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,439
I will...

95
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,060
Please don't make it a big affair.

96
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,300
Our marriage is just a way to save my life.

97
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,981
If it's too extravagant,

98
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,000
it'll draw unwanted attention and give us away.

99
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,679
I just don't want you to feel like you've been mistreated

100
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,079
when it comes to the formalities.

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,661
You know me better than that.

102
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,620
If throwing a big banquet ends up disrupting my business,

103
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,661
that's when I'd really feel wronged.

104
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,199
Well then,

105
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,940
how do you want the wedding?

106
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,260
Just keep it simple,

107
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,860
one table,

108
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,380
a few pots of osmanthus wine,

109
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,079
and that's enough.

110
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,959
As you wish.

111
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,000
Keep it modest and low-key.

112
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,420
Absolutely not!

113
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Come on.

114
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,101
This concerns King Ning,

115
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,840
and your life is at stake.

116
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,500
You mustn't let any word slip

117
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,880
and drag your friends into this.

118
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,480
Lord Jiang, marrying Mu Dan is already a blessing for three lifetimes.

119
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,776
If you don't make it a grand affair with a lavish banquet,

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,101
Da Fu and I won't stand for it.

121
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,501
News of this joyous occasion has spread like wildfire in Jiang Residence.

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
By tomorrow,

123
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,180
the line of people bringing gifts will probably

124
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,040
stretch all the way to the palace gates.

125
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,021
Keeping it low-key

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,039
is going to be hard.

127
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,701
No grand spectacle, please.

128
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,701
You know I'm not one for pomp and ceremony.

129
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,810
Besides, how many of those guests would

130
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,620
actually be there to celebrate sincerely?

131
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,740
Most are just outsiders eager

132
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,780
to watch a theatrical display of a deeply romantic wedding.

133
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,855
When we swore our oath of sisterhood, we did it with full ceremony.

134
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,696
For something as important as marriage, how can it be handled so casually?

135
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,040
That would just feel too strange.

136
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
Your friends understand the situation and respect you,

137
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,360
but outsiders only see what they want to see, a slave from the military

138
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,775
turned merchant climbing her way up

139
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,679
by attaching herself to someone in power.

140
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,181
Only by hosting a grand event can Sui Zhi

141
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,860
show how much he values you

142
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,341
and silence the gossip about you scheming your way up.

143
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,701
You ordinary folks just don't understand

144
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,020
Mu Dan's unique charm.

145
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,101
This is our wedding,

146
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,181
and how it is going to be held,

147
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,480
I will leave it entirely up to Mu Dan.

148
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,900
You know me so well, Lord Jiang.

149
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,020
Have I ever cared about what others said about me?

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,799
I just want a simple wedding,

151
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
a small gathering

152
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,176
with a few close friends to celebrate.

153
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,400
Sincerity means far more to me

154
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,073
than extravagant gifts or grand displays.

155
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Hang on.

156
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,701
You're about to get married,

157
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,639
so why is Mu Dan still calling you Lord Jiang?

158
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,461
I've brought it up with her before,

159
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
but she's so used to saying it

160
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,381
that she forgets to change.

161
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't be fooled by her boldness,

162
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,540
she's actually very shy.

163
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,159
There's no rush to change how she addresses me.

164
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,896
I have matters to discuss with San Lang.

165
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,501
I'll come back later

166
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,919
to drink with you.

167
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,981
Alright.

168
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,341
Mu Dan, this all happened so suddenly.

169
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,221
Do you really want to be his concubine?

170
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,895
You're not being forced into it, are you?

171
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,840
- I'm not... - Don't worry.

172
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,895
Whatever he's done before is none of my business,

173
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,301
but if he dares to mistreat you after the wedding,

174
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,101
my fists will be ready!

175
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,660
Got it, mighty fists.

176
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,321
Alright, alright, come on.

177
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,216
- Let's have some meat. - Alright.

178
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
I want the biggest piece.

179
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,900
That's raw meat you're grabbing.

180
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,440
I don't care. I'm starving!

181
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,295
Even though we're not holding a banquet or inviting guests,

182
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:08,199
the formalities still need to be done properly.

183
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Borrow me the artisans and coordinators

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,646
from the Bureau of Rituals, Attire, and Feasts

185
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,400
to decorate the residence and organize the wedding arrangements

186
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,855
As for the wedding pastries prepared by the Imperial Kitchens,

187
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,279
I'll distribute them to all the major officials in the city.

188
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,400
Should I lend you the Bureau of Bedding too?

189
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,360
This is just for appearances.

190
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,920
I'm not taking the act all the way to the bridal chamber.

191
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
That said,

192
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,136
But I've heard the bed linens and drapes must follow specific customs,

193
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,301
or it's considered unlucky.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,421
Fine, borrow them too.

195
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,960
So, have you decided on names for your future children?

196
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,161
I've told you, this is all just for show.

197
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:46,681
Don't let your imagination run wild.

198
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,516
As a Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Entertainments,

199
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,936
haven't you handled all kind of feasts?

200
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,320
And yet, you're putting so much effort into a fake wedding.

201
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,341
Could it be that you're hoping to turn this charade into reality?

202
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,238
I've broken my rule by taking a concubine.

203
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
If I don't make it a public spectacle,

204
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,740
King Ning might grow suspicious.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,839
And don't you dare say anything to Mu Dan,

206
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,239
I don't want her getting the wrong idea.

207
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,022
You arrived

208
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,981
soon after King Ning left.

209
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,040
Even by bystander standards, this is fast.

210
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,920
What are you really here for?

211
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,262
I heard that when Princess Ji'an fell from her horse,

212
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,321
Ling Ge stepped in to defend Mu Dan.

213
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,062
So, I came to check on her.

214
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,240
Consort Shu ran off after being upset by Consort Hui.

215
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,482
You don't know how to apologize,

216
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,640
so you're hoping Mu Dan can convince her to come back, aren't you?

217
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,513
Your back courtyard is small and plain,

218
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,420
yet it manages to keep the wealthy and resourceful Miss He staying.

219
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,461
Meanwhile, I have grand palaces,

220
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,456
yet Ling Ge moves out at the slightest whim,

221
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
and won't return no matter how I try.

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,660
Over here, it's real love hidden beneath the charade,

223
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,260
while on my side,

224
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,000
it's a case of a family falling apart.

225
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,700
Nonsense.

226
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,821
Consort Shu was lonely in the palace before,

227
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,376
but now she'll have a sister-in-law to keep her company.

228
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,816
Mu Dan is perceptive and understanding.

229
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,519
She will talk to her and ease her troubles.

230
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
You Zhen!

231
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,319
You Zhen, stop! Don't do this!

232
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,399
Calm down!

233
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,240
You Zhen, stop! Stop!

234
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,701
Three years ago,

235
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,461
my marriage

236
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,061
was bartered away for the allegiance of noble families.

237
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,421
And now, my suffering has become

238
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,181
a convenient bargaining chip between you and the Flower Bird Envoy.

239
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,020
My broken body

240
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,421
can no longer serve any purpose for you.

241
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,581
Rather than living in humiliation,

242
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,341
I'd be better off dead.

243
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,281
You Zhen!

244
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,821
Don't think like that!

245
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,981
I remember every grievance

246
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,301
you've endured.

247
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,159
I promise

248
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,260
I will repay you tenfold in the future.

249
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,900
Will there even be a future?

250
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,920
All of Chang'an knows now

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
that I was humiliated by a merchant

252
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,860
and that I can no longer bear children.

253
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
My pain...

254
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,660
I can't make He Wei Fang pay for any of it.

255
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,200
Without the prospect of children,

256
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,301
will Zi Shu still want to marry me?

257
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,301
Even if he does,

258
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,873
what if he takes countless concubines for heirs?

259
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,461
How am I supposed to live with that?

260
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
You...

261
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,581
My Lord, Your Highness, Liu Shen and his son are here.

262
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,639
Father!

263
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,500
I can't face Zi Shu anymore.

264
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,140
If he dislikes me because of this...

265
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
He wouldn't dare.

266
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,919
Lie down.

267
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,039
Lie down, You Zhen.

268
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,620
Since you're betrothed,

269
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,559
you're meant to share joys and hardships.

270
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,879
The wrongs you've suffered, the pain you've endured,

271
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,020
as your husband,

272
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,221
he should bear them a hundredfold and ease them for you.

273
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Don't worry.

274
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm here for you.

275
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,900
Your Highness.

276
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,639
Your Highness,

277
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,066
this medicine contains golden-edge mulberry mushroom,

278
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,250
personally requested by His Lordship from His Majesty.

279
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,680
Please drink it while it's warm.

280
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,300
Liu Chang doesn't deserve you.

281
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,720
He is fickle and ungrateful.

282
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,719
Seeing you hurt and worried over him,

283
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,239
and even neglecting your own health,

284
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,141
it breaks my heart.

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,060
Why insist on him of all men?

286
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:24,333
Even the affection of royal parents

287
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,582
for their daughters

288
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,040
cannot outweigh the pull of power

289
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,421
and interest.

290
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,781
Knowing that,

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,781
I cherish Zi Shu even more.

292
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,500
At least with my love for him,

293
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,981
I don't have to measure gains and losses or calculate benefits.

294
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,621
It's perhaps

295
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,941
the only truly pure thing

296
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,181
I'll ever have in my life.

297
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,559
This is...

298
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,679
My Lord, you're turning this engagement

299
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,760
into a matrilocal marriage?

300
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
My Lord,

301
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,941
Zi Shu is my only son.

302
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,500
Our family isn't some impoverished household.

303
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,959
How could you bear to let our family line end here?

304
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,340
Zi Shu would be ridiculed by everyone!

305
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,060
You Zhen was harmed

306
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,260
because of your former wife,

307
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,981
and now she may never be able to bear children.

308
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,701
Zi Shu is deeply pained by what happened to Her Highness.

309
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,160
He will surely care for her and love her twice as much.

310
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,616
In the future, should he have children with a concubine,

311
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
Her Highness can adopt them...

312
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Adopt?

313
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,661
That's a good idea.

314
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,060
If you are concerned about continuing your lineage,

315
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,701
you could also adopt a child from a distant relative,

316
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,661
wouldn't that work?

317
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,141
You Zhen's current plight

318
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,580
is the direct result of Zi Shu's fickleness.

319
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,160
If he were to take multiple concubines,

320
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,461
with numerous children born,

321
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,141
it's bound to lead to more trouble

322
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,701
and disaster down the road.

323
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,759
My Lord,

324
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,981
if You Zhen doesn't trust me,

325
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,880
I'll talk to her and ease her worries.

326
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,340
You should know You Zhen's temperament by now.

327
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,941
This is the only way to give her peace of mind.

328
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,340
It's settled.

329
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,661
I give you my word,

330
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,119
I will help you

331
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,260
rise to the rank of Grand Chancellor one day.

332
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,359
I understand your deep love for your daughter.

333
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,421
You share in

334
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,141
her joys and sorrows.

335
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,421
However, this matter concerns the future of my family.

336
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,820
I must consult with our elders.

337
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,260
I also ask for some time

338
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,381
to consider this carefully.

339
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,279
My father and I will take our leave for now.

340
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,839
My Lord.

341
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,839
My Lord.

342
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,080
My Lord, please don't be mad.

343
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,941
For the sake of You Zhen's love for you,

344
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,340
I've been nice and polite enough.

345
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,519
Like I said,

346
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,381
this is the only way.

347
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,533
Sign the matrilocal marriage agreement,

348
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,141
and any requests you have will be granted.

349
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,181
What kind of absurd love is this?

350
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Her pain is now my punishment,

351
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,221
magnified a hundredfold?

352
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,826
Just because she can't have children,

353
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,602
you're forcing me into a matrilocal marriage

354
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,847
and end my family's bloodline?

355
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,519
Zi Shu...

356
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,335
My family has been a prominent family for generations.

357
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,621
We don't need to sell ourselves through marriage to survive!

358
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,839
I will marry her,

359
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:49,035
but if you want me to become a matrilocal husband,

360
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,080
Never!

361
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Very well.

362
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,181
Then your family

363
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,981
might as well end its line today!

364
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,661
My Lord! My Lord!

365
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,439
- I'll sign! I'll sign! - Father!

366
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,696
On behalf of Zishu, I agree to the matrilocal arrangement!

367
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Father!

368
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,239
Father! Father!

369
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,359
- I refuse! - Move!

370
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,519
Father!

371
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,359
Father!

372
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,340
Marriages are decided

373
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,780
by the parents and arranged by the matchmakers.

374
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,489
Whether it's taking a wife or entering into a matrilocal marriage,

375
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:22,613
it's a joyful occasion.

376
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,080
Her Highness has been loyal to you,

377
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,100
it's only right for you to repay her.

378
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,559
My Lord, My Lord...

379
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
My Lord,

380
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,639
Please calm down, My Lord.

381
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,340
In-law,

382
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,479
you really are pragmatic and wise.

383
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,839
See him out.

384
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,319
Yes, My Lord.

385
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,319
My Lord, what about Zi Shu?

386
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,260
Zi Shu is too stubborn.

387
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,199
I will talk to him and make him change his mind.

388
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,740
I know you are very powerful,

389
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,399
but even if you can force me into the bridal chamber,

390
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,480
do you really think you can bind me and You Zhen together for life?

391
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,340
Zi Shu,

392
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:06,780
you think

393
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,440
being a matrilocal husband, with no heirs,

394
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,100
is very unfair to you.

395
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,039
Fine.

396
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,901
I'll balance things out for you,

397
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:26,026
so you can live in harmony

398
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,461
with You Zhen.

399
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Someone,

400
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,100
bring Zi Shu

401
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,640
a fine cane.

402
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Yes, My Lord.

403
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,941
You've put yourself

404
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,661
on too high a pedestal.

405
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,640
Your pride and ambition

406
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,780
are meant to be ground down.

407
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,980
Come to terms with it as soon as you can.

408
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,100
Don't keep You Zhen waiting too long.

409
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,559
Chun, Da Fu,

410
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,981
I understand that, as Mu Dan's family,

411
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,661
you want to test me.

412
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,079
I get it. But as I said,

413
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,853
I don't have any mistresses,

414
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,039
chambermaids,

415
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:35,861
or favored dancers.

416
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,799
All those women you've seen around me

417
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,120
are nothing more than employees.

418
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Bullshit!

419
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Da Fu!

420
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Lie.

421
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,941
Last time, you also said

422
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,199
that you and Mu Dan were just employer and employee.

423
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,100
Did I say that?

424
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,181
I fell in love with Mu Dan at first sight!

425
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,479
I used our business dealings

426
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
as a way to express my devotion.

427
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That's right.

428
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
He's telling the truth.

429
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,100
We grew fond of each other

430
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,820
as we worked together over time.

431
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,221
Anyway, Young Master Jiang isn't a womanizer.

432
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,141
And besides, hasn't Miss Chun already checked his pulse?

433
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,901
His health is indeed excellent,

434
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,861
exceptionally good, I'd even say.

435
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,759
But...

436
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Say it.

437
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:37,287
Just say it.

438
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,960
- But you frequent pleasure houses. - Surrounded by beauties.

439
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,080
Have you just been...

440
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,440
Drinking and chatting with them?

441
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,300
You have such dirty mind.

442
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,600
I only flatter those dancers and performers

443
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,920
to expand business opportunities for Mu Dan's shops.

444
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,200
Where do you think all your recent orders came from?

445
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,759
That's right.

446
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,060
Even though Miss He wanted the wedding to be simple,

447
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,295
Young Master still risked being criticized to invite the female officials

448
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,159
from the Six Departments and Twelve Divisions.

449
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,300
Everything is being handled as if he were marrying a proper wife.

450
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,381
My love for Mu Dan

451
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,880
is as clear as the heavens and the moon!

452
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,120
Mu Dan was the one who had been hesitant to accept me.

453
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Yes.

454
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,941
That's because

455
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,160
I couldn't believe your love for me before.

456
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,780
But now that Chun has checked your pulse,

457
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,740
I know for sure.

458
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
To have found such a good man,

459
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,760
what more could I ask for?

460
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,981
But looking at the two of you now,

461
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,820
where is even a hint of that romantic spark between a couple in love?

462
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,100
Mu Dan has always focused her mind on business,

463
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,820
and I've never fallen in love.

464
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Now that we're exploring this new feeling of love,

465
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,360
it's only natural to be a little awkward.

466
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,401
Besides, neither of you has experienced romance yourselves, have you?

467
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,100
It's no wonder you can't see the affection we have for each other.

468
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,960
Well, I...

469
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Look at Mu Dan,

470
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,100
she can't hide her joy at marrying someone like me.

471
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,060
Mu Dan, don't hold back

472
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,799
in front of your friends.

473
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,439
If you want to smile, just smile.

474
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,439
Yes, yes! Look at that! Now I'm seeing the romance speck

475
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,580
I read about in legendary tales!

476
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,320
It's romance spark, Da Fu.

477
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Yes, spark.

478
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,340
Now, tell us,

479
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
how exactly

480
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,740
did you two manage to fall for each other and exchange feelings

481
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,720
right under our noses?

482
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,221
Maybe it was when he brought back

483
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,181
the honey-glazed flatbreads made by my father from Luoyang.

484
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,381
They were tasty.

485
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,680
So, the flatbreads were tasty.

486
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
And you?

487
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,500
I felt an instant connection with Mu Dan from the moment

488
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,159
we met at the Liu Residence in Luoyang.

489
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,540
But since she was Young Madam Liu at the time,

490
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,759
I had no choice

491
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,639
but to bury those feelings.

492
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,701
So there's some backstory after all.

493
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,279
That does make sense.

494
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,740
And after meeting again in Chang'an?

495
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,160
- She went up... - He was being forced...

496
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,720
He was being pressured by nobles to arrange a marriage,

497
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,080
I stepped in to help him out.

498
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,535
She ran into a tiger when she went up the mountain to pick flowers.

499
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,440
And I saved her.

500
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,880
So, who helped whom?

501
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,300
We helped each other.

502
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,480
A corrupt official and a cunning merchant are a perfect match.

503
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,399
I lent her the capital to start her business,

504
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,839
and by some twist of fate,

505
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,079
we ended up as neighbors.

506
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
Over time,

507
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,941
our feelings naturally deepened.

508
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,381
Warm wine by the pavilion,

509
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,176
nightly conversations and drinks,

510
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,421
our love didn't spring up overnight

511
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,701
but grew steadily over time.

512
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:29,141
And so, here we are, finally getting married.

513
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,920
So, do you have any other questions?

514
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,840
No, no, not at all.

515
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,960
We have no more questions.

516
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,680
Miss He,

517
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,880
my mistress has received your calling card

518
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,340
and sent me to fetch you.

519
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,981
Coming!

520
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,260
See, isn't it the same as what's written here?

521
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Allow me.

522
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,599
Go ahead with your business. I'll wait for you to come home for dinner.

523
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,556
I'll walk Mu Dan out.

524
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,399
Please make yourselves comfortable here.

525
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,679
Alright, since Lord Jiang is accompanying Mu Dan,

526
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,559
I'll go back and have dinner with my mother.

527
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,240
Mu Da was packing so many things just now.

528
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:18,321
Where is she going?

529
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,439
The benefactor who saved Mu Dan at the polo field isn't in great health

530
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,326
and can't take strong medicinal decoctions.

531
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,381
After studying her usual prescriptions,

532
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,336
we found her condition stems from postpartum complications,

533
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,381
insomnia, and exhaustion.

534
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,759
So, we've prepared some restorative bath beans and incense

535
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,661
to help with her recovery.

536
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,640
Got it. You save lives, I'll go eat.

537
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,820
Go inform San Lang to head to Xingqing Palace immediately.

538
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,599
If Mu Dan manages to convince his wife to go back,

539
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,919
let's see how he'll thank me.

540
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Yes, Young Master.

541
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,015
Young Master, haven't you been trying to find the perfect betrothal gift

542
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,341
that Miss He wouldn't refuse?

543
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,281
Well, Da Fu told me there's one thing she definitely won't turn down.

544
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:58,039
How are you going to thank me for this tip?

545
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:04,260
Miss He's true desire isn't gold or jewels,

546
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,479
it's the garden her mother loved,

547
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,559
the Fang Garden.

548
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,080
Fang Garden was sold a few days ago.

549
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,600
Miss He even borrowed money from a pawnshop to try to buy it,

550
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,240
but Lv Wan Rong from the Flower Association beat her to it.

551
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,199
So all the money she's earned from her business,

552
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:21,621
and she wouldn't spend a dime on herself,

553
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,421
it was all to buy that garden.

554
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,740
That garden is considered cheap to you.

555
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,616
Let's pay a visit to the Lv Residence.

556
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
Surely, he wouldn't dare refuse to sell.

557
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,981
She is very prideful.

558
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,600
She would want to buy Fang Garden with her own efforts.

559
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,295
If I were to buy it and gift it to her,

560
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,679
it'd feel like a slap in the face,

561
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,740
as if all her hard work and determination meant nothing.

562
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Besides,

563
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,981
that garden was legitimately bought by her friend's father.

564
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,381
If I use my authority to seize it,

565
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,306
it would only annoy her.

566
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,912
But when two people are in love,

567
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:58,553
shouldn't one provide help in a time of need to deepen the bond?

568
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,461
When did you become such an expert on romance?

569
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,320
And yet I don't see any beauties in your arms.

570
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,639
I'll go deliver the message to San Lang now.

571
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,359
I've always been free-spirited, riding and hunting,

572
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,820
and never cared much for these refined things.

573
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,319
But today, just one whiff of this fragrance,

574
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,141
I must say, it's truly soothing.

575
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,239
The pleasant scent is only secondary.

576
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,719
This medicinal incense is specifically blended to help with your anxiety.

577
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,159
The aroma travels through your lungs and chest,

578
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
aiding in healing.

579
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,340
The daytime blend contains

580
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,959
dried chrysanthemum, rosewood, and tree peony

581
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,519
to soothe the liver and ease tension.

582
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,880
The nighttime blend features clove, poria, and amber

583
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
to calm your nerves and improve sleep.

584
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,861
Such thoughtful preparation.

585
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,639
It's far better than the daily bowls of bitter herbal soup.

586
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,580
Your insomnia and melancholy didn't develop overnight.

587
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,901
Over time, it has upset your digestive system

588
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,760
and made it harder for you to tolerate those strong medicines.

589
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,400
But with food therapy,

590
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,341
medicinal scents, and everyday remedies,

591
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,540
gradually and gently nurturing your health,

592
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,200
the results can be just as effective as traditional medicine.

593
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Greet...

594
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,639
Come on.

595
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,582
Mu Dan always knows what to do.

596
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:46,976
Ask her later if there's anything else suitable for Ling Ge.

597
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,240
Have her make a few more items.

598
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,580
Send them to me first.

599
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,301
I'll deliver them to Ling Ge personally.

600
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,140
Maybe once her anger subsides,

601
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,119
she'll return to the palace with me.

602
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,840
Your Majesty, as long as you pays generously,

603
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,861
forget a few, Mu Dan would make dozens of them for you.

604
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,140
Forgive my boldness,

605
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
but emotional wounds

606
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,700
can only be healed with care for the heart.

607
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,920
I went through so much to give birth to my child.

608
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,440
I wish I could stay by their side day and night.

609
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,680
Yet, by rules, I must hand them over to palace attendants to raise.

610
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,119
Even on the rare occasions we meet,

611
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,060
I'm surrounded by those same attendants constantly meddling.

612
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,901
Have you ever shared this with His Majesty?

613
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,861
Perhaps he also wouldn't bear to see you and your child separated

614
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:38,712
and might allow you to raise them yourself.

615
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,719
Though I hold the title of Consort Shu,

616
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,580
I am still just a subject.

617
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,869
His Majesty is surrounded by other favored consorts daily.

618
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,406
Why would he concern himself with my joys and sorrows,

619
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,861
let alone break the rules for me?

620
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,180
Nothing matters

621
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,861
more than your own health

622
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,620
and happiness.

623
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,821
If His Majesty's affections lie elsewhere,

624
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,280
then all the more reason to cherish yourself.

625
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,199
Letting go of someone indifferent to you

626
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,840
might just open your heart to peace.

627
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
Is this her way of comforting people?

628
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,160
How is this supposed to help me make up with Ling Ge?

629
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,135
Well, it's true you've been spending a lot of time

630
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,620
in Consort Hui's palace.

631
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
Jiang Chang Yang,

632
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,656
Consort Hui is one of King Ning's spies. Do I have a choice?

633
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,999
I was hoping she'd help ease Ling Ge's troubles,

634
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,062
but instead, Mu Dan told her to give up on me!

635
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,998
A troubled heart

636
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,535
needs the right diagnosis before it can be healed, doesn't it?

637
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,320
She hasn't even married you, and you're already so protective of her.

638
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,700
Have you no conscience?

639
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,000
Since moving into the palace,

640
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,020
no one has ever asked me these things.

641
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,261
They only care

642
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,079
if Consort Shu manages the harem well,

643
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,140
if the prince I bore is intelligent and well-mannered.

644
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,941
No one has ever asked

645
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:02,714
what Huangfu Ling Ge really wants.

646
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,060
And what do you want?

647
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,741
After entering this lonely palace,

648
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,381
what I once sought

649
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,461
became a far-off luxury.

650
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,580
Perhaps the only way

651
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,901
to find peace

652
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,679
is to focus on myself.

653
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,421
You're absolutely right.

654
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,719
Letting go of what weighs on your heart

655
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,461
will heal it in time.

656
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,941
Now that you're here in Xingqing Palace to relax,

657
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,040
you should take the chance to live freely.

658
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,741
If you're angry, let it out.

659
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,261
If you're sad, cry.

660
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,540
When you're bored, have some fun.

661
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,456
When you have things you can't share with anyone else,

662
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,660
you can always tell me.

663
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,461
But I'll eventually have to return,

664
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,741
where I'll face people I wish I didn't have to see,

665
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,901
listen to hypocritical nonsense,

666
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,941
and force myself to smile like the perfect, virtuous consort.

667
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,860
San Lang,

668
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,140
Consort Shu didn't mean it that way.

669
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,781
Don't tell Ling Ge that I was here.

670
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,660
Just let Mu Dan spend more time with her.

671
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Young Master Liu,

672
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,239
it's time to eat.

673
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:06,572
Don't bother trying to persuade me.

674
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,341
I'll starve myself to death

675
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,781
as a way of repaying Her Highness.

676
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,341
Please deliver a message to my parents.

677
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,760
Tell them I've failed to restore our family's honor

678
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,360
and am ashamed to call myself a son of the Liu clan.

679
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,101
I hope they won't grieve too much.

680
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,209
But your parents were overjoyed to accept

681
00:39:30,289 --> 00:39:32,261
His Lordship's betrothal gifts today.

682
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,495
They even bowed and kowtowed multiple times in gratitude.

683
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:37,496
They said that Liu Chang now belongs to King Ning's family,

684
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,610
in life or in death.

685
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,742
Your broken leg has brought them

686
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,821
twenty full chests of wedding gifts.

687
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,781
They couldn't be happier.

688
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Get out!

689
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,180
I know you're determined to die,

690
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,261
but at least have some wedding pastries first.

691
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,900
You can die afterward.

692
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,420
I said get out!

693
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,701
I won't go through with this marriage.

694
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,140
Tell King Ning to enjoy those pastries himself!

695
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,660
You've got it wrong.

696
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,680
These wedding pastries are from your former wife He Wei Fang

697
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,821
and the Flower Bird Envoy.

698
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,100
His Lordship said that you'd surely regain your appetite

699
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,662
when you saw these.

700
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,239
No, it couldn't be.

701
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
It couldn't be.

702
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,559
It couldn't be.

703
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:32,379
It couldn't be.

704
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,781
A free citizen isn't allowed to marry a slave.

705
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,741
The Flower Bird Envoy has the power to change her status easily.

706
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,501
He Wei Fang should've been tortured to death

707
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:45,586
after harming Her Highness.

708
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,140
But who would've thought she'd catch Lord Jiang's favor?

709
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,620
His Lordship had no choice but to spare her life.

710
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,020
You can't move on from her,

711
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,540
but look at yourself now,

712
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,341
how do you

713
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,660
compare to Jiang Chang Yang in any way?

714
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,060
Survival comes first.

715
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,296
Being a concubine or a matrilocal son-in-law,

716
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,220
what do those labels even matter?

717
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
In this world,

718
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,301
the real win is having the ability

719
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,620
to stay alive.
