1
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:36,184
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,011
(Episode 31)

3
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,799
I heard the bride is exceptionally beautiful.

4
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,960
Lord Liu, please.

5
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Alright.

6
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Flower Bird Envoy truly lives up to his reputation,

7
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,671
marrying two concubines in just three days.

8
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,400
I heard the last one was a slave,

9
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,230
so there wasn't even a proper banquet.

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,631
But today, this bride was given by King Ning, a noble concubine.

11
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,671
Look at this grand and lavish feast, it's so dignified.

12
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,159
Chuan Yu.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,671
Why is the bride taking so long?

14
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,399
- We're eager to offer our congratulations. - Yes.

15
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,150
She's almost ready. I'll go check on her.

16
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,439
Go on.

17
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,086
You've been getting ready for over two hours, aren't you done yet?

18
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,271
The ceremony is supposed to be casual,

19
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,840
- you don't have to... - It's you

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,686
who is treating me casually, isn't it?

21
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,910
There was no bridal carriage to fetch me,

22
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,511
no poem urging me to dress,

23
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,870
I've been quite understanding.

24
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,710
Not to mention that Mu Dan hasn't even shown up.

25
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,750
She's busy with her shop.

26
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,726
She may not make it in time for the wedding.

27
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,511
If you want to meet her,

28
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
serving tea tomorrow works just as well.

29
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,910
I wouldn't dare forget His Lordship's instructions.

30
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,870
I must toast

31
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,750
Mu Dan at tonight's banquet.

32
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,470
She wouldn't neglect King Ning's goodwill

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,351
and turn me down,

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
would she?

35
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
King Ning and I are on one mind,

36
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,199
and Mu Dan and I are of one mind as well.

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,460
How could she possibly refuse you?

38
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,111
Why don't you stay

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,630
and pick a hairpin for me?

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,470
The person you've been so eager to see has just returned.

41
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,046
I'll go hurry Mu Dan along

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,630
so she doesn't miss your wedding.

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,439
Not bad. This smells so good.

44
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,000
How are you not getting it?

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
This one is good.

46
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,440
You've only been married three days,

47
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,720
and he's taking another concubine,

48
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,486
without even giving you a heads-up!

49
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,711
Say the word, how do you want him to pay for this?

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,591
I'm just a concubine.

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,031
He doesn't need my permission to take another.

52
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,720
Come on.

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
It's really good.

54
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,639
Let's get back to dinner.

55
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,950
He's not important.

56
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
What's important is our commencement banquet.

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
Here. Want some more?

58
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,280
- Drink slowly. - This clearly wasn't grilled by Miss He.

59
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,750
It tastes awful.

60
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,000
Put aside the burnt ones.

61
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,151
I'll make some fresh ones for you later.

62
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,521
Here, have this instead.

63
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:49,840
And look, I have more wine too.

64
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,031
- Everyone, drink up! - Alright!

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Yes!

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Everyone,

67
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,671
I'm counting on you to take care of Fang Garden.

68
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,671
Please give it your best.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
When our business thrives in the future,

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,400
I'll throw a proper celebration banquet with the finest wine,

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,120
and you may drink your fill until morning then!

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,180
You've always been efficient and fair, Miss He.

73
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,320
Working at Fang Garden is a blessing for us.

74
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,883
We'll work hard to get it up and running as soon as possible!

75
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Raise your cups.

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Drink up.

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,281
- Please have some more. - Fill your cups.

78
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,430
Cheers!

79
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,390
This one is burnt.

80
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
I'll throw it away.

81
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,111
Enjoy the food.

82
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,399
More, please.

83
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,950
Here, have some meat.

84
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,840
- Who else want some wine? - I've had enough.

85
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:52,199
Take care of everyone for me. I'll be right back.

86
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,279
Got it.

87
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,119
Here, have some.

88
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,390
Give it to me.

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Jiang Chang Yang.

90
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:20,126
Flower Bird Envoy, you're supposed to be taking another concubine.

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,676
Why did you toss stones at my courtyard?

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,800
Were those burnt meat your handiwork?

93
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,520
I thought I shouldn't keep freeloading off your midnight snacks,

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,830
so I figured I'd return the favor.

95
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,600
But you took forever to come home,

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
and when you did, you brought a whole group along

97
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,260
to drink and feast like it's a festival.

98
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,031
Fang Garden just got a team of capable hands,

99
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,031
so of course, a commencement banquet was in order.

100
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,671
You, on the other hand,

101
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,319
on your big day,

102
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,911
with another beauty marrying you,

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,190
do you really have time to drink with me?

104
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,031
You think I wanted this?

105
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,315
King Ning uses women as his pawns

106
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,099
to charm ministers and secure control of the court.

107
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,031
Even His Majesty has Consort Hui by his side.

108
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,680
I had no choice but to smile and accept her.

109
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,351
You used to have no wives, no concubines,

110
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
a fortress sealed tight.

111
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,879
But now,

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,950
because of me, you've opened that door.

113
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,791
And you can't turn them away anymore.

114
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,639
So, I suppose

115
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,072
it's my fault.

116
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,551
It's good that you realize it.

117
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,270
The one King Ning sent isn't easy to deal with.

118
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,390
She spent ages picking out hairpins earlier

119
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,151
and said she's waiting for you to join the banquet so she can toast you.

120
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,270
Since I'm the reason she ended up here,

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,791
no matter how difficult she is,

122
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,671
I'll take care of it for you.

123
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,319
Let's go.

124
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,111
You're obviously drunk.

125
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
If you go in like this,

126
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,106
you'll end up giving everyone something to gossip about.

127
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,671
You've had a little too much today.

128
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,111
Your cheeks are so flushed

129
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:09,983
that even powder can't cover it up.

130
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,751
The newly weds are entering!

131
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,253
No wonder they say beauty is the essence of taking a concubine.

132
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,079
Madam He is stunning.

133
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,030
Even her makeup is exquisite.

134
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,431
Truly fitting for the owner of Blooming Abode.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,360
Everything from the flowers

136
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,270
to the cosmetics is exceptional.

137
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,910
Yes, she's breathtaking.

138
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,630
You must be Lian Zhou.

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,951
I heard you were waiting to toast me.

140
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,920
I got held up on my way here.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,351
please don't take offense.

142
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,471
Mu Dan,

143
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,071
a pleasure to meet you.

144
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,361
We're family from now on.

145
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,431
If there's anything you're not used to in the residence,

146
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:46,632
don't hesitate to let me know.

147
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,630
If you really saw me as family,

148
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,591
why were you so late?

149
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,151
I thought you didn't want to see me

150
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,191
and were trying to embarrass King Ning.

151
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,759
Of course not.

152
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,591
I informed Mu Dan as soon as you arrived.

153
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,991
To celebrate our wedding,

154
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,173
she specially prepared a fine wine in your honor.

155
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,311
Since you are His Lordship's goddaughter,

156
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,578
she took her time selecting the best,

157
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,659
which is why she was late.

158
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
That's right.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Serve them!

160
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,111
I've been busy refurbishing Fang Garden lately.

161
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,991
Our winemaker has crafted this special Hundred Flower Brew.

162
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,991
This wine is smooth, rich, and fragrant beyond compare.

163
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,030
It was originally meant for next spring's grand opening,

164
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,790
but since you're joining our family today,

165
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,111
let's make this banquet even more special

166
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,679
and taste it in your honor!

167
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,550
Yes!

168
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,711
This is a rare fine brew.

169
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,400
It's exquisite.

170
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Here.

171
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,750
Exceptional.

172
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,559
Madam He, this wine is as rich and fragrant as expected.

173
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,272
If I could purchase a few bottles to take home,

174
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,400
- wouldn't that be wonderful? - That's right.

175
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,991
The wine is divine, and Madam He, your makeup is stunning.

176
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,831
May I ask what it's called?

177
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,120
This is called Drunken Glow,

178
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,270
created using Drunken Rouge from Blooming Abode.

179
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,510
As for the Hundred Blossom Brew, it's exclusively available at Fang Garden.

180
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,920
Please do visit us

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,599
with your families in the spring to enjoy it.

182
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,439
We will! Such a marvelous wine!

183
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm pre-ordering ten bottles right now.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,280
Perfect! Coming here today was definitely worth it!

185
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,510
Agree.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,040
I spend most of my days out managing business,

187
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,120
so I've grown a bit rough around the edges.

188
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,831
Please don't take offense.

189
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,150
When it comes to grace and attentiveness, that's your strength.

190
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,790
From now on, I'll leave the household matters in your capable hands.

191
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,280
Well, I've delivered the wine and met everyone I needed to.

192
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,390
I hope you enjoy the rest of your wedding banquet!

193
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,160
Madam, the banquet in the main hall has ended,

194
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,630
but Lord Jiang is nowhere to be found.

195
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,390
He has probably gone to He Wei Fang's courtyard.

196
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,630
King Ning sent me here to win over Chang Yang,

197
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,351
to ensure he'll be

198
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,960
of greater use to him in the future.

199
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,191
This is my wedding night.

200
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,759
I'm not going to just sit here and wait.

201
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,799
You've had a long day,

202
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,680
and you still have to keep up this act with me now.

203
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,039
It must be exhausting.

204
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,991
Well, if it weren't for me,

205
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,630
you wouldn't have to go through all this trouble pretending.

206
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,559
What's wrong?

207
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,799
Nothing.

208
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,351
Just that Lian Zhou marrying into this household,

209
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,390
only to face suspicion and rejection,

210
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,951
reminds me so much of when I married into

211
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,351
the Liu family.

212
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,032
It feels kind of sad.

213
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,919
At the banquet earlier,

214
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,670
she was clearly trying to embarrass you,

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,351
yet you still treated her with kindness.

216
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,639
I could see then

217
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,311
you felt sorry for her.

218
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,550
She's just a pawn sent by King Ning to compete for favor.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,630
Whatever she says or does is likely not by her own will.

220
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,870
Ever since Sheng Yi passed,

221
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,150
I've come to understand more deeply

222
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,431
that all women share a common plight.

223
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,546
I'll try to keep my distance from her,

224
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,431
and as long as she doesn't act with malice,

225
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,630
I hope you won't be too harsh on her either.

226
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,679
I got it.

227
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,630
You're so compassionate toward her,

228
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,759
perhaps you should spend the wedding night with her instead.

229
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,311
It would spare me from all this pretense.

230
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,751
Why hasn't she shown up yet?

231
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,152
Could it be we've misunderstood her?

232
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:12,769
Maybe, like I once did, she doesn't actually

233
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,471
want to get married either.

234
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
She's here.

235
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,240
Five black pieces, Lu!

236
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
I win!

237
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,030
A bet is a bet.

238
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,630
Take off your cloth.

239
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,398
Fine.

240
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
My dear.

241
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,030
Lian Zhou?

242
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,351
What brings you here?

243
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
My dear, I've been looking all over for you.

244
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,071
Tonight is our wedding night.

245
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,620
Surely you don't mean for Mu Dan to keep you company instead?

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,351
Now that you've had your fill of drinks,

247
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,550
allow me to take you back

248
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,639
to our room to rest.

249
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,191
I'm not drunk!

250
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,231
I want Mu Dan to play dice with me!

251
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,351
I'm going to strip you naked today!

252
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,880
- My turn. - No, you've had your turn.

253
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,470
It's my turn now.

254
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
- Now, watch. - Since you enjoy it so much,

255
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,150
why don't I join in? Wouldn't that make it even more fun?

256
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,831
My dear, you may not know this,

257
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,071
but I'm quite the dice master.

258
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
That's great!

259
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,471
The more, the merrier!

260
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,919
Come, drink with me!

261
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,399
Are you alright, Lian Zhou?

262
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,630
My dear, you're drunk.

263
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,231
- Are you alright? - What a buzzkill.

264
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,520
- Oh no, are you about to throw up? - Get me the spittoon!

265
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,800
It's coming out.

266
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,390
Let's get you back to bed.

267
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,360
Lian Zhou, he's completely out of it.

268
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,270
You won't be able to manage him like this.

269
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,760
Careful, my dear. This way.

270
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,390
It's fine, I've got him.

271
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
- Easy. - I'm not drunk.

272
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,360
Lie down. I'll come later.

273
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Mu Dan...

274
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,920
Lian Zhou, even if you could manage to tend to him,

275
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,030
there's no way he could handle it tonight.

276
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,390
Go on now, get some rest. Wash up and call it a night.

277
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,280
He can get violent when he's drunk.

278
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,799
Better leave this to me.

279
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,879
Off you go, quick, quick.

280
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,440
- Play with me, Mu Dan. - Coming!

281
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,399
I'm here.

282
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,559
The dice...

283
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Let's keep playing.

284
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,711
On your very first night here, he's already ignoring you.

285
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,111
What are we going to do moving forward?

286
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,879
Don't panic.

287
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,351
I've seen a fair share of spoiled and fickle men like him.

288
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,256
They're constantly chasing new toys

289
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,870
and getting bored just as quickly.

290
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,280
He'll tire of He Wei Fang sooner or later.

291
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,112
A man like him

292
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:36,191
will never keep his heart on just one woman.

293
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,431
The key to securing my place here

294
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,911
is to bear him a child.

295
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:44,872
When that happens, whether it's swaying him under King Ning's orders

296
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,472
or the wealth and prestige in this household,

297
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,271
I can have it all.

298
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,990
Unlike fleeting affections,

299
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,952
money and land are the only things you can truly rely on,

300
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,201
wouldn't you agree?

301
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,031
You're right, Madam.

302
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,791
She should be gone now.

303
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Not so fast.

304
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,959
Just to be cautious,

305
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
let's wait a little longer.

306
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,751
Besides, I wanted to ask you something.

307
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,260
How many more carts of belongings are you taking to Fang Garden?

308
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:44,872
When are you moving?

309
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Tomorrow.

310
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,152
I know what you're thinking.

311
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,120
You're worried

312
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:04,020
I won't help you anymore.

313
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
Don't worry.

314
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,112
I'm not an ungrateful person.

315
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,360
I won't disappear on you during the move.

316
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
She's gone.

317
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,191
You saved my life.

318
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,592
A bottle of Peach Blossom Wine isn't enough to repay you.

319
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,201
I know you don't lack anything,

320
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,080
but I still want to show my gratitude.

321
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,533
So, I'm giving you 20% of Fang Garden's profits.

322
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,471
Here's the contract I drafted.

323
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:36,993
Take a look.

324
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,260
This is the first time you've been this generous, Miss Xiao Hua.

325
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,860
It's a side of you I'm not used to.

326
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,711
Every life is priceless.

327
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,280
And with your protection,

328
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,512
let's be honest, I'm the one coming out ahead.

329
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,234
Elite families rent the Fang Garden for

330
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:12,871
their banquets and garden parties every year.

331
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,711
It's bound to be a goldmine.

332
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,391
This business is a guaranteed profit.

333
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Excellent.

334
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,710
I don't intend to cater solely to the wealthy elite.

335
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,960
Whether it's common folk

336
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,832
or royalty,

337
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:28,678
as long as they pay the entrance fee,

338
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,113
everyone can enjoy the flowers, listen to music,

339
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:32,813
and indulge in fine food and drinks.

340
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:34,239
At Fang Garden,

341
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,512
anyone can savor a taste of elegance and charm.

342
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:43,361
What?

343
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,672
A blueprint of Fang Garden?

344
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,587
The layout of the covered corridors

345
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,193
and waterside pavilions is so well-arranged.

346
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:25,286
And the way the rock gardens complement the flowerbeds

347
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,367
is just perfect.

348
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,521
Where did you get this garden layout?

349
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,071
The Chief Overseer of Imperial Works owed me a favor.

350
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:34,774
When he heard about our wedding

351
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,093
and that you acquired Fang Garden,

352
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,864
he had the garden plans redesigned and sent them to me as a gift.

353
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,992
See if you like it.

354
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,680
If you don't, you can just throw it away.

355
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,660
I like it, no, I love it!

356
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,200
Being friends with the Flower Bird Envoy truly has its perks.

357
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,832
- Thanks. - Took you long enough to realize.

358
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,200
There are plenty of people who'd give anything to befriend me,

359
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,566
but I've never bothered with them.

360
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,952
So you'd better appreciate me.

361
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,720
Yes, yes, of course I do.

362
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:14,201
Well, I should go back to my room. Good night.

363
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,152
Yes, good night.

364
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Jiang Chang Yang.

365
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Thanks.

366
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:03,761
I'll take two boxes of Drunken Rouge.

367
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:05,841
Sorry, sorry.

368
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:07,711
It's our last two. It's sold out.

369
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,041
Please wait for the next batch.

370
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,720
Sorry, but we're completely out!

371
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,360
Ladies, listen,

372
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:17,720
we're currently preparing for the grand opening of Fang Garden.

373
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,841
It'll be ready by next spring.

374
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,321
At that time, not only will we have Drunken Rouge,

375
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,802
but also an array of new cosmetics,

376
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:26,081
and skilled ladies on-site to offer personalized makeup trials.

377
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,000
- Make-up trials? - Yes.

378
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,271
That's such a long wait!

379
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,912
But those who wait will have perks that others won't.

380
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,920
The first batch of garden tickets will be limited to just 100

381
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,281
and sold at half price.

382
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:38,832
Once sold out, that's it!

383
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,562
That's awesome! I want some tickets!

384
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:43,000
When the garden opens, you'll not only

385
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,271
get to admire the flowers, dine on exquisite feasts, and enjoy music,

386
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,361
but you'll also have the opportunity to learn

387
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,040
unique makeup techniques no one else has seen.

388
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:51,240
Next spring, all of Chang'an's beauty

389
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,672
will be reflected on your faces.

390
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
That's wonderful!

391
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:57,802
Plus, we'll have Hundred Blossom Brew ready for you,

392
00:22:57,882 --> 00:22:59,521
perfect for sipping as you stroll the garden

393
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:01,912
or taking home to share with loved ones.

394
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,392
I'll take two tickets!

395
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:04,720
Me too!

396
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,231
Everyone, over here.

397
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,420
Slowly now, no rush!

398
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,302
There's enough for everyone.

399
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:12,900
Tickets are available at this counter.

400
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:14,801
- I'll take the tickets! - Please line up!

401
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:16,912
- I'll take two! - Line up!

402
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,281
Please stay in line.

403
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:20,361
I'll take five tickets!

404
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,720
Intimidated by the county princess's threat,

405
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,031
those noble ladies didn't dare set foot in Blooming Abode before.

406
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,511
Now, it seems that hurdle has finally been cleared.

407
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:30,801
Yes, Thanks to you and Chun's treatment,

408
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:32,681
Consort Shu's health has been steadily improving.

409
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:35,361
The reputation of Blooming Abode has spread far and wide.

410
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,392
Plus, with all the new products and makeup styles we keep introducing,

411
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:40,791
those noble ladies have been itching to come by.

412
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,440
Now that they know you have a good rapport with Consort Shu,

413
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,400
they're confident they can hold their own against the county princess.

414
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,231
After all, the county princess wouldn't dare openly clash with a consort.

415
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:53,632
If the county princess hadn't forced me to the polo grounds that day,

416
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:55,361
I wouldn't have had the chance to meet Consort Shu.

417
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:57,632
Sometimes, fate works in such unexpected ways.

418
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:03,240
I'd like three tickets, please.

419
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
This is yours.

420
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,952
We've shared a chapter as neighbors.

421
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,904
And now you leave to pursue your aspirations.

422
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:14,912
Take care of yourself, and don't forget your old home.

423
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,780
May you return often, and don't forget it.

424
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,000
(To Mu Dan)

425
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,311
After being gone for so long,

426
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,992
you've finally shown up.

427
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,760
Just the other day, Mu Dan was wondering

428
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,031
when you'd return.

429
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,480
She even had the courtyard stocked with some dried fish for you.

430
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:22,601
Young Master,

431
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,711
Madam He hasn't returned.

432
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:28,791
And the last wooden cart has left from the back courtyard.

433
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,152
Since she is refurbishing the garden,

434
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,313
she will need decorative rocks.

435
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,311
I found a towering Lingbi rock for her, about the height of a person.

436
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:40,952
It will be delivered here later.

437
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:48,751
Have it delivered

438
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,231
to Fang Garden tomorrow along with this.

439
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,441
Consider it my housewarming gift to her.

440
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Yes, Young Master.

441
00:25:58,161 --> 00:25:59,161
Young Master,

442
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,031
if you're so reluctant to see her leave, why won't you ask her to stay?

443
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:05,991
Even a stray cat longs for boundless freedom.

444
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,632
What reason do I have

445
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
to ask her to stay?

446
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,112
But I've never seen you care for anyone like this before.

447
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:25,961
You're still here?

448
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:30,352
I just finalized the seedlings for Fang Garden.

449
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I just came back,

450
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
where would I be going?

451
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,320
I thought you were moving to Fang Garden.

452
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,533
This courtyard's practically been emptied out.

453
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,632
That's just Da Fu moving over to manage things.

454
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,192
I'm still staying here.

455
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:47,551
Didn't I just plant some new begonias?

456
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
I promised you

457
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,311
I'd make sure your backyard blooms beautifully.

458
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,071
What? Am I being a nuisance to you now?

459
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:57,881
Of course not. Young Master was reluctant to see...

460
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:00,152
I was reluctant to see my goldmine leave.

461
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,511
Da Fu did suggest I move with her,

462
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,040
but I figured since we had just...

463
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,071
We had just had our fake wedding.

464
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,641
Leaving you to deal with Lian Zhou all on your own

465
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
wouldn't be very loyal of me.

466
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Oh, by the way,

467
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,520
have you decided what flowers you want planted

468
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:27,800
in your residence next spring?

469
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:29,432
I should start cultivating them now.

470
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:31,672
Let me know once you decide on it.

471
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,432
When I'm done at the garden during the day,

472
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:36,760
I can come back in the evening to plant them for you.

473
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,480
Sure, I'll think about it.

474
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,751
I'll have Chuan Yu let you know tomorrow.

475
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:47,841
Burn that letter.

476
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:49,920
What letter? Someone wrote a letter?

477
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,160
How come I didn't hear about this?

478
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,961
What letter? Who wrote a letter?

479
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,432
We were talking about something else.

480
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,791
I think those begonias look great.

481
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,161
Maybe move a few to my courtyard.

482
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,320
Begonias don't suit you at all.

483
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,872
They are not for you.

484
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:18,841
And why is that?

485
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:21,711
Begonias are also called

486
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,592
"flowers of unspoken longing."

487
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,551
Do you even know what longing feels like?

488
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,392
But I've never seen you care for anyone like this before.

489
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:53,441
Mu Dan.

490
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,071
There is something on your nose.

491
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

492
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
Down.

493
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Lord Liu!

494
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Lord Liu!

495
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Lord Liu!

496
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,480
I didn't know my place and offended you before.

497
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,352
The blame is entirely mine.

498
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,551
I have elderly parents to support

499
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,961
and young children to raise.

500
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,912
Please show mercy

501
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:27,601
and spare me.

502
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,031
Oh, it's you, Official Ge.

503
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,872
I don't understand

504
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,551
what you're talking about.

505
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:41,352
You were flogged for embezzlement and negligence.

506
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,632
Your punishment and dismissal were according to the law.

507
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,832
What does that have to do with me?

508
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,680
Lord Liu! Lord Liu!

509
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Please!

510
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,311
Please show mercy.

511
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:55,681
Please give me another chance.

512
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:59,511
I'll forever be indebted to your kindness.

513
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,112
Official Ge, if you're truly sincere,

514
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,912
why don't you start by drinking every last drop

515
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,112
of the dirty water in this horse trough?

516
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,551
And live and work in the stables from now on.

517
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:17,231
If you can serve with that level of dedication,

518
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:20,031
perhaps I could consider recommending you

519
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,791
for a lowly stablehand position.

520
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Lord Liu!

521
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Lord Liu!

522
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:31,841
Lord Liu!

523
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,471
Zi Shu, it's rare for you to come home.

524
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,952
And you even cooked for us yourself

525
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
We appreciate it.

526
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:46,672
If it weren't for my birthday today,

527
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:49,511
I doubt he'd even remember this family exists.

528
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:54,031
Father, that's not quite fair now, is it?

529
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:57,751
Since I've married into King Ning's family,

530
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,031
King Ning's Residence is my only home now.

531
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,271
How could I come here so easily?

532
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,751
It was not like I wanted to abandon you that day.

533
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,271
His Lordship would kill us if I had said no.

534
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:13,791
You're married now.

535
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,961
How much longer are you going to resent me?

536
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,432
As long as you keep the county princess happy,

537
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,751
you'll never have to worry about power or fortune again.

538
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:24,961
Zi Shu,

539
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,592
your father has thought it all out for you.

540
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,071
We'll find you a couple of lovely maidservants to keep here.

541
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:32,071
When they bear your children,

542
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,293
we will send them to be raised in some distant place.

543
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,271
No matter how powerful King Ning may be,

544
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,832
he can't live forever.

545
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
When the time comes,

546
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,361
you can come home, and we will be family again.

547
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:51,952
Stop calling me a family.

548
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:54,112
Tell me, Father, Mother,

549
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,760
have you ever thought of me as a living, breathing person

550
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,952
who feels joy and sorrow?

551
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:06,912
We gave you life, raised you,

552
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,086
and provided you with the finest clothes and food...

553
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,111
To save your own lives

554
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,241
and chase after wealth and power,

555
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,150
you sold me off to King Ning.

556
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,056
Where were you

557
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:25,064
when they broke my leg?

558
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:29,361
Where were you when I starved myself in the dungeon

559
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:30,752
to resist the marriage?

560
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,853
You were counting those 20 chests of betrothal gifts!

561
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,272
I've lived with less freedom than your dog!

562
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:41,312
Zi Shu, how could you talk to...

563
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:45,752
- Zi Shu! - You wanted a son who would bring you power and glory,

564
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,281
but as parents, you are groveling, spineless, and utterly heartless,

565
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:50,432
so I'm cutting ties with you!

566
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:52,561
Master! Are you alright?

567
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:54,392
Do you know what you were

568
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:56,471
just so happily feasting on?

569
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,591
It's the same as I was,

570
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,872
something you've bled dry and crushed.

571
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Savor that taste.

572
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,031
You'll never forget it for the rest of your lives.

573
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,110
Madam!

574
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,551
Madam, wake up!

575
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,401
Pat her.

576
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Madam!

577
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,471
You're now the master of a garden

578
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,151
and the owner of two shops,

579
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:40,846
why are you still out here digging and weeding yourself?

580
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:42,721
Take a break.

581
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:02,881
You know,

582
00:36:03,321 --> 00:36:04,631
although I'm a native of Luoyang,

583
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,872
my mother went into early labor while visiting Chang'an

584
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:10,832
to see relatives.

585
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,646
I was born right here in Fang Garden.

586
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,232
What a twist of fate.

587
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:18,921
It feels like destiny.

588
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,240
When I was little, Mother often brought me here to visit family.

589
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:28,232
So many of our spring days were spent right here.

590
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:30,441
Back then,

591
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:32,671
all the peonies in this garden

592
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:35,000
were planted by Mother and me together.

593
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,832
Including this osmanthus tree.

594
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:47,961
Later,

595
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:49,832
as my father's business grew,

596
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:51,921
life became busier,

597
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,232
and after my grandmother passed,

598
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,752
we stopped coming as often.

599
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,591
Children grow up,

600
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:02,952
and parents grow old,

601
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:05,312
it happens in the blink of an eye.

602
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:09,591
Now that Mother's gone,

603
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:12,761
everything feels so different.

604
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,151
Well, this tree is still here,

605
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:19,881
isn't it?

606
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:28,191
When we first planted it, it wasn't even half my height.

607
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:30,841
Now it's thriving, full of blossoms and leaves.

608
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,912
And you're doing well too.

609
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:39,712
Watching from above,

610
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:41,832
Mother would surely be proud.

611
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:49,520
Since we're already reminiscing,

612
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,761
I should help out with the weeding tonight.

613
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,526
Have you ever done this kind of work?

614
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Ever even held a hoe?

615
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:01,865
Don't underestimate me.

616
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,312
How hard can weeding be?

617
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:07,031
Alright, let's see how you manage.

618
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
You're pretty strong.

619
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:24,471
What did you hit?

620
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
What is that?

621
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:56,881
Easy.

622
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:02,232
"May my daughter Wei Fang

623
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:04,232
find true love

624
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,232
and a lifetime of happiness."

625
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,151
It's Mother.

626
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:15,752
She buried this for me.

627
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:28,872
She once told me

628
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:33,752
that when my grandmother gave birth to her,

629
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:37,480
she buried nu'er hong wine in this garden for her.

630
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,551
I didn't know she'd do the same for me.

631
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:46,191
She must have hoped

632
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,191
to share this wine with me

633
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,111
on my wedding day.

634
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:57,281
It's a shame...

635
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
It's not a shame.

636
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:15,401
We just got married.

637
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,726
This wine couldn't have come at a better time.

638
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,560
Clearly,

639
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:23,232
Mother is watching over us from above,

640
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,281
making sure her son-in-law is the one to dig it up.

641
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:33,801
Son-in-law?

642
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:37,321
You've really seen yourself as her son-in-law, huh?

643
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:39,631
Son-in-law or not,

644
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,912
we have to finish this wine now.

645
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
Why is it leaking?

646
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,480
Oh no, no! We can't let it go to waste!

647
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:56,392
Go grab the bowls.

648
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,591
I got them.

649
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,030
Slow down!

650
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:05,321
Don't waste it.

651
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:07,952
I'll share some with you.

652
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,786
Is it still leaking underneath?

653
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,240
Slow down! Slow, slow!

654
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
I'll drink it like this.

655
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,039
This is the wine my mother left for me.

656
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,642
You can't finish it! Give it to me.

657
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:25,031
Didn't you say it's a wedding wine?

658
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Give it back.

659
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,871
How could I let the bride drink it alone?

660
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Give it back!

661
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,432
Don't drink it all!

662
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:34,991
Don't finish it!

663
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:38,120
Give it back, I'm not kidding!

664
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:39,281
Mother left it for me!

665
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:40,480
- Stop! - Alright, alright.

666
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,832
- Careful, don't spill it! - Let's put it here.
