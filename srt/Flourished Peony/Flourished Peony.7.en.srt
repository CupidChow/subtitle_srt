1
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:35,600
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:39,120
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,640
You should've agreed earlier.

4
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,640
If so, you didn't need to suffer.

5
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,560
I can choose to be your concubine.

6
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:54,240
But I can't just do the deed
with you tonight for no reason.

7
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:58,840
I want you to invite two tables
of guests to the shop tomorrow.

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,680
At least the neighborhood
will hear about it.

9
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:10,720
That's not an issue.

10
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:19,480
Spend the night in the wine cellar today.

11
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:22,605
You're not allowed to
leave before our wedding.

12
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll tell Wu Niang to give
you a bath tomorrow.

13
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,440
As for your injuries,

14
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,280
we can cover them up

15
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,120
with some rouge.

16
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,840
Let's go!

17
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,615
Wu Niang, there's something on your hair...

18
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,560
What's wrong?

19
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:19,680
Wu Niang, you wish to chase Mu Dan away,

20
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,240
am I right?

21
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:54,760
Before this, you picked on me on purpose.

22
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,960
You wanted to chase me away.

23
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,200
In reality, you were
trying to rescue me, right?

24
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,880
I assume

25
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,727
you've known the kind
of animal Wang Qing is

26
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:08,880
after last night, huh?

27
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:17,720
He abuses people after he gets drunk.

28
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:20,928
Since he's afraid that it
might ruin his business,

29
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,240
he only targets concealed areas.

30
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,520
If I dare to cry or scream,

31
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,400
he'll abuse me even more.

32
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:45,520
I'll stop doing it!

33
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:55,280
You wouldn't have been injured again

34
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:57,800
if it weren't for me.

35
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,480
I realized that too late.

36
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,120
Wang Qing is an expert at pretending.

37
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,788
He always appears kind and
benevolent in front of outsiders.

38
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:09,810
Forget about you,

39
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:13,904
even our neighbors, who had spent
many years living right next to us,

40
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,920
had no idea about it.

41
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:23,640
Mu Dan, you're not his first victim.

42
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,080
You won't be his last victim either.

43
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,422
So, has he married other
girls forcefully as well?

44
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:35,880
You think he married them?

45
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:38,344
He just deceives girls and
toys with them for a few days.

46
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:41,720
Once he's tired of them, he'll sell
them off to Pingkang Pleasure House.

47
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:46,920
You had a chance

48
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:50,000
to escape before this.

49
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,920
But now,

50
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:55,600
it's too late.

51
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:00,344
It's not too late.

52
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,680
It's not too late as long
as you wish to leave.

53
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:08,240
It's pointless to stay
with a husband like him.

54
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,640
Wu Niang,

55
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:13,920
leave together with me.

56
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,673
Report it to the authorities
and request a divorce.

57
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:17,978
This way, you won't need to
stand his torment any longer.

58
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,320
Back then, our family was
too poor to buy any food.

59
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:31,200
Father married me off to
Wang Qing for ten dan of rice.

60
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,560
Those ten dan of rice

61
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,360
had ruined my life.

62
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm his official wife.

63
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,240
No matter where I escape to,

64
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:46,200
he'll catch me back.

65
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:48,880
He won't let me off.

66
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm already terrified of his beating.

67
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:58,520
I no longer wish to struggle.

68
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,503
Even if you're willing
to submit to your fate,

69
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm not.

70
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:09,760
So what?

71
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:12,480
The walls at the back
are too high to scale.

72
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,400
If you leave through the front door,
Wang Qing will definitely catch you.

73
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,280
By then, he'll beat you up again.

74
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,160
What's the point?

75
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,760
Just wear this.

76
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:46,679
Don't move!

77
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:50,800
Wu Niang, I don't wish to hurt you.

78
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,000
Please don't make a sound.

79
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,720
There's no way in hell

80
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:57,960
I'll get married to Wang Qing.

81
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,320
Don't do it!

82
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,640
Let me help you escape.

83
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,840
Wu Niang, let's leave together.

84
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,720
I'm Wang Qing's official wife.

85
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,025
There's no escape.

86
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:09,379
I've already accepted my fate.

87
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:12,840
You're different from me. You still
have a chance to escape. Go now.

88
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,800
Here! Step on my shoulders!

89
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,360
Darned wretch! How dare you foil my plan?

90
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,200
You're something else.

91
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,920
You're asking for it, aren't you?

92
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,400
I'll take you to the marital chamber now.

93
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,920
Wu Niang! Let's go!

94
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:51,400
Stop right there!

95
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,760
Run!

96
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,631
- Get up! - Run!

97
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:57,680
- Get out of my way! - Mu Dan, run!

98
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:58,944
Get up! Come back!

99
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,511
- Run! - Get out of my way!

100
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:02,360
- Mu Dan, run! - Get out of my way!

101
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:04,200
Get up!

102
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:07,120
Help!

103
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,396
- The owner of the tavern is trying to kill me!
- What are you doing?

104
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,540
- Help! - What's going on?

105
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:12,960
Help! The owner of the
tavern is trying to kill me!

106
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,617
- Whose bride is that?
- She ran away with my money!

107
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,587
- He's trying to kill me!
- How dare you report me first?

108
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:17,839
Wang Qing is trying to kill me!

109
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,400
Guys, catch her for me!

110
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,641
Hurry and catch her!

111
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:23,640
The owner of the tavern
is beating his employee up!

112
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,560
Hurry and catch her!

113
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:26,928
- Stop right there! - Help!

114
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,454
- Stop right there! - Help!

115
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:31,215
- Stop her! - He's trying to abduct me!

116
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,016
Help!

117
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,520
Stop right there!

118
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,469
- Hurry and stop her!
- He's trying to abduct me!

119
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,824
- Help! - Stop her!

120
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:41,328
- Help! - Stop right there!

121
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:42,520
Help!

122
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,620
Help!

123
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:46,160
Help!

124
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,040
Miss, are you okay?

125
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:51,400
Cousin Wen Qing?

126
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:53,160
Mu Dan?

127
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,000
What are you looking at?

128
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,520
I heard wrongly.

129
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:06,790
Sui Zhi, don't tell me you caught
the eye of a charming belle?

130
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:08,240
Are you trying to escape from her?

131
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:09,920
That's not it.

132
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,000
But that person does owe me a debt.

133
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:15,544
Who exactly is daring enough

134
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:16,920
to owe you money?

135
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:21,080
A few days ago, I encountered
a strange girl in Luoyang.

136
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,640
She has a sharp mind and a silver tongue.

137
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,422
Initially, I wanted her
to be my accountant.

138
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:27,520
However, she didn't like the notion.

139
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:30,840
Back then, she risked
her life to obtain freedom.

140
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,400
I wonder if she's leading
the life she desires.

141
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:38,000
It's rare for you to talk
about a girl like this.

142
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,951
Sui Zhi, with your means, you
could've tamed her and made her yours.

143
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,207
A beautiful peony flower is
blooming and swaying with the wind.

144
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,440
It's no fun if I pick it by force.

145
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,120
See you.

146
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:53,660
(Fugui Pavilion)

147
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:56,519
- Cousin! - What's wrong?

148
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,601
- What's with the sorry state?
- Cousin, it's him!

149
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,040
I went to work in his tavern.

150
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,600
He detained me by force.

151
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,280
He forced me to get married to him.

152
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:05,040
Nonsense!

153
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:08,520
My Lord, you have no idea.

154
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:11,480
This girl is a slave who tried to escape.

155
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,640
My head is bleeding because of her.

156
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,520
- Do not believe her words.
- Speak for yourself.

157
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,353
I'm the supervisor of the Imperial Academy.

158
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:21,200
This is my cousin. How
could she be your slave?

159
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,679
Seems like Mu Dan wasn't lying.

160
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,280
You're up to no good indeed.

161
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:27,040
Listen up! The laws of Chang'an
won't tolerate your insolence!

162
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,551
You're a man!

163
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:30,993
How dare you bully a girl like
her! You mustn't be spared!

164
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,456
We have to give him a beating today!

165
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,653
We'll stand up for your cousin!

166
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,200
Don't do it!

167
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,703
The law will punish him for his crimes.

168
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:39,720
We mustn't inflict our
own punishments on him.

169
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:41,791
What about this? You can
report this to the authorities.

170
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:43,192
- Let the authorities arrest him. - Okay.

171
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:44,686
Let's surround him, but do not hurt him.

172
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,848
- Come. Let's surround him. - No!

173
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,080
Don't do it!

174
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:48,880
Don't do this.

175
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:51,320
It was my fault for not recognizing her.

176
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:52,960
It's just a misunderstanding.

177
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:55,160
It's just a misunderstanding.

178
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:59,400
Mu Dan, it'll be
terrible if the authorities

179
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:00,920
hears about this.

180
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:03,680
Please be generous

181
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:05,640
and spare me for once.

182
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:08,996
- What do you mean by that? - Cousin.

183
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,737
I don't want to press
the matter any further.

184
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,800
Let's leave for now.

185
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,480
I couldn't explain myself to you

186
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,800
as I was trying to
escape from him just now.

187
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,120
Cousin, you'll understand
why after I tell you everything.

188
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,000
Due to my household register,

189
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:33,591
I cannot meet the local
authorities together with Wang Qing.

190
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,840
It must've been tough on you.

191
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,800
The Liu family has done
something truly despicable.

192
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,040
All these years of education
were wasted on them.

193
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,896
Mu Dan, you made the right
choice by getting a divorce.

194
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,280
Your reputation is clean.

195
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,600
You shouldn't be together
with a scoundrel like him.

196
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,680
Cousin, you're keen and open-minded.

197
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,440
You're unlike any ordinary man,

198
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:00,480
who are usually prejudiced against women.

199
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm grateful to you for that.

200
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,720
Cousin, I have a favor to ask of you.

201
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:15,280
I wonder if you can do me this favor.

202
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,960
We're cousins.

203
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,560
Just tell me

204
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,080
what you need.

205
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,560
Due to my household register,

206
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,680
it's difficult for me to make a living.

207
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:29,120
Cousin, you're a member of the officialdom.

208
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,576
I wonder if you can forge
a household register for me

209
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
so that I can...

210
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,120
No!

211
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,860
The laws of the nation cannot be
disregarded for personal reasons.

212
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,160
Mu Dan,

213
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:41,880
I can agree

214
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,440
to any of your other requests.

215
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,135
This is the only request

216
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,800
I cannot agree to.

217
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:52,360
Cousin, you still follow
the rules and walk the line

218
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,040
just like when you were young.

219
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:57,080
I was too abrupt.

220
00:14:57,223 --> 00:14:58,880
I shouldn't have put you on the spot.

221
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:00,240
It's fine.

222
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,800
Mu Dan, just stay here.

223
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,696
Don't worry. I'll surely
take good care of you.

224
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,200
I won't let you suffer again.

225
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:09,720
Cousin, I haven't had a single bite

226
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,440
since last night.

227
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm a little hungry.

228
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:15,408
I was negligent.

229
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,061
I'll prepare some food for you.

230
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Wait here.

231
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:30,496
Mu Dan.

232
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:35,847
Mu Dan?

233
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,328
(Your mother fell out with mine because)

234
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,960
(my mother got married to a merchant.)

235
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:55,296
(Cousin, I don't want to
make things difficult for you.)

236
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,080
(If your mother writes to my father, )

237
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,080
(I'm afraid the Liu family will
catch me and torture me to death.)

238
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:05,644
(Cousin, please keep this a secret.)

239
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:09,320
(Once I've established
a foothold in Chang'an, )

240
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:12,364
(I'll definitely write to you again.)

241
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,240
(Do not miss me.)

242
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,480
(Mu Dan.)

243
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,120
It's midnight!

244
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,440
It's midnight!

245
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:43,760
Mu Dan, run!

246
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:46,480
You!

247
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,480
I wonder how Wu Niang

248
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:52,520
is doing right now.

249
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,790
Yu Lu.

250
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:32,440
Are you seeing this?

251
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:38,080
The Jade Orchid is blooming.

252
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,094
(Imperial Academy)

253
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,143
Aren't you the second son
of the Minister of Revenue?

254
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:23,040
Send my regards to your father.

255
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,480
Fourth son of Minister
Zhang, the Minister of War,

256
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,000
tell your father

257
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,360
that I liked the Longgao Liquor he gave me.

258
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,200
Thank him on my behalf.

259
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,160
Brat, this is a place of etiquette.

260
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:39,800
How dare a clown like
you make so much noise?

261
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,920
If all of you aren't calm and focused,

262
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:46,640
how can you guys hope to succeed?

263
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:48,200
Hurry and return to your positions!

264
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:55,360
Flower Bird Envoy,

265
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:57,987
why are you causing a commotion
in the Imperial Academy?

266
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,400
Lord Xu?

267
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,055
- Xu Ji Jiu?
- Master's pavilion is right ahead.

268
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,920
Please stay here and do not interrupt him.

269
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,480
Xu Ji Jiu?

270
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:11,280
Lord Xu?

271
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:12,840
Lord Xu!

272
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:14,583
His Majesty is sick.

273
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,440
Please approve his leave.

274
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,750
You're acting as if you're
applying for his leave.

275
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,640
But in reality, you're just
notifying me that he's not coming.

276
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:27,960
I heard that you presented an artist
who performed with monkeys to him.

277
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,680
His Majesty was so happy

278
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:31,880
that he made him an assistant minister.

279
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:36,120
If His Majesty still has any
regard for me as his tutor,

280
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:37,800
he would never entertain

281
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:39,720
your audacious behavior!

282
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,937
His Majesty was led
astray by villains like you.

283
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,880
It's all my fault.

284
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,434
Lord Xu has a deep misunderstanding
toward His Majesty because of me.

285
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,720
If I don't explain myself,

286
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,504
and Lord Xu and His Majesty
were divided because of this,

287
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,080
it'll all be my fault.

288
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,320
His Majesty fell sick because he
spent too much time on state affairs.

289
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:58,680
He felt very guilty.

290
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,737
He summoned King Ning to
assist him in managing state affairs.

291
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,742
Lord Xu, don't worry.

292
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,880
This is a 100-year-old ginseng.

293
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:08,840
If you take it, you'll live
for another 50 years.

294
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:11,166
His Majesty cannot live without you.

295
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,400
What kind of book should
be used to teach a person

296
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,520
with such a sweet tongue
and a venomous heart?

297
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,640
I recommend the Book of Documents.

298
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,030
There are not enough words in the book.

299
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,880
The Rites of Zhou is a good choice.

300
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,198
"The king determines the
regions and fixes the positions."

301
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:27,998
"To help the king to regulate
the fiefdoms and the state."

302
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:29,543
"Either sit and discuss the Way,"

303
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:31,000
"or act and practice it."

304
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,947
"The six duties, ritual,
education, governance,"

305
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:34,371
"law, administration, and affairs,"

306
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:36,623
"none of these should be neglected."

307
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:38,745
"I would advise you, to balance the
people and regulate the use of wealth,"

308
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,920
"but not to indulge in
excessive luxury yourself."

309
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:43,821
"I would advise you, to harmonize
the people and nurture all things,"

310
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,280
"but not to let the ruler
neglect state affairs."

311
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:47,702
- Lord Xu! - You unkind,

312
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:50,351
- Lord Xu!
- Disrespectful, improper, incapable,

313
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:53,057
- Lord Xu! - lawless and indistinct person!

314
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:54,434
How dare you comfortably
reside in the imperial court?

315
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,720
You!

316
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,751
You're utterly shameless!

317
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:05,160
The Imperial Academy is
a pure and sacred place!

318
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,905
In the future, if any corrupt officials

319
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,560
were to visit us again,

320
00:22:08,848 --> 00:22:10,240
do not let them in!

321
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Yes, sir.

322
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:23,800
He's abandoning an
excellent ginseng like this.

323
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:27,000
He must be courting death.

324
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:32,800
Let's go.

325
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:50,360
The stamens and petals have
a green jade-like color to them.

326
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:52,360
This is an excellent plant.

327
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,312
Can you actually bear to part with it?

328
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:56,520
This plant has a special meaning to me.

329
00:22:56,728 --> 00:22:58,480
I hope that it can thrive here.

330
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:01,600
I'll redeem it in the future
once I've made enough money.

331
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:03,480
Miss, if you lack money,

332
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:06,680
why don't you just pawn the
white jade pendant you're wearing?

333
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:08,320
It's much more valuable.

334
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,280
The thing I desire

335
00:23:12,552 --> 00:23:15,320
can be exchanged for a pot of Jade Orchid.

336
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:18,640
Miss, seems like you're
not here to seek wealth.

337
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,440
What do you desire, then?

338
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,680
I want

339
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,320
a female household register.

340
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,831
You should head to the
Ministry of Revenue, then.

341
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,535
We're not capable enough to do it for you.

342
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:38,144
I've been inquiring about you
guys in Chang'an for some time.

343
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,643
Everyone said that Wanguan
Hall has an excellent reputation.

344
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,168
It's because all things can be sought

345
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:43,760
without questioning the one who comes.

346
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:46,672
When I saw the animal-head
jade carvings placed in the hall,

347
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:49,960
I knew that I had come to the right place.

348
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:52,080
With Wanguan Hall's wealth,

349
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:54,328
having such jade carvings
is nothing out of the ordinary.

350
00:23:54,352 --> 00:23:55,960
Miss, what makes you say so?

351
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:58,240
But those aren't any
ordinary jade carvings.

352
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:02,061
They are of exquisite color, which
are only meant for the royal family.

353
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,000
I have no intention of offending you all.

354
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:10,431
I'm just here to seek
something with an earnest heart.

355
00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:13,200
I'm willing to redeem my plant
with twice the price in the future.

356
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:15,612
Shopkeeper, isn't that a good deal?

357
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:17,567
Miss, you have sharp eyes.

358
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,840
We can negotiate a deal.

359
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,969
But for your plant, we can only
negotiate a deal using a withered one.

360
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:25,936
It's not like I'm trying to take
away your beloved plant from you.

361
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,680
But flowers are living plants.

362
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,440
If it's a withered one, we can
proceed with the deal immediately.

363
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,200
But if it's alive,

364
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,147
if the plant dies on us

365
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,112
before you gather
enough money to redeem it,

366
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:38,520
we'll be in for a terrible deal.

367
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:40,880
But the plant has to be alive.

368
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:43,440
Shopkeeper, regarding your concerns,

369
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:46,560
I can come and tend to
the plant from time to time.

370
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:48,520
I won't let it wither.

371
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,400
What about this?

372
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,597
Miss, you should follow
me to the inner chamber.

373
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,480
I have to ask the owner

374
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,464
whether we should
proceed with the deal or not.

375
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:04,544
Shopkeeper, sorry for the trouble.

376
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:05,800
Miss, please.

377
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,008
(There's nothing in the
room that emits fragrance.)

378
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:28,720
(Where is the fragrant smell coming from?)

379
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,480
Who's laughing?

380
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,980
It's rare to see such a beauty!

381
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:53,869
Miss, you do resemble a goddess!

382
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:55,008
I...

383
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:57,143
Don't go overboard.

384
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:05,120
Miss, you have a clear mind and sharp eyes.

385
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,800
You're also skilled in tending to flowers.

386
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:11,200
Wouldn't it be a shame

387
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,541
if I don't let you work for me?

388
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,200
The owner of Wanguan Hall

389
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:20,520
does live up to her reputation.

390
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,640
You're mysterious and unpredictable.

391
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:26,200
You have an ethereal voice as well.

392
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,540
I'm sure you look just as
good as your voice sounds.

393
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,481
You must be kind and beautiful.

394
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm sure you won't make
things difficult for me.

395
00:26:34,955 --> 00:26:36,136
As for our deal...

396
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:39,280
Let's put the deal aside for now.

397
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:44,925
I'm quite interested in you.

398
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:53,396
I'm just a nobody.

399
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:56,960
Shop owner, what do you mean by that?

400
00:26:57,573 --> 00:26:59,212
You do not

401
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:00,920
have a household register.

402
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:03,440
You're known as a slave.

403
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:04,920
Miss,

404
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,708
from now on,

405
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:10,600
you should work for my shop.

406
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:15,800
You see,

407
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,120
I don't worth much.

408
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:20,960
But the Jade Orchid?

409
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:23,960
You can't buy it even if you're wealthy.

410
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:27,160
Since this is our first encounter,

411
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,840
why don't we

412
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,452
talk about

413
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:32,560
the deal first?

414
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:37,640
Stop right there!

415
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:39,359
He Wei Fang!

416
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,435
Flower Bird Envoy?

417
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:49,113
Don't you want your household register?

418
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,240
Just now...

419
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,423
Were you the one playing
a trick on me just now?

420
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:58,240
What do you mean by that?

421
00:27:58,447 --> 00:28:00,400
You barged into my shop first.

422
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:03,200
No wonder Wanguan Hall can get its hands

423
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:04,880
on everything in the world.

424
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:07,640
So, you're the shop owner.

425
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:10,480
But according to the law,

426
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:13,040
officials cannot do any kind of business.

427
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:15,480
They might be able to
stop the others, but not me.

428
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,924
As for you, I'll just keep you here.

429
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,740
Lord Jiang, you know this too.
I always keep my mouth shut.

430
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:24,956
Please stop joking around.

431
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,883
But when I was in the room,

432
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:31,520
which female spirit was trying to...

433
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,780
I mean, which girl was trying to scare me?

434
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,640
It didn't sound like Shopkeeper Yun.

435
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:49,024
So, it was Chuan Yu, huh?

436
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,800
My bodyguard is equipped
with many useful skills.

437
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:55,400
Ventriloquism isn't that big of a deal.

438
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:57,614
Miss He,

439
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:59,772
our lord merely wanted to tease you.

440
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,560
But you were ruthless.

441
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:04,855
Sorry for the offense.

442
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:06,560
It was a misunderstanding.

443
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,000
I thought this was a shady shop.

444
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:11,008
Luckily, there was a
cup of tea in the room.

445
00:29:11,136 --> 00:29:13,280
If not, I would've removed my hairpin

446
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:14,800
and stabbed the hole with it.

447
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,820
Lord Jiang, I almost lost
my eyes because of you.

448
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:22,360
Ouch! It hurts!

449
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,760
Miss He, I'm afraid my eyes were
injured because of what you did.

450
00:29:26,192 --> 00:29:27,192
As if.

451
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,391
I didn't know cold tea
could scald one's eyes.

452
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:30,592
Keep up the act.

453
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:43,680
Wanguan Hall values rarity the most.

454
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:47,040
The Jade Orchid is a new plant
that my mother and I had cultivated.

455
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:50,120
It can be considered a rare species.

456
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:52,360
But you want 20 pots of them

457
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:54,400
in exchange for a clean household register?

458
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,760
Lord Jiang,

459
00:29:56,904 --> 00:29:59,160
don't you think that you're
going overboard here?

460
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:01,680
You're the one seeking my favor.

461
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:05,217
A clean household register can't
be bought with mere money either.

462
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:07,720
I'm the only one who
can acquire it for you.

463
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,503
- But Lord Jiang...
- Allowing you to keep the plant alive

464
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:14,487
and repaying your debt in the future
is already the best I can do for you.

465
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:17,895
I would never accept this deal

466
00:30:18,168 --> 00:30:21,600
if my flower-loving aunt didn't
intend to visit Chang'an soon.

467
00:30:22,927 --> 00:30:23,927
Don't forget.

468
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:26,731
You still owe me the reward for
getting rid of the crooks in your life.

469
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:28,080
20 pots of flowers

470
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:30,040
sounds reasonable to me.

471
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:34,800
To be honest,

472
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,840
Lord Jiang, the Liu family turned on me

473
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,740
right after you left.

474
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:40,872
Not only did they not
return my dowries to me,

475
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,416
but they also tried to assassinate me.

476
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:45,476
That's why I escaped to
Chang'an without a single cent.

477
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:48,752
You said you got rid of
the crooks in my life for me.

478
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,109
But I don't think you did a good job at it.

479
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:53,520
Why don't you help me out until the end?

480
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:55,320
What about ten pots?

481
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,762
You managed to escape
from the Liu Residence.

482
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,537
But why did you come
all the way to Chang'an

483
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:01,760
instead of returning to your hometown?

484
00:31:04,817 --> 00:31:06,897
I don't want to make
things difficult for my father.

485
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:09,120
I don't want him to get involved.

486
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,421
Since I'm competent, I
should make my own living.

487
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:17,251
It's good to harbor lofty aspirations.

488
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:20,680
It's a shame that the means you
employed weren't good enough.

489
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:22,280
You're an escapee.

490
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,247
Even if you do get a
fake household register,

491
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,311
aren't you afraid that your family
members might take you back by force?

492
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:33,320
I'll enjoy my freedom

493
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:35,080
one day at a time, then.

494
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,120
Lord Jiang,

495
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,280
please show mercy.

496
00:31:42,424 --> 00:31:44,400
I'm already showing you mercy.

497
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,400
Take it or leave it.

498
00:31:50,663 --> 00:31:51,840
Chuan Yu.

499
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:55,760
I didn't say I wouldn't sign it.

500
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,080
I didn't say I wouldn't.

501
00:31:58,695 --> 00:31:59,920
I'll sign it now.

502
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,979
But I can't write down my name

503
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:07,880
before the household register is ready.

504
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,279
I'll put my thumbprint on it first.

505
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:18,080
Please take a look.

506
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:26,613
All right. Come back at the
same time tomorrow to retrieve it.

507
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,040
Why are you following me?

508
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:38,759
Last time, I lost my jade abacus

509
00:32:38,864 --> 00:32:40,960
in order to make a household register.

510
00:32:41,096 --> 00:32:43,397
This time, I can't afford to
lose anything else again.

511
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,634
You're saying out loud
that you don't trust me, huh?

512
00:32:46,658 --> 00:32:48,840
Are you afraid of me or not?

513
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:51,483
That's not it. You helped
me to win the trial back then.

514
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,560
Naturally, I believe
that you won't harm me.

515
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:55,120
Why are you following me, then?

516
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,016
I'm just afraid that you
might forget about it

517
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:02,201
because you have so many
state affairs to attend to.

518
00:33:04,328 --> 00:33:05,607
I'll follow you silently.

519
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,768
Don't worry. I won't utter a single word.

520
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,360
- You won't utter a single word? - I won't.

521
00:33:12,703 --> 00:33:15,365
Just treat it as an accessory.

522
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,760
You want me to bring
another accessory with me?

523
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:23,476
They're heavy, you know?

524
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,304
Waiter, get us two more pots!

525
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:36,333
Yes, sir!

526
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,680
Coming!

527
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:45,124
How fortunate am I,

528
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:47,200
to meet such a noble person?

529
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:48,961
Having seen this gentleman,

530
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:51,080
how can one not be pleased?

531
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:54,086
I wish to share this cup with you

532
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:56,304
to fulfill a long-held wish.

533
00:33:56,423 --> 00:33:58,360
Excellent poem!

534
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,680
Excellent!

535
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,440
Let me recite a poem as well!

536
00:34:04,624 --> 00:34:07,120
Let us set wine on the high hall

537
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:09,621
to welcome our esteemed guests.

538
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:12,160
May you drink this,

539
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,880
and may all things go as you wish.

540
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,550
Forget it.

541
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:21,920
If I don't let you speak,

542
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:23,840
I suppose you'll die of boredom.

543
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Thank you, Lord Jiang.

544
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,880
Actually, there's one
thing I don't understand.

545
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:31,696
Aren't we supposed to make household
registers at the Ministry of Revenue?

546
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,560
Why are we at a dance house instead?

547
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:38,066
Director of the Ministry of
Revenue will come here every day

548
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,640
after paying the stipends.

549
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:42,055
I wouldn't need to rush all the
way here to get his official seal

550
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,901
had you not rushed
me to finish the process.

551
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,640
I was thinking that I could rest at ease

552
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:51,960
as soon as I'm done with
the household register.

553
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:55,600
Naturally, I wanted you

554
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:57,920
to rest at ease as soon
as possible as well.

555
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,920
Excellent!

556
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:03,160
Both the dance and tune were amazing!

557
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:11,087
The dance house is
filled with male customers.

558
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,920
Won't you feel uneasy?

559
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,040
Not a single soul here knows me anyway.

560
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:20,040
What about me?

561
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:23,296
To me,

562
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,679
you're the God of Wealth.

563
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,160
You're a noble figure.

564
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,040
You and your honeyed words.

565
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:40,792
My Lord,

566
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:43,600
I've completed the task
as per your instructions.

567
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,280
It's time for you to sign

568
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:47,904
the IOU with your thumbprint on it.

569
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,320
You do own the yamen, huh?

570
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:54,773
Lord Jiang, I'm utterly impressed

571
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:56,480
by your efficiency.

572
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:02,760
Jiang Xiao Hua.

573
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:04,560
Are you satisfied?

574
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,034
(Jiang Xiao Hua)

575
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,280
I am.

576
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:18,800
I am.

577
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:34,760
Please take a look.

578
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,560
Keep it.

579
00:36:46,392 --> 00:36:47,648
- Come! - Dear, don't do this!

580
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,952
- Go inside! - No!

581
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:51,015
- I know my fault now!
- What's with the ruckus?

582
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,360
Dear, don't do this!

583
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,400
- Come! - Don't do this!

584
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,440
Get up! Come!

585
00:36:57,776 --> 00:36:59,080
Come!

586
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:03,360
How dare you disobey me?

587
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:05,318
How dare you let her escape?

588
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,120
You forget who makes the call
when I don't teach you a lesson, huh?

589
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:10,368
I will sell you off today!

590
00:37:10,455 --> 00:37:13,277
You better know what's good for
you! If not, I'll beat you to death!

591
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:16,086
From now on,

592
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,168
I'll do whatever

593
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:18,551
you tell me to do!

594
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:21,072
Don't sell me off to the dance house!

595
00:37:21,153 --> 00:37:22,211
I have to sell you off today!

596
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:23,440
Come!

597
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:25,080
How dare you cry?

598
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:27,736
Come!

599
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:29,951
No!

600
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
Come!

601
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:35,972
No!

602
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,480
- No! - Come!

603
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,960
Thank you.

604
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,382
Who was it? Who threw that at me?

605
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:57,200
Who was it?

606
00:37:57,384 --> 00:37:59,232
Come. Let's go and take a look.

607
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:01,360
Get up!

608
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:03,640
- Come! - He's trying to kill her!

609
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:06,560
Guys, look! He's beating his wife up!

610
00:38:07,424 --> 00:38:09,240
- Wu Niang! - Mu Dan!

611
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:12,150
Wang Qing, I've already spared you once.

612
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:13,680
But now, you're behaving worse.

613
00:38:13,864 --> 00:38:15,024
What has Wu Niang done wrong?

614
00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:16,504
Why are you trying to sell her off?

615
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:19,725
Only useless fools will take
their anger out on their wives!

616
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:22,152
Don't think that I'm
afraid of you just because

617
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,583
the supervisor is backing you up.

618
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,260
You still ended up here alone.

619
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:30,600
She's mine. I can do
whatever I want to her.

620
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,821
It's none of your business.

621
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:34,885
- Come! Get up! - What are you doing?

622
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:36,193
- What are you doing? - Get up!

623
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:37,578
- What are you doing? - Get up!

624
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:42,920
What are you guys doing?

625
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:44,520
What are you guys doing?

626
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,080
Huanyun Pavilion is open for business.

627
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,319
Are you guys no longer
accepting new recruits?

628
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,376
Does your wife have a
clean household register?

629
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,160
Of course.

630
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:57,160
If so, no trades should be done.

631
00:38:57,288 --> 00:38:58,960
To take a concubine is a crime as well.

632
00:38:59,054 --> 00:39:00,400
Don't you know that?

633
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:03,240
It's pointless to reason
with an animal like him.

634
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,864
Report him to the authorities. Don't
let him ruin Huanyun Pavilion's name.

635
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:07,040
Yes, My Lord.

636
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,840
Fine. I won't sell her off.

637
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:11,520
I won't sell her off.

638
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:14,316
Thank you, Mu Dan!

639
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,240
- Thank you! - Hurry and get up!

640
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:18,504
Thank you, benefactor!

641
00:39:18,585 --> 00:39:19,944
- Come! - Thank you...

642
00:39:20,038 --> 00:39:21,038
What are you doing?

643
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,588
I'm taking her home.

644
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,360
Wu Niang,

645
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:33,000
to think that you did so much to save her.

646
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:34,887
Look at how capable she is.

647
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:37,000
She didn't need your help at all.

648
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,416
They might be able to
stop me from selling her off,

649
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,679
but they can't stop me from
teaching my wife a lesson.

650
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,448
Come home with me.

651
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:46,564
I'll treat you well when we reach home.

652
00:39:46,824 --> 00:39:47,943
- Let's go! - Wu Niang!

653
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:50,080
- Come! - Wu Niang!

654
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:51,800
Come!

655
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:01,560
Wait!

656
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:10,680
Wu Niang,

657
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:13,452
I'm afraid that you'll still
suffer if you follow me.

658
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:15,200
But I promise you

659
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:18,160
that no one will ever dare to
bully or humiliate you again.

660
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,280
Are you willing to live together with me?

661
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:40,280
What should I do for you to let her go?

662
00:40:41,257 --> 00:40:42,720
Give me ten strings of coins,

663
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:45,304
and I'll draft a divorce
agreement immediately.

664
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:47,557
Fine. I'll pay you ten strings of coins.

665
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:49,880
Draft a divorce agreement immediately.
