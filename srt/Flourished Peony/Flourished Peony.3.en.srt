1
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,289
<i>[Flourished Peony]</i>

2
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,592
<i>[Episode 3]</i>

3
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,592
Your Highness, this way please.

4
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,879
Your Highness, this is your room.

5
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,280
All the furnishings in the room

6
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,560
are all crafted by my son.

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,120
We only wish you

8
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,239
to feel at home.

9
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,760
My favorite glazed cup,

10
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,959
vase

11
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,400
and handwarmer.

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,680
It's been so long,

13
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,479
yet he still remembers.

14
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,319
The curtains in the room

15
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,680
are also chosen by Zishu

16
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
for you, Your Highness.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
Zishu keeps

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,280
all your preferences all in mind.

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,719
Finding Shuiyu curtains in Luoyang

20
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,800
is truly hard.

21
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,439
Zishu is really thoughtful.

22
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,439
Was this also chosen by Zishu?

23
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,479
Zishu's father saw the items Zishu has chosen

24
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,639
are elegant yet lack nobility,

25
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,159
therefore, he added a few items.

26
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,199
This gold and jade Ruyi…

27
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,432
Take it away.

28
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,704
Yes.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,919
Servants, remove it.

30
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,280
- Hurry.
- Yes.

31
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,800
Madame Liu.

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,879
The jade pillow on this bed is precious,

33
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,280
it is too cold and hard.

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,800
County Princess uses a medicinal pillow.

35
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,560
The silk quilt on the bed is too thin as well.

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,199
County Princess's body is fragile,

37
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,400
can only sleep on an extremely soft bed.

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,879
Your Highness.

39
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
Zishu does not understand
the items used in a lady's room,

40
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,840
so I took the liberty of deciding for myself.

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,800
But I've never thought to make such mistakes.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,680
Please spare me.

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,759
I will

44
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,199
have it replaced immediately.

45
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,360
Your Highness, are you feeling cold?

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,599
It is late spring in Luoyang,

47
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,599
but it's still a bit chilling.

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,039
The window screens of this room are thick,

49
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,319
blocking out all the sunlight.

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,039
County Princess

51
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,280
has been already tired from the journey,

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,680
and got frightened at the floral banquet.

53
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,240
How can she stay in
such a cold and gloomy room?

54
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,560
I beg your forgiveness.

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,879
It is my oversight.

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,960
My son

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,520
has specially prepared

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,840
a jasmine pearl soup for you
to relieve fatigue and warm the body.

59
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,879
Your Highness,

60
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,680
please go to the side hall to take a sip.

61
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,959
Just wait a moment.

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,399
I will immediately help you
arrange a better room.

63
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,920
No need.

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,519
I am fully aware of

65
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,839
the mansion

66
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,352
of a Deputy Fifth-Rank official.

67
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,319
I presume this is

68
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,560
the best wing-room here.

69
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,920
We have brought with us the daily supplies.

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,399
Just change them.

71
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,519
Don't make Zishu's kindness go in vain.

72
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,480
Yes, I'll do it right away.

73
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,920
Thank you for your understanding,
Your Highness.

74
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,000
This wing-room

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,360
is right next to Zishu's courtyard.

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,839
It's very convenient for getting around.

77
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,000
If you need anything,

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,399
please let him know.

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,720
The banquet has already ended.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,920
Has Zishu not finished
seeing off the guests yet?

81
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,064
Rou.

82
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,480
The County Princess's wing-room
has been tidied up already.

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,879
What are you doing?

84
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,959
My lord.

85
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,040
County Princess is dissatisfied
with the furnishings in the room,

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
and thus has sent someone

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,199
to fetch her own belongings for replacement.

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,680
Today, there is an event of negligence here.

89
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,439
If Zishu didn't

90
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,160
beg on his knees for mercy for the Liu family,

91
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,720
this matter certainly
could not be easily glossed over.

92
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,439
If such negligence

93
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,240
had occurred in Chang'an,

94
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
everyone in the Liu Mansion

95
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,279
would all face the death penalty.

96
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,519
Such a mistake that has occurred

97
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,160
is all due to the incapability of Madam He.

98
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,920
What a disaster that the Liu family

99
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,240
has such a daughter-in-law.

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,759
Everyone knows

101
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,040
that since she married into the Liu family,

102
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,360
she has never been favored by Zishu.

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
The duty to manage the family

104
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,040
would never fall into her hand,
the daughter of a merchant.

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,800
The place where she lives

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,079
is remote.

107
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,680
So she will certainly not bother you.

108
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,199
You protect her like this,

109
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,000
making me the one who is annoying.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,839
Your Highness, you got me wrong.

111
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,160
I'm afraid that woman

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,439
will bother you.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
Master Liu was demoted
and transferred to Luoyang,

114
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,439
willingly degrades himself and makes
a marriage alliance to a merchant family.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,480
He has been ups and downs
in his official career for a full three years.

116
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
And now, he is still

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720
a minor regency official,

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,279
causing Zishu to be unable
to even be an inherited official.

119
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,800
He can only study hard

120
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,920
for the Imperial Exam with great effort.

121
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,959
He is such a man of talent and value,

122
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,360
has fallen to such a state.

123
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,079
Do you really believe

124
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,000
the assets from the He family

125
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,319
could make him rise rapidly through the ranks?

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Your Highness.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,519
You are right.

128
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
We have held back Zishu.

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,480
For Zishu,

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,079
I will not tell my father

131
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,879
about the assassination attempt.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,279
However,

133
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,720
the servants are so incompetent,

134
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
must be punished.

135
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,720
All the servants at today's floral banquet

136
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,519
receive eighty strokes of the cane
as punishment.

137
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
Madam He failed to notice it,

138
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,079
and receive forty strokes of the cane
as punishment.

139
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
Your Highness, please spare us.

140
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Madam He failed to notice it,

141
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,639
and will be surely dealt with by us
according to family discipline.

142
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,040
And we won't let off the servants

143
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
who deserve punishment.

144
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,600
However,

145
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
if given such a caning punishment,

146
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,560
they might get seriously injured.

147
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,079
Zishu can't bear to see these.

148
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,120
He will surely blame me.

149
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,759
If you care so much about

150
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,319
what Zishu thinks,

151
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,319
why forced him to marry
someone he does not love?

152
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,120
If the punishment is not severe,

153
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,680
then it's hard to establish family discipline.

154
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,399
I'm doing this for Zishu.

155
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,519
He's set to rise step by step.

156
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,439
He will receive guests
more often in the future.

157
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,120
If such accidents happen again

158
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,000
and offend other nobles,

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,079
who can protect him?

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
Rest assured.

161
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,759
This matter has nothing to do with you.

162
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,839
I will make the decision.

163
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,160
Zishu.

164
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,680
As you say,

165
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,000
my father, my mother and I

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,799
are all guilty of negligence,

167
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,039
should all be punished with death together.

168
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,039
What does this have to do with you?

169
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
It was you who protected me
when I was in danger.

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,519
I took it all to heart.

171
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,559
Whether to kill or to punish,
you would never be involved.

172
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,016
Get up.

173
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,639
Even if they are at fault,

174
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
still people of the Liu Mansion.

175
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,600
Whether to lightly punish

176
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,879
or severely deal with,

177
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,759
whether to beat them or execute them,

178
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,759
are all matters of the Liu family.

179
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,279
How can we trouble guests on this?

180
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,480
Zishu.

181
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,559
You never used to talk to me like this.

182
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,720
I'm doing it for you.

183
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,039
But Youzhen

184
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,919
would never

185
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,919
take the lives of half the people
in my Liu Mansion with just one sentence,

186
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,000
and force my mother, past fifty, to kneel down.

187
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,279
Your Highness is doing it for you.

188
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,759
How can you fail

189
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,200
her kindness?

190
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,600
Think it over.

191
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,039
If you don't like me
meddling in your family affairs,

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,480
then I won't, okay?

193
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,919
Get up.

194
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,200
Help your mother

195
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,360
to rise as well.

196
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,768
Your Highness, you are generous.

197
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,240
Zishu.

198
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,559
Don't be willful.

199
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,200
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

200
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,240
Zishu.

201
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
is so into studying,

202
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,799
and he's long forgotten
how to speak with women.

203
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,960
Your Highness,

204
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,919
please forgive his blunt words.

205
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,240
Your Highness pardons you all.

206
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,559
Hurry and kowtow, then leave.

207
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,720
Your Highness, thank you so much.

208
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,200
I'll take my leave.

209
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,399
I can't bear to see you frown.

210
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,000
<i>Youzhen.</i>

211
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,960
<i>In a few more years,</i>

212
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,799
<i>once I've succeeded in the imperial exam
and secured an official position,</i>

213
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,240
<i>I will definitely propose to your father</i>

214
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
<i>and marry you.</i>

215
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,879
<i>There are many guests coming</i>

216
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,879
<i>to seek my father's support.</i>

217
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,360
<i>Should I also go ask my father</i>

218
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,240
<i>for an official position for you?</i>

219
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
<i>This way, you won't have
to study hard for years</i>

220
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,600
<i>and can also be promoted in rank.</i>

221
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,720
<i>I know you mean well.</i>

222
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,679
<i>But I study</i>

223
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,120
<i>for the purpose of understanding principles</i>

224
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,639
<i>and improving myself.</i>

225
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,720
<i>I wish to serve the imperial court
with my talent and knowledge,</i>

226
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,799
<i>instead of climbing ranks by relying on others.</i>

227
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,240
<i>I see.</i>

228
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
<i>You have lofty ambitions and are knowledgeable,</i>

229
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,879
<i>surpassing those dandies who rely on</i>

230
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,039
<i>their family background.</i>

231
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,919
<i>One day, you'll surely top the imperial examine
and be appointed to the highest official rank.</i>

232
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,240
<i>Let me tie it for you.</i>

233
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,768
<i>Okay.</i>

234
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,759
<i>I have a gift for you.</i>

235
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,919
<i>I hope to be with my beloved,</i>

236
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,039
<i>never apart in life or death.</i>

237
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,440
<i>County Princess is my beloved daughter,</i>

238
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
<i>regarded as the Second-Rank,</i>

239
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,879
<i>honored and noble.</i>

240
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,039
<i>She has been living in wealth since childhood,</i>

241
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,320
<i>and has never suffered the slightest</i>

242
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,559
<i>grievance or neglect.</i>

243
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,000
<i>With your Liu family's rank and status,</i>

244
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,639
<i>how could you possibly match her?</i>

245
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,080
<i>And how could you take good care of her?</i>

246
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,080
<i>Please go back.</i>

247
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,440
<i>Father, as long as I'm with Zishu,</i>

248
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,519
<i>I don't care about rank and status.</i>

249
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,879
<i>Your Highness.</i>

250
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,240
<i>I hereby swear</i>

251
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,840
<i>I will never let Youzhen suffer the slightest.</i>

252
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,320
<i>And I will cherish and value her</i>

253
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
<i>as a treasure.</i>

254
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,519
<i>Please agree.</i>

255
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,519
<i>Please agree.</i>

256
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,799
<i>Take County Princess back to her room.</i>

257
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,992
<i>Yes.</i>

258
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,480
<i>- Your Highness.
- Zishu.</i>

259
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,679
<i>- Your Highness.
- Zishu.</i>

260
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,000
<i>Zishu.</i>

261
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,264
<i>Your Highness.</i>

262
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:49,320
<i>- Zishu.
- Youzhen.</i>

263
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,080
<i>Zishu.</i>

264
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,440
<i>Zishu.</i>

265
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,720
Once you were

266
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,759
my Youzhen,

267
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,519
not the same as those high-handed noble ladies.

268
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,704
But just now,

269
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,919
you became the County Princess Ji'an.

270
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,200
Your demeanor and words

271
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,360
all made me feel so strange.

272
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,120
I am always Youzhen before you.

273
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,639
I did that

274
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,120
just because I care too much about you.

275
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,759
I'm afraid someone will hold you back.

276
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,360
We have finally reunited.

277
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,879
Don't let this little thing upset us, okay?

278
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,120
You've lost weight.

279
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,000
So the rumors are true

280
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,320
that you are not living well.

281
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,200
Zishu.

282
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,879
Times have changed.

283
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,360
Do you think about moving back to Chang'an?

284
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,320
My father holds a minor official position,

285
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,600
how could we go to Chang'an?

286
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,600
I am living well.

287
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,159
Do not trust the rumors.

288
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,159
Don't worry about me.

289
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,039
In this world,

290
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,559
apart from you,

291
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,320
who else is there for me to worry?

292
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,399
Don't hide it from me.

293
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,080
I know

294
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,159
you have always kept

295
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,679
my portrait in your room.

296
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,960
Even after getting married,

297
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,039
you've never spent the night
in Madam He's room.

298
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,039
You've been alone for three years,

299
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,879
and never betrayed our vows.

300
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,279
I know well

301
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,800
your sincerity.

302
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,679
Youzhen, all this you mentioned

303
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,080
is all privacy in my mansion.

304
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,320
You are in Chang'an,

305
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,039
how would you know so clearly?

306
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,480
I've kept you in mind,

307
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
so, I got to know

308
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,000
everything about you.

309
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,759
So, whether it is to punish my servants,

310
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,960
or to inquire my privacy,

311
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,960
it's all about your one sentence.

312
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,399
County Princess Ji'an,

313
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,399
have you ever asked for my opinion

314
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,240
or cared about my feelings?

315
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,240
I care about you,

316
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,519
so I did so.

317
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm worried…

318
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,799
I'm worried that you would forget about me.

319
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm afraid that you would be bullied

320
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,704
and not living well.

321
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,919
Zishu.

322
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,799
If you don't like it,

323
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,879
from now on,

324
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,279
just tell me all about it yourself.

325
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,399
Then I will stop doing so.

326
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,720
Don't blame me, okay?

327
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,720
No one in the Liu Mansion

328
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,279
dares to blame you.

329
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,200
It's getting late.

330
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
I'll go help my mother prepare for the dinner,

331
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
in case any mistake happens again.

332
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,880
Good.

333
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,248
Nice.

334
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
Mr. Jiang.

335
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
I will be heading to Chang'an next month.

336
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,559
From now on,

337
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,039
I hope you could continue to support me.

338
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,480
The Chen family has
the backing of His Highness,

339
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,759
and your official career is thriving.

340
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,240
Where would you need the support
of a minor official like me?

341
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,720
Mr. Jiang.

342
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,279
His Highness is so powerful.

343
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,440
The families backed by him

344
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,160
not just my Chen family.

345
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
So many names

346
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,319
presented before His Majesty,

347
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,160
if

348
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,319
anyone is fortunate enough

349
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,799
to be mentioned by you,

350
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,599
then he would secure an official position.

351
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,920
I get countless requests every day.

352
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,240
And I am not wise as His Majesty,

353
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,759
I can't remember everyone.

354
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,440
Mr. Jiang.

355
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,680
It was my oversight.

356
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,480
I can't let you help me for nothing.

357
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,759
A small token.

358
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,744
Please accept it.

359
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,319
Mr. Jiang.

360
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,960
Don't you like

361
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
the item in this box?

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,799
The only thing I don't like is

363
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,720
that the gift is not great enough.

364
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,960
Are you kidding me?

365
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,200
Such a cheap item

366
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,519
is usually only fit for my guard.

367
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,664
Thank you, My lord.

368
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,319
Mr. Jiang.

369
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,839
What a huge misunderstanding!

370
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,880
Knowing you are liberal with money,

371
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,960
this is

372
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,480
just for you to give away.

373
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,968
The real token

374
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,288
is right here.

375
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,720
Eight shops in the eastern market of Chang'an

376
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,880
and a hundred mu of fertile farmland
on the outskirts of the city.

377
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,799
Your father has taught his son well.

378
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,119
His Majesty

379
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,480
shall soon know it.

380
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,160
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

381
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,360
Pour the wine.

382
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,759
Mr. Jiang, a small token.

383
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,039
Please accept it.

384
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,240
Mr. Jiang, please accept it.

385
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,000
Stop it.

386
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,960
Stop it now.

387
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,880
What happened?

388
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,240
Young Madam has suddenly left

389
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,240
and said to go check

390
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,799
the two shops that came with her dowry.

391
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,279
Mudan has always been obedient.

392
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,160
Even if she knew we sold her shops,

393
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,200
she would not say anything.

394
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,319
A husband's family has no right
to sell the wife's dowry. How could you…?

395
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,440
If not,

396
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,160
then how could we get the money
to receive the noble people?

397
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,359
And how could we support
your future official career?

398
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,519
Her being like this

399
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,599
must be because she saw
our attitude towards County Princess

400
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,599
and felt resentful.

401
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,640
Has she recently had any quarrels with you?

402
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,319
Not at all.

403
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,000
That's fine then, you go ahead.

404
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,079
I'll take some people to check it out.

405
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,039
We must not let today's business get disturbed.

406
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,448
Take it slow.

407
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,319
The breakfast sent
from the Liu Mansion is so plain.

408
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm afraid we'll be busy,

409
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,720
Madam, have a piece of cake to fill you up.

410
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,279
After the divorce,

411
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,240
we still need to rely on these two shops.

412
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,480
Without resolving this matter properly,

413
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,119
how can I have any appetite to eat?

414
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,359
After you get divorced,

415
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,640
the He family will take care of you.

416
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,319
No need to operate the shops.

417
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,920
Be careful.

418
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,400
After mother passed away,

419
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,440
my stepmother managed the family.

420
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,480
I don't want to be looked down

421
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,680
by her and younger brother.

422
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,799
And I don't want to see my father in a pickle.

423
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
I plan to sell one of two shops

424
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
that came as my dowry

425
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,799
and procure some property.

426
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,000
And I personally operate the other shop.

427
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,039
At the very least,

428
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,960
mother has a garden in Chang'an.

429
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,559
We could go there

430
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,640
and live,

431
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,880
being self-sufficient

432
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
and living at ease.

433
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,559
No matter what you wish to do,

434
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,640
I will always be with you.

435
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,720
You've loved the rose steamed cakes.

436
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,960
Eat some,

437
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,119
so you can

438
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,519
help me mess up the Liu family's business.

439
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,480
After we're done,

440
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,664
let's eat together.

441
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,720
Be careful.

442
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,992
Mudan.

443
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,224
Mudan.

444
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,080
Come on.

445
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
Father.

446
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,319
Why are you here?

447
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,720
I wanted to ask you.

448
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,559
Why aren't you staying at home

449
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,680
but hanging around here?

450
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,240
Mother asked me

451
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,960
to help my husband
settle matters in the officialdom.

452
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,880
I have two shops in my dowry.

453
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,440
Today I thought I'd come and check

454
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,400
if I could arrange some funds.

455
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,960
I have already dealt with it.

456
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,000
So you don't have to worry about it.

457
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,312
Go back.

458
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,359
If the family needs money in the future,

459
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,480
we will always need these two shops.

460
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,680
Father, don't be courteous.

461
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,279
I told you no.

462
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,599
If you don't want to go back,

463
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
then I'll have someone take you back.

464
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,160
My lady wants to check her own dowry.

465
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,640
Why do you refuse?

466
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,680
How bold you are!

467
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,799
You have no right to speak here.

468
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,559
You obstructed me like this,

469
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,920
is there something you want to hide?

470
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,039
A woman should be

471
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,559
gentle and compliant.

472
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,400
Just listen to whatever
your husband's family says.

473
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
Don't ask questions.

474
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,400
I don't want to defy you.

475
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,319
It's about my dowry,

476
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,200
and I have to go.

477
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,759
Stop her.

478
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,000
My lady, just go.

479
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
I'll hold them off here.

480
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,279
My lady, go.

481
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,599
Move!

482
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,319
Hurry, My lady.

483
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,440
Hurry, My lady.

484
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
- Hurry and stop Young Madam.
- Go stop Young Madam.

485
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,519
Stop Young Madam.

486
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,559
Move!

487
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,720
Move!

488
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,920
My lady.

489
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,480
Someone has fallen into the water!

490
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,640
Someone has fallen into the water!

491
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
Come save her!

492
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:32,680
Yulu.

493
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,079
Anyone who can swim?

494
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,319
- Hurry, save her!
- Somebody, save her!

495
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,759
I can't swim, Master.

496
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,056
I can't either.

497
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,056
Yulu!

498
00:24:46,816 --> 00:24:48,079
Crazy!

499
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,880
Let go of me.

500
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,040
Let go.

501
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,160
Liu Chang, I'm begging you.

502
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,359
Please save Yulu.

503
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,519
I'm begging you, please save Yulu.

504
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,519
- Save her.
- Yes.

505
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,720
Yulu.

506
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Yulu.

507
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,480
She's been saved.

508
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,720
You don't go and keep County Princess company.

509
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
What are you doing here?

510
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,039
After all, Madam He is my wife in name.

511
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,440
If she has made a mistake,
it should be me to discipline her.

512
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
I wouldn't dare trouble you, Father.

513
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,000
Wake up.

514
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,560
Yulu.

515
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,799
Wake up, Yulu.

516
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,960
Wake up, Yulu.

517
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:37,400
Yulu.

518
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,559
Young Madam.

519
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,799
- Yulu.
- Yulu has stopped breathing.

520
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,680
Call the physician now.

521
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,279
It's too late now.

522
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,279
It's not too late.

523
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,279
Medical books said

524
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,920
putting two dan of stove ash

525
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,319
into the body from head to toe,

526
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,559
then water will come out of all seven orifices,

527
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,599
and the person who has drowned will be saved.

528
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,519
It certainly works.

529
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,512
Go.

530
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,799
Go!

531
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,359
Young Madam.

532
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,920
It really is too late.

533
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,119
Yulu has already gone.

534
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,200
Father.

535
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,440
Please save Yulu.

536
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,799
I'm begging you.

537
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
I'm begging you.

538
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,759
I'm begging you.

539
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,160
Please save Yulu.

540
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,680
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

541
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,279
I'm begging you, Father.

542
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,480
I'm begging you, Father.

543
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,440
Liu Chang.

544
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,160
Liu Chang, please save Yulu.

545
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,720
I'll do whatever you say.

546
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
I'm begging you.

547
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,160
Please save Yulu.

548
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,200
I'm begging you.

549
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,799
- Please. save Yulu.
- Get up.

550
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,119
- Please save Yulu.
- She has stopped breathing.

551
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,792
I'm begging you.

552
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,799
She hasn't.

553
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,200
She hasn't gone.

554
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,839
Yulu.

555
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,839
Yulu, don't scare me.

556
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,864
Yulu.

557
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,759
Yulu.

558
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,240
Don't scare me.

559
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,599
Please don't scare me.

560
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,440
Please don't scare me.

561
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,160
Please don't scare me. I'm begging you.

562
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,552
Please.

563
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,400
Please wake up, okay?

564
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,640
We had agreed…

565
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,519
We had agreed

566
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,519
to go eat steamed cakes together.

567
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,559
We agreed to be live at ease.

568
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,319
Please wake up, okay?

569
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,920
Say something, Yulu.

570
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,960
Mudan.

571
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
I didn't mean

572
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
for this to happen.

573
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,319
How about this?

574
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,359
I will deduct three months' wages
from the steward

575
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,359
as a warning to others.

576
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,599
Do not act rashly anymore.

577
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,279
If you hurt Young Madam,

578
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,359
can you afford to compensate?

579
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,039
Furthermore,

580
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,640
Yulu was resisting,

581
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
then the accident happened.

582
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,920
If you didn't defy against
your husband's family,

583
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,559
how could Yulu die?

584
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,599
Don't be willful anymore.

585
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,039
Be well-behaved.

586
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,119
I'll

587
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,400
find you a better maid then.

588
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,232
Mudan.

589
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,799
Why do so for a maid?

590
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,000
Hurry back to freshen up.

591
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Don't catch a cold.

592
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,799
She is not my maid.

593
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,000
She is my sister.

594
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,912
Yulu.

595
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,119
Let's go home.

596
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,240
Go home.

597
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:02,880
<i>[The Tomb of Yulu]</i>

598
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,759
Whenever I make mistakes out of playfulness,

599
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,759
grandmother would punish me
by not allowing me to eat.

600
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,079
But you

601
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,720
would always steal some snacks for me.

602
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,240
And,

603
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,440
you would

604
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,680
always get caught,

605
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,759
then spanked on the palm.

606
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,144
Yulu.

607
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,119
I still remember

608
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,720
after the Qiongtai Yulu was first cultivated,

609
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,359
and when you learned that my mother and I

610
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:42,319
named it after you,

611
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,319
you were delighted for a long time.

612
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,880
But you didn't get to wait

613
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,359
the Qiongtai Yulu bloom.

00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:55,240
<i>[The Tomb of Yulu]</i>

615
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,440
Since childhood,

616
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,279
you have always worried about me,

617
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,720
fearing that I would not live well.

618
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,599
When the Liu family bullied me,

619
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,240
you were even angrier than I was.

620
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,312
Yulu.

621
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,160
From now on,

622
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,519
you don't have to worry about me anymore.

623
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,688
Yulu.

624
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,152
Rest assured.

625
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,000
I won't force myself again.

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,839
<i>[Women's Precepts]</i>
I once thought

627
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,160
to conceal my edge

628
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,599
would allow me to live at ease.

In the end,

630
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,559
I couldn't even protect

the closest one to me.

632
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,599
No matter how difficult,

633
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
from now on,

634
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,480
I will live as I please.

635
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,319

638
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,736
This way.

639
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,720
Mudan.

640
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,400
What are you doing?

641
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,680
We are all family.

642
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,240
Why make it seem like
we're dividing the family?

643
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,720
In just one year,

644
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,079
I've been deceived and cheated,

645
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,440
and my dowry has reduced by more than half.

646
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,640
Is this what you call a family?

647
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,119
Mudan, have you misunderstood something?

648
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,720
County Princess and Floral Envoy have come.

649
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,920
Many gold and jade ornaments,

650
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,200
antique calligraphy and paintings in your dowry

651
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,279
are just temporarily

652
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,000
placed in their room.

653
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,039
Sooner or later, they will be put into storage.

654
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,480
Everything should prioritize the Liu family.

655
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,799
Why be so calculating?

656
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,799
Yes, Young Madam.

657
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,359
You can't snatch with them.

658
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,720
Why can't I be calculating?

659
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,920
Those are mine.

660
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,960
Let me ask you. Why can't I be calculating?

661
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,119
The two nobles are just staying
at the Liu Mansion temporarily.

662
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,880
No matter how noble they are,

663
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,119
they shouldn't take what I cherish.

664
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,920
If you wish to flatter others,

665
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,240
I don't care.

666
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,880
But I

667
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,240
won't let others manipulate me.

668
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,759
Liu Chang.

669
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,480
You pride yourself on being a scholar.

670
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,199
In the past, you deemed yourself
as the most lofty.

671
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,840
Are you also willing

672
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,519
to use a woman's dowry

673
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,000
to pave your way to success?

674
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,719
Mudan, you…

675
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,119
I did not know before

676
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,519
that they were your dowry.

677
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,760
Had I known,

678
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,472
I would never have touched it.

679
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,480
Go get the furnishings from the guest room.

680
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,880
Zishu,

681
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,639
I'm afraid County Princess will be displeased.

682
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,559
Mother, Mudan is right.

683
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,280
How to deal with
the belongings of the Liu Mansion

684
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,920
is not something outsiders to criticize.

685
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,024
Go now.

686
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,599
Apart from the items in the storage,

687
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,000
there are also the two shops
that were sold previously.

688
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,840
I hope you could return them all together.

689
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,800
Without my permission,

690
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,840
anyone in the Liu Mansion

691
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,360
can't touch my belongings again.

692
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,199
Mudan.

693
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,280
Why are you like this today?

694
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,079
Being so calculating

695
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,199
and seeking money.

696
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,440
You are not like an official's family.

697
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,800
I've been like this.

698
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,400
But you all have come to know it today.

699
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,096
Mr. Jiang.

700
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,976
Wait.

701
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,840
Why is this jade on you?

702
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,559
Chen Zhang gave it to me.

703
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,559
I found its quality to be decent,

704
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,280
so I gave it to Chuanyu.

705
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,639
As for where Chen Zhang got it from,

706
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,119
I'm afraid you'll have to ask Master Liu.

707
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,800
Mr. Jiang.

708
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,360
This was mine.

709
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,039
Could you

710
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
sell it back to me?

711
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,880
You are a stingy person,

712
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,920
are you willing to spend money

713
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,360
to buy back what was yours?

714
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,480
Someone from the Liu family
gave it to someone else

715
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
without letting me know.

716
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,719
It has nothing to do with you.

717
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,280
I have no reason to make you bear this loss.

718
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,559
You are quite reasonable.

719
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,079
However,

720
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,880
I have already given this jade to Chuanyu.

721
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,000
Whether it is to be sold or kept,

722
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,920
you should ask him.

723
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,544
I…

724
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,119
This item was a birthday gift

725
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,719
from me to Yulu.

726
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,199
Now, somehow,

727
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,280
it has ended up in your hands.

728
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,360
To me, Yulu

729
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,559
is like my younger sister.

730
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,920
Now that she's gone,

731
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,936
I just want to

732
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
take this item to remember her by.

733
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:22,440
Well,

734
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,480
the quality of my jade is even better.

735
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,719
I am willing to exchange this jade

736
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,079
to get back yours, how about it?

737
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,039
This was your item.

738
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,239
I should give it back to you.

739
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,480
You can keep it.

740
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,559
No way.

741
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,920
You take this. Take it.

742
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
My lord.

743
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,320
My lord always gets bribe.

744
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,519
And he gives me many things.

745
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,199
This one item won't make a difference.

746
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,079
My lord treats me very well.

747
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,719
I know how close

748
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,960
you and Yulu were.

749
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,119
I can feel what you feel.

750
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,960
If I were to accept your jade,

751
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,079
my lord would surely look down on me.

752
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,920
Regarding Yulu,

753
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,872
please accept my condolences.

754
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,960
Thank you.

755
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,136
Mr. Jiang.

756
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,480
Could you keep this jade

757
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,519
and return it to me tomorrow?

758
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,776
Yes.

759
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,128
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

760
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,519
What does she mean?

761
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,256
What is she going to do tomorrow?

762
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,559
Just wait and watch the play.

763
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,280
Why is the rabbit so fierce?

764
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,480
It bites.

765
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,559
What are you afraid of?

766
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,000
No matter how fierce, it's still a rabbit.

767
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,400
Just soothe it by stroking its fur.

768
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,768
County Princess.

769
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,400
I've told Zishu before

770
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,760
I like fluffy things.

771
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,679
I didn't expect after such a long time,

772
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,352
he still remembers it.

773
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,920
Please thank Zishu.

774
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,159
Bring the rabbit over.

775
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,039
It's for Young Madam?

776
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,360
Yes.

777
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,400
My lord.

778
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,760
I am incompetent.

779
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,960
The rabbit bit me

780
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,679
and it ran away.

781
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,424
It ran away?

782
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,920
Then what's with the blood on you?

783
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,159
My lord, please forgive me.

784
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,480
Qiushi, I'm asking you a question.

785
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,952
Answer me.

786
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,000
It was County Princess.

787
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,280
She saw the rabbit,

788
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,719
realizing it wasn't for her.

789
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,280
Then County Princess asked me

790
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,039
to kill the rabbit.

791
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,559
County Princess asked you

792
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,039
to kill the rabbit?

793
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,119
Tell County Princess

794
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,360
that she's still in her mourning period.

795
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,159
I fear others will gossip about her.

796
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,199
I won't go boating on the lake tonight.

797
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,559
You may leave.

798
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,896
Yes.

799
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,360
Three years have passed.

800
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,000
People have changed.

801
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,280
Well,

802
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,519
Zishu not going boating with me

803
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,679
is for me,

804
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,199
or for that Madam He?

805
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,679
Madam He is nothing.

806
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,480
Mr. Liu never cares about her.

807
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,519
Your Highness, please don't overthink it.

808
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:55,159
If he never cared about her,

809
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,800
why would he give her a rabbit then?

810
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:25,951
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫</i>

811
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:34,489
<i>♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫</i>

812
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:42,363
<i>♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫</i>

813
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:51,709
<i>♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫</i>

814
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:59,252
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

815
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:08,093
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

816
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:15,904
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

817
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:23,801
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>

818
00:43:44,477 --> 00:43:51,360
<i>♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫</i>

819
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:59,355
<i>♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the fragrant garden ♫</i>

820
00:44:00,112 --> 00:44:07,414
<i>♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫</i>

821
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:16,407
<i>♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫</i>

822
00:44:16,407 --> 00:44:23,838
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

823
00:44:24,669 --> 00:44:32,925
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

824
00:44:32,925 --> 00:44:40,349
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

825
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:48,803
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>
