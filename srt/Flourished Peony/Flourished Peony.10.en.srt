1
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,958
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:39,027
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,600
Although common purslane
can be sold as a herb,

4
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,240
peonies are much more valuable than them.

5
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,606
It may seem like we're
losing out on some profits here,

6
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,492
but in reality, it's
providing us with more time.

7
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,536
This way, we can make a
profit as soon as possible.

8
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,896
I've been doing business
together with my father since young.

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,750
The first lesson I learned

10
00:01:57,876 --> 00:02:01,639
was that time is more
valuable than money sometimes.

11
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,179
I see.

12
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:13,404
Sheng Yi, if you had doubts earlier,

13
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:15,440
why didn't you ask me right away?

14
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,720
I don't know much about business.

15
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,480
I was worried I'd say the wrong
thing and mess up your plans.

16
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,519
See, even now, my question only showed

17
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,620
how shortsighted I was.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,340
From now on, I'll just
follow whatever you say.

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,541
- I won't question you again.
- Don't say that.

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,061
We're business partners,

21
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,035
equals in this venture.

22
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,545
If you ever have any questions,

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,040
just ask me directly.

24
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:46,175
Mu Dan,

25
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,541
you're literate and skilled in business.

26
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,541
You've even talked about

27
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,880
buying back your mother's garden.

28
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,823
You must have been the
daughter of a wealthy family, right?

29
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:01,391
Sheng Yi,

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,392
if we ever reach a point where
money is no longer a concern,

31
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:05,944
what would you want to do?

32
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,680
Before I got married,

33
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,079
my life revolved around
my parents and brothers.

34
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,440
After I got married, my
husband became my world.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
I've never thought about

36
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:27,120
what I want to do

37
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:28,527
or what I could do.

38
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,661
You're free now.

39
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:36,760
You can do whatever you want.

40
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,960
Have you ever considered

41
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:40,800
learning to read and write?

42
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:44,358
Then, you'd be able to
understand ledgers and documents.

43
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:46,236
No one could ever deceive you again.

44
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,419
I... I'm too old to start learning now.

45
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:59,320
Right now, I'm the only
one keeping the accounts.

46
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:00,880
There's always a risk of making mistakes.

47
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:04,246
Hiring an accountant would cost money,

48
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,000
and we might get deceived again.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Sheng Yi,

50
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:10,295
you're the only person I trust completely.

51
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:11,599
You're bright and hardworking.

52
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:13,175
I'm sure you'll pick it up in no time.

53
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,127
Just think of it as
helping me out, alright?

54
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,320
Please help me.

55
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,400
I just hope my teacher won't
mind having a slow student.

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,640
Great. I'll teach you now.

57
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:33,080
The Jiang Residence is so lively.

58
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:36,840
He's having parties every night.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,520
Doesn't he worry about his health?

60
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,500
I just hope my Jade Orchid
is placed somewhere safe.

61
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,341
Heaven forbid someone bumps into it.

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,240
Sheng Yi,

63
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,912
I'll teach you now.

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,759
Look, when we keep accounts,

65
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,720
we write from right to left.

66
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:57,240
You know that part, don't you?

67
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,640
(Jiang Residence)

68
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
Nothing will go wrong this time.

69
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:19,640
I've brought twice as
much as I did last time.

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,680
We will get to see him this time.

71
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,799
Flower Bird Envoy is so unpredictable.

72
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,879
Miss He.

73
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:29,870
Is it Lord Jiang's birthday today?

74
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,548
Why are there so many people here?

75
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,480
No. Today is the fifteenth, an
auspicious day to open the warehouses.

76
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,200
Since you'll be visiting
the residence more,

77
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,680
let me show you around.

78
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:46,160
Merchants have a tradition of opening
their warehouses to release goods.

79
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,880
What's the custom here
in the Jiang Residence?

80
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:51,807
Young Master says that since
the warehouse doors are opened,

81
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,560
they must be filled.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,880
These officials are here to
help replenish the warehouse.

83
00:05:57,198 --> 00:05:59,560
Next! To the main hall, please.

84
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,600
That's Young Master's pet.

85
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,141
His pet?

86
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,640
A pipa inlaid with gemstones and seashells.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
Such a massive scale.

88
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,080
This scale was custom-made by Young Master.

89
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,369
If an item doesn't meet
the standard of this scale,

90
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,280
it won't make it to Young Master's hands.

91
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,679
Just one gemstone on that

92
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,781
is equal to a sixth-rank
official's annual salary.

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Easy, easy! Steady!

94
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,800
Alright, onto the scale.

95
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,160
Place it on the scale!

96
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:56,391
Marshal Feng.

97
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,760
This one won't be accepted.

98
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:02,520
Why not?

99
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,217
Didn't you say that as long as the
item weighs more than a hundred taels,

100
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,120
we can meet Lord Jiang?

101
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,840
Your stone is heavy enough,

102
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:13,015
but your sincerity is lacking.

103
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,983
- This red coral is such a rare treasure.
- Seriously.

104
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:18,480
This is still not enough?

105
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,679
I went to great lengths to have it
shipped from Qiongzhou by sea!

106
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:23,782
I...

107
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,151
My loyalty to Lord Jiang

108
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,626
is as massive and as
vibrant as this coral itself!

109
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,079
Marshal.

110
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:33,935
Could it be that your sincerity

111
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,380
to someone else is what's lacking?

112
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:43,080
Chuan Yu, you've worked hard.

113
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:45,828
How about giving me a little leeway?

114
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:48,800
Have some good tea, relax a little.

115
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,480
That's a real gold bar.

116
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,014
I am a servant of the Jiang Residence.

117
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,640
All my food and expenses
are provided by Young Master.

118
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,319
This red coral radiates sincerity
no matter how you look at it.

119
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Until you give me a valid
reason for rejecting it,

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,300
I'm not going anywhere.

121
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm staying here!

122
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
In that case,

123
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:16,236
please bring your sincerity

124
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:17,920
and follow me.

125
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,520
What are you waiting for?

126
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,280
Hurry!

127
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:36,920
Marshal Feng,

128
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,559
this was gifted by Imperial
Commissioner Bao.

129
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,440
It was also shipped from Qiongzhou.

130
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,640
Why don't you choose something new

131
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,880
and try again on the fifteenth next month?

132
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,320
Miss He.

133
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,800
Rows upon rows of grand mansions,

134
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,680
gates opening to the nine heavens.

135
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,600
It's nothing more than this.

136
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:11,039
I saw Lord Jiang grab that tiger
demon's tail with his left hand,

137
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,199
and with his right hand,

138
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,040
he fired three arrows
straight at the creature.

139
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,719
The wicked creature was struck
in the forehead, chest, and below.

140
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,751
It died on the spot.

141
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,320
Bravo!

142
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:28,204
Then I saw Lord Jiang rise into the air.

143
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:31,960
Before I could react, he
flew right in front of me.

144
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,720
I immediately knelt down

145
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,000
and thanked him for saving my life.

146
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,821
But Lord Jiang said,

147
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,040
"Vanquishing demons and upholding justice

148
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
is nothing worth mentioning, Director Yin."

149
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,260
But how could I ever forget your kindness?

150
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,920
As soon as I woke up,

151
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:53,200
I hurried to commission this embroidery,

152
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,581
Lord Jiang Banishing Evil,
and sent it over as a gift.

153
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,080
No wonder I've been sleeping
poorly these past few days.

154
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:04,560
It turns out I was busy
killing demons in your dream!

155
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,837
This should be turned into an
opera by the Pear Garden Academy!

156
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:08,800
I've ordered someone to write it.

157
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,684
But I worry that no actor,
no matter how skilled,

158
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:15,828
could capture even a fraction
of your grace and bearing.

159
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:19,480
To think I'm so handsome and heroic,

160
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,560
yet I don't remember any of it,

161
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,080
what a shame.

162
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,480
Still, this is quite amusing.

163
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,280
I might share it with His Majesty.

164
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:29,360
If His Majesty doubts me,

165
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,561
you'll have to vouch for me.

166
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,500
Of course!

167
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,240
By the way, here's a basket of magpie eggs,

168
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:45,768
brought by a divine bird in my dream

169
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,588
and entrusted to me to present to you.

170
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,583
Since you've brought me something
from your dream, Director Yin,

171
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,189
it's only proper that I
give you a return gift.

172
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh...

173
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,879
Well...

174
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,360
You didn't have to, Lord Jiang.

175
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,893
Is this a cricket?

176
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,789
His Majesty has recently become
obsessed with cricket fights.

177
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:13,640
He has bestowed this
"Invincible Marshal" upon me.

178
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,320
It's won twenty matches
without a single loss.

179
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:18,680
From now on, if you have another nightmare,

180
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:21,160
let it vanquish the demons for you

181
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:22,960
so I won't have to make another trip.

182
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:25,240
This is a gift from His Majesty.

183
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:28,564
I have no way to repay such generosity!

184
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:32,920
The cricket is escaping!

185
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,480
Will your residence have another

186
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,655
"auspicious warehouse opening"
on the fifteenth next month?

187
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,440
No, it'll be an "auspicious
day for relocating."

188
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:50,720
You're moving?

189
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,880
We're moving the items in the warehouse.

190
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,576
We'll move the things
on the left to the right,

191
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,096
and the things on the right to the back.

192
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,319
Young Master says

193
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,040
that once things are
moved, it creates new space.

194
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
And since there's new space,

195
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,380
why not fill it?

196
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,400
- Please.
- The warehouses in this residence

197
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,479
are just like Lord Jiang's heart,

198
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,860
never full.

199
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,000
We spent so much money
and ended up with just a cricket?

200
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,400
This feels like such a loss!

201
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,760
What do you know?

202
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,440
This isn't just a
cricket. It's information.

203
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,221
If I can cater to His Majesty's
interests and win his favor,

204
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,620
I might secure the
position of Imperial Diarist

205
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,291
and become someone in
the His Majesty's inner circle!

206
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,301
Lord Jiang is overqualified
as the Flower Bird Envoy.

207
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,479
He ought to be at the Imperial Academy,
imparting wisdom and knowledge.

208
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,199
This is the literal exchange
of gold for priceless advice,

209
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,382
far more practical than
the "golden house" in books.

210
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,040
But for him to share stories
of His Majesty like this,

211
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,221
isn't he afraid of being blamed?

212
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,791
Young Master and His
Majesty grew up together.

213
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,360
They are as close as brothers.

214
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,821
He's merely sharing some
lighthearted stories between friends.

215
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:58,464
And by coincidence,

216
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,559
every time these stories
are shared with others,

217
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,239
it happens to fall on an auspicious day.

218
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,500
Just to legitimize making money,

219
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:10,983
Flower Bird Envoy is really impressive,

220
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,880
he even makes use of the almanac!

221
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,599
His mastery of underhanded
and unconventional methods

222
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,240
is unparalleled.

223
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,200
Admirable, really.

224
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,560
This way, please.

225
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:25,449
Maybe I should follow the almanac too

226
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,290
and find auspicious
excuses to sell flowers.

227
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,140
Who knows? My business
might just soar to new heights.

228
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,759
Young Master.

229
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,559
Stealing my clever tricks without paying?

230
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,380
That's not going to fly.

231
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,759
No, no. I wouldn't dare.

232
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,200
I've seen enough of the estate for now.

233
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:45,040
If there's nothing else,

234
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,760
I'll go water the plants.

235
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,680
Lord Jiang, please take care.

236
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Hold on.

237
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,101
Talking behind my back

238
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,280
to my own guard while in my estate?

239
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,440
You've got some nerve.

240
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,000
True despicable men

241
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,732
would do everything to hide their filth,

242
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,061
just like Liu Chang and his family.

243
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,061
But you don't even bother to
conceal the gifts you accept.

244
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,181
Even your most trusted guards
share every detail with me,

245
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,880
as if you're eager for the rumors

246
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,461
to spread far and wide.

247
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:20,831
From what I see,

248
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,701
you're hoping the storm of
accusations grows stronger

249
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,301
so that you can hide
something else entirely.

250
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:36,588
That copper coin you shot down?

251
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,120
I haven't forgotten it.

252
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,780
Aren't you curious about

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,620
what I'm hiding?

254
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,160
Not at all.

255
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,800
I'm just a humble commoner.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,680
I even needed your help to
obtain a household register.

257
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:56,703
How could I dare to dig any deeper?

258
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,780
The Jade Orchid is in the study.

259
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,900
Thank you, Lord Jiang.

260
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,341
This way, please.

261
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,600
This grape wine

262
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:31,564
was brought all the way from Persia.

263
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,640
Your Highness, Zi Shu,

264
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:35,200
if you like it,

265
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,740
I'll offer to supply all the
wine for your wedding.

266
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,719
Come, everyone,

267
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,200
empty your glass.

268
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Cheers!

269
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,279
This wine is sweet and
refreshing. It's excellent.

270
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:55,596
Don't let him fool you.

271
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,020
He lost a bet

272
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,816
and ended up spending a fortune
to buy all the grape wine in Chang'an.

273
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,199
Now he's worried about
his father finding it out.

274
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,039
So, he's trying to
get rid of it through us.

275
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
Brother,

276
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:10,384
King Ning has access
to the finest of everything.

277
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,495
Do you really think they'd
bother with fruit wine like this?

278
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,680
Since this is my first visit,

279
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,023
I've brought a little treasure to share.

280
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,740
Let's admire it together over wine.

281
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,096
This piece by Master
Wu, the Saint of Painting,

282
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,240
is bold, masterful and magnificent.

283
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:26,720
It's exceedingly rare,

284
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,479
as it's one of his early works,
created before he rose to fame.

285
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,896
Such pieces are nearly impossible to find.

286
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,895
It's been a prized possession
of my father's for many years.

287
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,759
I hope you'll appreciate
it, Young Master Jia.

288
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,800
Zi Shu, you really are everything
Her Highness said you'd be,

289
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:41,851
refined, elegant, and
effortlessly graceful.

290
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:44,244
Even your taste in art

291
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:46,693
is so exceptional and unique.

292
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,981
Such a generous gift deserves something

293
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,301
equally remarkable in return.

294
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,020
Master Wu is renowned for his portraits.

295
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,320
Bring the Born of Gautama
Buddha painting from the study.

296
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Yes, Master.

297
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:06,000
The Born of Gautama Buddha?

298
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,880
Wasn't it presented to
His Majesty by Master Wu?

299
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
How could it be here?

300
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,239
The family of a founding marquis

301
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,735
often receives gifts from His Majesty.

302
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,181
Having such a painting isn't unusual.

303
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,580
You two aren't showing much sincerity.

304
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,421
Our family has plenty of Master Wu's works.

305
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,100
Young Master Liu, Her Highness will
accompany you to pick out a few later.

306
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,701
Whatever catches your eye,

307
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,661
feel free to take it all.

308
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,580
Master Wu's works are priceless treasures,

309
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,239
and your family's collection
is equally precious.

310
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,616
Receiving the Born of Gautama
Buddha is more than enough.

311
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,661
How could I possibly take anything more?

312
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,901
My father and Master Wu have
been close friends for many years.

313
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,735
Our families have a long history together.

314
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,100
Don't worry about it, Zi Shu.

315
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,759
If you are interested,

316
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,260
I can invite Master Wu here

317
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,461
to paint a new piece for you on the spot.

318
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
How about that?

319
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,381
That sounds perfect.

320
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,500
Zi Shu, what do you think?

321
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,095
We've been sitting
indoors drinking for too long.

322
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,340
It's getting dull.

323
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,816
How about we move to the Agate Pool

324
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,095
for a game of Drum to Hasten the Blossoms?

325
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,759
Let's see who can leave sober today!

326
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,160
- Great idea! - Let's go.

327
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,759
Yes, come on.

328
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Let's go!

329
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,941
Zi Shu, let's go.

330
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,340
I'll join you later.

331
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,981
Let's go first.

332
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Young Master Jia,

333
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,800
I've heard you work at
the Ministry of Works.

334
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,239
I have an essay on canal transport

335
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,780
that I'd like to get your advice on.

336
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,982
Since we were born into privilege,

337
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,701
so let's enjoy life while we can.

338
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,599
Why bother discussing official matters?

339
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,100
Let the burden of governing the nation

340
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,260
fall on those minor officials

341
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,820
with no family background to rely on.

342
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,600
I thought the gift I brought

343
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,861
was refined and elegant,

344
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,120
but actually, it was like showing
off before a real collector.

345
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,800
I might as well not have given anything.

346
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,080
Young Master Jia may
have many fine paintings,

347
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,559
but he doesn't appreciate them.

348
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,000
He's nowhere near your
level of talent and ambition.

349
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,039
Nobles like him are born into wealth

350
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
that others couldn't amass in lifetimes,

351
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,319
yet all they do is indulge in pleasure

352
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,060
with no thought of making contributions.

353
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,461
The thought of having to mingle and
maintain ties with them in the future

354
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,181
exhausts me already.

355
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,840
Only nobles could afford
to grow peonies in the past.

356
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Thanks to that extraordinary
flower-selling woman,

357
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,080
now even we can afford them.

358
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,495
These Fragrant Sleeves may
be smaller than regular peonies,

359
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,880
but every bloom is lush and full.

360
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
They brighten up the room so nicely.

361
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,359
Indeed. I heard that extraordinary
woman got it from Mount Qingliang...

362
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,319
Young Master.

363
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,661
What does that
extraordinary woman look like?

364
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Zi Shu.

365
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
What are you doing here?

366
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,221
He must've had too much to drink earlier

367
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,320
while helping you fend off toasts.
He's out here to clear his head.

368
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,400
The Jia Residence is so large, I got lost.

369
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,941
Are you feeling unwell?

370
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,039
When you marry Her Highness,

371
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,039
your residence will surely
be far larger than this one.

372
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,119
When that time comes,

373
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,260
you'd better stick close to her.

374
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,999
Don't end up like today.

375
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,600
You were only gone for a moment,

376
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,340
Her Highness was already worried.

377
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,941
You talk too much.

378
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,260
What are they holding?

379
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,079
Are those peonies?

380
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,959
When did your family start
using such inferior flowers

381
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,181
to decorate the estate?

382
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,520
How did such vulgar things
end up in our household?

383
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,137
We bought these flowers
for our own amusement.

384
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:15,735
We were just about to take
them to the servants' quarters.

385
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,055
We didn't mean to offend your refined eyes.

386
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,319
We'll take them away right now!

387
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Hurry!

388
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,100
Please forgive us!

389
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,560
Let's go, Zi Shu.

390
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,480
We wouldn't want to
get tainted by such filth.

391
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,300
Some people are just like these flowers,

392
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,141
completely out of place
in such a grand estate.

393
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,159
I should take my leave now.

394
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,000
Only nobles could afford
to grow peonies in the past.

395
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,079
Thanks to that extraordinary
flower-selling woman,

396
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,381
now even we can afford them.

397
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,695
Don't head back to the estate just yet.

398
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,879
Take me to the flower market.

399
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Yes, sir.

400
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,759
Turn right up ahead.

401
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,479
- Here you go. - Thank you.

402
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,095
Potted peonies shouldn't be overwatered.

403
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,920
- I got it. - And don't...

404
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,919
We've lowered the price of
the flowers as much as possible,

405
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,199
but after deducting costs

406
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,999
and Flower Bird Envoy's share,

407
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,320
there's hardly any profit
left at the end of the month.

408
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
It's alright, take it slow. Our
savings will build up over time.

409
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,055
Once the blooming season
for Fragrant Sleeves ends,

410
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,255
we'll need to find other
affordable varieties of peonies

411
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,360
to keep potted ones
on the stall year-round.

412
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,656
That's the only way to retain customers.

413
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Understood.

414
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,461
Sheng Yi, it's still early. Go home first.

415
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,095
I'm going to visit the flower
merchants on the outskirts of the city.

416
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,936
I'll clean up here. Go
take care of your errands.

417
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
I'm off then.

418
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Excuse me.

419
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,381
Do you sell Fragrant Sleeves?

420
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,381
Could that be...

421
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,580
I spent a fortune on this Moutan peony!

422
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,079
Compensate me!

423
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,319
How...

424
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Are you alright, sir?

425
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
I'm fine.

426
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,461
How much did that flower cost you?

427
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,300
20,000 coins.

428
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,079
What? 20,000 coins!

429
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,500
You might as well just kill me!

430
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
You've been scammed.

431
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,039
You'd better go after the swindler.

432
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,319
Nonsense.

433
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,160
This flower was perfectly fine before.

434
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,479
It's worth every penny I paid.

435
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,255
It's all because of this old fool!

436
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,260
His donkey ruined my precious flower.

437
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,999
Folks, help me out here!

438
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,279
You've really been scammed.

439
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,879
Look at this flower, it may look fine,

440
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,120
but the stem hasn't developed properly.

441
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,941
It's clearly a first-year peony,

442
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,735
and without pinching off the
buds, it's been deprived of nutrients.

443
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,780
There's no way it'll bloom this year.

444
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,461
How odd, though.

445
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,800
By right, Moutan peony is a premium variety

446
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,600
and should be under the care of a gardener.

447
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,360
Oh, I know. It must have been
stolen from some noble estate

448
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,759
by a servant who didn't
know how to care for it.

449
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,439
Now that they've failed to keep
it alive, they've sold it to you.

450
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,479
Stay out of this! Stop
spouting nonsense here.

451
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,519
- He's been scammed. - Old fool.

452
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,360
Either you pay me back,

453
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,137
or you're coming with me
to the authorities. Let's go!

454
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:44,361
I really don't have the money.

455
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
Sir, sir, don't be like this.

456
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,335
You want to report it to the
authorities, right? I'll go with you.

457
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,359
I'll be your witness.

458
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
That scammer is just too vile.

459
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,055
They stole flowers and
swindled you out of money.

460
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,439
At the very least, they deserve
fifty lashes as punishment!

461
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Forget it, forget it.

462
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,199
Old fool, seeing as you're up in age,

463
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,060
I won't make things hard for you.

464
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,920
Just pay me 3,000 coins
and we'll settle this privately.

465
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
I don't have 3,000 coins.

466
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,440
No, we can't let that scammer off
so easily. Let's go to the authorities.

467
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,679
That's not necessary.

468
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,759
They have to be punished!

469
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,399
I've got something urgent to attend to.

470
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,621
My wife is about to give birth.

471
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,120
She's waiting for me at home.

472
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,319
I see.

473
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,300
How about you sell me the flower instead?

474
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,919
Consider it as me taking the loss.

475
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,136
I'll go with the old man to
track down the scammer.

476
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
If we can't find them,

477
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,519
I'll accept my bad luck.

478
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,079
What...

479
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,580
But for now,

480
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,600
this is all the money I have.

481
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
This is so little?

482
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,461
Oh right, you spent 20,000 coins after all.

483
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,416
Forget it, let's just report
this to the authorities.

484
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
- Let's go, old man.
- Never mind, never mind.

485
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,080
Fine, just consider me
unlucky. Give it to me.

486
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,519
The scammer must be him.

487
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,599
That's right.

488
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,840
You haven't told us who the scammer is!

489
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,141
Sir, the scammer is him.

490
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,461
I just saw him hurt your
donkey with my own eyes.

491
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,080
This whole act was staged so
he could extort money from you.

492
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,020
I see.

493
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Young Master.

494
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,060
Young Master, you don't think

495
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:09,901
that extraordinary flower-seller
could be Young Madam, do you?

496
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,400
I just have this feeling

497
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,181
that she wouldn't disappear
from the world so easily.

498
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:20,041
But the hairpin found near the cliff's edge

499
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:21,421
belonged to Young Madam.

500
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
I know.

501
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,280
Your feelings for Young Madam...

502
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:32,461
He Wei Fang

503
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,081
was my wife for a year.

504
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:36,081
It wasn't until her final days

505
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,701
that I really realized what
kind of person she was,

506
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,501
and how much my family owed her.

507
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,062
I was cold to her in the past.

508
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,622
I wanted to make amends,

509
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
but unfortunately,

510
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:52,521
I'll never have that chance again.

511
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
I'm fine.

512
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:00,181
Thank you for helping me.

513
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,040
- It's nothing. - Thank you.

514
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,456
- Please take care. - Alright.

515
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,081
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

516
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:06,641
Careful.

517
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
He Wei Fang.

518
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:32,161
He Wei Fang!

519
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Wait!

520
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:35,081
He Wei Fang.

521
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:36,953
- He Wei Fang! - Let go of me!

522
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,080
- He Wei Fang! - Let go!

523
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,416
Why did you run when you saw me?

524
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,782
Why did you fake your death?

525
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,782
Didn't my death fulfill
your family's wishes?

526
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,974
That was what my parents wanted, not me.

527
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,342
Your parents got to seize my dowry,

528
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,617
and you got to rekindle your
romance with the county princess.

529
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:55,748
Meanwhile, I got a chance to
start over with a new identity.

530
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Liu Chang, I beg you,

531
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,102
just let me go.

532
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:02,161
A new identity?

533
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:06,221
Is this what you mean by starting over?

534
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:08,681
You look disheveled,
filthy, and utterly miserable.

535
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:11,121
How have you been living all this time?

536
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:12,801
Are you working as someone's servant?

537
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,221
I'm running a business.

538
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,480
You don't need to concern yourself with it.

539
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,021
Are you selling flowers?

540
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,161
So that extraordinary
flower-seller really is you.

541
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
For the sake of my family,

542
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:35,761
I had no choice but to
marry the county princess,

543
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:37,574
but I am not an ungrateful man

544
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,582
who would abandon his wife.

545
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Liu Chang,

546
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,701
you and I were never
really husband and wife.

547
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,902
And now, we've long since divorced.

548
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,161
Why would you rather
live as a lowly flower vendor

549
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,661
than return to me?

550
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:55,701
Without merchants and farmers,

551
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:59,155
where would the clothes you wear
and the goods you use come from?

552
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:01,321
I earn my living with my own hands,

553
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:03,281
and I have never felt
inferior because of it.

554
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:04,361
That's not what I meant.

555
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:08,142
I see you clearly now.

556
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:10,622
I misunderstood you in the past.

557
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
He Wei Fang,

558
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,741
can't we start over and get
to know each other anew?

559
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,601
I never signed the divorce agreement.

560
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,509
This marriage can still
be salvaged, if you...

561
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:23,533
Liu Chang!

562
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,442
There were things I had
intended to leave unsaid,

563
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:26,701
to spare you some dignity.

564
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,782
But since you refuse to let
me go, I can no longer endure it!

565
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,897
Your parents coveted my dowry so much

566
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:33,501
that they sent people to kill me.

567
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:36,137
They left my father with no
choice but to abandon me,

568
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:37,741
leaving me with no home to return to.

569
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:40,976
Back then, you tricked me into
marrying you with fake medicine.

570
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,941
I ended up missing the
chance to save my mother.

571
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:44,629
She died because of it.

572
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:47,102
Between us,

573
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
there is nothing left

574
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,862
but hatred.

575
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:52,841
Your mother's death

576
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,941
is a sin my family bears.

577
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:56,641
I can't defend it.

578
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,302
But I really was unaware of it.

579
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:02,181
If you want,

580
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,382
I can steal the Zixi Pill for you.

581
00:30:05,361 --> 00:30:07,082
You can keep it or take it back...

582
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:08,941
My mother is gone!

583
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:12,848
What use would I have
for the Zixi Pill now?

584
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Liu Chang,

585
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,423
no matter what role you played in it,

586
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:21,148
it makes no difference to me.

587
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
My mother

588
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:25,822
is never coming back!

589
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
He Wei Fang.

590
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:35,641
He Wei Fang.

591
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:37,321
- What do you want? - Listen to me.

592
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:40,057
Whether it's my family or my mistakes,
I bear responsibility for them all.

593
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:41,256
Just give me a chance to make it up to you.

594
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,321
I can take care of you
in your mother's place.

595
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,120
I know you love tending to flowers.

596
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,760
I could set up a garden for you.

597
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,416
You wouldn't need to
endure anyone's judgment,

598
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,560
worry about making a living,

599
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,142
or work yourself to
exhaustion just to survive.

600
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,302
What do you take me for?

601
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,640
Some kept woman locked
away in a separate estate?

602
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,241
Liu Chang, this is what
you call "seeing me clearly"?

603
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:00,321
That's not what I meant.

604
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,342
I just want to protect you

605
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,370
from facing my parents' and the
county princess's cruelty again.

606
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:05,855
If you really want to protect me,

607
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:08,881
don't tell anyone I'm alive,

608
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,261
and don't ever appear before me again.

609
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
Make way! Make way!

610
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:15,321
Come here.

611
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:17,401
He Wei Fang!

612
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,377
When we married, you
didn't want it, and neither did I.

613
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:22,862
Now, He Wei Fang is dead, and you're free.

614
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:24,902
Stop pestering me.

615
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:28,841
He Wei Fang!

616
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:42,601
She's not dead.

617
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,080
You can put your mind at ease now.

618
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Don't worry.

619
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,701
Hate Liu Chang! Liu Chang is awful!

620
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:06,062
I completely misjudged her.

621
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:07,801
I underestimated her.

622
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,640
Though she comes from a merchant family,

623
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,861
she has integrity

624
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:15,188
and extraordinary insight.

625
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Just like me,

626
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,960
she wants to rely on her own
efforts to make a name for herself.

627
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,941
It's just a pity

628
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:28,582
that it took me so long to realize it.

629
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Shuai Shuai,

630
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:38,021
do I really have no
chance to make it up to her?

631
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:41,789
I like Mu Dan.

632
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,320
I like Mu Dan.

633
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,901
We're not speaking the same language.

634
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
What do you like about her?

635
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,582
Her sharp glares

636
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:53,987
and cutting words?

637
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,781
Or her carefree,

638
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,741
unrestrained spirit?

639
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,640
He actually tried to scam
an old man in broad daylight.

640
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,822
He's so shameless.

641
00:33:19,234 --> 00:33:22,102
Exactly. So I swooped in like a hero,

642
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,936
fought off the bully and helped the weak.

643
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,701
As a bonus, I got this for a bargain.

644
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Sheng Yi,

645
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,301
this peony really is a Moutan peony.

646
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,021
If we can save all the offshoots,

647
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:35,342
this single pot could sell
for an astronomical price.

648
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,461
Oh, right, go buy some
sea tree bark for me.

649
00:33:39,806 --> 00:33:41,184
Soaking it in water and
using it to water the flowers

650
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,229
will promote root growth.

651
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Go on now.

652
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:04,461
San Lang, drink.

653
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,801
I won again. Drink!

654
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,721
I'm not playing anymore.
I keep losing to you.

655
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:13,541
Pan, you will drink this
for me now, won't you?

656
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:16,021
A bet is a bet now!

657
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,621
First-class musician of Huanyun Pavilion,

658
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,902
do you not realize you
played the wrong note?

659
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:31,186
I was too distracted by
the beautiful kites in the sky

660
00:34:31,724 --> 00:34:33,046
and lost focus for a moment.

661
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:34,674
Please forgive me.

662
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:40,862
Distracted by those flimsy little kites?

663
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,679
- Bring my kite here. - Yes, sir.

664
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,600
Let me show you what it means to
cover the skies and block out the sun.

665
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:50,080
Alright!

666
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,697
Is that a phoenix? It's incredible!

667
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:54,519
San Lang, I've never seen
such a large kite before!

668
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,601
- Told you.
- Look at it, are those feathers real?

669
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,119
- Take a guess. - I don't know.

670
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,221
- Take a guess. - Oh, San Lang,

671
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,981
you've got a wife already,

672
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,096
and now you're competing
with us for the ladies' attention?

673
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,321
- That's just no fun. - That's right.

674
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:09,281
Alright. I'm tired of holding it anyway.

675
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,617
- Here, you take over for me.
- You have good taste, San Lang.

676
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:14,041
My arms are still sore from
playing polo with you yesterday.

677
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,240
Your phoenix, your responsibility.

678
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,440
Just take over, or you
will nag me again later.

679
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Take it.

680
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,737
It's flying away! The kite is flying away!

681
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:23,862
The kite is flying away!

682
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:27,981
It flew to the backyard.

683
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,429
It took me two whole months
to make that phoenix kite!

684
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:36,801
Now this is great.

685
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
It's within the Jiang Residence grounds.

686
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,488
Just send someone to fetch it.

687
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:43,641
Sui Zhi's brewery backyard
has been left idle for years.

688
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:45,061
It's a total wreck.

689
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,080
Even if it's retrieved, it'll be filthy.

690
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Forget it.

691
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:50,960
That yard's been cleaned up now.

692
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
Someone is living there.

693
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:54,881
Who's living there?

694
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,421
Just a flower-growing farm girl.

695
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:07,702
That corrupt official's kite is
so extravagant and wasteful.

696
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,222
Each of these feathers

697
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:13,782
must have been plucked
from the profits I gave him.

698
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,840
Sui Zhi, you're hiding a
beauty in your house now?

699
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,047
I have to go see for myself!

700
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:30,920
She's just renting a place here.

701
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,302
She's not a woman I'm hiding.

702
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,280
Besides, the door is locked.

703
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,381
You can't just barge in.

704
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:39,201
San Lang?

705
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,761
- San Lang? - Sui Zhi...

706
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
San Lang?

707
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,840
Get down, San Lang!

708
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,841
San Lang...

709
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Get down!

710
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:51,988
What are you doing?

711
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,476
You twisted your back
playing polo yesterday.

712
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Stop messing around.

713
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,990
You've been a ladies' man for years,

714
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,244
but this is the first time
you've brought someone home.

715
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:58,668
How could I not take a look at her?

716
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,480
Come on, give me a hand.

717
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,241
What? Forget it. Let's go!

718
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,200
Stop whining. I'll just take a
quick peek. Just one glance.

719
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,536
- Just one glance?
- Come on, give me a hand.

720
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,120
- Just one glance? - Just one.

721
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,801
Alright, easy there. I've got you.

722
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:18,461
- Easy. Hold tight. - A little more effort.

723
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,141
Oh, this is bad!

724
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:37,915
Jiang Chang Yang!

725
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,742
My Moutan peony

726
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:44,755
is incredibly valuable.

727
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,222
Your friend just crushed its branches.

728
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,141
It's probably beyond saving now.

729
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,800
Isn't it reasonable for me to
ask you for compensation?

730
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm really so...

731
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,857
The Moutan peony is
notoriously difficult to care for,

732
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:56,881
with a low survival rate.

733
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,620
Even without today's incident,

734
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,416
you might not have
been able to keep it alive.

735
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,576
You were the one who failed
to keep your friend in check,

736
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,440
and now you're turning
around and doubting me?

737
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:05,826
You made an outrageous demand,

738
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:07,216
of course I'm going to doubt you.

739
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,719
- You... - What about me?

740
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,460
That flower seller is quite beautiful,

741
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,001
but all she talks about is money.

742
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,176
Now that you found a chance...

743
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,856
No wonder Sui Zhi
didn't want us to meet her.

744
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,821
She's really uncultured.

745
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,481
Still, the scene of San Lang
smashing the flowers was priceless.

746
00:38:20,562 --> 00:38:21,737
I can tell them all about it when we drink

747
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:22,936
at Young Master Jia's residence tomorrow!

748
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,560
Besides, who's to say
this is really Moutan peony

749
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:26,868
and not just you making it up?

750
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,180
Wow, you'll say anything

751
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,554
to avoid paying, won't you?

752
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:35,022
You're so generous when it
comes to those lovely courtesans,

753
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,600
but when it's your friend's
mess, you won't open your wallet.

754
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,822
Sir, what a shame to have
befriended someone so unreliable.

755
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,601
Now that you've seen his true colors,

756
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,700
you must be feeling quite disheartened.

757
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,903
- You... - What? Shut up.

758
00:38:54,787 --> 00:38:55,787
If I may

759
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:57,474
say something?

760
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:00,241
Sure.

761
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Go ahead.

762
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,174
May I ask, what should I call you?

763
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,781
You're too polite, sir.

764
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,201
Unfortunately, the one who named me

765
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:14,961
was struck with a grave illness.

766
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:17,541
My humble name is unworthy of your ears.

767
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:19,141
You can just call me Mu Dan.

768
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:21,607
Mu Dan.

769
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,222
May I ask how I should address you?

770
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,480
Coincidentally, my name
isn't very elegant either.

771
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,466
I'm the third in my family,

772
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:31,607
so you can call me San Lang.

773
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,641
San Lang, I'm not being unreasonable here.

774
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,416
It's just that we're
running a small business.

775
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,902
We... We can't afford such losses.

776
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,095
Since it was I who broke the flower,

777
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,639
I should be the one to compensate you.

778
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:45,282
Sui Zhi only spoke up to protect me,

779
00:39:45,606 --> 00:39:47,096
worried I might be taken advantage of.

780
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,960
Please don't hold it
against him, Miss Mu Dan.

781
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,060
I'll reserve the flower.

782
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:54,560
If you can successfully grow Moutan peony,

783
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:57,547
I'll pay whatever price you name.

784
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,222
But if you can't,

785
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,141
then it's just empty talk,

786
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:03,439
and I'll compensate you at the price

787
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:04,592
of an ordinary flower.

788
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
How does that sound?

789
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,600
San Lang, you're so reasonable,

790
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:11,822
unlike someone here.

791
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:14,536
Since that's the case, I'm
willing to put it in writing,

792
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,702
just so no one can
accuse me of extortion later.

793
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,656
San Lang, with your
generous and noble character,

794
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,822
surely you wouldn't refuse
to sign and seal it, would you?

795
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:23,209
You're clearly afraid he won't pay up.

796
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,673
Do you really think your friend
would default on his promise?

797
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,781
Of course not!

798
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:29,961
Isn't that right, San Lang?

799
00:40:45,681 --> 00:40:46,681
Wu.

800
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
Don't be afraid, Wu'er.

801
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,222
I'm here to buy flowers.

802
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:57,120
80 coins for a pot of Fragrant Sleeves.

803
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,541
I'm relieved to see

804
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,541
you're doing so well now.

805
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:12,141
What do you really want?

806
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:14,160
Wu'er, please come back to me.

807
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,803
Ever since you left, I
feel like I've lost my soul.

808
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:17,009
Nothing I do feels meaningful anymore.

809
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:18,473
The new workers I've hired are lazy.

810
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,640
The tavern's business is
getting worse every day.

811
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:23,021
I can't live without you.

812
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:27,061
You were the one who wanted to sell me.

813
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,840
I was just furious at the time.

814
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,100
I only wanted to scare you, I
never really intended to sell you.

815
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:35,261
It was Mu Dan who instigated
those nobles to force my hand.

816
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,741
I had no choice!

817
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,141
Wu'er, I've missed you so much.

818
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,801
Wu'er, I've missed you terribly.

819
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:43,079
She's not Qin Wu'er anymore!

820
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,003
- People are watching!
- I can't live without you.

821
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:46,087
Let go of her!

822
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:50,440
You're no longer Qin Wu'er.

823
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,840
You are Qin Sheng Yi.

824
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,160
You don't need to be afraid
of that scoundrel anymore.
