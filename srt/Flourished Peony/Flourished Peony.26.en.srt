00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:36,184
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,011
(Episode 26)

3
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,970
You prepared so much. I can't finish them.

4
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,392
If you want to thank me,

5
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,231
it's better to pay me with money instead.

6
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,752
Are you too used to being arrogant and alone?

7
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,351
Da Fu and Chuan Yu are waiting to eat.

8
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,400
- Aren't you tired from what you did the whole day? - I'm not tired.

9
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,490
- Can't we stop fighting? - No!

10
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,176
How wonderful.

11
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,512
We can drink again.

12
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,611
A toast to our teamwork.

13
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,131
To our teamwork.

14
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,880
What are you thinking about?

15
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:54,610
I'm thinking about

16
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
the wish that I made when I came to Chang'an.

17
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,272
It will come true soon.

18
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:01,537
What did you wish for?

19
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,352
You will find out

20
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,319
on the day when it comes true, Lord Jiang.

21
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
What about you?

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,072
Did you get your wish after successfully solving the millet case?

23
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,394
Of course.

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,272
I never do a business that makes a loss.

25
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,011
- Li Xing. - Wei Fang.

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,399
What a coincidence. We are eating.

27
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,512
- Come and join us. - I won't be joining you.

28
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,816
I've been busy with documents a few days ago.

29
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,711
I only heard about what happened to you yesterday.

30
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:35,834
I am late.

31
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,851
It's all right. I'm fine and have been released.

32
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,512
How can you be fine

33
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,952
when you are with him?

34
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,690
Wei Fang.

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,359
We are related by blood.

36
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,079
I don't care that you were a slave

37
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,048
and the fact that you were in the army camp.

38
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:53,615
I don't even care that you were the Flower Bird Envoy's servant.

39
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,512
I know you were being forced to do this.

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,392
Li Xing,

41
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,080
what is the meaning of this?

42
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,169
I'm willing to take you as my concubine

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,880
and rescue you from all the suffering.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,072
Li Xing.

45
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,639
I used to think

46
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,031
you were an ordinary nerd.

47
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,559
I didn't expect you to just be ordinary

48
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,959
but also a confident man as well.

49
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,411
Cut the nonsense.

50
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,970
Wei Fang,

51
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:25,209
I might not love you as a partner

52
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,520
but I won't complain about you.

53
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:30,162
I don't mean that.

54
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,280
If you marry me,

55
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,831
I won't let you suffer.

56
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,592
Do you know

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,600
that a commoner cannot marry a slave?

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,600
You can't take her as a concubine.

59
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,400
I can buy you first.

60
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,152
Don't worry. I won't order you around like a servant.

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,391
Let's talk after we overcome the obstacle in front of us.

62
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,850
- You will always be my cousin. - Li Xing.

63
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,999
- Did you drink? - Mu Dan.

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,090
- Mu Dan. - I've never drunk before. You are...

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,175
- Liu Chang? - I've finally found you.

66
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,935
I'm not seeing any guests. Leave, all of you!

67
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,295
Mu Dan, if you don't want to see me,

68
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,992
are you going to abandon Shuai Shuai too?

69
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,721
- Go away. - Mu Dan, I sent you a letter

70
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,041
when you were at the army camp.

71
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,879
Why would you rather become a slave

72
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,439
than let me help you restore your status by becoming my wife?

73
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,592
That's because the Liu family betrayed her first.

74
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,330
Wei Fang.

75
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,448
He is going to marry the princess now.

76
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,817
She is someone with a noble status

77
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:20,136
but you can't even become a concubine with your current status.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,931
- What will you do if the princess decides to kill you? - No!

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,831
I am forced to marry the princess to save my father's life.

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,970
Mu Dan, don't misunderstand.

81
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,631
Show her some respect.

82
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,970
Don't listen to him.

83
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,511
Mu Dan, I've rented a residence.

84
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,239
If you are willing to come with me, I will protect you

85
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,600
and not let anyone hurt you.

86
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,520
There's no need to be anyone's servant.

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,792
Your father is corrupt

88
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,800
and you betrayed your marriage

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,480
and sided with traitors for your career.

90
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:49,376
Mu Dan might be a merchant's daughter but she has a backbone.

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,696
She will never be interested in a disloyal person like you!

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,112
You don't like her.

93
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,631
Why are you fighting for her?

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,232
Because I am her cousin.

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,879
How can I do nothing

96
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,112
when she is in danger?

97
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,951
The Li family is a family of integrity.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,055
I will choose a good person as my wife in the future.

99
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,439
Being with me is the best choice for Mu Dan.

100
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,271
Li Xing! Liu Chang is a fool

101
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,352
but why are you arguing with him?

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,191
Have you asked me about my opinion?

103
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,840
- Jiang Xiao Hua. - I am...

104
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,760
Don't you get it?

105
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
With your current status,

106
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,640
there's no need to ask for your opinion.

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,131
Actually, the person they should be begging now is me.

108
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,399
I have He Wei Fang's indenture. The person who pays the highest gets it.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,871
- You may offer your price now. - Go away.

110
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,559
It's already a mess now.

111
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,976
Can you stop causing more trouble?

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,472
How am I causing trouble?

113
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,777
I'm giving them some clear instructions to help you.

114
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,152
Why is your young master

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,191
always bullying Mu Dan?

116
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,480
Your friend is the one

117
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,032
who caused my young master trouble.

118
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,016
Take a good look and tell me who's at fault.

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,495
She is causing trouble for Young Master.

120
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,071
If I'm not around, how will you explain this in the future?

121
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:52,400
Both of you should stop flattering yourselves.

122
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm living a good life and don't need anyone to save me.

123
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,411
You should go home and you should sober up. Go away!

124
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,240
- No, Mu Dan. - Wei Fang.

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,380
I get it.

126
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,536
Are you keeping quiet because you are scared of Jiang Chang Yang's might?

127
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,239
Don't worry. I might not be rich

128
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,210
but I will save enough money to free you.

129
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,401
Mu Dan, whether I'm drunk or sober,

130
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:10,920
what I said was sincere.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,520
Jiang Chang Yang is dissipated

132
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,840
and Li Xing is boring.

133
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,640
I am the only one. We are the same kind.

134
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,735
- Wei Fang. - Go away!

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,840
- Get lost! - Mu Dan.

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,640
- Don't be reckless. - Let's talk it out.

137
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,731
- Go away! - I...

138
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,291
- Get lost! - Mu Dan.

139
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,280
- Wei Fang! - Mu Dan!

140
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,151
- Wei Fang, let me finish. - I'll treat you well.

141
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:28,366
- Wei Fang. - Mu Dan!

142
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,592
Wei Fang, let me finish.

143
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,410
- Wei Fang! - Mu Dan!

144
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,812
Mu Dan, why did you close the door?

145
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,931
- Open the door, Mu Dan. - Wei Fang!

146
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,472
- Wei Fang! - Mu Dan, listen to me.

147
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,330
Mu Dan. I like Mu Dan.

148
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,311
Shuai Shuai is the cutest.

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,071
What was that?

150
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,311
How absurd.

151
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,400
I don't mind

152
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,271
watching a few of these interesting plays.

153
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:10,960
If this goes on,

154
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,391
I will soon win the wager.

155
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,792
Dream on.

156
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,032
I finally realized this.

157
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,611
There aren't any normal men around me

158
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,152
including you.

159
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,040
The most reliable thing

160
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,040
in this world is still making money.

161
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,152
Right, Shuai Shuai?

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,592
Since coming to Chang'an,

163
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,112
I've always thought that I've saved a lot of money

164
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,479
but when I wanted to buy a garden,

165
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,432
I realized how little money I had.

166
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,832
Our business is still too small.

167
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,959
We don't make less money

168
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,671
but land in Chang'an is too expensive.

169
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:55,138
Da Fu,

170
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,520
has your mother agreed

171
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,959
to the thing I told you?

172
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,359
She agreed as soon as I told her.

173
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,051
That's great.

174
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,655
Before going to the bank tomorrow,

175
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,151
I will draft a contract first.

176
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,320
I'll shoulder all the risk of the mortgage and loan.

177
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,839
- I will never let you two... - What are you talking about?

178
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,312
We are not afraid of losing money.

179
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,952
I'm worried that you are too tired.

180
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,760
Getting a loan of so much money

181
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,151
and buying a big garden.

182
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:20,608
What if something goes wrong and you can't repay the loan?

183
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,592
Aren't you worried

184
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,320
that Blooming Abode might be repossessed?

185
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,671
Of course, I'm worried.

186
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,832
However, I must take risks

187
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,260
if I want to expand my business.

188
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,096
If the bank is willing to loan us money,

189
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,080
that means they think our business is doing well.

190
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,160
Your mother has agreed decisively

191
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,712
because she thinks

192
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,992
Blooming Abode is going to expand its business.

193
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,472
If we can buy Fang Garden in the future,

194
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,799
we will have more space

195
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,072
to grow new species.

196
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,880
We can even lend it to others

197
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,112
to organize banquets.

198
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,791
Then, our revenue

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,271
will not only be doubled.

200
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:58,078
- How much will our revenue be? - It will be multiplied.

201
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:00,478
Sure. We'll head to Fang Garden immediately

202
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,920
after getting the loan tomorrow.

203
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,059
(Fang Garden)

204
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,611
- Leader Lv? - Shopowner He.

205
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,999
Shopowner He, you have good taste.

206
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,592
Unfortunately, you are too late.

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,352
Fang Yuan has been acquired by the Flower Association.

208
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:25,985
Leader.

209
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,472
The Flower Association's properties are all over Chang'an.

210
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,352
I'm sure you don't need this garden.

211
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,791
Can you sell it to me?

212
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,640
Even if I'm willing to sell it,

213
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,192
I'm afraid your money

214
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,791
is only enough to purchase a storeroom in Fang Garden.

215
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,799
Leader Lv, don't underestimate us.

216
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,611
- This box is full of gold bars. - Da Fu.

217
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,832
I'm sure the gold in the box

218
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,312
is all the assets you have.

219
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,080
You got a loan from the bank, right?

220
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,472
You are the owner of this garden now.

221
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,272
I'm going to do this business with you.

222
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,240
Are you willing to move to Fugui Pavilion, Leader?

223
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,960
We can sit down and discuss it in detail.

224
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,999
You've not been in Chang'an for long.

225
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,192
It's no easy feat to get such a big loan.

226
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,631
However, you are still lacking when it comes to your assets.

227
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,199
A private garden

228
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,271
isn't affordable for normal merchants like you.

229
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,952
Why don't you

230
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,992
find a smaller garden or one in a remote place?

231
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,592
Honestly speaking,

232
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,639
this garden has an important meaning to me.

233
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,031
I only want to buy it.

234
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,679
I wonder what I can do

235
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,391
to make you sell it to me.

236
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,375
You might be better than the Flower Association

237
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,192
when it comes to growing precious flowers

238
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,271
but the association is a huge organization after all.

239
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,031
I'm sure you understand

240
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,880
that a person will still face obstacles

241
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,952
no matter how talented he or she is.

242
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,671
I will never sell

243
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,472
Fang Garden.

244
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Farewell.

245
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,031
Why don't we discuss it with Chun?

246
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:06,467
No.

247
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,671
Doing business is all about mutual consent.

248
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,072
We can't trouble Chun.

249
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,131
It's all right.

250
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,112
We've waited for so long.

251
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,910
Waiting for a while longer won't make any difference.

252
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,671
Do we need to return the money to the bank?

253
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:27,143
Even if we don't buy Fang Garden,

254
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,520
We still need to open Blooming Abode's branches.

255
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,521
Since we've gotten a loan,

256
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:34,081
let's think of a way to make enough money to pay the interest.

257
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,011
Let's save up the gold and take a look at some shops in the Eastern market.

258
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,410
Let's go.

259
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:47,031
(Fang Garden)

260
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,959
Fugui Pavilion has a new wine today.

261
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,472
Please come in and try it.

262
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,145
(Blooming Abode)

263
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,495
Blooming Abode is opening in the Eastern market today.

264
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,911
Everyone, please come inside.

265
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,455
(Grand Opening)

266
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,592
Where did you get the money to do this?

267
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,959
Did He

268
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,751
give you money behind my back?

269
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,331
Speak.

270
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,791
Speak!

271
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,199
You like doing embroidery, right?

272
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,960
If you like doing embroidery,

273
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,171
let's see how you do it!

274
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,371
Let's see how you keep doing it!

275
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:30,706
What a wretch.

276
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:53,929
Wang Qing.

277
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,890
- Give me five pots as well. - Sure.

278
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:57,121
Please pay over here.

279
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,760
- I'll ask my staff to deliver them to you later. - Sure.

280
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,131
- Miss, I've packed them for you. - Thank you.

281
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:04,506
Mu Dan,

282
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,251
Chun's beauty cream is selling well.

283
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,239
We have invested in the right thing.

284
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,091
What's wrong?

285
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,730
It's nothing.

286
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,671
I just remembered

287
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:20,639
how Sheng Yi spent all her savings

288
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,232
to redeem this jade pendant for me as a gift

289
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,359
when Blooming Abode's first shop opened.

290
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,671
If she's still around,

291
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,791
she will be the one to manage this shop.

292
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,290
I wonder how she is doing right now.

293
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
Enough. Don't think about that.

294
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,479
I know. I'm just feeling emotional. I'm fine.

295
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,559
Shopowner He, a lady asked me to give this to you

296
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,279
to congratulate you on the grand opening.

297
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,571
Thank you.

298
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,192
Take a look.

299
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,151
I'll make eight to ten of them for you

300
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,176
so you will always have a clean handkerchief to use

301
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,336
no matter how much you are sweating from growing flowers.

302
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,450
They are from Sheng Yi.

303
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,633
(Blooming Abode, Grand Opening)

304
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,392
I hope

305
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,533
I don't have to be a woman in my next life

306
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,111
and just be a peony

307
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,031
that blooms according to the wind instead.

308
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:41,524
(Blooming Abode, Grand Opening)

309
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,639
There's also a letter here.

310
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,730
(Mu Dan, )

311
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,040
(I don't have anyone to rely on.)

312
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,152
(I have no choice but to beg you in the end)

313
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,912
(to tell my family what happened to me.)

314
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,359
(If my brother, Liu Lang, comes to find me, )

315
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,432
(please treat him well.)

316
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,600
This is bad. Something has happened to Shan Yi.

317
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:05,850
Da Fu, hurry!

318
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,712
(I only have)

319
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,479
(two people I miss in life.)

320
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,712
(One, I hope everything will go well for you.)

321
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,952
(Two, I hope Liu Lang)

322
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,791
(can be healthy.)

323
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:18,993
(Take care.)

324
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:20,954
(Take care.)

325
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,520
Vile woman who killed your own husband.

326
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,479
Since you have surrendered,

327
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,519
why aren't you kneeling and admitting your crime?

328
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,912
The victim, Wang Qing,

329
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,952
deserves to be punished.

330
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,071
I might have killed someone

331
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,000
but I've punished someone in Heaven's place.

332
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,111
You're insane for saying such outrageous things.

333
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,050
- Someone. - Yes!

334
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,679
Do you dare

335
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,351
murder someone in court?

336
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,850
You are really reckless. This is intolerable!

337
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,271
Intolerable?

338
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,511
A lowly person

339
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,192
can only be trampled and crushed

340
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,119
by the norms of the world.

341
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,351
This is what's intolerable.

342
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,632
My fate in life

343
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,912
has always been determined by others.

344
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,691
In the end,

345
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,800
I still need to die

346
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,160
in this world with unfair norms.

347
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,872
I can't choose how I live my life

348
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:16,999
but I can choose

349
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,751
to die with a clear conscience.

350
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,192
- Someone is dying. - Move.

351
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,491
Sheng Yi!

352
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,360
Sheng Yi!

353
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,511
Sheng Yi!

354
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,632
Sheng Yi!

355
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,992
Sheng Yi!

356
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,912
Sheng Yi!

357
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,192
Sheng Yi!

358
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,831
Sheng Yi!

359
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,872
Sheng Yi!

360
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:55,282
Wu Niang, if you follow me,

361
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,880
you might still live a difficult life

362
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:58,392
but I can guarantee

363
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,232
that no one will bully or humiliate you again.

364
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,511
Are you willing to live with me?

365
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,632
You are no longer Qin Wu'er now.

366
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,351
You are Qin Sheng Yi.

367
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,351
Sheng Yi!

368
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,351
Sheng Yi!

369
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,551
Sheng Yi!

370
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,271
Sheng Yi!

371
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,432
Sheng Yi!

372
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,330
Sheng Yi,

373
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,351
Fragrant Sleeves

374
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,192
will bloom again next spring.

375
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,031
When the time comes,

376
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,051
I will visit you again.

377
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,040
(Qin Sheng Yi's Grave)

378
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,585
You must always visit me in my dreams

379
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,432
to speak with me,

380
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,890
all right?

381
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,831
Sheng Yi.

382
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,050
Next life.

383
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,551
Everything will go well for you in your next life

384
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,591
without any worries.

385
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,793
If Li Xing sees someone burning books in my residence,

386
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,992
he will surely write poems to scold me again.

387
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,199
The incident where Sheng Yi killed her husband was written into a story.

388
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,672
Everyone saw her as a vicious woman

389
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,392
and wanted to see her getting executed.

390
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,160
I can't bear to see those who know nothing about the truth

391
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,732
scold her and misunderstand her.

392
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:35,026
Is that why

393
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,171
you bought all the books and burned them?

394
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:52,348
If Sheng Yi knows about this in the underworld,

395
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,192
she will be happy

396
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,632
to see what you did for her.

397
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,111
The last time I met her,

398
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,639
she was standing over there.

399
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,530
She stood there

400
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,679
and said many things to me.

401
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,472
That was when I understood

402
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,971
I was only lucky to survive until today.

403
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,231
Not everyone has an opportunity to choose.

404
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,111
There are many people

405
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,079
who vanish without a trace just like Sheng Yi

406
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,872
yet no one cares

407
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,010
or feels sad for her.

408
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,192
Women in this world

409
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,551
are like this cup.

410
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,952
Whether

411
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,160
it's sweet wine or bitter water being poured into it,

412
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,152
it still has to tolerate it.

413
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,619
Meanwhile, the hand that holds the cup

414
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,152
can simply pour out its contents without saying a word

415
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,992
and crush this weak cup.

416
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:12,409
Do you think

417
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,591
men are the hand that holds the cup?

418
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,791
What crushes the cup

419
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,791
is the norm that prioritizes men over women.

420
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:31,616
So,

421
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,192
you are going to write this story yourself.

422
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,784
Yes.

423
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:40,458
I'm going to write Sheng Yi's story

424
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:42,089
from a woman's point of view

425
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,800
and let the world knows how evil Wang Qing was

426
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,720
and how difficult it is to live as a woman.

427
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,610
What about the ending?

428
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,771
Have you thought about it?

429
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,392
Qin Wu'er is dead

430
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,240
but Qin Sheng Yi will get a divorce and be independent in the story.

431
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,200
She will live happily for the rest of her life.

432
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,551
I hope an ending like this

433
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,690
can give a sliver of courage

434
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,650
for women who are trapped in the same situation

435
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,712
so they can cherish themselves

436
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,311
and their lives.

437
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,425
As for me,

438
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,192
I will manage Blooming Abode well.

439
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,250
I want everyone to know that women

440
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,591
can also do something great.

441
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,050
The woman I respected most in the past was my aunt.

442
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,400
I thought she was the most unrestrained woman in this world.

443
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,370
Now that I've seen you,

444
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,080
I realize you are someone who can live well all by yourself

445
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,712
yet you have the courage

446
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,672
and a compassionate heart.

447
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,432
I'm not as great as you described.

448
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,792
I just think that all women share the same fate.

449
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,632
We can only live independently

450
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,311
if we support each other.

451
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,800
- Here you go. - Thank you.

452
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,050
- Come again. - Take care.

453
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,111
We have had no noble customers recently.

454
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,251
We also have two customers who canceled their orders.

455
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,651
This.

456
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,560
Rent in the Eastern market is more expensive than in the Western market.

457
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,011
What should we do if this goes on?

458
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,001
Da Fu, take care of the shop for me.

459
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,136
I'll go and ask these customers who canceled their orders

460
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,760
why they don't want our flowers anymore.

461
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,611
Rose.

462
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,610
Flower Bird Envoy. Lord Tang.

463
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,775
Are you here to buy something

464
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,712
or are you organizing a banquet?

465
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,656
It's the birthday of her favorite dancing courtesan.

466
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,441
Help him pick a few rare flowers

467
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,496
and deliver them to Huanyun Pavilion three days later.

468
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,613
Sure.

469
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,840
What is the favorite color

470
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,111
of the person you like?

471
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,119
Is there a fragrance that should be avoided?

472
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,896
The brighter the color, the better. The stronger the scent, the better.

473
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,991
I understand. Please take a look at these first.

474
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,152
Tang, you are right.

475
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,640
There aren't many people

476
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,152
visiting Mu Dan's shop indeed.

477
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,831
Have you heard about anything, Lord Tang?

478
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,432
Did the Princess' fiance

479
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,311
come to see you a few days ago?

480
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,115
That's...

481
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,457
The princess organized a flower banquet a few days ago

482
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,121
and invited every noble lady in the city.

483
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,712
She kept giving hints to others in her words

484
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,959
that anyone who buys flowers from Blooming Abode

485
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,992
would no longer be able to visit King Ning's Residence anymore.

486
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,791
What is this?

487
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,672
Liu Chang was drunk.

488
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,831
I'm unrelated to the incident.

489
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:17,160
The princess has been charmed

490
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,921
and couldn't affect her fiance's heart

491
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,721
so she vent her frustration on you instead.

492
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,071
Sui Zhi, I came here because of you.

493
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:24,530
I know.

494
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,192
Go and pick your flowers.

495
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,211
Da Fu, serve him. Quick.

496
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,051
The money you make from this order will go to me.

497
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,031
This pot is just nice.

498
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,921
- I want five pots of these. - All right.

499
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:46,481
- Give me five pots of the purple ones as well. - All right.

500
00:30:47,104 --> 00:30:48,245
Your shop just opened

501
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:50,160
and you already have the princess oppressing you.

502
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,664
What do you plan to do in the future?

503
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,279
The princess can stop the nobles from buying something

504
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,600
but she can't control

505
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,519
what flowers are used to decorate the places

506
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,719
frequented by nobles, right?

507
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:03,039
Not to mention the places frequented by people from various social classes.

508
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,815
Pingkang Pleasure House is just beside the Eastern market.

509
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,055
Besides Pingkang Pleasure House,

510
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,290
there are also numerous taverns and dance houses.

511
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,640
I'm sure you know more about them than me, Lord Jiang.

512
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,280
A crisis is also an opportunity.

513
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,971
It seems like I'm worried about nothing.

514
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,071
Lord Jiang is also my investor.

515
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,392
I know that besides Huanyun Pavilion,

516
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,992
you also bought a place

517
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,370
called Huren Tavern.

518
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,160
Since you need flowers to decorate the place,

519
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,472
why not order your flowers from Blooming Abode?

520
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,591
I can give you

521
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,351
a 10% discount compared to other shops.

522
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,511
Not taking advantage of something isn't my style.

523
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,690
However,

524
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,751
I want a 20% discount.

525
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,591
You do not disappoint me indeed, Lord Jiang.

526
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,912
You are still as evil as usual.

527
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,661
I'm already being reasonable

528
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:56,741
by not asking you for extra dividends every month.

529
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,971
Fine. A 20% discount then. It's decided.

530
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,495
I'll deliver the flowers at the beginning of every month

531
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,110
according to Miss Yun's orders.

532
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,726
When there's a celebration and more flowers are needed,

533
00:32:19,806 --> 00:32:21,078
I'll prepare them earlier.

534
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,570
If you have any other instructions, do tell me, Miss Yun.

535
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,152
I heard Old Lady Tang's flowers during her birthday banquet were praised.

536
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,200
Coincidentally, Huanyun Pavilion wants to change its decoration.

537
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,959
Do you have any ideas, Mu Dan?

538
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,152
Don't simply touch them.

539
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,284
Your hand.

540
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,360
Pleasure house customers

541
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,791
prefers novelty.

542
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,632
Can you bring me upstairs to show me your dance courtesans?

543
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,831
If every leading dancer can have a flower exclusive to them,

544
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,519
When they form, the flowers

545
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,872
will change every night.

546
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,251
Do you think that a novelty?

547
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,751
This is a good idea.

548
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,091
I can give it a try.

549
00:32:58,539 --> 00:32:59,570
This way, please.

550
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,640
Don't accuse me!

551
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,400
Everyone ate the snack yesterday.

552
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,411
Why were you the only one who had a rash?

553
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,930
Miss Yun!

554
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:18,002
No one tried to harm you.

555
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,472
Have you not been cleaning your face before you sleep for a few days?

556
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,931
I was drunk and forgot to do it.

557
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,856
All of you are applying powder on your face every day.

558
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,400
If you slack at night without washing them off before you sleep

559
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,999
and apply new powder

560
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,432
before removing the old powder,

561
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,031
your face will be ruined

562
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,610
if you repeat this practice.

563
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,920
Everyone, the powder is roughly ground

564
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,143
and contains a lot of lead.

565
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,560
If you use it every day,

566
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,831
your face will get worse.

567
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,632
Every courtesan must apply powder when they perform.

568
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,392
Good powder is expensive.

569
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,691
How can they afford to use them every day?

570
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,297
With orders from Pingkang Pleasure House,

571
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:10,080
taverns, and dance houses around the city,

572
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,839
there's no need to worry about the shop in the Eastern market closing down.

573
00:34:12,863 --> 00:34:15,574
However, the revenue is still 40% lower than previously.

574
00:34:17,311 --> 00:34:19,521
There's still no solution to the princess' constraints.

575
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,931
We should focus our efforts on this instead.

576
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,130
We will attract more common people to buy from us

577
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,671
so sales of the shop in the Western market can improve.

578
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:30,496
Mu Dan has found a new business opportunity

579
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,280
after visiting Huanyun Pavilion a few times.

580
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,175
There are many business opportunities

581
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,661
when it comes to people.

582
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:36,755
For example,

583
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,392
we need bath beads when we clean our faces and take a bath.

584
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,699
After taking a bath, we need to use fragrance powder.

585
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,400
We need to apply hair cream to our hair.

586
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,159
When we go out and meet friends,

587
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,231
we need to put on powder and rouge.

588
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,872
Look at this bath bead.

589
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,210
It is sold in Western markets

590
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,411
but it is still too expensive for the common people.

591
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,840
If we can develop

592
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,191
cheaper bath beads,

593
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,111
wouldn't we benefit more people?

594
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:02,503
Perhaps we can

595
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:05,503
improve on the bath bead formula recorded in the "Thousand Gold Formula".

596
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:08,031
Sure! That's wonderful.

597
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,280
When we were poor,

598
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,331
my mother was always reluctant to use bath beads

599
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,240
and saved it for me.

600
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,411
I was thinking

601
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,931
how good it would be to have cheaper bath beads.

602
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,680
My intention in running a business is to hope

603
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,631
that poor and wealthy people

604
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,472
can all see something beautiful.

605
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,291
However, Jiang Chang Yang is right about one thing.

606
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,952
Most people

607
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,631
are busy making a living.

608
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,320
They have no time to appreciate

609
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,840
the useless beauty of fresh flowers.

610
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,551
Growing flowers requires patience.

611
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,952
Take me for example.

612
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,312
I'm usually tired from treating patients all day.

613
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:44,239
When I go home, I don't feel like taking care of plants anymore.

614
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,320
I used to think

615
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,878
that there was only one form of beauty.

616
00:35:47,902 --> 00:35:48,931
However, I didn't know

617
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,560
that a clean face and a refreshing smell

618
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,480
is also a form of beauty to the common people.

619
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,959
The people

620
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,200
are Blooming Abode's largest customer base.

621
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,491
If we do our makeup products well and build a reputation

622
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,570
so everyone in the city can use our products,

623
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,170
In the future, even if we have princesses troubling us

624
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,312
and no nobles to patronize us,

625
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,689
Blooming Abode will still be in business.

626
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:11,823
Yes.

627
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,623
Zhu Fu doesn't have

628
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,731
this wealthy fragrance on you.

629
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,090
Chuan Yu. Come here.

630
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:43,849
Young Master.

631
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,832
Is there a strong fragrance on me?

632
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,491
No.

633
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,371
Maybe I'm used to it because I've been with you for too long.

634
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,851
Young Master, take a whiff. Come on.

635
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,210
Take a whiff and see if I smell good.

636
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:10,632
You finally took a bath?

637
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,591
Da Fu gave me three bath beads.

638
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:16,975
She even asked me to tell her which one I prefer after using them.

639
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,002
She is using you as a poison tester

640
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:20,682
yet you're still feeling happy about it.

641
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,952
I didn't see Miss He giving you one.

642
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,952
I heard this from Da Fu.

643
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,881
Miss He has been dressing up

644
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,551
when she goes to the shop.

645
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,371
She used fragrance powder, hair cream,

646
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:35,050
beauty powder, and rouge without missing anything.

647
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,792
What's that saying?

648
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,431
A woman makes up for the person she likes.

649
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,079
I wonder

650
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,559
which gentle and well-spoken customer Miss He has met

651
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,511
at the shop recently.

652
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,090
Jiang Chang Yang! What are you doing?

653
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,371
You scared me.

654
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,051
I came to remind you

655
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,610
to prepare the wager and don't chicken out.

656
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,511
I'm not marrying someone. Why should I prepare it?

657
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,450
Why are you putting on all this makeup?

658
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,080
Blooming Abode is going to launch new makeup products.

659
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,432
I have to use my face to experiment with them.

660
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,111
I must try them one by one.

661
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,511
Forget about the wager.

662
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,680
Moreover, if you dare scare me again,

663
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,191
I'll close the back door

664
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,872
so you can't have any supper.

665
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,832
Help me see

666
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,231
which color looks nice.

667
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,811
They are all good.

668
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,231
Whatever. Asking you is useless.

669
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,120
Since Cheng Lang became the assistant of Luoyang's regent,

670
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,016
the families who imitated the Chen family by claiming the farmers' fields

671
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,120
are showing some restraint.

672
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:34,792
Luoyang's farmers have regained their fields.

673
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,440
All of them are working hard and waiting for the autumn harvest.

674
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,551
Many people are involved in the Chen family case

675
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,832
but we still can't find evidence of them working with King Ning.

676
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,690
Your brother is too sly

677
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,600
and removes himself from any involvement.

678
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,771
However, the peace of a kingdom

679
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,130
depends on its officials, fields, money, and army.

680
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,162
The corrupt officials who took the fields

681
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,632
have been dealt with.

682
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,280
The treasury's situation is improving.

683
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,891
There is great progress in our plan.

684
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,451
Next,

685
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,575
we just need to focus our energy

686
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,832
on taking this final step.

687
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,832
We can look forward

688
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,920
to accusing King Ning of his crimes.

689
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,679
After the princess gets engaged to Liu Chang again,

690
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,240
King Ning has been getting along with other nobles.

691
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,392
He is finally getting impatient now

692
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,080
and wants to meddle with the appointment of officials.

693
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,071
If we are watching too closely,

694
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,231
he might be suspicious.

695
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,392
Instead of stopping him,

696
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,891
why don't we

697
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,352
just give him one?

698
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,752
Have you thought about a suitable position?

699
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,832
Vice Commissioner of Transport.

700
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,720
Lu Chu replaced Minister Hu

701
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
after he was removed from the Ministry of Revenue.

702
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,655
The Vice Commissioner of Transport has power

703
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,792
but with Lu Chu watching,

704
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,432
nothing bad will happen.

705
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,681
That's right.

706
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,952
If they are going to do something,

707
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,120
it would mean handing over evidence of their crime directly to us.

708
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,472
Mu Dan works well with you

709
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,320
like she has known you for many years.

710
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,912
She has helped us so much.

711
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,851
Did you help me thank her?

712
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,231
What are you talking about?

713
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,912
It's all thanks to my perfect plan.

714
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,591
Someone like her

715
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,364
will rather accept a piece of gold

716
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,031
than a word of thanks.
