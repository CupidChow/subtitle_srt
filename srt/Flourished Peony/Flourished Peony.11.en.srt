<i>[Episode 11]</i>

3
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,640
Wuniang, I miss you so much.

4
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,959
Wuniang.

5
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,120
I really miss you so much.

6
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,040
- She's not Qin Wuniang.
- So many people here.

7
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,159
I truly can't leave…

8
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,448
Let her go.

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,680
You are no longer Qin Wuniang.

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,159
You are Qin Shengyi.

11
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,879
Don't fear that man anymore.

12
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,120
We are chatting.

13
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,319
What does it have to do with you?

14
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,079
That divorce agreement worth ten strings

15
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,760
is still in my house.

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,640
The person who has nothing
to do with Shengyi now is you.

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,639
My lady, I was wrong.

18
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,000
I have known my mistake.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,560
Do you really plan to

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,400
go on without a home or husband?

21
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,199
My lady, I truly can't leave you.

22
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,159
I-I truly can't live without you.

23
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,879
Of course, you can't live without her.

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Without her, no one would
work for you without complaint.

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,439
Without her, no one would

26
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,879
endure your beating.

27
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,000
But without you,

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,759
she will only get better and better,

29
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,759
and her business will grow bigger and bigger.

30
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,560
It was never her who needed you,

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,439
but you who can't be without her.

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,240
My lady.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,479
In the past, the business was bad,

34
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,159
so I could only drown my sorrows in alcohol.

35
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,080
But when I beat you,

36
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,120
I felt painful.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,879
My lady, I was so sorry.

38
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,879
I will never

39
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,879
beat you again.

40
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,639
Think about it.

41
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,240
When we just got married,

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,360
I treated you so well.

43
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,400
We also had our harmonious days.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,439
He's said this to you

45
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,719
more than once, hasn't he?

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,439
A beast is a beast.

47
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,840
How can it change its nature?

48
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,639
Shengyi.

49
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,719
Don't be fooled by his sweet-talking.

50
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,360
You'd better go.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,800
Don't stay here

52
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,159
and never come to me again.

53
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,439
My lady.

54
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,599
I really can't live without you.

55
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,599
Get lost.

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,896
Get lost.

57
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,400
Don't be afraid. It's okay now.

58
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,439
Xinfeng wine is free to try.

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,479
- Lady, take the money.
- Okay.

60
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,240
This is the second pot that I've bought.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,680
This flower is not easy to take care of.

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,759
Here, take this. Come again next time.

63
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,952
Okay.

64
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,479
Don't water it too much.

65
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,728
Alright.

66
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,280
Fresh flowers newly arrived.

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,719
Come and see the reasonably priced peony.

68
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,840
My lady will surely be delighted.

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Come and take a look at the flowers.

<i>[Shengyi]</i>

71
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
Previously,

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,480
I can never write my name properly.

73
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,800
Today I met Wang Qing

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,120
with frustrated look,

75
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,399
I felt a bit of triumph.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,920
See,

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,360
I can write it

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,560
now.

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,879
From now on,

80
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,120
we will get better and better.

81
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,879
Mudan.

82
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,680
What kind of incense are you making?

83
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,000
I've never seen it before.

84
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,240
It's called Baikexiang.

85
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
My mother taught me this.

86
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,399
I can create different patterns

87
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,879
according to personal preference.

88
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,199
This incense can also tell time,

89
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,360
and can be used

90
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,800
to calm the mind when making it.

91
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,160
We can't afford expensive incense powder,

92
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
but we can still pursue some refined pleasures

93
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
to make our days

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,120
more exquisite.

96
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,248
Peace…

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,880
Joy…

98
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,600
What a great meaning.

99
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,896
Here.

100
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,079
You've worked so hard to make this incense.

101
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,879
I must save it for a special day,

102
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,680
otherwise, I won't burn it.

103
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,759
If you don't

104
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,279
burn it after being made,

105
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,800
it would become a useless item.

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Don't worry.

107
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,959
Making it

108
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,319
already calms my mind.

109
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
Use it.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,879
I'll make another for you
after you've used it up.

111
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,759
Mudan.

112
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,879
Wait for me.

113
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,568
Mudan.

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,879
Shengyi.

115
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,304
This…

116
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,959
I'm now living so fully and happily,

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,959
all thanks to you.

118
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,759
I have nothing of value to repay you,

119
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,160
so I took the first money I earned

120
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
and bought the cloths

121
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,399
to make this dress.

122
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,879
I hope you would like it.

123
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,279
Your clothes are all torn,

124
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,040
yet you still thought of
buying such a nice dress for me.

125
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,639
Shengyi, thank you.

126
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,879
- I will buy you clothes too.
- I…

127
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,360
Let's take a day off tomorrow,

128
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
and go out for a stroll.

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
We've earned money,

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
so we should go experience

131
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,360
the prosperity of Chang'an.

132
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,480
Okay.

133
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,040
Youshi Hall facial cream nourishes the skin.

134
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
Come on, Shengyi.

135
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,040
Bravo!

136
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,319
Bravo!

137
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,480
One more.

138
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,600
Bravo!

139
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Don't.

140
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,360
Just watch. Save some money.

141
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,800
Let's go look over there.

142
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,040
Bravo!

143
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,079
Well played.

144
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,439
Bravo!

145
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,959
Wishful sachet.

146
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,704
Take a sniff.

147
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,752
It smells good.

148
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,439
For you.

149
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,920
- Take care.
- Thank you, Mudan.

150
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,319
Don't mention it.

151
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,959
I'm glad you like it.

152
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,959
It's really beautiful.

153
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Well drawn.

154
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,279
I'd like to ask her to draw

155
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,600
a portrait of my mother for me.

156
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,639
Anyone you wish to draw?

157
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,976
We can do it together.

158
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,439
My father and mother

159
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,159
are only doting on their son.

160
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,480
In the entire family,
only my sixth brother is kind to me.

161
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,960
Sixth brother?

162
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,519
You have a younger brother?

163
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,200
Why have you never told me?

164
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,039
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

165
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,039
Although my sixth brother
can't read, just like me,

166
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,600
he is very clever and sensible.

167
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,559
In order not to let my mother sell me,

168
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,279
he himself was not in good health,

169
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,360
but still went to the tavern
to help in the kitchen.

170
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,720
When I got married,

171
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,799
he was the only one in the family
who was reluctant to let me go,

172
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,279
crying and asking me to go back often.

173
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,320
But Wang Qing would not allow me to go back.

174
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,600
I didn't see him once in two years.

175
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,679
Now you are free.

176
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,159
Whenever you want to see your younger brother,

177
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,840
you can go back at any time.

178
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,840
Indeed.

179
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,919
I was thinking

180
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,279
when I save up some more money,

181
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,279
I could

182
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,840
also bring him to Chang'an

183
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,279
to live a good life.

184
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,624
Okay.

185
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,399
But for now, you can draw

186
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,000
a picture of you two enjoying the flowers.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
When you miss him,

188
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
you can look at it.

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
When we make money

190
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,519
and open a shop,

191
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,279
then you can return home with money,

192
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,360
showing off to those

193
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,639
who looked down on you.

194
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,039
Let them see how successful Shengyi is

195
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,440
in Chang'an.

196
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,944
Okay.

197
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,240
That's amazing? See.

198
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,320
Look at mine. It's not growing well.

199
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,799
- Selling inferior flowers.
- Right.

200
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,240
- Mine is the same.
- Everyone.

201
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,559
Everyone, what happened?

202
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,080
It's her.

203
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,480
It's this evil woman

204
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,360
intentionally selling us the sick flowers.

205
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,720
Everyone,

206
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,279
when the Huaixiuxiang was sold,

207
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,759
it was definitely not sick.

208
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,200
There must be some misunderstanding.

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Who can tell me what exactly happened?

210
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,440
- You…
- Everyone, please make way.

211
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,559
When you just set up your stall,

212
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,879
I bought this flower.

213
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,200
But it's withered within four days.

214
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,080
My wife

215
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,519
scolded me for not taking good care of it.

216
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,159
A couple of days ago, I bought another pot.

217
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,320
Look at this pot now.

218
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,960
I'm afraid it's about to wilt again.

219
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,472
I'll take a look.

220
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,960
You must water it too much.

221
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,360
The water collects at the root.

222
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,960
You can give me this flower.

223
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
I can revive it

224
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,440
and return a healthy one to you tomorrow.

225
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,960
But this other one

226
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,399
is completely withered.

227
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,799
I can't do anything to save it.

228
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,919
Can you tell me how you cared for it before?

229
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,039
Well…

230
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,759
Your flower had a problem,

231
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,320
yet you're blaming us.

232
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,480
If one or two people didn't care for it well,

233
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,240
but so many flowers are withered,

234
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,600
don't try to shirk the responsibility.

235
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,559
Lady, I bought

236
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,919
this flower when you just started your stall.

237
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,960
You said

238
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
that the flower would bloom for half a month.

239
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,360
Look, the situation of the others

240
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,320
- is similar to mine.
- Yes.

241
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,639
No one's flowers survive more than ten days.

242
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,759
We hope you can give us an explanation.

243
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Madam, flowers are living things.

244
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,039
There are many reasons for wilting.

245
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,639
I must check them one by one.

246
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,679
Let me check on your flower.

247
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,000
Cut the chatter.

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,639
The flower is dead.

249
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,919
What else is there to see?

250
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,759
- Refund.
- Refund.

251
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,720
- Right.
- Refund.

252
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,600
Are you trying to pass the buck?

253
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Are you trying to shrink responsibility
and not refund our money?

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,440
I have no such intention.

255
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,679
Please listen to me.

256
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,399
Don't listen to her.

257
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,240
Selling inferior flowers, cheating the people.

258
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,559
and refusing to refund the money.

259
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,759
Today, we must teach her a lesson.

260
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,279
- Exactly.
- Smash her stall.

261
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:07,799
- Smash it.
- Right.

262
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,080
- Smash it
- Smash it.

263
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,200
- Don't smash my flowers.
- Get out of the way.

264
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,320
If no refund, then smash everything.

265
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,200
- Don't smash my flowers.
- Smash them all.

266
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,240
Give me a refund.

267
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,000
- Smash the flowers.
- Stop it.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
- Stop it
- Smash them!

269
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,000
- Smash them!
- Stop it.

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,720
- Don't smash my flowers.
- Stop it.

271
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,480
- Move!
- You can't smash them.

272
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,440
All of these are our effort.

273
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,399
- Don't smash.
- Go away.

274
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,639
- Shengyi.
- Mudan.

275
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,879
- Are you okay?
- Move.

276
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,840
Stop smashing.

277
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,159
I'll refund.

278
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,480
I'll refund.

279
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,759
So many flowers.

280
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,879
If we refund them all,
our business will be ruined.

281
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,000
Customers,

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,159
I know as a merchant,

283
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,840
if one wishes to last long in business,

284
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,080
one must value reputation.

285
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,279
I didn't mean to cause this.

286
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,399
But since you bought the flowers

287
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,039
from me,

288
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,639
I will certainly take full responsibility.

289
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,039
The peony flowers may be withered,

290
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,600
but my character will not.

291
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,200
I assure all of you,

292
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,200
just return your Huaixiuxiang to me,

293
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
Once I clear the stock and recover the funds,

294
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,879
I'll return all the money for the flowers

295
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,039
to you all.

296
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,399
None of us is wealthy,

297
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,879
we are all needing money.

298
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,600
Why should we wait for you?

299
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
Refund it today.

300
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,159
Yes, refund it today.

301
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,320
Refund it all today.

302
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,639
We don't have much money left.

303
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,440
The next batch of flowers
is still being cultivated.

304
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,080
Okay.

305
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
I will refund it all today.

306
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,519
Please wait here.

307
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,759
I'll go back to get the money now.

308
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,679
If you run away,

309
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,879
then what should we do?

310
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,919
I won't do so.

311
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,600
We must take them back with us,

312
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,759
watch them take out the money.

313
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,480
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

314
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,039
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

315
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,080
- Shengyi.
- Let's go.

316
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,840
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

317
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

318
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,240
- Hurry up.
- What's wrong?

319
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,519
Everyone, look.

320
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,159
Dishonest traders are selling inferior goods.

321
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,399
Everyone, remember them.

322
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,159
Don't be deceived by them again.

323
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,960
- Women are no good at business.
- You!

324
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
Going outside all day long,

325
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,919
how can they be considered nice women?

326
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,919
The authorities should have

327
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,360
caught them and locked them up.

328
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
This is going too far.

329
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,279
Wang Qing leading the trouble

330
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,879
is all my fault.

331
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,600
It's my fault, Mudan.

332
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,216
It's alright.

333
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,679
It's just a few rumors.

334
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,480
When we restore our reputation later,

335
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,720
we will surely change everyone's view.

336
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,759
Don't worry. Calm down.

337
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
- What are you doing?
- Hurry up.

338
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
Don't dilly-dally.

339
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Are you thinking of running away?

340
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,960
Just follow them and get the money back.

341
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,080
Hurry up.

342
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,320
- Don't push her.
- Everyone, come and watch.

343
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:54,200
Dishonest traders are selling inferior goods.

344
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,120
Everyone, remember them.

345
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,639
Don't be deceived by them again.

346
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,519
My lord.

347
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,399
I can kill the fish.

348
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,720
But I really can't

349
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,279
tease the fish.

350
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,679
I've been teasing this fish for half a day,

351
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,679
but I haven't even seen it at all.

352
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,559
What's so special about this fish anyway?

353
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,919
This governor of Yuanzhou

354
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,120
specially presented this gold carp,

355
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,399
begging me to offer it to His Majesty.

356
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,399
He said it's entirely golden,

357
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,720
with dragon patterns on its belly,

358
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,120
which is a sign of good omen.

359
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,240
This fish is timid and easily frightened,

360
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,879
always hiding under the rocks.

361
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,879
If you want to see it first,

362
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,440
well, let's not make any noise

363
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,840
and wait quietly.

364
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,679
Hurry up.

365
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,679
Don't dilly-dally.

366
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,720
Don't try to run away. We're all watching.

367
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
Back yard again?

368
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,159
The evil neighbor disturbs me.

369
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,559
According to law,
how much fine should be imposed?

370
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,559
Hurry up, thinking of running away?

371
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,720
Don't touch her anymore.

372
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,879
The people living nearby

373
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,399
are all high officials and nobles.

374
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,559
Making a commotion here

375
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,240
might not be good.

376
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
What's there to fear?

377
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,519
She's not from a noble or wealthy family.

378
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,200
We're here to get our money back
from the dishonest traders.

379
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,720
- Shengyi.
- If the officials come, we are still in the right.

380
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,360
Everyone, I never go back on my promise.

381
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,559
I'm going in to get the money.

382
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,039
Please wait here.

383
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,919
You can climb walls.

384
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,519
If you run away, whom shall we find?

385
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,720
I'll stay here and wait with you.

386
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,559
Rest assured.

387
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,639
Since she has said she will give a refund,

388
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,679
we don't need to be aggressive here.

389
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,279
This is her house.

390
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,000
If we barge in by force,

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,399
even a justified cause will seem unjustified.

392
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,000
If she reports it to the yamen,

393
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,960
we may even end up being beaten with sticks.

394
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,440
- Right.
- We should just wait here.

395
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,720
- Yes.
- Lady, hurry up.

396
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,599
Thank you.

397
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,000
- Hurry.
- Go.

398
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,519
Go.

399
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,440
Shengyi, assign numbers to them.

400
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,160
I'm going in to get the money.

401
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,720
The madam who just spoke up for us

402
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
is a kind person.

403
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,680
If Wang Qing starts trouble again,

404
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,720
ask her to speak for us.

405
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,888
Don't be afraid.

406
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,039
Understood, leave.

407
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,480
My lord.

408
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,759
All the flowers sold by Lady He have withered,

409
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,319
and her customers are causing trouble here.

410
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,640
She agreed to refund the money,

411
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,160
asking them to wait outside.

412
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,056
Refund?

413
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
Then I'll lose my capital.

414
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,559
After she went back,

415
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,759
the group of people outside
have been shouting nonstop.

416
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,960
I'm afraid they will barge in

417
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
and do some aggro.

418
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,039
It would be good if she could be unharmed.

419
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,839
Yet you still only care about money.

420
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,279
My lord, you are truly cruel.

421
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,279
I'm flattered.

422
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,160
He Weifang is cunning and shrewd,

423
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
treasuring money as life.

424
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,720
No one could make her suffer a loss.

425
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,720
How long has she been back in her house?

426
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,559
Has she run away?

427
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,400
It's normal for these flowers to wither.

428
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,759
Ignorant women!

429
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,759
- What good can they possibly grow?
- Exactly.

430
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,240
This woman doesn't know how to grow flowers.

431
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,599
Why selling flower?

432
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,640
Might as well sell her body.

433
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
Exactly.

434
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,039
A pot of flowers costs eighty wens.

435
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,599
It withers after just a few days of care.

436
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,079
She's so despicable and unreliable.

437
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,680
Right, despicable and unreliable.

438
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,880
This is not a peony at all.

439
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,200
We have been deceived by this woman.

440
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,759
Right, she is a swindle.

441
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,240
Don't ever again

442
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,039
trust these indecent women again.

443
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,960
She's disobedient

444
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,359
and committing fraud.

445
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Stop slandering Mudan.

446
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,519
Qin Wuniang, she is so cunning.

447
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,400
I know

448
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,319
you have learned from a bad example.

449
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,599
Today,

450
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,519
if she can't get the money,

451
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,160
then we'll smash this place up.

452
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,000
- Right, smash it up.
- Everyone, go in and smash it.

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
- Let's smash it.
- Smash it.

454
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,960
Just a pot of flowers, it's not worth it.

455
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,920
The neighbors are all nobles.

456
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,032
<i>[Peace and Joy]</i>

457
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:28,320
<i>♫ Smiling as the storm stir the dust ♫</i>

458
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,271
<i>♫ Flowers should bloom proudly ♫</i>

459
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:33,984
<i>♫ Reflecting the color of the sky ♫</i>

460
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,872
<i>♫ Never withering ♫</i>

461
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:41,888
<i>♫ Do not fail the varied fragrance ♫</i>

462
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,640
Mother.

463
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,079
Wait for this incense to burn out,

464
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,920
I will go handle it myself.

465
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,881
<i>♫ Flowers should bloom proudly ♫</i>

466
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:08,245
<i>♫ Reflecting the color of the sky ♫</i>

467
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:10,296
<i>♫ Never withering ♫</i>

468
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:14,079
<i>♫ Do not fail the varied fragrance ♫</i>

469
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,599
I can't wait any longer.

470
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,680
If she doesn't come out, don't blame me.

471
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,759
Mudan.

472
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,920
Wait no more.

473
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,319
- Smash it.
- Right.

474
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,039
- Smash it and enter.
- Right.

475
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,640
The commotion from outside is growing louder.

476
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,319
I can hardly hold them back anymore.

477
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,559
How's it going?

478
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,319
Does she need my help?

479
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,799
She'll be out soon.

480
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,799
You go find the account book first,

481
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,000
so you can check the accounts later.

482
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,240
Is she alright?

483
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,160
Very well.

484
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,640
She is someone

485
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
who can solve everything. Go ahead.

486
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,079
- Open the door.
- Hurry up and open it.

487
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,079
Open the door.

488
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,759
- We've been waiting for so long.
- What are you doing?

489
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,400
If you don't have money, just come out
and follow us to the yamen.

490
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,960
Who knows what she's doing in there?

491
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,279
She might have escaped.

492
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,359
Please wait a moment longer.

493
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,160
My lord, it's Lady Qin's ex-husband
who's instigating this event.

494
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,480
He deliberately incited
customers to cause trouble.

495
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,880
Everyone, smash the door.

496
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,960
- Go.
- Don't.

497
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,976
- Smash it.
- Calm down.

498
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:04,400
She must have run off with the money.

499
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,839
- Mudan is coming out.
- Move.

500
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,559
- Check if there's a back door.
- Mudan is gathering the money.

501
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,880
- Move.
- Don't rush, wait a bit longer.

502
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,599
- Move.
- Go away.

503
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,240
Wang Qing, if you hate me, just come at me.

504
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,720
Don't take it out on others.

505
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,240
That wretch coaxed you into leaving me,

506
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,480
I won't let her go.

507
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,640
Unless you are willing to come back
and live with me.

508
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,240
Impossible.

509
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,880
Make way!

510
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,160
Why standing there?

511
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,400
Don't think that hiding in there

512
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,720
means all is well.

513
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,799
Everyone, come with me and charge in.

514
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,240
Take away all the valuable things in the house.

515
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,400
To get back our money.

516
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,119
- That's right.
- Let's go.

517
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,319
- Hurry.
- My lord.

518
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,000
- Stop.
- You really just watch by and not helping?

519
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,920
The commotion in Luoyang is bigger than this.

520
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,279
- Mudan can handle this.
- Move.

521
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,752
Stop!

522
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,559
I already get the money.

523
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,279
Who overturned the table just now?

524
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,119
The teacup is worth ten wens,

525
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,119
and the table fifty wens.

526
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,200
I will deduct it from his spending money.

527
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,000
Who else wants to smash it?

528
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,912
Please feel free.

529
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,240
Who are you trying to scare?

530
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,519
Smashing a dishonest trader's things

531
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,400
is to uphold justice.

532
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,480
To uphold justice?

533
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,799
So it will give you money?

534
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,119
Just now at my flower stall,

535
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,559
the peonies you smashed

536
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,839
all must be compensated for at the set price.

537
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,960
If it goes to the yamen,

538
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,440
I'm afraid
the compensation will be even greater.

539
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
- I told you.
- She wouldn't deceive others.

540
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,960
- You didn't smash it just now, did you?
- Everyone.

541
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,440
Wang Qing has a personal grudge against me,

542
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,920
so he incited you all
to come here and cause trouble.

543
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,400
Don't be used by him.

544
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,319
Just listen to me

545
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,640
and don't act rashly.

546
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,799
You will get back the refund money.

547
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,799
I want

548
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,880
to run the business

549
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,160
for a long time.

550
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,880
I also want to make friends with you.

551
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,960
Harmony brings wealth to all.

552
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,039
Everyone,

553
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,240
please think it carefully.

554
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,279
I knew it.

555
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,799
This lady will keep her word.

556
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,920
What are you making a fuss about?

557
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,039
Exactly.

558
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,759
Madam, you go first.

559
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,640
The show is over, let's go.

560
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,880
Here is your money. Take it.

561
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,384
Do I let you go?

562
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,559
In the backyard of the Jiang Mansion,

563
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,960
a group of people barged in

564
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,000
and even smashed the door.

565
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,559
If any flowers, tiles,

566
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,720
or walls get damaged,

567
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,880
this money for the repairs

568
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
will be deducted from your monthly salary.

569
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,280
No, My lord.

570
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,512
Next, please.

571
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,039
I have two pots.

572
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,599
I remember you. You've bought flowers twice.

573
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,880
- Here, for you.
- Thank you

574
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,880
She has the current situation under control,

575
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,599
and we can't turn the tide anymore.

576
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,240
We must find another way.

577
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,440
Rest assured.

578
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,759
During the mess just now,

579
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,480
I've obtained
Qin Wuniang's personal belongings.

580
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm used to doing such things,

581
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,400
and I will not fail again.

582
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,119
You, being an auspicious object,

583
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,359
are yet so timid,

584
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
hiding away at the slightest fright.

585
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,359
You can't achieve anything.

586
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,839
I know someone

587
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,039
who feels fear and cries,

588
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,960
yet always faces difficulties,

589
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
never backing down.

590
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,880
How about I take you to learn from her?

591
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,759
<i>Crying secretly again.</i>

592
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,240
<i>Why do I keep seeing you like this?</i>

593
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,920
After all this,

594
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,160
you don't cry or fuss,

595
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,799
nor ask me for additional money,

596
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:22,799
yet you still

597
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,039
tidy up these withered flowers.

598
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,079
Jiang Xiaohua, your resilience

599
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,519
is far greater than that of your flowers.

600
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,799
The business has encountered such a setback.

601
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,079
I have failed your expectations.

602
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,000
You promised me

603
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,960
that you would yield great profits for me.

604
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,440
You made your promise.

605
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,000
It's not the small amount of money
that disappoints me,

606
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,440
but as the Floral Envoy,

607
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,160
I have misjudged.

608
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,400
You haven't misjudged

609
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,720
my talent in caring flowers.

610
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,519
The failure now

611
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,680
is all because I was being smug.

612
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Why would you say that?

613
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,160
When I dug up these flowers from the mountain,

614
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,920
I knew

615
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,839
it would hurt them.

616
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,359
But I had previously

617
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,720
successfully transplanted multiple times,

618
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,799
so I ignored my inexperience
with mountain flowers,

619
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,759
thinking that with my own skills

620
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,279
and good fertilization and irrigation,

621
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,920
I could minimize the damage.

622
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,559
Unfortunately,

623
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,440
I failed to consider the subsequent growth.

624
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,359
Now, to refund the money

625
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,240
to the customers is only right.

626
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,920
I also feel ashamed of your investment.

627
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,200
If you wish to take back your capital

628
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,400
and withdraw from this deal,

629
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,800
I accept it.

630
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,119
You've nearly spent all your money.

631
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,776
How will you compensate me?

632
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,599
The ladies of Huanyun Tower

633
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,640
all know

634
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,880
that there's
a clever-tongued flower-selling woman

635
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,519
living in my backyard.

636
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,319
If I forced you to dead end

637
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,880
for some petty money,

638
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,559
it would ruin my reputation
for cherishing beauty.

639
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,480
In business,

640
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,839
one must not only
seek profit for profit's sake.

641
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,920
Honesty should be prioritized.

642
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,519
Since you

643
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,160
have invested in my business,

644
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,920
I must take responsibility for your money.

645
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,440
Once I've earned back the capital,

646
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,480
I will immediately repay you.

647
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,000
Doing business is like warfare.

648
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,279
Victory and defeat are common.

649
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,400
With lessons,

650
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
just improve yourself.

651
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,680
I invested money in you

652
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,599
to turn one hundred strings
into tens of thousands strings.

653
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,599
If I only get back the capital

654
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,880
and severe our cooperation,

655
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,279
to me, it is a loss.

656
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,599
Yes.

657
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,839
Mr. Jiang, you have long-term vision.

658
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,720
I will certainly not fail your trust.

659
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,279
Mr. Jiang, look.

660
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,559
This patch is the new breed
of peonies I've cultivated.

661
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,759
This kind of flower boasts a unique color,

662
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,759
but it's very difficult to blossom.

663
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,400
Thus, the purchase price is not high.

664
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,960
However, I have already improved this flaw,

665
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,839
and have named it Chunyiwan.

666
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,319
I don't care what color it is.

667
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,440
I just want

668
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
you to make money for me.

669
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,160
Yes, yes.

670
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,880
The Chunyiwan has a long blooming period

671
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,359
and it can bloom until the peonies go on sale.

672
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,359
After autumn comes,

673
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,759
I will pick another batch of good seedlings,

674
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,200
and start cultivating them from scratch.

675
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,079
There will be no further risk of transplanting.

676
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,400
Then I'll count on you

677
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
for my next month's drinking money.

678
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,464
No problem.

679
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,400
But there's another compensation

680
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,680
that you need to make up for me today.

681
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,200
What is it?

682
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,039
I got a golden carp.

683
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,440
Seeing it brings good luck.

684
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,400
But

685
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,039
it's timid and easily frightened.

686
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,519
I've been watching it all day,

687
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,079
and it was about to come out.

688
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,160
But it was scared back
by the noise in your backyard.

689
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,599
Tell me, how will you compensate me?

690
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,160
Mr. Jiang,

691
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,720
why are you considerate at times,

692
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,039
yet unreasonable at others?

693
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,839
What does this fish have to do with me?

694
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Let's deal with it one by one.

695
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,880
This is a fish to be offered to His Majesty.

696
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,048
You'd handle it yourself.

697
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,400
Raising fish is similar to caring flowers.

698
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
The most important thing
is a suitable environment.

699
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,920
This fish

700
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,519
lived in rivers and lakes before.

701
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,480
If I try

702
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
to create

703
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,880
a familiar environment for it,

704
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,960
with moonlight and fallen trees,

705
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,279
making it believe that it's still

706
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,119
in a mountain stream,

707
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,839
perhaps it will then show itself.

708
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,720
Little tricks to deceive
both humans and animals.

709
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,200
Indeed, you are of this talent.

710
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,000
As a Floral Envoy,
you don't know how to tame a fish.

711
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,960
Indeed, you are a charlatan.

712
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
You have the talent for business,

713
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,880
and know how to be a merchant.

714
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,599
You surely know selling fresh flowers

715
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,400
comes with high costs and risks.

716
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,160
Why not pursue
another line of work to earn money?

717
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,359
You present tribute and gadgets to His Majesty,

718
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,160
naturally, should evaluate
the value of everything.

719
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,200
But I

720
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,880
grow and sell flowers.

721
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,359
It's all because I love it.

722
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,400
I do as I please.

723
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,319
As for me,

724
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:35,359
the peony flowers are

725
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,960
the most precious things in this world.

726
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,279
The peony flowers are delicate and fragile,

727
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,720
of no use,

728
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,640
merely a beautiful plaything
without any practical use.

729
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,920
Why are you so obsessed with them?

730
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,759
Regardless of
what they have been through before,

731
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,480
as long as

732
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,519
they are replanted into

733
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,880
the soil,

734
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,279
they will take root again

735
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,319
and grow towards the sun.

736
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,759
Every time I see these,

737
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,359
a surge of power wells up in my heart

738
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,559
to start over again.

739
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,279
People said that only those who are useful

740
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,960
can appreciate the beauty
of what's deemed useless.

741
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,480
In that case,

742
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,200
are you useful

743
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
or useless?

744
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,319
You talk so mean,

745
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,720
making me a headache.

746
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,440
Is this fish coming or not?

747
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,039
Yes, I suppose.

748
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,200
Let's wait a bit more.

749
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,279
Is it beneath here?

750
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,839
It seems to be on this side.

751
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,799
I saw it.

752
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,136
So small?

753
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,080
It's useful, right?

754
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,559
Shengyi.

755
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,599
- I have something…
- This is for you.

756
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,504
Thank you, Shengyi.

757
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,880
If it weren't for me,

758
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,079
Wang Qing would not have
taken his revenge on you,

759
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,759
and your effort would have not gone in vain.

760
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,640
Mudan.

761
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,359
I am sorry.

762
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,720
What are you talking about?

763
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,559
Come on, have a seat, Shengyi.

764
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,880
Remember.

765
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,519
There's no need for apologies between us.

766
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,440
Moreover,

767
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,759
the root cause of the flower's failure
lies with me.

768
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,359
It's good to learn a lesson.

769
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,119
Don't worry.

770
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,759
I will try to improve

771
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,359
the last batch of Huaixiuxiang.

772
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,599
If we can get enough nutrient to them

773
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,640
to extend the blooming period,

774
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,279
perhaps we can also sell them.

775
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,960
But our money

776
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,200
is either lost to the customers,

777
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,680
or used to purchase new peony varieties.

778
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,839
The Chunyiwan is still waiting

779
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,640
for the last fertilization.

780
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,960
We have

781
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,720
no extra money to use.

782
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,759
How can we go on this business?

783
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,599
We have just started doing business.

784
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,559
We can't give up once we face difficulty.

785
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,800
There will always be a solution.

786
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Right.

787
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,039
Madam Sun from yesterday

788
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,239
is so kind.

789
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,519
When we have the time,

790
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,719
let's go thank her properly.

791
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,679
She seems to sell incense powder

792
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,440
in the West Market,

793
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,519
not far from us.

794
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,032
Incense powder?

795
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,920
If we turn the withered flowers

796
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,079
all into incense powder,

797
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,000
then we could earn back

798
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,559
the money for Chunyiwan fertilization?

799
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,079
Shengyi, now

800
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,639
let's go find Madam Sun

801
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,679
and ask her how to make incense powder.

802
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,544
Let's go.

803
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,480
Shengyi, thank you

804
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,760
for reminding me.

805
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
You have a lot of ideas.

806
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,880
Baked cakes,

807
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,639
crispy and delicious.

808
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,039
Ceramic utensils for sale.

809
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,599
Baked cakes,

810
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,559
crispy and delicious.

811
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,960
Come and take a look.

812
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,039
Seasonal fresh flowers for sale.

813
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,440
Peonies and azaleas.

814
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,719
Suitable for both viewing and wearing.

815
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,360
Madam, there is new incense powder today.

816
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,920
Madam, your incense powder
is really fine and smooth.

817
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,239
It's you two.

818
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,239
But the clove and yulan magnolia

819
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,480
are being used by everyone.

820
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm afraid that people might find it boring,

821
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,599
that's why causes the poor business.

822
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,679
What a pity.

823
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,639
I'm truly sorry.

824
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,719
Yesterday, I didn't mean
to put you two in a difficult position.

825
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,039
But I am indeed short of money.

826
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,480
Madam, it was I who wanted
to refund the money for the flowers yesterday.

827
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,679
It has nothing to do with you.

828
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,760
Don't feel guilty.

829
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,119
Ladies,

830
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,320
do you want to buy incense powder?

831
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
You can take any

832
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,599
on this stall.

833
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,119
After all, I'm also going to close down.

834
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,159
Might as well give them to you

835
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,159
as a gift.

836
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,960
Take it.

837
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,480
Madam, no need.

838
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,639
Our visit today is for two matters.

839
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,519
Just call me Mudan.

840
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,440
First is to express gratitude

841
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,199
for your tolerance towards us yesterday.

842
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,280
Second,

843
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,199
we would like to ask for your guidance

844
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,400
on how to make incense powder.

845
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,440
Since your business

846
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,719
is not that good,

847
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,199
why not

848
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,280
cooperate with us?

849
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,000
Peonies are expensive
and have a light fragrance,

850
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,639
so no one uses them for making incense.

851
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,320
But the Huaixiuxiang

852
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,920
has a rich and pleasant fragrance.

853
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,424
Take a whiff.

854
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,800
If we develop a product with this,

855
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,320
we will definitely stand out

856
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,360
and double the product price.

857
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,519
Madam, you have the skill of making incense,

858
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:37,360
and we have incense materials.

859
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,559
We can develop

860
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,639
peony incense powder together.

861
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,880
Even if you are closing your stall,
it doesn't matter.

862
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,119
My stall is vacant.

863
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,719
You can go there to sell.

864
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,719
Mudan.

865
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,960
I understood

866
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,239
what you mean.

867
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,296
Very good.

868
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,559
However,

869
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,760
you know what happened yesterday.

870
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,960
Now, we can't afford the down payment.

871
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,159
But if you trust me,

872
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,960
I will write a contract right now.

873
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,679
After the peony incense powder is sold,

874
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,304
I will repay your money.

875
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,599
Mudan.

876
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,239
You are smart and reliable.

877
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,840
What have I to worry about?

878
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,840
The cooperation you just mentioned is feasible,

879
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,119
but…

880
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,639
I have a favor to ask.

881
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,360
Mother.

882
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,159
Mother, I'm back.

883
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,159
This is my daughter, Fu.

884
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,719
She is frank and kind,

885
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:39,880
usually helps out at the stall,

886
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,280
assisting me.

887
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,559
I wonder if you two

888
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,800
could take her with you and work together,

889
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,840
to temper her character

890
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,320
and teach her how to do business.

891
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,639
Do…

892
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,719
Although she is not eloquent,

893
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,840
she is hardworking and diligent,

894
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,440
certainly will not disappoint you.

895
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,639
Mind your manners.

896
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,280
My name is…

897
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,199
Smile.

898
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:16,199
My name is Zhu Fu.

899
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,760
Greetings.

900
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,280
For the incense powder business,

901
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,760
we are still novices.

902
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,559
We will need your guidance in the future.

903
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,159
In the past at the stall,

904
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,559
what were you responsible for?

905
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,039
I prepare incense.

906
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,199
I am naturally strong and adept at
cutting, pounding, grinding, and filing.

907
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,400
All the incense here…

908
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,480
Compared to other women,

909
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,760
she is stronger.

910
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,039
Any physical labor,

911
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,159
just leave it to her.

912
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,920
She is also good at blending scents.

913
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,400
She can distinguish

914
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,760
the smells of all kinds of incense materials.

915
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,199
If she's that amazing,

916
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,199
I wonder if you can smell

917
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,679
what the sachet in my hand

918
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,079
is made of.

919
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,639
This is the sachet you gave me,

920
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,199
and it disappeared yesterday.

921
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,760
I thought I had lost it.

922
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,480
Last night, you've

923
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,079
spent the night with me,

924
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,159
very joyously.

925
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,679
Even you left

926
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,000
your personal belonging.

927
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,199
Today I came specially to return it.

928
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,880
And I thought to give you more money

929
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,400
to spend the night together again.

930
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,719
So, this flower-selling woman

931
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,480
is selling her body.

932
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,280
Selling flowers is just a front,

933
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,239
but selling her body is the reality.

934
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,840
Remember them. They are

935
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,159
cheaper than those

936
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,280
from the brothels.

937
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,559
This matter started because of me.

938
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,599
I'll go explain to him. You go…

939
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,239
It was Wang Qing who sent you, wasn't it?

940
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,880
Failing to provoke trouble,
then slandering her, how despicable!

941
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,519
Your body is surrounded
by the seductive incense

942
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,280
made of cardamun vanilla, and ambergris.

943
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,320
Only the courtesans use this incense.

944
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,159
Last night, you were seeking pleasure
in Pingkang House.

945
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,280
You scoundrel!

946
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,840
How dare you to ruin her reputation!

947
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,440
Watch me break your legs.

948
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,440
Murder! Someone's killing!

949
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,760
Come back! I'll…

950
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,639
Kneel down.

951
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,280
Madam, don't.

952
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,199
- Do you know you're wrong?
- Yes.

953
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,000
- What did you do wrong?
- I should've broken his legs first,

954
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,079
then he couldn't have run away.

955
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,760
How dare you!

956
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,199
You are pissing me off.

957
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,360
What did you say to me earlier?

958
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,519
To properly learn how to do business

959
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,000
and stop learning martial arts

960
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,119
and causing trouble.

961
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,960
I've finally found you

962
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,079
a master.

963
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,079
If you still act like this,

964
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:30,360
who dares take you in?

965
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,519
I have already said

966
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,039
I've never wanted to do business.

967
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,239
I just want to venture the world

968
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,239
to uphold justice,

969
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,280
just like it's written in the legends.

970
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,800
What did you say?

971
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,760
- Madam, don't.
- Madam, please stop.

972
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,248
Don't hit her.

973
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,639
Fu is an extraordinary woman.

974
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,800
When we interact,

975
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,960
it will certainly be of fun.

976
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,480
Yes.

977
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,880
You don't find me rude and impolite?

978
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,000
Of course not.

979
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,159
On the contrary,
I find you honest and charming.

980
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,199
And you eliminate harm for the people,

981
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,599
like a heroine of an era.

982
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,360
Heroine?

983
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
As the saying goes,

984
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,400
one is hard to find the one who admires him.

985
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,472
I think

986
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,400
you are the one.

987
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,679
No, no, no.

988
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,760
Madam.

989
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
I really like

990
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,239
Fu.

991
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,519
I will surely take good care of her.

992
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,800
Mudan.

993
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,039
You are willing to take in Fu.

994
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,519
That's great.

995
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,639
Your name is Mudan?

996
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,039
Just call me Fu.

997
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,159
You are…

998
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,480
My name is Shengyi.

999
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,000
Shengyi.

1000
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,119
What a pleasant name.

1001
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,920
From now on, we are friends.

1002
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,280
If anyone dares to bully you,

1003
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,480
they'll answer to my fists.

1004
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:04,472
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫</i>

1005
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:13,010
<i>♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫</i>

1006
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:20,884

songs and dances, glass goblets ♫</i>

1007
00:42:21,878 --> 00:42:30,230

a thousand flowers burst forth ♫</i>

1008
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:37,773
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

1009
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:46,614

carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

1010
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:54,425
<<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

1011
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:02,322
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>

1012
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:29,881
<i>♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫</i>

1013
00:43:31,182 --> 00:43:37,876
<i>♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the fragrant garden ♫</i>

1014
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:45,935
<i>♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫</i>

1015
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:54,928

a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫</i>
