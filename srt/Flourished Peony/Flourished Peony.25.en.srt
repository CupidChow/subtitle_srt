<i>[Episode 25]</i>

3
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,799
I've been very busy. I'm too tired

4
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,480
to prepare something to eat.

5
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,480
I hope you won't mind.

6
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,319
How did you know I came, not Zhu Fu?

7
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,319
Zhu Fu doesn't have

8
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,719
the fragrance of incense.

9
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,520
You're very busy.

10
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,439
Yet you have time to deal with people
from the black market.

11
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,120
How bold you are.

12
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,960
Mr. Jiang, on the day we left the barracks,

13
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,080
you said you already considered me a friend.

14
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,599
If so, feel free to speak frankly.

15
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,400
I know that since you arrived in Chang'an,

16
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,400
you have been dwelling on revenge
for your mother and Yulu,

17
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,360
seeking an opportunity to punish Liu Shen.

18
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,520
But if you're against the powerful
as a merchant,

19
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,719
it'll be very dangerous.

20
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,840
If Liu Shen discovers
that you are investigating him,

21
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
he might secretly have men abduct you

22
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
and throw you into the river.

23
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,159
Even I might not be able to find you.

24
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,240
How did you know?

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,759
Chuanyu saw the man

26
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,599
you hired to follow Liu Shen
in the black market.

27
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,479
I want to expose Liu Shen

28
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,479
indeed for my mother and Yulu.

29
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,080
But it's not just for my vengeance.

30
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,960
Liu Shen harms the people for money.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
Though I'm as weak as an ant,

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm not dead meat.

33
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,199
Countless ants can give it a try.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,520
But you are alone.

35
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,560
I'm not advising you
to stand by and do nothing.

36
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,240
I hope that you will play it safe.

37
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,000
I know you're worried.

38
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,120
I understand your concerns.

39
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,560
Rest assured, I will be cautious.

40
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,080
I will make my move at the right time.

41
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,759
All the grain shops in the West Market

42
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,199
are in cahoots with Liu Shen,

43
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,399
mixing in old millet
that should have been destroyed.

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,079
This is not something that he can do alone.

45
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,759
Behind Liu Shen lies a tangled web.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,199
If he collapses,

47
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,199
the people behind him will fall too.

48
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,560
What you are facing
is never just one corrupt official.

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,480
You are also investigating the millet case?

50
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,439
You don't just want to take down Liu Shen,

51
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,639
but also to strike hard at the power brokers
behind him, right?

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,639
If this is as dangerous as you say it is,

53
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,240
I can no longer stand by.

54
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,839
Since we both want the evil men
to be brought to justice,

55
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,879
how about we work together?

56
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,600
You're overconfident.

57
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,759
Can you interfere in political affairs?

58
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,639
No, I can't interfere.

59
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,680
But when it comes to punishing Liu Shen,

60
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,040
we need concerted efforts
to ensure a sure victory.

61
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,920
In this nation,

62
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,439
the common people outnumber officials, right?

63
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,680
You stir things up in the official circles

64
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
and show your mettle.

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,680
But as a commoner, I can also do something.

66
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,519
There is strength in numbers.

67
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,480
So, you mean,

68
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,279
the grievances of the common people
are a sharper knife?

69
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,639
It's not something
a few high officials can defeat.

70
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Since they deceive their superiors
and oppress the people,

71
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,439
they shouldn't blame us

72
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,688
for faking.

73
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,352
<i>[Jiang Mansion]</i>

74
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,136
Mr. Ren.

75
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:51,160
Is it tasty?

76
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,864
Sure.

77
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,360
I truly didn't know before

78
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,600
that Lady He was on your side.

79
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,879
I mistakenly believed the words
of the troublemakers.

80
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,639
So I gave her severe penalties.

81
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,360
Please forgive me, Mr. Jiang.

82
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,360
It's alright. After all, you didn't know.

83
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,600
Don't worry.

84
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
If I bear a grudge,

85
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,360
I won't invite you to watch the flower.

86
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,920
Your tolerance

87
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,279
makes me feel even more ashamed.

88
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,079
I rarely see the beauty.

89
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,759
Thanks to you,

90
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,088
I have the honor of seeing it.

91
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:43,199
It is a great honor.

92
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,519
Here's to you.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
The best part of this flower is
that it blooms at night

94
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,000
only for a fleeting moment.

95
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,920
It's a beautiful sight.

96
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,800
It'll be dull if I don't watch it with others.

97
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,879
Excuse me for a moment.

98
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,240
Everyone, make yourself at home.

99
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,920
Enjoy yourselves.

100
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,360
Although they ate moldy rice,

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,679
it started a bit too quickly.

102
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,639
They've been eating delicate food.

103
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,440
Their stomachs can't withstand this.

104
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
Mr. Ren, are you okay?

105
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,039
I've been waiting for the flower to blossom.

106
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,759
That's why I'm holding this banquet.

107
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,279
Yet now, I've missed the blooming scenery.

108
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,960
Bring the kitchen staff to me.

109
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,240
Make sure to find out what went wrong.

110
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,872
Yes.

111
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,799
My lord, I've found out.

112
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,000
The soup at the banquet
was made with inferior millet.

113
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,480
That's why it made everyone feel unwell.

114
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,440
This matter is probably not simple.

115
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,279
Could it be
that someone is attempting to poison me?

116
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,480
Tell me. Who instructed you to do this?

117
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,759
My mother is ill.

118
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,000
I need money for her treatment.

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,279
To save money, I didn't buy millet
in the East Market,

120
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,279
but in the West Market.

121
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,879
I didn't know that the millet
from the West Market was inferior.

122
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,960
My lord, considering my filial piety,

123
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,440
please spare me.

124
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,559
Spare me.

125
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,679
Whether someone has tried to poison me,

126
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,559
or if the grain shops
in the West Market are behind it,

127
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,200
Mr. Ren, you investigate this matter

128
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,000
for me and our colleagues here.

129
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,720
That's right.

130
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,799
You must find out.

131
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,832
Yes.

132
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,679
- Again.
- Alright.

133
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,800
Again.

134
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:22,880
<i>[Grain]</i>

135
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,480
Everyone, look at this millet.

136
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,320
The grain shop is selling inferior goods,

137
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,120
moldy millet.

138
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,559
Look at my face.

139
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,679
My face has been disfigured

140
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,080
by the incense powder made
from this kind of millet.

141
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,120
As the owner of Huamanzhu,

142
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,320
even if I suffer the loss
of money and reputation,

143
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,639
I absolutely can't sell bad incense powder

144
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,759
to the people.

145
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,879
- Right.
- Exactly.

146
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,320
Please rest assured,

147
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,159
I've already sent people
to withdraw the shoddy goods.

148
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,200
However, the main culprit is still at large.

149
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,039
But I must let everyone know

150
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,919
the true nature of this unscrupulous shop.

151
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,559
I bought millet from it.

152
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,679
When cooking,

153
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,639
I have seen black spots on the millet.

154
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,039
I thought it was just dirty
and washing it would be fine.

155
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,279
Could it be that I bought moldy grains?

156
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,159
Exactly, the moldy millet is tiny.

157
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,559
Without close examination, it's not noticeable.

158
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,000
That's why everyone has been kept in the dark.

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,039
Consuming moldy millet harms our health.

160
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,639
Yes, indeed.

161
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,039
Medical books state that the stomach
is the foundation of the viscera.

162
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,600
Eating bad grains for a day or two
won't show much effect.

163
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,960
But if consumed for a long time,

164
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm afraid it will spoil our health.

165
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,480
It brings endless troubles.

166
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,480
No wonder I've been suffering
from stomach pains.

167
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,200
Turns out it was caused by bad grains.

168
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,080
What an unscrupulous merchant.

169
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,960
Let's go in and demand an explanation.

170
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,000
No, you mustn't do that.

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
Everyone, please calm down.

172
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,000
We're just ordinary folks.

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,759
If we argue with them,

174
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,159
they will get something on us.

175
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,840
The owner of this grain shop
has committed a crime.

176
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,720
He should be arrested by the authorities.

177
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,559
All we need to do
is report him to the officials.

178
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,399
I believe
the Jingzhao Prefecture will do justice.

179
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,080
Can't we make him do refunds today?

180
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,120
If I keep waiting, my illness will get worse.

181
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,720
- Yeah.
- Yes.

182
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,879
Although Huamanzhu is also a victim,

183
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,480
I still feel guilty

184
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,000
about selling inferior goods.

185
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,679
Therefore, I've hired a physician
to see patients.

186
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,080
Those who have bought incense powder in my shop

187
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,000
will get stomach medicine for free.

188
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,799
What about those who haven't bought it?

189
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
What should we do?

190
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,080
Even so, you can see the physician for free.

191
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,679
Huamanzhu would like to do good deeds.

192
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,159
I'll sell the medicine at cost price

193
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,159
to those who have stomach problems.

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,480
You're so nice.

195
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,960
Thank you.

196
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,559
You're welcome.

197
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,879
It's what I ought to do.

198
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,840
Please get your medicine
over there. Next, please.

199
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,559
You have a stomach ache?

200
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,200
- Here's your medicine.
- Thank you.

201
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,519
The moldy millet harmed my health.

202
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,799
After hearing your words,
they filed complaints in droves.

203
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,200
But the Jingzhao Prefecture
doesn't take up the case.

204
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,720
Now the people are being blocked
outside the government office's gate.

205
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,639
Good.

206
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,639
What do you mean?

207
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,879
I knew officials would cover for each other.

208
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,399
What I want is the flames of the fury
of the common people.

209
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,960
At the right time,

210
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
the flames will get huge.

211
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,720
This time, I must

212
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,279
get guilty officials burned

213
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,600
until they collapse.

214
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,679
Great.

215
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,256
Again.

216
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,519
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

217
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,000
I am He Weifang, the owner of Huamanzhu.

218
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,240
There is a matter
concerning everyone's life and health.

219
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,519
Please listen to me.

220
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,639
I believe you've heard

221
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,120
that a grain shop in the West Market
is selling moldy millet extensively.

222
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,600
I thought it was only one shop's mistake.

223
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,759
To continue my incense powder business,

224
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,080
I turned to other grain shops for purchases.

225
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,679
To my shock, in the entire West Market,

226
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,080
all grain shops are selling moldy millet.

227
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,639
Everyone, please take a look!

228
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,840
This is all moldy millet.

229
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,960
It's a huge thing.

230
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,639
Yet the Jingzhao Prefecture
actually refused to handle it.

231
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,559
The officials eat

232
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,000
good grains from the East Market.

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,039
They disregard the lives of us commoners.

234
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,120
Everyone, though each of us alone is weak,

235
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,840
there is strength in numbers.

236
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
As long as every household

237
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
gathers evidence and appeals to the officials,

238
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,759
we will surely make the officials
investigate the matter

239
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,879
and return a safe West Market to us.

240
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,120
If everyone wants to stay healthy,

241
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,200
we must fight for ourselves.

242
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,600
Today we are eating moldy millet.

243
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,120
Who knows what bad food we will eat?

244
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
This matter is not so simple.

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,120
I'm afraid before justice is served,

246
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,240
we'll put our lives at risk.

247
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
How can you be so cowardly?

248
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,799
Lady He

249
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,399
is more courageous than you.

250
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,360
This is a matter that concerns our own health.

251
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,720
If everyone were like you,

252
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,000
waiting for others to take the lead,

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,159
this matter would come to nothing.

254
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,840
That would be fatal.

255
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Bring our millet here.

256
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,360
We must be united in this matter.

257
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,960
Every one of us should join her.

258
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,480
Lady He, I will go with you.

259
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,159
We must make the officials
give us all an explanation.

260
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,200
Excuse me, please make way.

261
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,279
Thank you, madam.

262
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,352
Lady He.

263
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,000
The flower guild will join you.

264
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,799
Thank you, Mr. Lv.

265
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,080
Look, if you no longer want to live in fear,

266
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,159
then join me.

267
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,600
Go to the government office
to seek justice for ourselves.

268
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,679
Demand justice!

269
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,440
Demand justice!

270
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,240
Demand justice!

271
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,320
Demand justice!

272
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,279
Demand justice!

273
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,399
Demand justice!

274
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,440
Demand justice!

275
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
The moldy millet sold
in the West Market is right on the cart.

276
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,279
We're going to the government office
to file a case.

277
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,279
Demand justice!

278
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,200
Demand justice!

279
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,000
Everyone, let's get united as one.

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,440
Gather all the moldy millet together.

281
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,840
We're going to the government office
to file a case.

282
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,360
Demand justice!

283
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,919
Moldy millet.

284
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,000
Who else has moldy millet?

285
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,759
Demand justice!

286
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,079
Mind your own business.

287
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,599
What are you doing here?

288
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,720
Who's leading this?

289
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,079
I gathered everyone here.

290
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,400
But I'm not making trouble.

291
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
If we don't do this,

292
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,279
will you do justice for the common people?

293
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,799
After all, the people who wanted to file a case

294
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,400
were turned away by the Jingzhao Prefecture.

295
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,552
Really?

296
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,359
You are growing more and more negligent.

297
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,880
This matter concerns the people's livelihood.
How dare you not report it.

298
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,359
I thought it was not a serious matter.

299
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,720
Please forgive me.

300
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
I'll get back to you later.

301
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,640
Lady He, you and I are acquainted.

302
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,559
I didn't know before
that you were Mr. Jiang's friend.

303
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,559
It's a misunderstanding today.

304
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,559
Since you are the complainant,

305
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,599
come with me to the government office.

306
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,440
This matter is unrelated to Mr. Jiang.

307
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,119
You needn't bring him into this.

308
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,240
Now, all the grain shops
in the West Market make a mistake.

309
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,799
Countless people have fallen ill
from eating bad millet.

310
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,039
Like everyone else, I am also a victim.

311
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,519
This case is no trivial matter.

312
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,240
It should be jointly judged
by the three ministries.

313
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,960
There's no need for the Jingzhao Prefecture
to handle it.

314
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,000
How dare you!

315
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,000
It's just a small matter of moldy millet.

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Why make such a fuss over it?

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Officials have so many things
to deal with every day.

318
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,279
If every single case is reported
to the three ministries,

319
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,400
it will mess up the proceedings.

320
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,680
Get out of here!

321
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,920
If you continue,

322
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,640
I'll punish you.

323
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,920
It's so unfair.

324
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
He's actually threatening us.

325
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,160
Yeah.

326
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,904
- It's not our fault.
- Get the millet.

327
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:52,920
Get the millet.

328
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,160
Yes.

329
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,168
Stop!

330
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,720
This millet is our evidence.

331
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,960
If they take it away,

332
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,279
I'm afraid the millet case will be obscured
without explanation.

333
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,640
What a bold commoner.

334
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,319
How dare you obstruct official business.

335
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,400
Quick, get the millet.

336
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,599
Go!

337
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,799
Stop it.

338
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,279
- Stop it.
- Don't move.

339
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,279
Stop it.

340
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,792
Give it back to us.

341
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,799
Stop it.

342
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't hurt us.

343
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Let go.

344
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,640
Put it down.

345
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,480
Stop it!

346
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,519
Stop it!

347
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,279
- Stop it.
- Back off.

348
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,119
Attention.

349
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:40,960
Please hear me out.

350
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,279
What do we toil every day for?

351
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,640
To provide a better life for our families.

352
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,759
Yes, exactly.

353
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,119
The taxes we pay increase every year.

354
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,920
But what do we get in return?

355
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,400
Moldy millet and weakened bodies.

356
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,480
That's true.

357
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,039
What we're holding in our hands

358
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,599
is the millet we bought with our own money.

359
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,039
We're on the streets
where the common people can pass.

360
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,440
We didn't smash the shops
that sell moldy millet.

361
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,119
Nor did we beat up the merchants
who sell moldy millet.

362
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,640
We didn't break laws.

363
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,519
All we do is to seek justice for ourselves.

364
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,200
On what grounds do you arrest people?

365
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,160
Why destroy our evidence?

366
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,319
Lady He is right.

367
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,559
Even officials cannot arrest people
without cause.

368
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,119
You can't arrest people without reason.

369
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,880
You can't arrest people without reason.

370
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,119
Stop it. Be quiet.

371
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,319
Food is a must for the people.

372
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,440
And the people are the foundation of a nation.

373
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,599
The millet case is huge.

374
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,400
It should be judged by His Majesty.

375
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,160
Let His Majesty judge.

376
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,440
Let His Majesty judge.

377
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,960
Let His Majesty judge.

378
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,880
Let His Majesty judge.

379
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,119
Let His Majesty judge.

380
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,480
Let His Majesty judge.

381
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,776
<i>♫ Do not fail the varied fragrance ♫</i>

382
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,799
The flowers in your mansion are blooming well.

383
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,279
They're not inferior to those in the palace.

384
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,599
Hundreds of flowers bloom for Your Majesty.

385
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,039
If they can make Your Majesty happy,

386
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,599
it's a great honor for those flowers and me.

387
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,599
On my way here,

388
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,880
I heard of something.

389
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,559
The grain shops in the West Market
are selling moldy millet,

390
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,799
causing public resentment.

391
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,039
<i>[Bloom into Fullness]</i>
What happened?

392
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,200
Your Majesty, that's utterly groundless.

393
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,279
I have not heard of it.

394
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,359
So, it's misinformation?

395
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:47,712
Many officials had diarrhea
at Mr. Jiang's banquet.

396
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:50,240
Didn't you hear about it?

397
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,559
Diarrhea? What happened?

398
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,440
Your Majesty, my subordinate
attended Mr. Jiang's banquet.

399
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,720
After eating the millet soup, he had diarrhea.

400
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,160
The next day, he asked for leave.

401
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,200
I heard Mr. Jiang's servant bought bad millet
from the West Market.

402
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,279
The health of many officials got hurt.

403
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
The Jingzhao Prefecture
clarified it the next day.

404
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
A grain shop accidentally sold old millet.

405
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Upon discovery, they immediately
withdrew the moldy millet.

406
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,880
The related merchant has been punished.

407
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,960
Exactly, I've instructed the market official

408
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,880
to thoroughly investigate this case.

409
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,640
This must not happen again.

410
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,599
Your Majesty, as you know,

411
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,559
I often go to the West Market
to watch the Huxuan dance.

412
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,519
The shops there are well-organized.

413
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,559
Furthermore, there are countless exotic items.

414
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:38,640
The common people have much to enjoy there.

415
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,680
It's very peaceful.

416
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
Your Majesty.

417
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,559
You need to know more of this case

418
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,559
to find out the truth.

419
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,799
The commoners in the West Market are shocked
and enraged by the moldy millet incident.

420
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,319
Unafraid of official suppression,
they demand justice.

421
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,200
So, you heard the voices of accusation.

422
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,920
If this case is not investigated,

423
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,799
the boiling public resentment may one day

424
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,559
lead to a fierce fight.

425
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,519
Your Majesty, the bad millet has damaged
not only the livelihood of the people

426
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,519
but also the health of numerous officials.

427
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,319
I implore Your Majesty to investigate.

428
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,519
Water can carry a boat; it can also capsize it.

429
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,200
I can't let the people down.

430
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,480
Besides, if you officials lose their health,

431
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,240
you won't work for me well.

432
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,759
It's a livelihood case
that should be handled by the three ministries.

433
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,240
The Censor acts as the chief judge.

434
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,559
You must find out the truth
for me, the common people,

435
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,680
and the officials.

436
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,839
Your Majesty is wise. As you command.

437
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,279
Your Majesty, the Censorate doesn't know
about the East Market and West Market well.

438
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,559
Well, Liu Shen has been working hard.

439
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,440
The market officials who oversee both markets
are his subordinates.

440
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,960
Master Liu should investigate this case,

441
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,000
with the Censor helping him.

442
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,319
Only then can Your Majesty be less worried.

443
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:12,440
Okay, I'll take your advice.

444
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,240
Investigate this case
to calm the people's anger.

445
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Yes.

446
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,839
Master Liu, this case is huge.

447
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,480
Please come with me to inspect the West Market.

448
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,720
Master Liu has important things to do.

449
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,359
You visit the West Market tomorrow morning.

450
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,039
Mr. Jiang, this case is urgent.

451
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,000
Can you put your thing aside?

452
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,519
What if it concerns His Majesty?

453
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,640
His Majesty has grown tired
of watching flowers.

454
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,480
Upon hearing of the prosperity
of the West Market,

455
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,079
he's commanded me to find some dancers
to perform in the palace.

456
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,880
He also asked me to find some exotic trinkets.

457
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,200
Master Liu must go with me.

458
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,359
If His Majesty can't see the Huxuan dance
tonight, he will be displeased.

459
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,200
You and I can't afford it.

460
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,880
Let's go, Master Liu.

461
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,319
I heard that He Weifang was the one
who stirred up things in the West Market.

462
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,640
She has tarnished my reputation.

463
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,824
After faking death to escape,

464
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,119
she gained favor from you
and became your servant.

465
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,519
It's clear that she is quite scheming.

466
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,240
Mr. Jiang, do not be used by her again.

467
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,160
In front of me, she's only to be used.

468
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,880
She is nothing but a lowly merchant.

469
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,920
Yet she could stir up things

470
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,119
and even get the news to His Majesty's ears.

471
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,559
Mr. Jiang, you must be cautious.

472
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,119
She loves money.

473
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,640
If she loses money, she will fight.

474
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,480
Moreover, she is a woman.

475
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,720
She's been disfigured by moldy millet.
How could she not be angry?

476
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,559
Making a scene on the street is no big deal.

477
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,519
Anyway, she makes money for me.

478
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,319
Nothing else matters.

479
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,960
You're very tolerant.

480
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,160
She stirred up things,

481
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,400
which could make me lose my position.

482
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,240
Haven't I bought you more time?

483
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,960
That's enough for you to handle this case.

484
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,359
I am grateful for your help.

485
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,200
I hope you can properly control Lady He

486
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,640
and let her behave
and not cause any more trouble.

487
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,519
I help you for the sake of His Highness.

488
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,359
How dare you make decisions for me.

489
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,799
Because of your incompetence,

490
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,880
the moldy millet matter
has become known to everyone.

491
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,119
Even I suffered from the bad millet.

492
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,759
I ran to the toilet seven times in one night.

493
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,240
Now I'm feeling weak.

494
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,039
How shall you compensate me?

495
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,759
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad.

496
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,160
Once I get through this matter,

497
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,359
I will offer a generous gift to you.

498
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,440
I'll endure it on behalf of His Highness.

499
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,240
I hope you will quickly fix it.

500
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,279
Do not disappoint His Highness again
because of your incompetence.

501
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,296
Yes.

502
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,680
Hurry up.

503
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,079
Master, the market official
has readied the granary.

504
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,640
Good millet will be delivered later.

505
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,079
Alright, as soon as possible.

506
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,136
Okay.

507
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,600
There's more.

508
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,640
Hurry up.

509
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,920
Even if His Majesty learns
about the boiling public resentment

510
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,799
and orders an investigation of the matter,

511
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,519
Liu Shen just needs to replace the moldy millet
with the good one.

512
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,759
Then he will get away with it.

513
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,759
I need him to replace the moldy millet
with the good one.

514
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,200
The call of action in the West Market
is just to draw him out.

515
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,680
The real purpose is to make Liu Shen mess up.

516
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,200
Before the investigation from above,

517
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,839
he will transfer away the evidence of guilt.

518
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,480
Sure, so you need

519
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
to give Liu Shen this opportunity.

520
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,599
No problem.

521
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:00,640
Chuanyu will go with you

522
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,279
to catch him red-handed and protect you.

523
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,279
Make way!

524
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,408
Make way!

525
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,128
Move! Don't block the way!

526
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:13,200
Should we start?

527
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
Make way!

528
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,359
Wait a moment until the passers-by walk away.

529
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,440
Be careful not to hurt the innocent.

530
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,559
Quick!

531
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,440
Make way!

532
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,480
Move!

533
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,519
Master.

534
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,720
Master, are you alright?

535
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,759
Millet.

536
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,200
Moldy millet, this is moldy millet.

537
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
Look, moldy millet.

538
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,839
It's really moldy millet.

539
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:48,640
Be quick.

540
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,440
Look, moldy millet.

541
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,680
Stop it.

542
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:00,240
Master.

543
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,720
Stop it!

544
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,240
Stop it!

545
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,519
Take Master away.

546
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,680
Keep Master safe.

547
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,160
Stop it!

548
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,359
Take Master away.

549
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,096
Stop it!

550
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,559
Stop it!

551
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,599
Stop it!

552
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,680
Help!

553
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,559
Forget the tribute medicine.

554
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,000
We must not let Lady He discover

555
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,039
what we gave back then was fake.

556
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,039
Help!

557
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,440
Master.

558
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,680
- Move.
- Move.

559
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,736
Quick.

560
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,480
Master, give me your hand.

561
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,880
Master, give me your hand.

562
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,680
Master, are you alright?

563
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,920
Make way!

564
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,976
Stand back!

565
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:28,064
Stand back!

566
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,112
Liu Shen.

567
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,319
Do you admit your guilt?

568
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,880
Take him away!

569
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,984
Yes.

570
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,119
<i>Mother, Yulu,</i>

571
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,279
<i>have you seen it?</i>

572
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,279
Take them away together!

573
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,312
Yes.

574
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:59,072
<i>[Liu Mansion]</i>

575
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,680
Liu Shen is a spineless worm.

576
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,799
Once imprisoned, he utterly collapsed.

577
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,920
The Chen family bore the brunt.

578
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,559
Since Prince Ning stood by,

579
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,799
to save his own life,
he had no choice but to report others

580
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,200
The officials of the Ministry of Personnel
and the Vice Minister of Revenue,

581
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,440
are guilty of corruption, bribery,
land grabbing, and deals of official positions.

582
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,640
Their crimes have been made public.

583
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,759
Prince Ning kept himself safe.

584
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,799
The influential families close to him

585
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,000
will complain about it.

586
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,839
Now, there are many vacant positions.

587
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,960
I guess Prince Ning can't help

588
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,799
meddling in official appointments.

589
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,640
Many of his people have been implicated
in this case.

590
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,079
He just recommended some men.

591
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,920
Yet, his recommendation was rejected
by the upright senior officials.

592
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,880
Prince Ning didn't want to provoke trouble
and had to give up.

593
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,279
Our people have taken the key positions.

594
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,079
After things are over,

595
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,079
even if Prince Ning tries
to appoint his own people again,

596
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,279
it's all within our control.

597
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,680
A grain of millet is tiny,

598
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,759
but it affects the will of the people.

599
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Prince Ning's financial source
has been cut off.

600
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,400
And bad officials have been eradicated.

601
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,599
The Military Governor is sly,

602
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,400
swaying with the wind.

603
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,960
It's even harder for Prince Ning

604
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,039
to get his support if he can't give him money.

605
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,359
Now, the governor of Eastern Capital is…

606
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:41,119
Your favorite student, Cheng Lang.

607
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,400
He will return the land to the people.

608
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,640
Don't worry.

609
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,680
It's been years since we met in Chang'an.

610
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,720
I hope to have tea with him again.

611
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,799
No matter how entrenched
Prince Ning's power is,

612
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,480
it will be uprooted entirely one day.

613
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,519
Don't be sad, sir.

614
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,279
I feel sorry for Cheng Lang.

615
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,880
You care about Cheng Lang.

616
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,440
Cheng Lang cares about Your Majesty.

617
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,000
But no one cares about me.

618
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,480
Mr. Third cares about you.

619
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,880
And Mudan.

620
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,039
She's just a florist.

621
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,279
Yet, she aided you in such a dangerous affair.

622
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,279
She did it all not for me

623
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,880
but for herself

624
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,160
and the merchants and commoners.

625
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:44,032
Mudan knows

626
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:47,319
there is strength in numbers.

627
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,839
What a pity. If she were a man,

628
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,480
she would certainly achieve great things.

629
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,960
So what if she is a woman?

630
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,759
She has done what she wanted to do.

631
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:07,519
<i>[Liu Mansion]</i>

632
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,679
Liu Shen is in big trouble this time.

633
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,688
Sure.

634
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,039
The County Princess likes you very much.

635
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,519
As long as you get engaged with her again,

636
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,320
she promises to save your father.

637
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,239
Son, don't hesitate anymore.

638
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,280
Your father is in prison now.

639
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,480
We don't know if he's alright.

640
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,440
You've been asking for help,

641
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,320
but is there anyone willing to help you?

642
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,639
Now, only the County Princess
can save our family.

643
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,239
Will you actually watch your father

644
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,880
be exiled and die alone far from home?

645
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,599
Zishu, I'm begging you.

646
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,639
Please save your father.

647
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,480
Zishu.

648
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,000
Zishu.

649
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,480
Youzhen, let's get married.

650
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,752
Okay.

651
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,840
He canceled the engagement.

652
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,400
It's too late to regret it.

653
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,280
My reputation has been ruined.

654
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,880
I can't marry into a noble family.

655
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,880
Father, please allow me to marry him.

656
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,639
Who dares to find fault with my daughter?

657
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,119
Any man you like--

658
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,280
I'd rather die if I can't marry Liu Chang.

659
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,024
Back off!

660
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,920
The Chen family has already lost power.

661
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,800
You did not rescue them.

662
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,159
Others will feel disappointed.

663
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,840
The Chen family has committed too many crimes.

664
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,760
If I step in to save them,

665
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,079
in any case,

666
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,079
I will get myself into trouble.

667
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,760
You should not interfere.

668
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,159
I'll explain to the noble families.

669
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,840
Actions are more persuasive than any words.

670
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,679
The only crime of Liu Shen is embezzlement.

671
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,840
It is not difficult to save him.

672
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,679
Other families will understand if you do so.

673
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,880
As long as they're loyal and useful,
they won't be abandoned.

674
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,039
In this way, you'll reassure them

675
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,719
and get their support.

676
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:58,280
Did Liu Chang teach you to say that?

677
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,904
Yes.

678
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,639
It seems he's not as useless as I thought.

679
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,280
Alright, put down the knife.

680
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,880
Put it down.

681
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,360
You can marry him.

682
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,320
Thank you, father.

683
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,472
Get up.

684
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,960
Youzhen, remember,

685
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:42,079
anyone can become your pawn

686
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,760
even if they are not loyal to you.

687
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,528
The Chen family is too greedy.

688
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:53,719
They even deceived me for personal gain.

689
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,880
But I still need to use them.

690
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,760
So I didn't deal with them.

691
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,800
You've long wanted to discard them.

692
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,519
You need to learn how to tolerate
and use people.

693
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,800
As long as the benefits are big enough,

694
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,119
there will always be people
who can be of use to you.

695
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,960
Go back and tell Liu Zishu.

696
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,440
To be my son-in-law,
loyalty is the most important thing.

697
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,159
I can tolerate him
for canceling the engagement once.

698
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,679
But I will never tolerate it again.

699
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,039
Great!

700
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,944
Great!

701
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,840
You have no conscience.

702
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,239
- He deserves it.
- Look.

703
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,159
Look at him.

704
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,360
Great.

705
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
Hit hard.

706
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:06,816
<i>♫ They say I'm overestimating myself ♫</i>

707
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,079
Now the West Market is orderly.
The goods are nice and cheap.

708
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,320
You have got your revenge.

709
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,440
Mudan, aren't you happy?

710
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,000
The common people pay taxes
according to the law.

711
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,440
The government should
return a fair West Market to us.

712
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,679
That's their job.

713
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,519
Without Jiang Changyang's message,

714
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,199
I'm afraid
we would be as happy as everyone else

715
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,480
about the punishment for Liu Shen.

716
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,920
In fact, Liu Chang has re-engaged
with Prince Ning's daughter.

717
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,639
Just one word from Prince Ning

718
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,400
can spare Liu Shen.

719
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,480
And Liu Shen was hit in public

720
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,880
just to silence the gossip.

721
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,239
As long as Liu Chang
is Prince Ning's son-in-law,

722
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,480
no matter what crime his father commits,

723
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,559
his father will be treated with leniency.

724
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,800
What the authorities truly restrict and punish

725
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,239
are just merchants and commoners.

726
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,320
Liu Shen cares most about his reputation
and official career.

727
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,079
He will never be an official again.

728
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,519
It will make him suffer more.

729
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:11,599
Your mother and Yulu will be happy

730
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,719
about Liu Shen being beaten.

731
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,320
And Liu Chang canceled his engagement before.

732
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,239
But now, to save his father,
he has to marry the County Princess.

733
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,760
The County Princess has a bad temper.

734
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,039
She will fight with Liu Chang's mother.

735
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,639
If so, she…

736
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,119
Fu, thank you.

737
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,000
You're right.

738
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,519
We should look on the bright side of things.

739
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,800
Liu Chang is inherently conceited.

740
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,360
If he marries the County Princess,

741
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,079
his family will be restless.

742
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,079
And Liu Shen's career is completely destroyed.

743
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,159
It's inevitable that Liu Chang
and his father will become estranged.

744
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,840
I believe

745
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,039
the evil will pay for what they do.

746
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,719
Alright, let me treat you to a meal.

747
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,400
Alright.

748
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

749
00:41:04,384 --> 00:41:10,880
<i>♫ Looking back,
I've traveled a thousand miles ♫</i>

750
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,239
I knew you would definitely want to come here.

751
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,079
Be careful not to break it.

752
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,800
You two, mind your step.

753
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Previously, you asked the house broker
to keep you updated

754
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,599
about the sale of Fragrance Garden.

755
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,704
Look.

756
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,360
Fragrance Garden is for sale?

757
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,639
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

758
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,280
I heard of it yesterday.

759
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,480
I wanted to surprise you.

760
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,039
Another good news now.

761
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,440
Are you happy?

762
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,719
Sure, I am.

763
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:45,360
It's the best surprise for me.

764
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,800
Let's go and ask

765
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,960
how much that house is for sale.

766
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Let's go.

767
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:12,853
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫</i>

768
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:21,391
<i>♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫</i>

769
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:29,265
<i>♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫</i>

770
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:38,611
<i>♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫</i>

771
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:46,154
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

772
00:42:46,808 --> 00:42:54,995
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

773
00:42:54,995 --> 00:43:02,806
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

774
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:10,703
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>

775
00:43:31,379 --> 00:43:38,262
<i>♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫</i>

776
00:43:39,563 --> 00:43:46,257
<i>♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫</i>

777
00:43:47,014 --> 00:43:54,316
<i>♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫</i>

778
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,309
<i>♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫</i>

779
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:10,740
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

780
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:19,827
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

781
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:27,251
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

782
00:44:28,255 --> 00:44:35,705
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>
