13
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,159
Master Xu, the rain is heavy.

14
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,000
Be careful. The roads are wet and slippery.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
No need to accompany me further.

Master Xu, go.

19
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,600
Since you've seen it,

20
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,800
you can't live anymore.

21
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,399
No.

22
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,920
Don't.

23
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,360
You had a nightmare again?

24
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,839
No, I just dreamed

25
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,079
that we lost money in our business.

26
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,560
Shengyi, I feel better now.

27
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,600
I can work with you today.

28
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,480
We can't do business today.

29

Why?

31
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,720
Master Xu died unexpectedly.

32
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,240
It's his burial today.

33
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,319
All the businesses in the city closed.

34
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,920
The people are gathering for his funeral.

35
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,879
When did Master Xu die?

36
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,639
What happened to him?

37
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,839
Some bandits infiltrated the city.

38
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,920
Three days ago,
the night you brought back flowers,

39
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,879
Master Xu was kidnapped by them.

40
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,079
I hear the bandits are extremely vicious.

41
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,480
They killed Master Xu and all his guards.

42
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,120
Their bodies were swept away
by the swollen river

43
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,600
and found the next day.

44
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,759
Fu went to take a look out of curiosity.

45
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,040
He said that the dead were unrecognizable.

46
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,279
Their death was tragic.

47
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,639
It was on the same day.

48
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,199
Indeed, fortunately,
you didn't run into those bandits.

49
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,319
Even thinking of it now scares me.

50
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,120
They say
Master Xu was a great scholar of our time.

51
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,399
He was deeply respected.

52
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,560
He often spoke out for us common folks.

53
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,040
Sadly, no good deed goes unpunished.

54
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,600
Shengyi, my cousin works
at the Imperial Academy.

55
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
This must have hit him very hard.

56
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,759
I'll go see him.

57
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040

58

There was a mole here.

155
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:01,360
Was he very close to Master Xu before?

He was always against Master Xu.

will he be pardoned?

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,519
Are you okay? What's wrong?

188
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,680
- Mudan.
- I'm fine.

189
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,759
Why have you been out of sorts lately?

190
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,000
You've been freaking out about something.

191
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,279
Due to the recent insurrection of the bandits,

192
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,319
I always feel a bit uneasy.

193
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,920
The bandits have been killed
by the authorities.

194
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,000
I watched them being executed.

195
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,680
They're totally dead. No need to worry.

196
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,640
Yes, they all died.

197
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,599
I have nothing to worry about anymore.

198
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,960
I want to discuss something with you guys.

199
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,039
<i>[Property for Sale]</i>
We can't always live in Mr. Jiang's house.

200
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
When our business gets better,

201
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,064
let's move out.

202
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,759
Then Ms. Sun can live with us.

203
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,240
the more people, the merrier.

204
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,240
Okay. It's yours.

205
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,799
- Let's go.
- Alright.

206
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,472
Let's go.

207
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,240
Lady He seems to be avoiding you.

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,880
Every time she comes
to take care of the Qiongtai Yulu,

209
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,160
you're always not home.

210
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,440
And she comes and goes in a hurry.

211
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,880
She no longer likes chatting
and joking with others like before.

212
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,559
<i>Lady He has relatives in Chang'an.</i>

213
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,240
<i>Li Xing, a student of Master Xu, is her cousin.</i>

214
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,400
Mr. Jiang, in the middle of the night,

215
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,240
why are you sitting on the wall?

216
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,079
Can't you knock on the door?

217
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,279
How could you climb over the wall?

218
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,319
You're freaking me out.

219
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,599
I was just watching the night views
on the wall of my own house.

220
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,920
I didn't mean to scare you.

221
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,839
Could it be

222
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,799
that you're afraid of something?

223
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,039
What are you talking about?

224
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,880
Alright, I can't lie to you.

225
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,839
Here's the thing.

226
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,079
I have selected a shop in the West Market.

227
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,039
I've been troubling you all this time.

228
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,720
So after my shop opens,

229
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,319
I'll pay you back.

230
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,440
I'm easygoing.

231
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,960
So, you're becoming more presumptuous.

232
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,759
I invested money in you for profits.

233
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,279
Yet when you're capable, you want to leave.

234
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,000
You wish.

235
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,880
Yes, I'm just asking you about it.

236
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,519
If you don't agree, I'll forget it.

237
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,839
You're incredibly obedient

238
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,759
and not even talking back to me.

239
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,359
I'm really too tired.

240
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,720
I've used all my energy on many things.

241
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,784
Mr. Jiang, have some water.

242
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,319
The Herbaceous Peonies

243
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,519
were bought five days ago?

244
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,279
I don't quite remember. What about it?

245
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,359
Five days ago, Master Xu of Imperial Academy

246
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,519
was robbed and killed on his way home.

247
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,799
You don't remember this either?

248
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,200
Of course, I know about this.

249
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,079
It caused an uproar throughout the city.

250
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,200
Now that you've reminded me, I remember.

251
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,640
Indeed, the flowers were bought that day.

252
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,319
Is there something wrong?

253
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,480
I have most of the money you earn

254
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,960
through hard work.

255
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,160
So you're sort of one of my people.

256
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,920
None of my followers
are dressed as plainly as you.

257
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,319
Isn't the money you've earned enough
to buy new dresses?

258
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,599
You're acting very strange.

259
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,039
You asked me when I bought these flowers

260
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,119
and found my clothes odd.

261
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,759
What's wrong with you?

262
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,160
One night, when I was walking at night,

263
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,000
I saw a flower from a distance.

264
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,519
I wondered why there was an Herbaceous Peony
in a quiet, secluded alley.

265
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,279
I went to see the flower.

266
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,559
And to my surprise, I found this.

267
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,799
You always haggle over every ounce,

268
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,319
Since I tore your dress,

269
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,640
naturally, I have to compensate.

270
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,912
What do you say?

271
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,839
This is just a very ordinary piece of cloth.

272
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,960
I'm not the only person
in Chang'an wearing this.

273
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,960
Mr. Jiang, did you find this piece of rag

274
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,279
just to make fun of me?

275
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,599
It seems I misunderstood you.

276
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,880
That's because

277
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,839
you aren't sincere with me and hid something.

278
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,400
You keep saying things to me
like they're supposed to mean something.

279
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,559
What is wrong with me?

280
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,519
When you came to Chang'an,
you said you had no relatives.

281
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,559
What about Li Xing?

282
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,160
He is your cousin.

283
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,599
I don't know what I did wrong

284
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,920
to make you investigate me.

285
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,160
Li Xing is my cousin.

286
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,599
But when my mother was still alive,

287
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,559
she cut ties with my aunt.

288
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,599
We were not close.

289
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:38,000
Otherwise, why didn't I ask him for help
when I was in trouble?

290
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,240
Why did I borrow money from you?

291
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,480
After Master Xu passed away,

292
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,440
Li Xing led others to curse me
by writing poems and essays.

293
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,240
This has nothing to do with you?

294
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,839
That's why you're questioning me?

295
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,799
Mr. Jiang, I swear

296
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,640
I have nothing to do with this.

297
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,240
I have what I have today

298
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,440
thanks to your help.

299
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,000
How could I possibly join others
in gossiping about you?

300
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,519
Previously in Luoyang,

301
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,279
you defended justice
and helped me get a divorce.

302
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,079
Not long ago, I witnessed you adopting orphans
with my own eyes.

303
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,880
I care not what others think of you.

304
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,640
In my eyes,

305
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,119
you are a person of benevolence and virtue.

306
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,119
How could I possibly be so ungrateful
and look for trouble?

307
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,240
You're just timid.

308
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,480
If you have an opportunity,

309
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,440
I fear you're the first to scold me.

310
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,759
You're open-minded.

311
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,759
What else do I have to complain about?

312
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:39,799
I just like

313
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,480
to joke with you.

314
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,559
Don't be serious.

315
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,160
I promise. My lips are sealed.

316
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,584
Jiang Changyang.

317
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,559
I'm just an ordinary citizen.

318
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:59,720
I just want
to make a little money for a living.

319
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,359
I hope you remain a wise person all your life.

320
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,039
Even if you can fly high,

321
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,559
don't forget

322
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,559
who pulls the strings.

323
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,240
Understood. I do whatever you say.

324
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,200
A flower shop opens.

325
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,119
Go and look. Maybe they're doing promotions.

326
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,799
Huamanzhu

327
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,359
is open.

328
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:25,632
<i>[Huamanzhu]</i>

329
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,640
They've actually opened a shop.

330
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,559
Ladies and gentlemen, Huamanzhu opens today.

331
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,079
To celebrate the opening,

332
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,319
within three days, a purchase of one item
gets a discount of five wen.

333
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,880
For two items, twelve wen, with no upper limit.

334

Welcome everyone to come, please.

335

Please come in.

339
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:48,480
You look exceedingly beautiful today.

Fresh flowers, fragrant powder.

343
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,400
You actually redeemed it back.

344
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,480
To open the shop,
you've invested all your money.

345
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,279
I know you've always had this on your mind.

346
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,839
Good things come in pairs.

347
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,072
Thank you, Shengyi.

348
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,040
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

349
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,680
Madam, this kind of fragrant powder

350
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,160
is made from this flower.

351
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,576
It smells so good.

352
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,759
This one has a sweeter taste.

353
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,519
Stir it a bit.

354
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,560
Put it through a sieve.

355
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,176
Please enjoy.

356
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,840
Thank you.

357
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,896
Please.

358
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Welcome to come again.

359
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,440
We have two ways of selling Herbaceous Peonies.

360
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,440
First, you can pre-order the seedlings
according to color.

361
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,519
We will plant them for you in the autumn.

362
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:04,416
When the flowers bloom next year,
you make the payment.

363
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,640
Second,

364
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,279
buy and take away immediately.

365
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,880
So you mean

366
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,759
all the Herbaceous Peonies here

367
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,160
are available to sell?

368
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes, but the flowers have their own habits.

369
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,960
The flowers in season

370
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,920
have a slightly shorter blooming period.

371
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,359
However, the good thing is

372
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:26,720
that you can enjoy the blooming flowers in time

373
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,400
without waiting a whole year.

374
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,759
Of course, it's up to you to choose.

375
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,440
It depends on your preferences.

376
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,359
It's better to enjoy it at a good time.

377
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,880
Who knows what will happen next year?

378
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,599
Madam, I'll buy

379
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,920
two purple peonies

380
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,680
to enjoy their stunning beauty.

381
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,799
Alright, please go to the main hall

382
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,400
and pick the flowers you like.

383
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,599
We'll have someone deliver them
to your residence later.

384
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,624
Thank you.

385
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,440
I would like to buy two peonies.

386
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,400
Can you transplant them in my courtyard today?

387
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,000
The flowers cannot be transplanted
when they are in bloom.

388
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,960
Otherwise, it'll damage their roots and stems.

389
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,160
If you want,

390
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,119
wait until autumn,
which is a suitable season to transplant.

391
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,599
I can transplant them for you then.

392
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,279
Alright then, I'll order two plants.

393
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,359
Okay, this way, please.

394
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,464
Okay.

395
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:14,400
<i>[Jingsheng Hall]</i>

396
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,240
Your Highness, the Yellow River dyke
in Xiangzhou has been breached.

397
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,640
The people from the Ministry of Revenue
will be sent to provide disaster relief.

398
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,400
Please allow me to go there.

399
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,480
Disaster relief is a huge issue.

400
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,480
You're new here. It's not appropriate
for you to intervene.

401
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,440
Besides,

402
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,160
Youzhen can't let you suffer.

403
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,368
Good.

404
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,279
Although I don't have much experience,

405
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm not afraid of hardship.

406
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,839
If you do this job, have you ever thought about

407
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,599
what you will benefit from it?

408
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,039
Your Highness, I am an official.

409
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,119
It's my duty to devote myself to the nation.

410
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,000
I never expect to benefit from it.

411
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,640
Zishu, you should take a more long-term view.

412
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,480
Do you know who's the master

413
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,119
of this world?

414
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,759
There are many officials
in charge of disaster relief.

415
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,079
It's not easy for you to stand out among them.

416
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,680
It's of no benefit to your official career.

417
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,319
I've already arranged another task for you.

418
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,839
It is simple and will allow you
to make connections with important officials.

419
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,680
When a higher position becomes available,

420
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,240
you can be promoted.

421
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,816
Great.

422
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,720
I will take my leave.

423
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,599
Liu Zishu is conceited.

424
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,759
He does not know

425
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,319
what he should do as my son-in-law.

426
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,119
Your Highness, Mr. Liu is still young.

427
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,680
He just needs more guidance.

428
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,440
Your Highness is ambitious.

429
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,400
He will have the chance to show his abilities.

430
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,576
Good.

431
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,232
My lord.

432
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,079
Weren't they originally
in His Highness's study?

433
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,480
Where are they to be taken now?

434
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:30,208
My lord,

435
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,279
every day, officials send

436
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,119
articles and poems of flattery here.

437
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,839
His Highness has ordered me
to regularly burn them.

438
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,160
After all, these things take up space.

439
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,240
Burn them?

440
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,232
My lord.

441
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,359
No wonder Prince Ning rejected my proposal.

442
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,119
It turns out he never even read my articles.

443
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,759
In his eyes,

444
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,000
I am just an incapable person
who pleases a woman.

445
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,720
I'm not different
from music and dance performers.

446
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,599
I've asked for leave on your behalf.

447
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,680
Let's stay at Mount Li for a while tomorrow.

448
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,920
The scenery of Mount Li is beautiful,

449
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,880
but the food there is not very good.

450
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,920
How about we
bring the chef from Fuguilou along?

451
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,960
I can't always ask for leave.

452
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,359
Otherwise, what's the point
of the Ministry of Revenue hiring me?

453
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,319
If it's all about eating,
drinking, and relaxing,

454
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,599
why should I come to Chang'an?

455
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,440
Did the Ministry of Revenue upset you?

456
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,408
No.

457
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,079
Since we're leaving the city tomorrow,

458
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,960
I must return to finish my work right now.

459
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm afraid I can't have dinner
with you tonight.

460
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,519
My lord, please stop drinking.

461
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,280
You need to get up early tomorrow.

462
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,800
If Lady Li smells the scent of alcohol on you,

463
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,320
she might guess you didn't go back to work.

464
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,920
I didn't spoil her mood.

465
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,320
I just drank in secret to drown my sorrows.

466
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,960
Why should I do anything

467
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,559
with her permission?

468
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,376
You may go. Leave me alone.

469
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:34,400
My lord.

470
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
Get out of here.

471
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,400
Take care. Come again.

472
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,416
Okay.

473
00:35:56,128 --> 00:35:57,239
How much is this?

474
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,639
This is for decoration. It's not for sale.

475
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,000
- Please come in.
- If you like it, it's yours for free.

476
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,239
If you buy five plants,
we'll give you a free one.

477
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,519
Take care.

478
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,480
I came all this way for nothing.

479
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,239
Tomorrow, you must personally
deliver the incense powder to me

480
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,760
and have tea with me.

481
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
The day before yesterday,

482
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,280
your wife bought the incense powder
from my shop.

483
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,400
Has she used it all up so soon?

484
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,039
Well then, I'll visit your wife tomorrow

485
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,239
for her patronage.

486
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,880
I don't buy it for her.

487
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,360
Madam, please don't cause me trouble.

488
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,199
I am not good at telling lies.

489
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,840
Tomorrow, l'll send the cleverest clerk

490
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,000
to deliver the goods to your residence.

491
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:48,679
My lady.

492
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,719
My lord, you…

493
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,079
You drunken man, didn't you see me?

494
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,464
Do you know each other?

495
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:03,599
No, we don't.

496
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,639
Shouldn't you apologize before you leave?

497
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,760
When you harassed a woman on the street,

498
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,280
you bumped into me.

499
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,719
You're just a minor official.

500
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,599
Aren't you supposed to work right now?

501
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,719
Now, you're drunk and spouting nonsense.

502
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,840
I can tell you're a good-for-nothing bum.

503
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,079
You have good looks,

504
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,760
but you only dare
to act recklessly here, right?

505
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,440
Do you know who I am?

506
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,079
Stop staring at me.

507
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,920
I don't care who you are.

508
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,639
Who is this man?

509
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,559
Beat him hard.

510
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,760
Beat him to death.

511
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,552
It hurts so much.

512
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,248
Hit him.

513
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Hit him hard.

514
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,800
<i>[County Princess Ji'an]</i>
This is a token.

515
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,696
Stop.

516
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,639
My lord, you work for Prince Ning?

517
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,719
Why didn't you tell me just now?

518
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:40,000
I made a stupid mistake.

519
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,079
I'm such a fool. Please spare me.

520
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,079
Keep hitting me. Why have you stopped?

521
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,199
Please spare me.

522
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:53,400
Get out of here.

523
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,559
Well…

524
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,320
Get lost.

525
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:02,912
Yes.

526
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,480
Get out of here.

527
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,360
The shopkeeper asks you to leave.

528
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,119
Please do not affect our business.

529
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,719
She gave this medicine to me?

530
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:39,800
Yes, please leave right now.

531
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,448
Thank you.

532
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,960
When I had no official post,

533
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,960
you were distant and cold to me.

534
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,440
Now that I am an official,

535
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,159
you still do not look up to me.

536
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,719
Others respect this token.

537
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,232
Yet in your eyes,

538
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,519
I have always been just Liu Zishu.

539
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,119
I didn't expect
that you had been married before

540
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,880
and had experienced such terrible things.

541
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,880
I didn't intentionally hide it.

542
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,440
I just felt that speaking of it
would only cause unnecessary trouble.

543
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,199
You won't blame me, will you?

544
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
No, we won't.

545
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,199
You dared to curse the County Magistrate

546
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,920
to defend yourself and obtain a divorce.

547
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,039
You are truly a heroine.

548
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,320
Liu Chang is different from his parents.

549
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,079
He ponders his mistakes and apologizes.

550
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,079
Wealth does not blind him.

551
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,760
He is much better than Wang Qing.

552
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,719
He's sincere towards you.

553
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,039
Such a gentleman cares about you,

554
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,800
which makes me envious.

555
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,840
Shengyi, truly caring for someone
is not like this.

556
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,920
He doesn't care what I think and pesters me.

557
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,519
It shows his selfishness, not deep affection.

558
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:32,119
You don't need to envy me.

559
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:58,197
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫</i>

560
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:06,735
<i>♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫</i>

561
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:14,609
<i>♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫</i>

562
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:23,955
<i>♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫</i>

563
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:31,498
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

564
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:40,339
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

565
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:48,150
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

566
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:56,047
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>

567
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:23,606
<i>♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫</i>

568
00:43:24,907 --> 00:43:31,601
<i>♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the fragrant garden ♫</i>

569
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:39,660
<i>♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫</i>

570
00:43:40,344 --> 00:43:48,653
<i>♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫</i>

571
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:56,084
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

572
00:43:56,915 --> 00:44:05,171
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

573
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:12,595
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

574
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:21,049
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>
