00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:36,224
<i>[Flourished Peony]</i>

2
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:38,656
<i>[Episode 24]</i>

3
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,120
Generally, the birthday banquet for the noble

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,120
is undertaken by the flower guild.

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you know why this time

6
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,359
such a bargain would fall
into the lap of someone like you?

7
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,799
Madame Tang is extremely picky,

8
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,040
and Tang Silang is unscrupulous.

9
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,959
No shopkeeper in the flower guild
dares to accept the job.

10
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,040
Huamanzhu has not joined the flower guild.

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,319
Even if you mess this up,

12
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
it won't implicate them.

13
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,120
To them, you are

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,319
merely an excellent scapegoat.

15
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,719
You, you and Lv Wanrong plotted
against me together.

16
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,680
I am merely a domestic servant now.

17
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,319
I don't have such great ability

18
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,400
to make Guild Head Lv join hands with me.

19
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,439
He, just like you, was in the dark
from beginning to end.

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,240
You deliberately let me hear
the news about the birthday banquet,

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,439
leading me to the flower guild.

22
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,840
You used everyone just to drive me to my death.

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,439
Your thoughts are so wicked.

24
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,960
No one forced you to take this business.

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,080
You ended up in this situation
all because of your greed.

26
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,919
Dusk.

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,960
Curfew is imminent.

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,759
Cherish your last hours.

29
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,039
Lady He.

30
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,400
Lady He, may you not bear grudges
for past offenses.

31
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,599
Please help me get through this difficulty.

32
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,000
Lady He.

33
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,240
Lady He, the birthday banquet begins
in the afternoon.

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,800
If you don't leave now, the flowers
in vases won't be salvageable.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,919
Lady He, please show mercy and spare my life.

36
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,032
I beg you.

37
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,039
Now you know to beg me.

38
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,199
If you want me to take action, that's possible.

39
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,919
But you must agree to my three conditions.

40
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,000
Missing one, no discussion.

41
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,879
Fine, state them.

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,120
First, immediately return Huamanzhu.

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,039
All earnings from the birthday banquet
go to me.

44
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,648
Of course, I can wait for you to botch this up

45
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:56,680
and lose your life…

46
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,159
Fine, I agree.

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,840
Second, apologize to Shengyi by kowtowing.

48
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,488
Mudan.

49
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,280
She has thin fortune. To kowtow to her,

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,600
I don't know if she can bear it.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,839
When you used to beat her in the past,

52
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,120
did you ever ask if she could bear it?

53
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,399
This humiliation is what you deserve.

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,519
Who are you trying to fool?

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
Let me tell you, Wang Qing,

56
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,560
the wounds on Shengyi's body,
the blood at the corner of her mouth,

57
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,959
an eye for an eye.

58
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
How this apology should be made,

59
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,160
you better think this through clearly.

60
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,160
You don't have much time left, kowtow.

61
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,639
Mudan, you don't have to do this for me.

62
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,199
I am telling you to kowtow.

63
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,079
Darling, I was wrong.

64
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,688
Please forgive me.

65
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,439
Darling, I was wrong.

66
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,879
Please forgive me.

67
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,120
Darling, I was wrong.

68
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,319
Please forgive me.

69
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,439
Darling, I was wrong.

70
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,592
Please forgive me.

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,200
Enough.

72
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,424
Don't cry.

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Since Shengyi has chosen to reconcile with you,

74
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,199
from now on, I hope you will behave properly

75
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,519
and treat her well.

76
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,800
If you dare to belittle or insult her again,

77
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
even if you hurt a single hair on her head,

78
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,680
I will make you suffer ten times,
a hundred times worse than today.

79
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,839
Do you understand?

80
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes, I dare not do it again.

81
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,160
What is your third condition?

82
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,759
How about these flowers?
Can they still be used?

83
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,079
They should be able to be revived.

84
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,959
We don't need to buy new flowers
from the florists anymore.

85
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,600
Wang Qing has been gone for so long,

86
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
and he has brought back
such a young lady as you.

87
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,199
Where is he?

88
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,720
Wang Qing is useless. He specifically asked
Mudan to save the flowers.

89
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,480
She is the former owner of Huamanzhu.

90
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
She can nurture any flower.

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,519
So it's Lady He.

92
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Lady He is no longer the owner of Huamanzhu.

93
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
There is no need to force it.

94
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,120
Silang is friends with Mr. Jiang.

95
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,399
If this birthday banquet, through your hands,

96
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,879
encounters a mishap, I fear…

97
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,439
Huamanzhu has already returned to my ownership.

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,839
Whether Madame Tang's birthday banquet
can be adorned with flourishing flowers,

99
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,040
I care just as much as you do.

100
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,519
Time is pressing, I hope you trust me

101
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,520
and follow my lead.

102
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,120
These flowers have wilted due to lack of water.

103
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,560
It is necessary to immerse with water
deeper than the flower stems

104
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,279
so that all these flowers can
fully absorb the water.

105
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,680
Fu, go and check,

106
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,000
see if there's any water
that has been left standing overnight.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,399
If not, fetch more from the deep well.

108
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,519
Madam, please boil more water.

109
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,552
I'll do it right now.

110
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,160
The water must be clean.

111
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,160
Given my special circumstances currently,

112
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,519
I can only trouble you

113
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,079
to send someone to the Tang Mansion
before the curfew

114
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,600
to fetch more top-quality charcoal.

115
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,439
Alright, I'll send someone right away.

116
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,224
Quickly!

117
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:05,376
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,160
The summer heat is stifling.

119
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,160
When these flowers are transported
to the garden outside the city,

120
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,439
please place ice blocks
around the banquet hall.

121
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,448
Okay.

122
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,632
What is this?

123
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,839
This is my secret recipe,

124
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,920
which can clear the flower stems.

125
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,679
Rest assured, tomorrow,

126
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,960
these flowers will surely
be as fresh as before.

127
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,200
Fu, just burn this.

128
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,279
Look, do you see it?

129
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,304
Look at this change.

130
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:08,096
<i>♫ Flowing into a scorching long river ♫</i>

131
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,616

133
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,352
Okay.

Mr. Tang.

150
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,528
Mr. Tang.

151
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,728
Lady He.

152
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,872
Please look.

153
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,584
Well,

154
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,279
this is very good, very good indeed.

155
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,440
The flower vessels chosen
by Wang Qing are not good.

156
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,072
I'm not very skilled in flower arrangement.

157
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:52,159
Well…

158
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,519
But you need not worry.

159
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,399
Before coming here, I had spoken with a florist
who excels at flower arrangement

160
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,399
and made arrangements.

161
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,440
I will take note of all the floral materials
here and inform him.

162
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
He will choose the appropriate vessels
based on the floral materials.

163
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,759
It absolutely won't miss the auspicious time.

164
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,320
That would be good.

165
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,400
Rest assured.

166
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,759
Fu, as soon as the workshop door opens,

167
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,840
I will go ask for the flower vessels.

168
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,039
It's up to you concerning Wang Qing.

169
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,679
Rest assured, I will definitely watch over him

170
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,759
to vent this anger for you.

171
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,480
Rogue merchant Wang Qing framed his wife,

172
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,679
conspiring to seize others' property.

173
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,799
He reaps the consequences
for being without sincerity and trust.

174
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,399
Today, Huamanzhu returns to its original owner.

175
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,960
Fairness to both young and old.

176
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,080
Rogue merchant Wang Qing framed his wife,

177
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,840
conspiring to seize others' property.

178
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,919
He reaps the consequences
for being without sincerity and trust.

179
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,519
Today, Huamanzhu returns to its original owner.

180
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,679
Fairness to both young and old.

181
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,960
Lady He, truly a master of your craft!

182
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,576
You flatter me.

183
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,176
Hurry up.

184
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:35,360
Yes.

185
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,944
He's been paraded through the streets all day.

186
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,240
Truly rotten to the core, serves him right.

187
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,879
Rogue merchant Wang Qing,
conspiring to seize others' property.

188
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,888
Louder.

189
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
Rogue merchant Wang Qing,
conspiring to seize others' property.

190
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,360
He reaps the consequences
for being without sincerity and trust.

191
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,960
Today, Huamanzhu returns to its original owner.

192
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,320
Fairness to both young and old.

193
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,920
Shengyi.

194
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,280
You have returned.

195
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,360
I just saw you waiting for me at the gate.

196
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,399
I thought you were willing to come back.

197
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,200
Only by seeing you return victorious
with my own eyes

198
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,120
can I be at ease.

199
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,320
Now, I have no more concerns.

200
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,080
I take my leave.

201
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,200
I just don't understand.

202
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,320
You clearly know what
a despicable scoundrel Wang Qing is.

203
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,759
Why do you still refuse to leave?

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,480
What good would leaving do?

205
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,399
What I seek is different from what you seek.

206
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,000
Like most women,

207
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,320
I desire a husband, I desire children.

208
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,240
But I can no longer bear children.

209
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,240
You never told me that.

210
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,159
Some pain, only those
who experience it can understand.

211
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,440
You are not the only woman
in this world unable to bear children.

212
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,720
After you leave him,

213
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,279
you may well meet a good man.

214
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,240
Whoever I meet again,

215
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,440
can it be guaranteed
they won't look down on me?

216
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,200
Why care how others view you?

217
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,840
It's about cherishing yourself.

218
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,600
This is the biggest difference
between you and me.

219
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,159
You cherish yourself.

220
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,279
But I

221
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,440
extremely loathe myself.

222
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,600
Shengyi, you…

223
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,039
Because I am lowly and cowardly,

224
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,799
I have never had a choice.

225
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,320
I despise being born into such a family.

226
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,000
I despise myself for never resisting

227
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
before being married off to such a brute.

228
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,039
I despise myself.

229
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,120
As soon as I return home,

230
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,799
I'd turn back into Qin Wuniang.

231
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
I despise myself even more

232
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,080
for ruining everything

233
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,240
after receiving your sincere love.

234
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,879
But what I hate the most…

235
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,919
What I hate the most is

236
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
that I am a woman.

237
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Once a woman is despised by her husband,

238
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,039
why is she then despised by the whole world?

239
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,856
I am sorry.

240
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,559
I should have realized earlier

241
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,519
that you were tortured so painfully
by conventional norms.

242
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,679
I regard you as a sister.

243
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,360
But at this moment,

244
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,600
it seems I have never understood you.

245
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,399
You have not wronged me.

246
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,200
It is I who have let you down too much.

247
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,240
I have despised myself for too many years.

248
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,600
I can't change it.

249
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,240
There is no wrong in us being women.

250
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,000
It is those who hurt you and belittle you
who are wrong.

251
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
This world has evils like Wang Qing.

252
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,319
Naturally, there will be good people
worth entrusting yourself to.

253
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,440
Even if there are none,

254
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
as women, we can rely on our own hands

255
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,960
to diligently and steadfastly work.

256
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,152
You still have me.

257
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,519
You have Chun and Fu.

258
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,839
We are with you together.

259
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,200
Let's start over from the beginning.

260
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,759
I have said so much.

261
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,440
But you still decide to leave, right?

262
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,496
Okay.

263
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,960
In this case,

264
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,680
as you are the second shopkeeper
of Huamanzhu, I must give you the money.

265
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,759
Keep it close for your use.

266
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,640
Mudan, you've already done enough for me.

267
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,319
There's no need to say these things between us.

268
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,440
For Huamanzhu's success today,

269
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,920
I am aware of all your contributions.

270
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,079
Keep this money well.

271
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,079
Make sure Wang Qing doesn't find it out.

272
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,799
There is another item.

273
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,519
I intended to keep it to give to you
when there's a chance in the future.

274
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,920
In this case, I will bring it too.

275
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,624
Shengyi,

276
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,888
wait for me.

277
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,519
Shengyi.

278
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,400
Shengyi.

279
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,800
Shengyi.

280
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,119
This name really sounds nice.

281
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:35,392
<i>[Huamanzhu]</i>

282
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,072
Thank you, everyone.

283
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,319
Although our Huamanzhu

284
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,440
made a name at the birthday banquet
in the Tang Mansion,

285
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,680
noblemen are still rare.

286
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,920
It's the common people
who are in the big world.

287
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,720
In the future, our business

288
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,920
will still rely on individual flowers
and boxes of incense powder.

289
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,599
Don't entertain thoughts
of deceit and trickery.

290
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,600
Understood.

291
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,599
The jasmine, gardenia, and wild roses
we improved before

292
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,119
have a long bloom period and robust flowers.

293
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,119
They can be used as affordable potted plants.

294
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
As for the expensive ones,

295
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,559
cymbidiums, roses, and lotuses,

296
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,240
be sure to explain clearly
to the customers before selling

297
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,519
that they have a short bloom time
and are difficult to care for.

298
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,240
But their value lies in their rarity.

299
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,960
Only Huamanzhu can cultivate them.

300
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,519
If the customers have any doubts,

301
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,119
we must not, for the sake of selling flowers,

302
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,200
lie or deceive people, understood?

303
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,264
Understood.

304
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,759
People who are willing
to spend money on these flowers

305
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,079
want something different from others.

306
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,480
Most of them don't care
about the length of the bloom period.

307
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,560
You're right.

308
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,480
Mudan, I've used our new summer flowers

309
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,720
to mix a few new kinds of incense powder.

310
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,119
Come and try the scent later.

311
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay, we can then come up
with more elegant names for them.

312
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,079
Madam, I think the flowers used in the sachets

313
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,279
can be changed accordingly.

314
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,440
What do you think?

315
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,528
I'll go with your suggestion.

316
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,519
Tomorrow, I'll go to your place to see

317
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,279
the newly cultivated Thousand-Petal Lotus.

318
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,039
This flower attracts insects
more easily than other lotuses.

319
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,440
If I am not around,

320
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,480
I hope you two will be extra careful.

321
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,200
We conduct regular patrols at night.

322
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,519
We will never let such precious flowers
be harmed by insects.

323
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,200
Thank you for your efforts.

324
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,200
I suddenly met with a misfortune before.

325
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,400
I have yet to settle the monthly payments
for everyone.

326
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,559
But you bear no grudges

327
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,319
and still wish to do business with me.

328
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,144
I'm very grateful.

329
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,079
I hope that in the future, everyone can
work together with me with one heart.

330
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,240
Once I open a new store,

331
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,799
I will increase everyone's monthly earnings
by twenty percent, is that okay?

332
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,559
Good, thank you, Miss.

333
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,000
You're kind and trustworthy.

334
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,400
We have no worries
about food and clothing following you.

335
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,960
Naturally, we will be fully dedicated.

336
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,119
Please be assured.

337
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,559
Thank you all for your hard work.

338
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,200
Put some effort into it, grind it fine.

339
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,960
Okay.

340
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,400
Pat it.

341
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,359
Gently sift it in a circular motion.

342
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,992
<i>♫ If the heart were like water ♫</i>

343
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:26,304
<i>♫ The shadow of youth is ever-present ♫</i>

344
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,184
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown ♫</i>

345
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:34,440
<i>♫ To meet for long ♫</i>

346
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,359
Mother, it won't be long,

347
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,920
I will definitely take back
our Fragrance Garden.

348
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,440
Just wait and see.

349
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,839
Every time Mr. Liu takes the horse for a walk,

350
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,160
Your Highness would come
to this desolate place to watch him.

351
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,880
However, he does not say a word.

352
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Why should Your Highness of noble birth
suffer such grievances?

353
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,400
Zishu is proud by heart.

354
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,960
He was demoted to the Stables Bureau.

355
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,000
It was my father
who forced him to face reality.

356
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,160
He acts this way because he harbors
resentment in his heart.

357
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,304
I don't blame him.

358
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,480
It's just that Zishu will one day understand

359
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,960
that this place is not where he belongs.

360
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,920
As long as he turns back,

361
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,119
I hope he can see right away
that I am waiting for him.

362
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,640
Your Highness.

363
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,440
Careful, have you hurt yourself?

364
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,160
This is a pitfall trap.

365
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,160
It was probably dug by hunters
in the mountains.

366
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,839
Your Highness, I support you.

367
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,160
Your Highness, be careful.

368
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
Careful.

369
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Such a deep trap

370
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,464
must be intended for capturing
very ferocious beasts.

371
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:11,720
In these mountains…

372
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,759
We sneaked out without bringing guards.

373
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,480
We simply can't climb up by ourselves.

374
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,880
If we encounter wild beasts…

375
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,319
What shall we do, Your Highness?

376
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,519
Why are you panicking?

377
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,319
We are so close to the mountain village.

378
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,240
If we shout loudly, someone
will surely come. Shout!

379
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,376
Yes.

380
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,880
Is anyone there? Help!

381
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,039
County Princess Ji'an is here.
Come quickly to rescue!

382
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,319
Help! Is there anyone out there?

383
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,039
Louder! Keep shouting!

384
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:41,160
Help! Save me!

385
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,000
County Princess Ji'an is here.
Come quickly to rescue!

386
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,160
Help! Is there anyone out there?

387
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,960
County Princess Ji'an is in danger.
Come quickly to rescue!

388
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,319
Help! Is there anyone out there?

389
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,319
Help! Save us!

390
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,240
Save us!

391
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,160
County Princess Ji'an is in danger.
Come quickly to rescue!

392
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,039
Help!

393
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,880
Your Highness, what should we do?

394
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,568
It's getting darker.

395
00:25:13,568 --> 00:25:14,799
If we still…

396
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,079
What's the use of crying?

397
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,359
If you don't want to die here, keep shouting.

398
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,920
Shout loudly, quickly!

399
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,119
Save us! Is anyone there?

400
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,559
County Princess Ji'an is in danger.
Come quickly to rescue!

401
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,559
Save us!

402
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,799
Help!

403
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,839
Her Highness is in danger.

404
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,440
Save us!

405
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,599
Biyu, someone's coming!

406
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,752
Help me up.

407
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:15,880
- Your Highness.
- Quickly!

408
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,160
Be careful, slowly.

409
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,208
Slow down, Your Highness.

410
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,599
Her Highness is here.

411
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,119
Her Highness is here.

412
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,880
No, it's not a person.

413
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,160
It's a wolf.

414
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,680
Biyu.

415
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,559
Your Highness.

416
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,039
Your Highness, we won't die here, will we?

417
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,680
Surrounded by beasts,
fear of unpredictable life and death.

418
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,720
She ought to experience this thoroughly.

419
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,160
Finally got to vent the spleen.

420
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,880
The wild wolves dare not jump down easily.

421
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,200
At most, they'll just scare them.

422
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,599
This bit of suffering is nothing compared
to what you endured in the military camp.

423
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,640
If you ask me,

424
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,839
she should be put in a sack
and beaten up directly.

425
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,720
Striking others with your fist
will hurt your own hand.

426
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,400
Besides, Fu's fists are so precious.

427
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,079
Why waste it on such a person?

428
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,376
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

429
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:34,432
Your Highness!

430
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:35,559
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

431
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,640
Your Highness!

432
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,720
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

433
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,079
Your Highness!

434
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,880
The County Princess's status is noble.

435
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,039
With just a message,

436
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,039
everyone in the mansion
will come to her rescue.

437
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,640
But the mute girl was nameless and unknown.

438
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,039
She wrongfully died tragically in the army.

439
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,616
Apart from me,

440
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,240
who else would remember her?

441
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,279
Your Highness!

442
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,440
Your Highness!

443
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,599
Your Highness!

444
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,920
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

445
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,456
Go fetch the paper kite.

446
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:48,512
Yes.

447
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,559
It was the birthday of the Eastern Capital's
caretaker a few days ago.

448
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,240
Liu Shen didn't go but sent two large boxes
of congratulatory gifts.

449
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,519
The gifts are so valuable,
far exceeding his annual salary.

450
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,160
When entertaining in Luoyang,

451
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,799
he was using the daughter-in-law's dowry
to supplement.

452
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,279
How long has it been
since he came to in Chang'an?

453
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,559
He has gotten so rich already.

454
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,160
Truly a big rat eating my millet.

455
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,799
Liu Chang was demoted,

456
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,720
but his father's position as the Minister
of the Imperial Treasury is so securely held.

457
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,839
It must be with the tacit consent
of Prince Ning.

458
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,119
We must find out
where Liu Shen's money comes from.

459
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,799
How to start bringing down Mr. Chen

460
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,848
depends on whether the Liu family
is impenetrable.

461
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:39,960
Yes.

462
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,440
Lady He, you've come.

463
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,519
Is Mr. Jiang here?

464
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,960
Mr. Jiang has instructed, he is currently…

465
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,079
Mr. Jiang, this is…

466
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,880
A new slingshot prepared for the children.

467
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,839
Just right to test if it can be pulled.

468
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:19,000
You plant flowers on ordinary days,
so your hands are indeed strong.

469
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,960
It's just the aim is too poor.

470
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Do you have poor eyesight?

471
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,680
Among thousands of people,

472
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,880
I spotted your extraordinariness
at first glance.

473
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,119
Is my eyesight not good?

474
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,559
It's just that I have never practiced this.

475
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,440
If I practice, I might not miss.

476
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Rather than picking a date,
it's better to just make it happen.

477
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,720
Let's practice today.

478
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,328
Zhaocai.

479
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,880
My lord, spare my life.

480
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,480
You are not usually one
to torment your servants.

481
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,640
What's the matter today?

482
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,160
My aim is poor.

483
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,359
How is it torment?

484
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,680
You know it in your heart

485
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,200
you won't hurt him.

486
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,000
But he doesn't know that.

487
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,799
He must be feeling frightened.

488
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,440
If you can't bear to watch, let it be.

489
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,720
Mr. Jiang, I've just recently
gotten back Huamanzhu.

490
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,552
The interest for this month isn't that much.

491
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:48,680
Please be patient with me.

492
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,400
Rest assured, next month,

493
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,720
I definitely won't disappoint you.

494
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,519
Also, the money for the previous purchasing
from my hometown is all in there.

495
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:00,000
Besides…

496
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,079
I want to retrieve my own indenture.

497
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,880
I want to drink wine and chat with Mudan.

498
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,720
You go fly this paper kite.

499
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,319
Fly it higher.

500
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,079
If you can win a smile from Mudan,
there will be a reward.

501
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,864
Yes.

502
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,720
What are you flying there? Go down and fly it.

503
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,856
Yes.

504
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,519
Do you have a grudge against this lad?

505
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,839
You guess.

506
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,664
Chuanyu.

507
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:03,039
Mr. Jiang, the money with which you bought me,

508
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,279
I've also put it in there.

509
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,112
It's placed here.

510
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,279
Mr. Jiang, when you're free,

511
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,640
could you go to the authorities

512
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,559
to change my household registration?

513
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,319
I understand, the favor of getting
a decent register is another matter.

514
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,880
You name a price, I will definitely
make up the amount next time.

515
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,039
You previously said we were good friends.

516
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,400
Today you're acting so distant.

517
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,799
It's not the first time dealing with documents
for a decent household register.

518
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,960
I'm not short of this bit of money.

519
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,880
Yes, it's just that even brothers
must settle accounts clearly.

520
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,200
With give and take, only then
can a friendship last long.

521
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,240
Moreover, a big favor
like getting a decent register,

522
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,759
I really do not know how to repay you.

523
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,440
I can only give you money.

524
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,400
You left the military camp.

525
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,839
The County Princess and the Liu family
will surely know it.

526
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,240
Do you want the decent household register
or do you want your life?

527
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,079
With me here, they wouldn't dare
lay a finger on you.

528
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,119
You should keep a low profile
and focus on making money for now.

529
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,240
When the time comes,
I will return the indenture to you.

530
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:12,679
Thank you very much for your protection.

531
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:18,848
Please take care.

532
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,320
How do I make a reservation for the cymbidium?

533
00:34:21,888 --> 00:34:22,960
This wild rose is really beautiful.

534
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
I would like three pots of jasmine.

535
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Please follow me.

536
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,880
- Please keep it well.
- Okay.

537
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,096
I like this one as well.

538
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,599
Fu is in good health.

539
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,079
This rash on the hands
isn't caused by internal heat.

540
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,079
It's because the hands are in contact
with these moldy ears of corn all day.

541
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,559
That's why they become red, swollen, and itchy.

542
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,599
These corn kernels are small.

543
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,760
As long as the amount
of moldy corn mixed in is controlled,

544
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,280
it's basically indistinguishable,

545
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,639
not to mention

546
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,400
washing the corn would remove
any trace of mold.

547
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,880
Fortunately, you have discovered it.

548
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,159
Otherwise, we would still be kept in the dark.

549
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,280
What about these powders
and the incense powder from the outer room?

550
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,360
Fortunately, the daily usage
of this incense powder isn't much.

551
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,639
We must quickly recall the incense powder
we have sold before.

552
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,000
Mudan, it's right to recall them.

553
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,159
But with such an occurrence,

554
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,840
people might not dare
to come to Huamanzhu again.

555
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,679
We'll return the money

556
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,039
and explain properly to everyone.

557
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,400
If we can't obtain forgiveness,

558
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,199
there's nothing we can do.

559
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,760
We did what we could.

560
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,119
As long as our conscience is clear.

561
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,360
I'll go and collect all the incense powder
from the outer room.

562
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,400
Thank you, Madam.

563
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,880
Which conscienceless person has come
to harm us this time?

564
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,599
I feel this matter isn't so simple.

565
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,840
Chun, you said before

566
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,800
recently there have been many more patients
with diarrhea and abdominal pain.

567
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,199
Yes, but I have asked them one by one
about what they had eaten.

568
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,280
It seems there was nothing abnormal.

569
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,599
Thinking about it, ordinary people

570
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,840
mostly eat corn as their staple.

571
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,679
They naturally feel there is nothing wrong
with food they are accustomed to eating

572
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,960
and wouldn't specifically report it.

573
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,760
Could this be why I've never been able
to find the cause of the illness?

574
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,760
I'll go with you to confirm it.

575
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,000
See if those people ate corn
from the same source.

576
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,039
Fu, stop scratching.

577
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,976
It's itchy.

578
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,320
Sesame seed cakes.

579
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,719
Make way, please.

580
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,800
Make way, please.

581
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:28,159
Make way, please.

582
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,480
Sheep liver cakes.

583
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,719
The rice and wheat vendors at the West Market

584
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,280
have actually adulterated
the grain with moldy corn.

585
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,840
Eating such moldy corn every day

586
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,360
will cause serious health issues.

587
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,639
Who on earth is committing this atrocity?

588
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:46,176
How is it?

589
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,360
The rice from the East Market is fine.

590
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,679
The rice from the East Market is fine.

591
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,400
The East Market is frequented by the nobility

592
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,119
while the West Market is
our common people's marketplace.

593
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,480
I didn't expect them
to be profiteering like this.

594
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,512
Who are they?

595
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,184
We must act quickly.

596
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,168
Okay, Master Liu.

597
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,960
Master Liu, take care.

598
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,119
I previously hired someone at the black market
to follow Liu Shen continuously.

599
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,400
Liu Shen is very close to the market official
who oversees both the East and West Markets.

600
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,760
This market official has held his position
for many years

601
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,360
and has never made a mistake.

602
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,079
Therefore, I did not pay attention
to it previously

603
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,599
until I discovered the moldy corn.

604
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,400
I sent someone to investigate carefully.

605
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,480
Indeed, since Liu Shen became
the superior of this person,

606
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,840
not just rice and wheat,

607
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,320
the West Market has seen an increasing number
of inferior goods.

608
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,000
The agricultural tools newly purchased
by the flower guild broke in less than half a month.

609
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,280
My father originally thought
it was the buyer's fault

610
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,920
that out of greed for a small profit,
they bought substandard goods.

611
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,159
Thanks to your warning.

612
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,159
Now that you are aware of the truth,

613
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,224
what are your plans?

614
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,159
Are you planning to report to the officials?

615
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,840
The evildoer is a high-ranking official.

616
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,360
My father is also powerless.

617
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,239
He says that merchants
should not fight with officials.

618
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,519
The guild head prudently protects himself.
It is truly a move made out of helplessness.

619
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,559
It is understandable.

620
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,920
But I…

621
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,800
It's too dangerous,
you mustn't do anything foolish.

622
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,159
It was just like this back then.

623
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,679
The Liu family passed off fake tribute medicine
as high quality,

624
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,440
delaying my chance to treat my mother.

625
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,519
Now, they have not restrained themselves.

626
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,840
Instead, they intensified their efforts.

627
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,000
They completely disregard the livelihood
and wellbeing of the common people.

628
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,039
As long as such a corrupt official
holds office for one day,

629
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,800
all of us have to live in fear for that day.

630
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,119
Liu Shen, I will not let him off.

631
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,039
I am a healer.

632
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,760
Watching people swallow moldy corn,
becoming weak and frail,

633
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,856
it is truly unbearable.

634
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,440
Mudan, I am willing to do
this foolish thing with you.

635
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,320
Rest assured, I will not be like an egg
striking a stone.

636
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,559
When I need you,

637
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,599
I will naturally tell you.

638
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,280
My lord, Prince Ning
is gathering wealth excessively.

639
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,559
It seems only Shuo Fang and Fan Yang,
the two Military Governors

640
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,119
sharing his mindset is not enough.

641
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,679
He wants to win over more Military Governors.

642
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,719
The grand ambition of Prince Ning

643
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,199
requires smoothing things over everywhere.

644
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,079
Naturally, he spends money like water.

645
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,960
My lord, through the hands of Liu Shen,

646
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,320
we could topple Prince Ning's money bag.

647
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,440
Will it alarm Prince Ning?

648
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,199
If conducting a thorough investigation
from top to bottom,

649
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,320
Prince Ning would surely become suspicious.

650
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,599
But if we investigate Liu Shen's crime
through the case of moldy corn,

651
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,239
we could work our way up and implicates
his relationship with Mr. Chen.

652
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,639
The marriage arrangement between Liu Chang
and the County Princess is no more.

653
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,800
Starting from the Liu family, it would
be easiest for Prince Ning to clear himself.

654
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,400
We are in the shadows.

655
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,679
We just need to speak a few good words
for Prince Ning when the time comes.

656
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,920
Then he would not suspect
that this purge was directed at him.

657
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,199
My lord, the way you speak differently

658
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,760
to different people

659
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,000
has become increasingly refined. I admire it.

660
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,199
All you know is to eat yourself.

661
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,360
You don't even think to feed me one.

662
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,672
My lord, please.

663
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,040
My lord.

664
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
How did you come at this hour?

665
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,760
The prey we are watching
has been targeted by others.

666
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,800
Who has no foresight?

667
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,360
Jiang Xiao… Lady He.

668
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,039
It seems she, just like us,

669
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,519
has also set her sights on this big fish.

670
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,039
These waters cannot stay calm for long.

671
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,960
These days, the shop is busy,
which is very exhausting.

672
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,639
I did not prepare late-night snacks.

673
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,239
I hope you can forgive me, Mr. Jiang.

674
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,840
How did you know it was me and not Zhu Fu?

675
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:12,853
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
