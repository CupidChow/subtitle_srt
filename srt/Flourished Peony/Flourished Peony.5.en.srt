1
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:35,708
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:39,000
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,840
Luckily, the Jade Orchid is still a young seedling. They didn't take it.

4
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:48,368
Once we return home,

5
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,541
I'll transplant you to the courtyard.

6
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,400
You only have one home to return to

7
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,360
ever since your marriage.

8
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:12,600
That is the Liu Residence.

9
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,320
Her Highness has already left.

10
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:22,800
As for those flowers of yours,

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,420
whether you want to plant them in the courtyard or in pots,

12
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,607
you can do whatever you want with them.

13
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,381
No one will touch them again.

14
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,221
You must be drunk. What are you doing in my room?

15
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:38,560
Shouldn't you be preparing betrothal gifts with your parents right now?

16
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:43,280
I guess it's a good thing.

17
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,040
Since you're here,

18
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:48,360
you can sign the divorce agreement.

19
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,381
I'll leave by tomorrow morning.

20
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:53,757
I won't stop you from marrying Her Highness.

21
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,800
The past affection between us is long gone.

22
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:05,003
She was overcome with grief and couldn't stop crying today.

23
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,140
That's why you saw what you saw.

24
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:10,840
The issue wouldn't be that difficult to resolve

25
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:13,103
had you not attracted the guests to where we were.

26
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,740
Although Her Highness can ensure the Liu family's prosperity,

27
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,941
and the He family is not beneficial to my career,

28
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,120
He Wei Fang,

29
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,760
I still wish to give it a try.

30
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,960
Enough. Stop messing around.

31
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:39,280
I'll treat you better in the future, okay?

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,720
Young Master, thank you for your high praise, then!

33
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,352
Unfortunately, you've found the wrong person.

34
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,320
Did you think I cared about your past ties with Her Highness?

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,580
Did you think I'm doing this in order to attract your attention?

36
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,102
You're overthinking it.

37
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
I'm trying to get a divorce with you

38
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:05,440
because I hate everything about the Liu Residence.

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,480
Our divorce is already certain.

40
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,320
Stop wasting your breath.

41
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,320
Hurry and sign this by today.

42
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:14,120
What are you doing?

43
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,683
You sobbed profusely on purpose today, right?

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,160
You wanted to blow the matter up

45
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,920
so that I had no choice but to marry her, right?

46
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,800
So what if you're right?

47
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,720
It's a good thing for all of us.

48
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,040
I'm sure everyone will be happy with it.

49
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,896
My parents plotted against me.

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,560
And now, you're also plotting against me?

51
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,640
I won't let you get your way!

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,240
Shu, prepare a hot bath for me!

53
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,360
Tonight, I'll spend the night with Young Madam!

54
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
You wish!

55
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:48,758
Help!

56
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,240
You think you can run away?

57
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:52,098
- You kept calling me - Help!

58
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:53,602
Young Master ever since our marriage!

59
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:55,800
I told you that you shouldn't call me that long ago!

60
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,920
It's either you call me Zi Shu

61
00:04:58,016 --> 00:04:59,237
or Dear tonight!

62
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,760
Cease your wishful thinking!

63
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,851
You're powerless against your parents!

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,960
You're powerless against the princess either!

65
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:09,539
You only flaunt your illusion of freedom in front of a weak woman like me!

66
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,790
- Let me go! - He Wei Fang!

67
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,266
You married into a prestigious official family and enjoyed utmost honor!

68
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm talented and knowledgeable! I'll be successful eventually!

69
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,190
It's a great marriage for you.

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,799
You should be content with it!

71
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,880
Why are you trying to avoid me instead?

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,040
Prestigious official family? My foot!

73
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:28,680
How are you any different from a hooligan now?

74
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,600
Even if you're from the royal family,

75
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:31,919
I'll still look down on you!

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Listen up! A hooligan is who I am tonight!

77
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,581
I'll see how you can leave once the deed is over!

78
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:38,328
Someone!

79
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:39,465
Someone!

80
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:40,684
Go on and shout!

81
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:43,488
Let's see who makes the call in the Liu Residence!

82
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:44,800
Someone!

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
Someone!

84
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:51,291
- He Wei Fang! - Someone!

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,520
Come back!

86
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,823
- You think you can run away? - Someone!

87
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,560
I'll help you up first.

88
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,400
Don't come near me!

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,200
Don't come near me!

90
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:14,511
Scram!

91
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:15,840
Scram!

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,760
I don't want to let you go, and I won't let you go either.

93
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,676
I'll explain myself to Her Highness.

94
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,200
I won't let you swallow any grievances.

95
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:29,926
He Wei Fang,

96
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,960
you should think carefully.

97
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,800
You should know what's good for you.

98
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,200
Scram!

99
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,581
So, Qingzhen Society is comprised of wanderers and fugitives.

100
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,200
Even those who tried to assassinate me, huh?

101
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,519
Indeed.

102
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:14,126
When their land was taken and they had no home to return to,

103
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,976
the leader of Qingzhen Society managed to recruit them.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,680
Experts in the society taught them reading skills and martial arts.

105
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,840
They hail from this area.

106
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,680
What's the background of Qingzhen Society's leader?

107
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,252
I haven't found anything yet.

108
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:36,527
But I found out that he didn't come from Luoyang.

109
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:38,280
He came from Chang'an.

110
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,279
So, he didn't dare to assassinate me when I was in Chang'an.

111
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,479
He came all the way here to assassinate me, huh?

112
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:48,160
There's no one else here.

113
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,360
Don't you feel giddy

114
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,320
for hanging upside down like that?

115
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,967
Using their slogan, "Clearing Corruption", the Qingzhen Society

116
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:06,531
only assassinated corrupt officials outside of Chang'an.

117
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:09,056
Although the imperial court has tried to take them down,

118
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,855
they couldn't stop their forces from growing.

119
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,020
They never operate in their territories.

120
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,360
It's no wonder we can't find them.

121
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,639
He's quite intelligent.

122
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,061
Can we travel together with the ones who tried to assassinate me?

123
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll interrogate them personally during the journey.

124
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sure I can get some intel out of them.

125
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
Our men are good at interrogations.

126
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,216
I'll make arrangements for the trip.

127
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,951
They still have enough energy to curse you out.

128
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,061
I'm sure it'll be interesting.

129
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,696
I want to see what they're capable of.

130
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,720
By the way,

131
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,440
regarding the incident at Fuyun Temple,

132
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,720
you must deal with it before we leave.

133
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,480
It's late at night.

134
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,559
Young Madam, you came here alone, wounded.

135
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,759
I assume you're not here to seek medicine.

136
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:11,981
Lord Jiang, you're intelligent indeed.

137
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,520
Liu Chang was angry at me for exposing his affair.

138
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,400
He abused me.

139
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:21,256
I intend to request a divorce from the authorities,

140
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,800
but all of the officials in Luoyang are in cahoots.

141
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,200
My only choice is to seek your help.

142
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,120
I hope you can uphold justice for me.

143
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,600
Excellent plan.

144
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:41,000
However, your means are inferior.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,320
You created this wound

146
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,680
with your right hand with a pair of scissors.

147
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,383
Therefore, the angle of the wound is toward the lower left.

148
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
And,

149
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:58,109
the bloodstain on your sleeves is also a dead giveaway.

150
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,520
Now,

151
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,917
there are no flaws.

152
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,080
Thank you for the reminder.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,260
Young Madam, I'm impressed by your strong desire for freedom.

154
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:35,876
But His Majesty rewarded me with this fan. It's very valuable.

155
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,040
Lord Jiang, if you don't help me out,

156
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:42,716
this fan can be used as evidence of you wounding me.

157
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,981
Lord Jiang, please think twice.

158
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,581
You're clinging on to me for real, huh?

159
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,840
That's not true.

160
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,511
We're just taking what we need from each other.

161
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:00,280
Lord Jiang, you've seen through my flaws.

162
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:05,000
I've seen through your flaws as well.

163
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,480
You say that you saw through my flaw with a copper coin in hand, huh?

164
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,981
It's my first time encountering such an insignificant threat.

165
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,399
I know.

166
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:23,480
Lord Jiang, with your intellect,

167
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,640
you'll never let someone like me have the goods on you.

168
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,560
But for people who are desperate,

169
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,120
it's worth a try even if there's only a sliver of a chance.

170
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,840
Moreover, Lord Jiang, if you help me out,

171
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,840
it's not like it's not beneficial to you.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,640
What's in it for me

173
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:45,600
if I help you to regain your freedom?

174
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,840
If I do leave the Liu Residence,

175
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,600
the princess will become

176
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,067
Liu Chang's official wife.

177
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:56,536
They will have their happily ever after.

178
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,080
Lord Jiang, isn't that what you desire as well?

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,160
Before this, I wanted to help you out.

180
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,096
You thought my help was too costly.

181
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,540
Now, you're seeking my help.

182
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,560
You finally understand the meaning of "You get what you paid for," huh?

183
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,380
Fine. I'll do something good for once.

184
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,360
Thank you.

185
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,840
But I have one more request.

186
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,880
I'm worried that the officials might cover up for each other.

187
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,120
Lord Jiang, can you round up some citizens for me

188
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,840
and make them surround the yamen?

189
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,716
I need some support.

190
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,576
You're quite intelligent, aren't you?

191
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,640
You know how to suppress them with public pressure.

192
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,324
Fine.

193
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,061
I'll round up some citizens and enjoy the show tomorrow.

194
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
However,

195
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,415
no matter if it's the show I'll be staging

196
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,000
or the good deed I'll be doing,

197
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,680
you have to pay up

198
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,900
this time.

199
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:05,623
Young Master Liu had an affair with the widowed princess not long ago!

200
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,400
And now, he's abusing his spouse!

201
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,761
He's shameless!

202
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,320
That's right! Look at her!

203
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:11,582
There's blood all over her clothing!

204
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,280
He's too cruel!

205
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,200
Precisely! He's shameless!

206
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,875
He's inhumane!

207
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:18,584
Silence!

208
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,296
Silence!

209
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:26,080
Lord Magistrate,

210
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,880
her causes of injury have been confirmed.

211
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,200
Lord Magistrate,

212
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,739
we only had a verbal argument last night.

213
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,440
At most, there was a slight push.

214
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:44,280
I don't remember injuring your shoulders.

215
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,319
Young Master, you can't hold your liquor well, huh?

216
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,280
You actually forgot everything?

217
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,640
What do you remember, then?

218
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,800
Do you remember the bruise on my arm?

219
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:02,880
Do you remember the injury on my forehead?

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,360
There are large patches of bruises on my back and my limbs.

221
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:10,480
Did you forget about all of them?

222
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,120
I didn't mean to injure you.

223
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,880
She's sustained plenty of injuries.

224
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,439
- How dare you say that you didn't mean it? - Precisely!

225
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,840
Shut up!

226
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:23,480
This is our family affair. This is none of your business!

227
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,908
How dare you act that arrogantly when you've abused her?

228
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:25,932
Yeah, right!

229
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:28,111
You reek of alcohol even when you're in the court!

230
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,518
You have no regard for the law at all!

231
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,063
- You! - Lord Magistrate.

232
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:34,840
Our family has been experiencing unrest lately.

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,880
That's why my son drowned himself in sorrow.

234
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,740
It's been days since he slept.

235
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,080
He's not in his right mind!

236
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,760
His words don't count.

237
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,981
Please take him to the back chamber

238
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,696
and hire a physician to give him a diagnosis.

239
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,120
We should treat his hangover first.

240
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,519
Father!

241
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,480
His incoherent words do affect the trial.

242
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,199
We can wait until Young Master Liu sobers up

243
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,640
before we proceed with the interrogation.

244
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,879
Yes, Lord Magistrate.

245
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,360
Young Master Liu, please.

246
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,400
Sorry for the embarrassment.

247
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,181
It's common for young couples to argue with each other.

248
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:22,800
- That's right. - At the very end, it's a family affair.

249
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,500
We should never air family secrets in public.

250
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,240
I think we should shut the yamen's gate for now.

251
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,941
We can talk this over.

252
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:34,400
Did you guys hear that? The girl was already abused!

253
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:36,216
He actually said that it was a family affair?

254
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,241
Guys, once they shut the gate,

255
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:40,149
they'll surely cover up for each other!

256
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,439
They'll sweep it under the rug for sure!

257
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,760
We can't let them do this!

258
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:46,800
Brazen commoners!

259
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,535
Not only are you guys disrupting the trial,

260
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,696
but you guys are also making accusations about officials!

261
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,221
Do you guys wish to be flogged?

262
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,480
- Shut the gate! - Shut the gate!

263
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,680
What gives you the right to do so?

264
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,400
- Wait! - Are you guys trying to cover up for each other?

265
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,480
Lord Magistrate,

266
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,440
the yamen holds public trials

267
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,240
to gain the trust of the people.

268
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,960
My husband had an affair outside. He abused me as well.

269
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,760
There's no need to shut the gate if the Liu family has a clear conscience.

270
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,311
Mu Dan, Zi Shu is kind and gentle.

271
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,760
He would never hurt you.

272
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,800
The Liu Residence has always been a generous household.

273
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,376
We've been caring for you meticulously

274
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,640
ever since

275
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,680
you married into our family.

276
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,960
We provided you with the best life possible.

277
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:36,200
How dare you turn against us in court?

278
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:39,160
You're acting as if our family will devour you alive.

279
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,480
I'm utterly heartbroken.

280
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,520
Mother-in-law, it's not that I want to talk back at you.

281
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,640
But don't you think

282
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:54,840
you're being too biased here?

283
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:58,328
I come from a family of merchants.

284
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:02,074
I know that I've overreached by marrying into this family.

285
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,960
Therefore, I'm cautious and respectful.

286
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
But Liu Chang?

287
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,160
Not only did he have an affair outside,

288
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:13,440
but he also abused me.

289
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,080
You guys did that to me,

290
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:19,087
yet you guys dare to say that you cared for me meticulously.

291
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:21,920
Lord Magistrate,

292
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:24,584
I came here to seek your help

293
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,300
just so I could survive!

294
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,559
Lady He,

295
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:39,280
this concerns the dignity of the royal family.

296
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,240
How dare you spout such baseless accusations?

297
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,720
If a husband has an affair,

298
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,295
that's because his spouse is not capable enough to win his heart.

299
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,960
Even now, you bear no child.

300
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:52,600
You can't blame Young Master Liu for having an affair.

301
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:57,040
You're childless, a jealous person,

302
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,920
and you disobey your parents-in-law.

303
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,800
If you two do intend to get a divorce,

304
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,920
it is you who should be divorced instead.

305
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,080
If you obstruct us from doing our duties,

306
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:10,940
you'll be convicted for disturbing the court.

307
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:12,520
According to the law,

308
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:15,396
you shall be flogged 20 times.

309
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,711
What? Flogged 20 times?

310
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,159
- Is he trying to kill her? - Lady He is already injured!

311
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,663
Now, she needs to be flogged 20 times?

312
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:22,663
Are they trying to solve the case? Or is he trying to silence her?

313
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,140
- Precisely! - Stop your nonsense!

314
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,265
Leave immediately!

315
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,584
- How can we be convinced? - You have no regard for human lives!

316
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:28,800
Lord Magistrate,

317
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:31,031
it hasn't even been one year since I married into the Liu family.

318
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,560
How could I bear a child for them?

319
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,800
And, no matter how Liu Chang treated me,

320
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:40,960
my family supported the Liu family financially when they needed it.

321
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:44,200
I even forked out most of my own dowries.

322
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:47,080
I served my parents-in-law every day.

323
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:50,360
I made sure to greet them without neglect.

324
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,720
I've done my best to serve the Liu family.

325
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,360
Why should I be abused?

326
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,400
Why should I be divorced?

327
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,560
I won't yield!

328
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:01,751
Such audacity!

329
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,860
How dare you come up with such excuses?

330
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,039
Someone, give her...

331
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,020
Lord Jiang.

332
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,740
That darned Lady He must've woken you up from your sleep.

333
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:18,320
It's her fault.

334
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,000
Lord Magistrate,

335
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,640
I just thought you were hilarious.

336
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Me?

337
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,160
What if your spouse had an affair behind your back?

338
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,340
After that,

339
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,760
she beat you up because you exposed her.

340
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,240
She also wanted to divorce you and complain about you.

341
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:35,040
Don't you think that sounds hilarious?

342
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,079
But...

343
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,751
This concerns her survival,

344
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,520
yet you want to shut the gate and pass it off as a family affair?

345
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,040
Even a puppet show doesn't have a ridiculous plot like that.

346
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,840
Lord Jiang,

347
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,559
since ancient times, wives have revolved around their husbands.

348
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,280
Aren't the affairs between husband and wife considered family affairs?

349
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,800
- That's right. - Besides, she's still alive.

350
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,494
Lord Jiang, you're busy with public affairs.

351
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:05,520
You have to serve His Majesty too.

352
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,221
You shouldn't waste your time on such trivial affairs.

353
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:13,280
What about this? I'll ask my men to send you to your residence.

354
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:16,520
You see, His Majesty is the one who arranges my time.

355
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,176
His Majesty has lived in the palace for a long time.

356
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
Compared to rare gems and treasures,

357
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,760
he values strange and unusual tales even more.

358
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,582
I've witnessed one interesting tale after another

359
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:28,360
ever since my stay at the Liu Residence.

360
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,600
His Majesty will definitely ask me about them.

361
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,280
I'm fretting about

362
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:34,640
which tale I should tell him first.

363
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:43,400
There were assassins during the flower banquet.

364
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,640
Such a serious mistake

365
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,264
has occurred within your jurisdiction.

366
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,935
Lord Jiang.

367
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,240
Fortunately, Lord Jiang, you're brave and intelligent.

368
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,400
The assassination wasn't successful.

369
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:01,480
Lord Jiang, I've prepared a gift for you as an apology.

370
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,960
I don't think we need to bother His Majesty for this.

371
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,960
That's negotiable.

372
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,093
All of us are merely sharing His Majesty's burden.

373
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,600
That's right.

374
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,360
Lord Jiang, you've been living in the Liu Residence lately.

375
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:20,760
I assume you've witnessed or heard about what happened to Lady He.

376
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,520
What do you think we should do?

377
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,120
That day,

378
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,760
something happened at Shuiyu Pavilion in the Liu Residence.

379
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,600
Lord Jiang.

380
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,920
The incident at Shuiyu Pavilion

381
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,200
could also be considered a beautiful story.

382
00:22:39,368 --> 00:22:42,760
Since they love each other, I assume they'll get married soon.

383
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,880
Lord Liu, am I right?

384
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,060
That's right.

385
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:52,560
Young Master Liu, let me congratulate you and Her Highness in advance.

386
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
However,

387
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:59,200
it's a fact that Lady He was injured as well.

388
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,421
Why don't we take them as separate matters?

389
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:03,720
Yes, Lord Jiang.

390
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
Since you mentioned the law just now,

391
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,400
we should proceed according to the law, then.

392
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:10,880
I'm not too familiar with the law myself.

393
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Chuan Yu?

394
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:16,360
According to the law, those who abuse their spouses

395
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:19,095
shall be divorced from their spouses and have their dowries returned.

396
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,817
In the worst case, compensation will be demanded.

397
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:23,122
The criminal shall be imprisoned and serve their sentence

398
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:24,720
for the crime of intentional harm.

399
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:28,800
Wait.

400
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:31,560
Is my subordinate correct?

401
00:23:31,815 --> 00:23:32,997
Yes, he's correct.

402
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,160
This is great!

403
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:37,494
- Excellent! - It's all thanks to the Flower Bird Envoy!

404
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:38,815
He did an excellent job in helping her out!

405
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,320
Excellent!

406
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:42,198
- Thank you. - Excellent job!

407
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,639
- Thank you. - Excellent!

408
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,080
Thank you.

409
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:47,920
Great! That was satisfying!

410
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,640
Lord Magistrate.

411
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,559
I came to the authorities

412
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,040
not to seek monetary compensation

413
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,480
or revenge.

414
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm merely trying to survive.

415
00:23:56,975 --> 00:24:00,120
Lord Magistrate, please permit me to divorce Liu Chang.

416
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,815
Let us sign the agreement today.

417
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,656
I shall clear the accounts and leave the residence tomorrow.

418
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,120
From now on,

419
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,399
the Liu family and I will go our separate ways.

420
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
We shall be unrelated by then.

421
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,280
Mu Dan,

422
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:15,160
you come from a family of merchants.

423
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:17,720
You don't understand the complexity of a divorce.

424
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,240
Both the husband and wife, as well as their parents, must give consent.

425
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,126
The authorities have to reissue the documents

426
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,680
and update the household register.

427
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,740
A detailed inventory count must be done

428
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:29,040
for the dowries as well.

429
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,880
It's not an instant process, you know?

430
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,920
Besides, you're still injured.

431
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:39,480
Just let us deal with the matter slowly, okay?

432
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,704
I was worried that I might be ignorant about the process.

433
00:24:43,728 --> 00:24:44,959
Therefore, I've made preparations

434
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,320
and done my inquiries prior to coming here.

435
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:57,840
I've already stamped and signed the divorce agreement.

436
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,320
I've also completed the inventory count of my dowries.

437
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:03,240
I've already deducted the amount that I'm willing to fork out

438
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,911
as a contribution to the Liu family.

439
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:06,800
Take it as a show of filial piety from me.

440
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,840
However, as for the items and shops

441
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,240
that the Liu family had sold without my permission,

442
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,520
I hope that they can return them to me.

443
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:19,680
But...

444
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,440
- Young Madam, you're truly... - Since I'm getting a divorce,

445
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:51,120
you shouldn't address me as Young Madam again.

446
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,480
My courtesy name is Mu Dan.

447
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,360
Lady Mu Dan, you're very talented.

448
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,840
It's a shame for you to stay within the confines of a household.

449
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:03,640
I'll surely reward you handsomely

450
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:05,720
if you're willing to be my accountant.

451
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,600
I'm being sincere here.

452
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:14,039
Lord Jiang, thank you for your recognition.

453
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:16,318
I do desire to serve you as your accountant.

454
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,600
However, Chang'an is too far away.

455
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,320
It's a shame.

456
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm fine with the other items.

457
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,400
But the peony was already planted in our courtyard.

458
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,000
If you intend to dig it out,

459
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,680
there will be holes everywhere.

460
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,800
The courtyard will look terrible.

461
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,320
It's just a plant.

462
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:36,880
You shouldn't take it to heart.

463
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:39,822
A few days ago, during the banquet, Lord Liu once bragged

464
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:43,400
to his guests that the prized peony was extremely valuable.

465
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,000
How could I not take it to heart?

466
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,200
Lord Jiang, you were there as well.

467
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,200
You should remember it.

468
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,575
You're talking about Gold Nugget, right?

469
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,880
Of course I remember it.

470
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,200
Lord Magistrate,

471
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Lord Liu,

472
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,440
please affix the seal.

473
00:27:17,855 --> 00:27:19,316
The Liu family has been officials for many years.

474
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,727
You receive a generous salary as well.

475
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:23,000
Don't tell me you can't even fork out such a small sum?

476
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,880
Lord Jiang, my seal is still in the residence.

477
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,133
Moreover, this is a year's worth of accounts.

478
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,221
I can't calculate all of them myself.

479
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:33,919
I need to hire an accountant to go through everything for me.

480
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:35,600
It'll take him a lot of time.

481
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,240
And, we've been busy with public affairs lately.

482
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,680
Even if we do rush it, it'll take until next month.

483
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,616
How long will it take to hire an accountant

484
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,960
to go through the accounts according to what Lord Liu had said?

485
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:50,799
Three days.

486
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,160
If so, you all shall come here

487
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,160
to affix the seal in three days.

488
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:57,314
Once the official documents have been reissued,

489
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,079
the divorce will be done!

490
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:01,711
- Excellent! - This is great!

491
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,228
The Flower Bird Envoy is amazing!

492
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:04,680
This is great!

493
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:11,360
The two are parting ways in search of their own happiness.

494
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,040
It can be considered a happy ending as well.

495
00:28:18,711 --> 00:28:20,080
All of you should leave now.

496
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,520
What are you guys waiting for?

497
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:24,480
The case is over.

498
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,920
Court dismissed!

499
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:35,275
Lackey Jiang! Kill us if you dare!

500
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:36,655
There's no need to complicate things!

501
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:39,198
We'll stay united no matter where you take us!

502
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,880
We'll insult your ancestors!

503
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,280
It's not like I care about them a lot.

504
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,840
Insult them all you like.

505
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:48,960
I have plenty of ways to teach you guys a lesson once we reach Chang'an.

506
00:28:49,663 --> 00:28:51,880
See you when I see you.

507
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:53,189
The heavens must be blind!

508
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:54,430
Corrupt officials are in power now!

509
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:56,240
Kill me right now if you dare!

510
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,071
I'll turn into a vengeful spirit!

511
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,640
I'll cause chaos at your ancestors' graves!

512
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,680
I won't let you rest in peace!

513
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,000
To hell with you!

514
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,167
Lackey Jiang!

515
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,680
Isn't he tired of these boring insults?

516
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,279
This is no fun at all.

517
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,340
My Lord, we may depart as well.

518
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Who are you waiting for?

519
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,280
I've staged a huge act.

520
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,880
I've done an excellent deed as well.

521
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,919
Even if I'm not doing this for the cheers, I still need the money.

522
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:31,480
Lord Jiang? Lord Jiang, please wait.

523
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:34,040
My Lord, your prediction indeed came true.

524
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,040
Lord Jiang, you assisted me in realizing my wish.

525
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,960
I came here to see you off as thanks.

526
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:47,480
This is for you.

527
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,799
I cherish beautiful women, and I uphold justice.

528
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:55,040
I'm doing it for the sake of passion, not money.

529
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:03,760
Not bad. It's quite heavy.

530
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,560
Money is cold to the touch.

531
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,320
It's not as warm as the roasted flatbreads.

532
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,896
I brought three jin of them for you.

533
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,880
Lord Jiang, you can have them when you're hungry.

534
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,920
I suppose this gift of gratitude is quite valuable, huh?

535
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:31,474
It's just a joke. I'm just joking.

536
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,760
The Liu family hasn't returned my dowries to me.

537
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm short on cash as well.

538
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,920
Let me owe you for now.

539
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,760
Chuan Yu,

540
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:46,078
the first person who dares to owe me money has actually appeared.

541
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,200
I charge a high interest. You won't be able to repay your debt.

542
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,800
In my opinion,

543
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,720
you should come with me to Chang'an and become my accountant.

544
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,440
You'll make plenty of money. I'm serious.

545
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,400
Only those who are bold can make huge fortunes.

546
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,560
However, I'm not.

547
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,880
Lord Jiang, may you have a smooth journey ahead.

548
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:09,560
I'll repay the favor

549
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,440
when I encounter you again.

550
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,880
You see,

551
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,320
the flatbreads are delicious.

552
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,199
I've applied two layers of nectar on them.

553
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:28,216
These are made with my family's traditional recipe.

554
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,520
You guys should try them.

555
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,000
You guys must have them while they're hot.

556
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,400
Remember that.

557
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,640
My Lord, they're delicious.

558
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:42,440
They're indeed more valuable than money.

559
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,720
Let's go.

560
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:52,975
Let's depart!

561
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:15,080
I've been so busy in the past few days.

562
00:32:15,286 --> 00:32:17,446
I haven't had the chance to give you some fertilizers.

563
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,840
I didn't expect you to be so strong.

564
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,040
There are already flower buds now.

565
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,319
Once Liu Chang seals the agreement with his thumbprint,

566
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,680
we'll go home together.

567
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,760
Mu Dan!

568
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,000
Mu Dan loves peonies!

569
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,760
Shuai Shuai, you too.

570
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:37,080
Let's go home together, okay?

571
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,080
Let's go. Time to make you something nice.

572
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,320
The Flower Bird Envoy and his men have left Luoyang.

573
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,520
We may act now.

574
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,516
He Wei Fang was considered diligent and respectful

575
00:33:15,604 --> 00:33:17,087
in their first year of marriage.

576
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,160
Master, why are you trying to kill her?

577
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,800
It's bad karma, you know?

578
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:24,480
Initially, I only wanted our son to divorce her.

579
00:33:25,023 --> 00:33:26,352
But she didn't know what was good for her.

580
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:27,696
She insisted on taking the dowries back.

581
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,300
She even turned the case into a trial, harming our reputation.

582
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:33,007
Establishing a marriage alliance with King Ning

583
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:36,240
is the only chance the Liu family has to make a comeback.

584
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,800
We must keep some money.

585
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,571
We can't allow her to live.

586
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,495
Father was the one who agreed to her leaving!

587
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,760
Not me!

588
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,080
Where's He Wei Fang?

589
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
What is she doing right now?

590
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:54,960
Young Master,

591
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,640
she has already prepared a carriage.

592
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,216
She's busy packing her personal belongings

593
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,520
and auditing the storeroom.

594
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,320
Shu has already moved her belongings onto the carriage.

595
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,720
She's just waiting for you to seal the agreement with your thumbprint.

596
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,520
She can return to her hometown by then.

597
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,680
Young Master,

598
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,200
since it has come to this,

599
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,880
it's already too late to turn back.

600
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,271
Her Highness requested the Liu family to ask for her hand.

601
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:18,880
She wants to be your official wife.

602
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,360
If you don't keep your word, the family will be in huge trouble.

603
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:32,200
Young Master?

604
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,800
My foot.

605
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm just a decoration in the house.

606
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,000
They put me wherever they like.

607
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,120
I don't get to decide

608
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,200
when I get married or get a divorce.

609
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,080
I can't keep the person I wish to keep.

610
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,600
And, I can't get rid of my old flame when I want to.

611
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,640
Young Master, I understand your feelings.

612
00:34:56,688 --> 00:35:00,080
In the past, Young Master, you missed Her Highness every day.

613
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:02,320
But when you saw her again,

614
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:04,951
she became very different from who she used to be.

615
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,720
Young Master, I know it's tough.

616
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,080
You Zhen said she did everything for my sake.

617
00:35:14,607 --> 00:35:16,527
But she's just oppressing people with her power.

618
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,920
The youthful feelings of the past

619
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,480
have all been erased by power.

620
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,640
Humans do change.

621
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Lady He has become different from who she used to be as well.

622
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,520
He Wei Fang.

623
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,760
I originally thought of her as a weak woman, like a clay figurine.

624
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,080
But I never expected her

625
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,941
to feel joy and anger.

626
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:46,443
I never expected her to resist and strive for her happiness.

627
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,520
Maybe things would've been different

628
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,080
if I had treated her sincerely back then.

629
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,520
I've already lost my freedom to choose once.

630
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:07,000
Now, I can't afford to repeat my mistake.

631
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,719
I just need to find the divorce agreement.

632
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:48,120
Just find it and burn it.

633
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:51,400
I just need to burn it.

634
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:10,413
(Divorce Agreement)

635
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:56,120
So, the Zixi Pill my parents gave her was fake?

636
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,720
(If Mu Dan finds out, )

637
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
(I'm sure she'll hate the Liu family even more.)

638
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:57,920
Young Master.

639
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,440
Young Master, did you hear anything just now?

640
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:02,280
No. What's wrong?

641
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,791
Master instructed me to deliver some items to Young Madam.

642
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:06,265
But she seemed upset with them.

643
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,960
She raised her voice and argued with me.

644
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,999
But she ran away before I could finish my words.

645
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,240
Young Master, did you see where she went?

646
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,040
She ran over there frantically.

647
00:39:16,182 --> 00:39:18,382
I think she was heading in Shuiyu Pavilion's direction.

648
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,880
Thank you, Young Master.

649
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:32,256
You may come out now.

650
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:46,511
Be careful.

651
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:49,760
Why did you save me?

652
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:52,400
You're my spouse. I've never intended to harm you.

653
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:57,480
Mu Dan, I'll ensure your safety as long as you're willing to stay.

654
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:03,400
You don't even get to decide who you'll marry and have a child with.

655
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,760
What makes you think that you can protect me?

656
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,640
Liu Chang,

657
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,840
our divorce is certain.

658
00:40:12,551 --> 00:40:15,120
Now, we just lack a seal from the local authorities.

659
00:40:15,263 --> 00:40:16,800
He Wei Fang, I saved you, you know...

660
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,960
Who did you think was trying to kill me?

661
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,680
Have you made up your mind?

662
00:40:24,848 --> 00:40:26,288
I have.

663
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:33,040
Your carriage is at the side entrance.

664
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,215
But we haven't signed the divorce agreement yet...

665
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,336
Do you know what situation you're in?

666
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,680
Just get out if you wish to live.

667
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,120
Lady He was cunning.

668
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,239
She ran away.

669
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,880
I couldn't find her even after searching the entire residence.

670
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,040
Useless fool!

671
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,175
She's just a weak woman who can't even defend herself.

672
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,760
How could you let her escape?

673
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,640
Where can the daughter of a merchant run to?

674
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,880
I'm sure she went to look for her father.

675
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:43,120
Bring along a few skilled servants with you.

676
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,960
Rush to the He Residence.

677
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,880
When you see her father,

678
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,720
think carefully about how to phrase your words.

679
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,520
Do not fail again.

680
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:53,360
Yes, Master.
