1
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:36,184
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,011
(Episode 30)

3
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,000
Young Master, the bride is here.

4
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Where's the Fan-removing Poem?

5
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,551
I seldom see you dressed up like this

6
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,630
so my mind was blank.

7
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,639
I forgot.

8
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,630
I'll reluctantly consider

9
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,710
both your Fan-removing Ritual complete.

10
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,351
There's also the Handwashing Ritual.

11
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Husband and wife

12
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,119
washing their hands together

13
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,271
as a symbol of purity.

14
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:24,494
Don't flick my forehead.

15
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,359
Chun and Da Fu put in a lot of effort

16
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,471
to do my makeup.

17
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,080
Lord Xu, look at her.

18
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,430
Shut up. Just wipe her hand.

19
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,911
Coming up is the Woe-sharing ritual.

20
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,439
The couple

21
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,510
will eat meat from the same animal

22
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,950
as a symbol of becoming a family

23
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,551
who will support each other and share weal and woe together.

24
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,959
Choose one.

25
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,111
Drinking from the same cup. Husband and wife become one.

26
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,111
Two hearts united, bringing everlasting happiness and prosperity.

27
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,680
What else? Mother, what else?

28
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Tying the hair

29
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,760
and entering the bridal chamber.

30
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,400
Entering the bridal chamber!

31
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Entering the bridal chamber!

32
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,510
Entering the bridal chamber!

33
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,920
We won't skip

34
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,351
this last step.

35
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,911
The joy of entering the bridal chamber is between the groom and bride.

36
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,151
I'm sure it's not right

37
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,151
for all of you to be watching.

38
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,280
I am old.

39
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,310
I can't bear to watch a young couple.

40
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Continue without me.

41
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,240
Remember. Respect the ritual

42
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,950
so this auspicious event can be perfect.

43
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Me too.

44
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm old.

45
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,111
I won't join this.

46
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,190
Enjoy the bridal chamber pranks.

47
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,519
Is it heavy?

48
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Do you want me

49
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
to help you remove it?

50
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Then,

51
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,670
let me remove it for you as well.

52
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,231
Lord Xu told us

53
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,670
to follow the ritual.

54
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Yes.

55
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,431
The first comb until the end.

56
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,471
May wealth and joy never end.

57
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,231
Comb more

58
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,630
and make us wealthy.

59
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,910
The second comb until the end.

60
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,431
Without worry or illnesses to impend.

61
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,150
This sounds good too.

62
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,670
The third comb until the end.

63
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,910
With respects aligned,

64
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,390
united in love till the very end.

65
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,030
With a start and an end,

66
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,879
may we share riches

67
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
till life's end.

68
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,351
I promise you on the last one.

69
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,510
May we share riches till life's end.

70
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
I will never break my promise.

71
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,159
Me too.

72
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,831
I will never break my promise.

73
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,991
Forget about this.

74
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,360
It's difficult for me to grow my hair.

75
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Forget it.

76
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,879
Anyway,

77
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,711
I'll give my hair to you.

78
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,920
If you lose your hair while combing,

79
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,351
just put a few strands here

80
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,550
and the knot will be tied.

81
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,870
Why does it sound so scary?

82
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,952
Aunt went to a foreign country on a ship.

83
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,360
She was so angry when she found out she missed our wedding.

84
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,630
She ordered someone to rush here

85
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,351
and give you this gift.

86
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,630
It's not something important.

87
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,419
Coincidentally, you've opened a new shop recently.

88
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,559
You look exhausted and your hair looks dull.

89
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,351
Comb more so you'll have fewer headaches.

90
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,030
All right. I'll try to get some of your aunt's wealthy blessing on me.

91
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,951
This comb looks nice.

92
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,519
It's exquisite.

93
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:36,510
Chun is developing a new pill that helps women grow more hair.

94
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,431
I can make some combs out of sandalwood

95
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:40,630
and pair them with the pill.

96
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,231
Won't that make us more money?

97
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,390
Sandalwood can help reduce hair loss

98
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,431
and get rid of wind, heat, and pain as well.

99
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,231
It is a perfect match with that Tresses Pill.

100
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,870
A token of love is very important.

101
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,150
He is just going to give her a comb?

102
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Let me tell you a secret.

103
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Don't reveal it to others.

104
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,399
This comb

105
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,231
is very important to Young Master.

106
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,270
Its monetary value is not important.

107
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,119
It belonged to Young Master's late mother.

108
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,839
When Madam was alive,

109
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,919
she said

110
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,071
if her son got married,

111
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,910
he must give it to his wife.

112
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,679
She only hoped Young Master and his wife

113
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,231
could live harmoniously

114
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,919
and grow old together.

115
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,351
The hair-tying ritual is complete.

116
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,231
As for the wedding chamber ritual,

117
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,071
if you are going to keep eavesdropping,

118
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,550
I might...

119
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:48,959
Yes.

120
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,720
Go! Let's go!

121
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,560
My mother told me about the wedding chamber ritual.

122
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,750
Aren't we watching that?

123
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,630
Let's see what they'll do.

124
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,910
Why aren't we watching?

125
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Come here, quickly.

126
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,759
Quick!

127
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,231
The Imperial Housekeeping Bureau

128
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,959
is really rich.

129
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,790
They put so much money here.

130
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,030
What a pity. These are not Kaiyuan Tongbao.

131
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,711
Otherwise, we'll be so rich.

132
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,910
These specially made bed money

133
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,510
symbolize luck, prosperity, and harmony.

134
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,550
They are not money you can use.

135
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
I'm hungry too.

136
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Let's eat together.

137
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,399
Great.

138
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,790
I'm almost starved to death.

139
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,910
You must remain

140
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,159
as your previous self.

141
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,440
There's no need to be restrained just because you married an official.

142
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,471
Forget about the customs.

143
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,279
Keep doing what you usually do

144
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,510
when it comes to your business.

145
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,689
If any officials are making complaints,

146
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,279
I'll deal with them.

147
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,870
The last time I married someone was a real marriage

148
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,750
but the wedding was ridiculous.

149
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,910
I suppressed my personality every day

150
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,191
and had to pretend as a virtuous wife of the Liu family.

151
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,591
I never had a single happy day.

152
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,559
Even though

153
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,351
it's a fake marriage this time,

154
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,270
I can truly become He Wei Fang.

155
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,030
Having a best friend like you in life

156
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,879
is good enough.

157
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Yes.

158
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Let's drink.

159
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,790
In the future,

160
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,711
if you meet someone you truly love,

161
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
don't worry.

162
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,550
I don't want the wager.

163
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,711
I will write a divorce letter myself

164
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,840
and will never get between you and your true love.

165
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,759
Sure.

166
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Young Master.

167
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Go away.

168
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:45,736
Young Master. It might be a matrilocal marriage

169
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:47,344
but His Majesty issued an edict

170
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,600
to promote you to Vice Commissioner of Transport at the banquet.

171
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,198
This position is in charge of transport and is exactly what you want.

172
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,911
You can achieve your ambition in the future.

173
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,998
How am I different from He Wei Fang

174
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,110
who used to marry into the Liu family?

175
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,070
Officials belittling the merchants.

176
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,631
Royalty belittling the officials.

177
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,911
One social class suppresses another.

178
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,270
If we don't climb up the social class,

179
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,191
we will forever be bullied.

180
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,231
Don't say that, Young Master.

181
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,631
Hearing that scares me.

182
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
You're scared?

183
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,350
What are you scared of?

184
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,270
I will become a good matrilocal son-in-law.

185
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,151
I will also

186
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,590
manage the transport well.

187
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,319
Young Master.

188
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,799
Young Master.

189
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,550
Don't let your feet get cold.

190
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,240
They are just a few pots of flowers.

191
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,359
You don't know.

192
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,599
These flowers

193
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,079
cannot be soaked in the rain.

194
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Young Master.

195
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,350
Peonies cannot be soaked in the rain

196
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,351
but these are Thousand-petal Lotuses.

197
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,871
The blooming period is over.

198
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,191
There are no peonies anymore.

199
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Thousand-petal Lotuses?

200
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,270
Treasured lotus with a thousand leaves

201
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,070
is like Buddha.

202
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,231
If there are deities and gods,

203
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,550
do they know my suffering

204
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,631
and help ease my suffering?

205
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,759
Young Master.

206
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Inform the whole residence.

207
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,590
I don't want to see any peonies or lotuses

208
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,350
in my residence.

209
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Yes.

210
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,151
Young Master, you look refreshed.

211
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,880
Congratulations on having a good wife and long-lasting blessing.

212
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,951
Congratulations on your wedding. I hope you live a harmonious life.

213
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,671
You flatter me with your sweet talk.

214
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
I like it.

215
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:04,608
- You'll be rewarded. - Thank you, Young Master.

216
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,110
Congratulations, Young Master.

217
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,359
You'll be rewarded.

218
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,471
Congratulations, Young Master.

219
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,070
All of you will be rewarded!

220
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:16,830
Thank you, Young Master!

221
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Be careful.

222
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,759
Sleeping with you yesterday

223
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,270
and moving away today.

224
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,839
This...

225
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,070
Madam He is so heartless.

226
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Da Fu.

227
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Where's Mu Dan?

228
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
All of you are...

229
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,590
Mu Dan went to take care of Fang Garden in the morning.

230
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:44,471
I'll also move to Fang Garden in the future.

231
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,391
Thank you for taking care of me during this period, Lord Jiang.

232
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:49,759
Let's go.

233
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Let's go.

234
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,830
She's moving?

235
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,920
I thought Fang Garden was just a place

236
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,310
for viewing scenery or doing business.

237
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,510
If she misses the place,

238
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,270
she can just spend a few days there.

239
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,550
I went to take a look at Fang Garden in secret.

240
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,350
There are many houses there

241
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,951
and the scenery is beautiful.

242
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:22,640
It's way more comfortable than living in this shabby place.

243
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,711
Young Master, do you not want Madam He to leave?

244
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,590
What do you mean?

245
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:33,119
Moving away the next day after her marriage.

246
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,138
What will happen to my reputation as Flower Bird Envoy?

247
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:42,799
Thankfully, there are many decorations in this house.

248
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,560
She can't move most of them in a short period.

249
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:48,270
Go to Fang Garden and keep an eye on her.

250
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,320
What should I tell Madam Fang

251
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,510
when I see her?

252
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,360
Should I tell her that you miss her

253
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,631
and wants her to move back

254
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,231
or should I say

255
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,200
that it's not right to move immediately after the night of the wedding?

256
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Just tell him

257
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,519
that I'm happy for her

258
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,631
for getting back the garden

259
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,040
but restoring the garden is a huge task that requires many people.

260
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,422
I'm worried that she is too exhausted.

261
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:11,613
I'm willing to help her.

262
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Understood.

263
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Slowly.

264
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,519
- Come and help out. - Coming.

265
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,431
Three, two, one. Be careful.

266
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,359
Mu Dan.

267
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,631
Let's go there together.

268
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Slowly.

269
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,599
Come.

270
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,391
If I can let those who are sincere in viewing flowers

271
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,871
to see the beauty of the garden inside,

272
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,030
I'm sure Mother will be very happy in Heaven.

273
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,759
Madam He.

274
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,710
Renovation of the garden is a difficult and complicated task.

275
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,310
Young Master is willing to help you

276
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,391
in terms of manpower and tools.

277
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,191
I need to

278
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,711
restore Fang Garden myself.

279
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,679
That is how I can experience the joy

280
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,991
of getting back what I lost.

281
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,510
Moreover, Lord Jiang has given me a lot of help.

282
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,631
Leave the renovation of the garden

283
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,871
to me.

284
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,487
There's no need to trouble Lord Jiang.

285
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,599
It's terrible!

286
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,320
- What's wrong? - It's terrible!

287
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,120
You look like you're panicking. What happened?

288
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,764
An old servant of this garden won't leave

289
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,336
after hearing about the garden's acquisition and wants to commit suicide.

290
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,559
Where is she?

291
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,521
Over there. Let's go. Hurry.

292
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,959
Let go. Let go of me!

293
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,270
- Come down! - Let go of me!

294
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,120
- Let go of her! - It's her.

295
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,519
- Please make way. - Let go of me!

296
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,360
Let go of me! What are you doing?

297
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
Let go of me!

298
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,039
Move. It's all right.

299
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,119
Ignore her.

300
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,520
Go on. Continue.

301
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,391
Why are you stopping?

302
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,671
This is a slip knot.

303
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,310
You won't die.

304
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,110
If you want to commit suicide.

305
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,790
Dying at night is more convenient.

306
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,070
What do you want? Just tell me directly.

307
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,391
Are you Shopowner He?

308
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,279
Why are you so harsh

309
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,871
for someone your age?

310
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,400
I just came here

311
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,551
and haven't said or done anything

312
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,711
but you are showing your might immediately.

313
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,960
How can I still treat you kindly?

314
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,160
You look like a wise person.

315
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,590
I'll speak frankly then.

316
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,600
I've served the garden for a long time.

317
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,871
Every time the owner changes, they are firing someone.

318
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,711
However, I'm old and don't want to go through this trouble anymore.

319
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,991
I hope you can let me stay here.

320
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,279
I investigated the background of every servant in this garden

321
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,070
according to Young Master's orders.

322
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,391
This woman is Tang.

323
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,590
Everyone calls her Madam Tang.

324
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,631
She was fired when the previous owner sold the garden.

325
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,560
Later, when Leader Lv took over,

326
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,191
she also tried to commit suicide.

327
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Leader Lv couldn't argue against her and let her stay.

328
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,711
Madam Tang is reluctant to leave this place

329
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,320
and is willing to commit suicide.

330
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,350
I'm sure there's another reason.

331
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,030
- I... - Madam Tang has a son.

332
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,310
Last year, he committed burglary at the County Lieutenant's Residence

333
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,400
and abandoned her to avoid punishment.

334
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,798
There's still no news of him until now.

335
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,310
My son was framed. That was why he abandoned me.

336
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,471
I'm sure the brat will come back.

337
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,951
Madam, this is my home with my son.

338
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,231
If I leave,

339
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,711
he won't be able to find me when he comes back in the future.

340
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,830
Please let me stay.

341
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,391
Please let me stay here.

342
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,070
Madam Tang, stand up.

343
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,319
Stand up.

344
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,240
Madam, I'm human.

345
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,151
I understand your intention as a mother.

346
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,991
However, this is business.

347
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,830
I renovate Fang Garden

348
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,750
so guests can enjoy the flowers here.

349
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,310
Food, wine, music, and scenery

350
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,151
must be cared for meticulously.

351
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,671
I'm renovating it today to run a business in the future.

352
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,631
If you are a capable,

353
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,310
I will let you stay.

354
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Otherwise...

355
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,279
Since you are running a business,

356
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,199
I'm sure you need a manager.

357
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,640
I've always been this garden's manager.

358
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,560
I've never made a mistake

359
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,590
in purchasing supplies for hundreds of people.

360
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,991
A talent in management

361
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
isn't rare.

362
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
What about manpower?

363
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,959
My father was a craftsman.

364
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,360
Every craftsman in Chang'an,

365
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,560
including tile makers, embroiderers, and musicians,

366
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,830
have to show me respect.

367
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,759
Mu Dan, we do need a lot of manpower

368
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,386
for the renovation and opening of the garden.

369
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,151
You have a high standard about this.

370
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,559
Why don't you

371
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
give her a shot?

372
00:29:04,796 --> 00:29:06,199
What kind of people are you looking for?

373
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,350
Just tell me.

374
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:09,238
Give me three days.

375
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,120
If I can't find the talent you ask for,

376
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,310
I will move.

377
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Fine.

378
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,391
I will give you three days.

379
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,550
Thank you, Shopowner.

380
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:29,383
If you want anything in the future, just tell me directly.

381
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,839
Don't cause any more trouble.

382
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,047
Great.

383
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,482
Young Master doesn't even get a chance to help search for talents now.

384
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,510
She hasn't returned for two days.

385
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,991
She has to return tonight no matter what.

386
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,030
I'm sure she has to bring all these flowers away.

387
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,281
Young Master, King Ning is here.

388
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:26,519
He is here to congratulate you for marrying a concubine

389
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,920
and brought a few boxes of treasure.

390
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,991
My concubine talked back against the princess.

391
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,960
I should be sending gifts as an apology.

392
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,191
How can I ask you to visit me, King Ning?

393
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,108
I'm afraid doing this might reduce her lifespan.

394
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,070
You Zhen's injuries

395
00:30:43,656 --> 00:30:46,110
were caused by the untamed wild horse after all.

396
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,750
How can a lowly animal

397
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,590
sever my close relationship with you?

398
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,519
Sui Zhi.

399
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,191
You finally have a partner now.

400
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,151
I feel very happy.

401
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,671
It's only right to give you these gifts.

402
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,039
However,

403
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,151
I still need you

404
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
to open

405
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,550
this most precious gift.

406
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,151
Sui Zhi, don't panic.

407
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Lian Zhou,

408
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
come out.

409
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Lord Jiang.

410
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
My Lord,

411
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,839
this is...

412
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,391
You said you wouldn't get married before this

413
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,590
but now that you've gotten a concubine,

414
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,240
marrying another person won't matter much.

415
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,750
This is a double happiness.

416
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,880
Moreover, if you have many children,

417
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,400
you'll be able to satisfy

418
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
your late parents.

419
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,039
I think

420
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,350
His Majesty will also be happy about this.

421
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
My Lord,

422
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,391
My name is Lian Zhou.

423
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,000
My skills in embroidery, guqin, and dancing

424
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,510
were all taught by famous teachers appointed by King Ning.

425
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,519
I also learned customs and rituals

426
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,510
in the King's Residence.

427
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,391
I'll surely manage the residence in the future

428
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,079
so you can always concentrate.

429
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,080
Miss Lian Zhou is pretty

430
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,270
and good at many talents. You are a great person indeed.

431
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,671
However, this is something you don't know.

432
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,070
My concubine gets jealous easily.

433
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,560
If I marry someone else

434
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,080
three days after marrying a concubine,

435
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
I'm afraid

436
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,431
my life will be difficult in the future.

437
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,790
Being jealous as a concubine

438
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,350
is disrespectful to her husband.

439
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,671
She lacks manners.

440
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,279
Lian Zhou,

441
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,070
you must educate her when the time comes.

442
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Yes.

443
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Sui Zhi.

444
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,510
In the past, I granted you a marriage

445
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,839
but you refused.

446
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Right now,

447
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm granting my beloved daughter to you

448
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,671
as your concubine.

449
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,790
If you refuse again,

450
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,030
are you really trying to sever ties with me?

451
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,599
Not at all.

452
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,799
I'm worried that Miss Lian Zhou will feel aggrieved

453
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,871
out of my respect for you.

454
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Not at all.

455
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
I came here

456
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,360
with the banquet of your wedding

457
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,711
fully prepared.

458
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Come in.

459
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,590
A few days ago,

460
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,510
you married a concubine

461
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,871
without even a banquet invitation.

462
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,151
For your wedding today with Lian Zhou,

463
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,431
I've arranged my best servants to organize it.

464
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,151
I'm sure it will show both our residences' reputation.

465
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,871
You are so considerate, My Lord.

466
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,391
I'm sure you've already sent

467
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,231
this banquet's invitation.

468
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,640
Sui Zhi, you are unrestrained

469
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,590
and wouldn't be hindered by these trifles.

470
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,911
I'll help you get it done.

471
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,030
Moreover, I made a divination

472
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,880
and selected today

473
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,351
because it is a very auspicious day.

474
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,559
Sui Zhi,

475
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,190
what do you think?

476
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,039
In that case,

477
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,550
thank you, King Ning.

478
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Thanks for your grace,

479
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
My Lord and Young Master.

480
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,510
In the future,

481
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,670
I will do my best

482
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,150
to serve you.

483
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,150
I don't want both of you

484
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
to feel restrained

485
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,550
so I will be absent from your banquet tonight.

486
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,719
Lian Zhou.

487
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,791
Remember to

488
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,680
show respect to your jealous elder sister

489
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,471
at the banquet.

490
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Yes.

491
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Lord Jiang.

492
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,391
I'm still drunk.

493
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Don't lean on me.

494
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,079
Don't lean on me.

495
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,230
Madam Tang is really capable.

496
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,670
The workers she recommended work quickly.

497
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,271
She could even haggle and save us a lot of money.

498
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,752
Let's go and take a look.

499
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Sure.

500
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Shopowner.

501
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,239
Greetings, everyone.

502
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,240
I've found these people

503
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,351
according to your orders.

504
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,230
This is the music instrument master, Tao.

505
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Greetings, Shopowner.

506
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,991
Tao can play every musical instrument you can name

507
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,311
including Pipa, Lusheng, and Harp.

508
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,911
This is the embroiderer, Man.

509
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,679
Greetings, Shopowner.

510
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,351
Man is not only good at Straight Stitch and Couching Stitch

511
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,630
but she is also good at Counter Stitch and Blending Stitch.

512
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,831
She can embroider anything you see.

513
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,991
Madam Jin is good at cutting and brewing wine.

514
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
Greetings, Shopowner.

515
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Madam Jin.

516
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,959
You will know

517
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,391
once you test their skills.

518
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,719
Tao, come.

519
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,079
Man.

520
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,679
Da Fu.

521
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:38,519
- I'm asking you to look at the embroidery. - It smells nice.

522
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,039
Madam Jin. The wine.

523
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:11,181
- It's nice. - This wine is called the Hundred Blossom Brew.

524
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,039
It's a good wine.

525
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,710
I might be untalented

526
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,271
but I can see that all three of you have excellent skills.

527
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,510
You can be one of the best in your respective industries.

528
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,040
Why are you willing to humble yourselves and work at Fang Garden?

529
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,991
I'm afraid you are not going to like this

530
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,630
if we tell you.

531
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,230
Shopowner, you know nothing.

532
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:38,848
Madam Jin was sold by her husband.

533
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,400
After going through a few traders, she is now working at a restaurant.

534
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,590
She might have the skills

535
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,150
but her peers are jealous of her.

536
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,479
She was also harassed

537
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,431
by the restaurant's owner because she was a woman.

538
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,800
She can't leave the restaurant

539
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,230
as long as she can't get her indenture.

540
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,559
Tao was an official's daughter.

541
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,952
She is good at all kinds of arts.

542
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,686
However, her family was punished for a crime

543
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,158
so her status was changed.

544
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,190
A musical courtesan might be able to make a living

545
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,150
but she is not willing to work in an environment full of men.

546
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,550
She heard the owner of Fang Garden was a woman

547
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,510
so she wanted to work here.

548
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,190
As for Man,

549
00:39:13,622 --> 00:39:15,213
she might be good at embroidery

550
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,519
but her gambling-addict father

551
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,911
sold her to Pingkang Pleasure House.

552
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,871
Her talents cannot be shown to others.

553
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,160
She has been trying to save up money to redeem herself.

554
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,519
She asked a few embroidery workshops

555
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,230
but they rejected her because of her identity.

556
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,311
She felt dejected at first

557
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,911
until she heard that Fang Garden was recruiting.

558
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
I understand.

559
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,510
As women,

560
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,431
there are many things

561
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,559
that are difficult for us.

562
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,391
However, not everyone

563
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,150
is as brave as all of you.

564
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,550
After hearing all these,

565
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,871
I respect all three of you more.

566
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,550
Does it mean

567
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,271
you are willing to let them stay here?

568
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,431
I will go to your respective masters

569
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,070
to redeem your indentures.

570
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,991
When you work with me in the future,

571
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,791
you won't be looked down upon by others

572
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,431
or bullied by men anymore.

573
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,030
Thank you for your grace, Shopowner.

574
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,519
What are you all doing?

575
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,599
Stand up.

576
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,480
- Stand up. - Please stand up.

577
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
Stand up, all of you.

578
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,351
I'm not looking for servants

579
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,751
but partners who share the same ambition as me.

580
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,630
If you show me all your skills and sincerity

581
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,030
and build Fang Garden with me,

582
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,230
I will reward all of you handsomely in the future.

583
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,911
We are willing to do our best to help you.

584
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,079
Mu Dan is right.

585
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,360
We see each other as siblings

586
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:35,831
instead of masters and servants.

587
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,230
If anyone dares bully you when you are here,

588
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,520
I'll give them a taste of my fist.

589
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,871
Her fist is great.

590
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,710
She will be able to protect you in the future.

591
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,630
Today is such a happy day.

592
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,999
After I fulfill my wish

593
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,431
of buying back Fang Garden,

594
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,670
I was a little confused

595
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,831
but after meeting all of you today,

596
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,230
I suddenly have a new hope.

597
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
In the future,

598
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,710
I will open more shops

599
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,510
so people like us

600
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,271
can have a place to be

601
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,791
and make money

602
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,311
by using our talents.

603
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,190
On the day I was sold,

604
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,670
I told myself that I no longer had any family.

605
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,311
I didn't expect to meet someone like you.

606
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Don't be sad.

607
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,871
Today is a good day to work.

608
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,840
Why don't all of you come to my house

609
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,200
to have a Start-of-work Banquet

610
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,360
at my house?

611
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,630
All right!

612
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,639
We'll have meat and wine.

613
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,471
We'll drink the Hundred Blossom Brew.

614
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,239
- All right! - Hundred Blossom Brew!

615
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,510
Hundred Blossom Brew!
