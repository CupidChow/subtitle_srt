1
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,720
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:38,998
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Mu Dan,

4
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,640
I'm sorry to put you through this.

5
00:01:57,942 --> 00:01:59,840
But if we don't agree to this marriage,

6
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,080
we won't be able to get the Zixi Pill.

7
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:03,655
I...

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,861
I have no other way.

9
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,560
Father, please don't blame yourself.

10
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,200
As long as Mother can recover,

11
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:21,604
I will do anything.

12
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,080
To have

13
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:26,696
a daughter like you,

14
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,760
what more could I ask for?

15
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,800
Such a fine family to marry into,

16
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:13,920
a family of scholars and officials.

17
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:16,896
How could Mu Dan be so stubborn?

18
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:20,560
Please reassure our in-laws.

19
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,880
A woman follows her father at home

20
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,264
and her husband after marriage.

21
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,934
Now that she's part of the Liu family,

22
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,720
she belongs to them, in life or in death.

23
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,580
Her talk of divorce

24
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,716
is likely just a moment of anger.

25
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:35,560
She's never mentioned
anything about this to us.

26
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,320
If she really runs back home,

27
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,848
we'll send her straight
back to the Liu family,

28
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:40,840
even if it means we have to tie her up.

29
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,520
Master He,

30
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,821
an incident like this is
a stain on both families.

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Having a marriage
alliance with an official family

32
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:52,181
ensures your son will have connections

33
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,525
for his studies and future exams.

34
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:55,040
I advise you

35
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:56,744
to think carefully

36
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,240
for the sake of your only son.

37
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,640
Yes, we understand.

38
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,740
I just can't believe it.

39
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,280
Mu Dan isn't an ungrateful girl.

40
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:08,576
- Why would she...
- Whether you believe it or not,

41
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:11,076
the whole city knows she's
disrespected her mother-in-law,

42
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,276
ignored her husband,

43
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:14,638
and stirred up a scandal by
demanding a divorce in court.

44
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,136
Do you really want to drag your family

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,760
into another public courtroom spectacle?

46
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:19,600
Master He,

47
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,760
merchants are already looked down upon.

48
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,720
If she goes through with this divorce,

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,422
your family's reputation
will be utterly ruined.

50
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,560
That's not what I meant. I...

51
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:35,920
Oh, Man. Don't cry. It's alright.

52
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:40,480
Marriage is a woman's only proper path.

53
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:43,040
The Liu family is such
a respectable family.

54
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:44,504
I love my daughter,

55
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:45,733
and I know how much

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,760
of an honor it is for Mu Dan
to marry into the Liu family.

57
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:51,380
Of course I want her to be a virtuous wife,

58
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:53,880
to care for her husband
and raise her children well.

59
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,668
For her to run away from home in the night

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,640
not only disgraces herself

61
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:01,103
but is entirely improper.

62
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,016
When I find her,

63
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,817
I will guide her properly.

64
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,000
Please tell our in-laws

65
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:08,480
to overlook this incident

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,093
and treat her kindly in the future.

67
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:14,298
Of course.

68
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,853
The Liu family's concern
for her is genuine.

69
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,440
Now, please lead the way.

70
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:20,742
Let's find her quickly.

71
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:22,680
Alright.

72
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,080
He Wei Fang better not

73
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,822
bring any more trouble back home with her.

74
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Father,

75
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,000
this past year,

76
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:34,472
for my brother's education,

77
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:39,520
you've been forced to give money
to the Liu family time and again.

78
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,821
Your business is no
longer what it used to be.

79
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,280
This money

80
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,248
is all I can leave behind for you.

81
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,640
From this moment on,

82
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:58,760
I can no longer serve
you as a filial daughter.

83
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
Forgive me.

84
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:41,743
But the life you wish for me

85
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:45,360
is not the life I seek.

86
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:49,240
And this place...

87
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,820
It is no longer my home.

88
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,111
I don't believe it.

89
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,320
This is impossible.

90
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:36,783
She wouldn't!

91
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,502
He Wei Fang is such a strong-willed woman.

92
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:41,048
She had already gotten away.

93
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:42,840
Why would she jump off a cliff?

94
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:47,160
You're lying, aren't you?

95
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:49,893
You're lying!

96
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,637
Did you kill her?

97
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:52,925
Did you kill her?

98
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,807
Tell me! Did you?

99
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:57,525
It's the absolute truth.
How could I dare to lie?

100
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,280
We followed the hoofprints

101
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:01,120
all the way to the cliff.

102
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,777
At the edge, there was
nothing left but the horse

103
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,040
and this hairpin.

104
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:06,910
Young Master, she took the
most remote and dangerous paths.

105
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,574
The woods are thick, the fog
was heavy, and it was pitch dark.

106
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:12,274
Falling off the cliff
accidentally is entirely possible.

107
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,621
You ordered it.

108
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,731
Even after she left,

109
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,600
you couldn't leave her alone, could you?

110
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:27,680
Just to get your hands on her dowry,

111
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,169
you fabricated this lie
without a shred of conscience,

112
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,680
didn't you?

113
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,560
- Master! - You've lost your mind!

114
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,501
Slandering your own parents
for an abandoned woman!

115
00:10:37,642 --> 00:10:39,823
Slandering? Which part
of what I said is slander?

116
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,239
Did you not send someone to kill her

117
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:42,884
or did you not kill her for her dowry?

118
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:44,400
Master!

119
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,959
Zi Shu,

120
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,824
we really have nothing to do with
He Wei Fang's fall from the cliff.

121
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,536
While we did send someone after her before,

122
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,959
it was for your own good,

123
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:54,349
to ensure there were no obstacles
to your marriage with Her Highness.

124
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:56,280
Fine. Then let me ask you,

125
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,440
is this marriage really for me,

126
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:02,800
or for your lust for status and glory?

127
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:04,920
Let me tell you now,

128
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,280
I will not agree to this marriage!

129
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:09,460
If you don't mind the embarrassment,

130
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,007
you can tie me up and drag me there!

131
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:14,000
Very well.

132
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,981
You've done everything
to disgrace the family,

133
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:20,637
breaking every rule and shaming our name!

134
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,080
Since I can't make you listen anymore,

135
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:24,583
bring me the rod.

136
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:26,140
At worst, I'll beat you to death

137
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,137
as an apology to King
Ning and the Princess!

138
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,161
Fine! Go ahead and beat me!

139
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:32,949
I'll just consider it
repaying her with my life!

140
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:34,360
Zi Shu!

141
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,841
Master, no.

142
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Go!

143
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes, Master.

144
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,149
Master...

145
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,767
Zi Shu...

146
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,872
Young Master, just yield. She's gone.

147
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,665
Why put yourself through this punishment?

148
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,640
I said, I won't marry Her Highness!

149
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,000
Master...

150
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,000
Give it to me!

151
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,720
You ungrateful son!

152
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:08,918
You really think I won't beat you to death?

153
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,360
Master!

154
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,561
There's nothing improper
between Her Highness and me.

155
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:14,320
I don't love her anymore.

156
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,240
If you force me to marry her,

157
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:17,720
it will only ruin her

158
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,532
and destroy me!

159
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,676
Stop it!

160
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:24,360
Zi Shu,

161
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,280
my son...

162
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,328
Whether or not there's truth to the rumors,

163
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:30,560
the gossip has already spread.

164
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:33,593
How will we explain to the
people if you don't marry her?

165
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,096
Even if you don't care about
Her Highness's love or reputation,

166
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,880
what about yourself?

167
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,377
Carrying such disgrace on your shoulders

168
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:44,360
will render all your years
of hard study meaningless.

169
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,440
Your career, your future, your ambitions,

170
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:48,303
they'll all be destroyed.

171
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:51,120
That's what will really ruin you!

172
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,240
What about my feelings?

173
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,600
In all these years,

174
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,800
have I ever been allowed to live as I wish?

175
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,061
From simple decisions
like what I eat, wear,

176
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,640
or who I associate with,

177
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:06,591
to the important decisions,

178
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,120
my education,

179
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:10,640
my ambitions,

180
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:12,024
even the official I should be,

181
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,548
all of it has been dictated by you.

182
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,120
I was forced

183
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:18,640
to marry once,

184
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,814
and now you want to force me again.

185
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,400
Why?

186
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,080
Why should I yield again?

187
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,680
Everything we've done
has been for your own good!

188
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,880
Our family has spared no effort,

189
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,511
all to ensure that one day
you can rise to the highest rank,

190
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,280
to achieve greatness.

191
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,520
And how do you repay us?

192
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,200
Master! Master...

193
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:50,840
Will a good marriage kill you?

194
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,720
If King Ning wants to
get even for his daughter

195
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,320
and accuses you of seduction,

196
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:58,005
our entire family will be implicated!

197
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:02,284
Your recklessness years ago

198
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,607
already caused our family
to be exiled from Chang'an.

199
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,400
If I don't make this decision for you now,

200
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:09,160
our entire lineage

201
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:13,143
will face utter ruin!

202
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,240
Zi Shu is stubborn, but
deep down he's soft-hearted

203
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:20,880
and filial.

204
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,960
This means he has agreed.

205
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:24,664
He has agreed.

206
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:29,440
Notify the magistrate immediately,

207
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:32,337
He Wei Fang fell to her death
from the cliff out of despair,

208
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:33,840
and her body could not be recovered.

209
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:37,333
Send a letter to inform
Her Highness as well.

210
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,320
Quickly summon the official matchmaker

211
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,400
and prepare the betrothal gifts.

212
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:46,360
Leave for Chang'an without delay.

213
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:48,655
Yes, Master.

214
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:14,780
Excuse me.

215
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:16,520
I'm just passing by.

216
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,920
Goodbye.

217
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,480
A pot of wine, please!

218
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:46,800
Please accept these.

219
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,760
Thank you.

220
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,360
Yu Lu,

221
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,840
we're reaching Fang Garden soon.

222
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:55,120
Fang Garden

223
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,520
was passed down from my
grandmother to my mother,

224
00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:59,576
and from my mother to me.

225
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:02,240
Mu Dan, this garden

226
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:04,788
will one day be yours.

227
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,720
The roots of this flower
are delicate and weak,

228
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:10,720
with limited nutrients to draw on.

229
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:14,280
These side buds only drain its strength.

230
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:15,760
They won't bloom

231
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:18,560
and will even weaken the
main blossoms on the stem.

232
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,720
When you're older,

233
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,480
you'll understand that sometimes,

234
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:26,360
after enduring hardship

235
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:27,960
and learning to make choices,

236
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,760
the flowers will bloom
even more beautifully.

237
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,560
The same goes for life.

238
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:36,638
I'm not afraid of hardship or struggle.

239
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:40,280
When I grow up, I'll grow even
more beautiful flowers for you.

240
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:43,000
You're a good girl, Mu Dan.

241
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:14,876
Bravo! Yes!

242
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:17,800
Yes!

243
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,280
(Mother, )

244
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:25,720
(though I can no longer fulfill
the promise I made to you, )

245
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,480
(I will carry on your legacy.)

246
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:30,880
(I will ensure that Fang
Garden blooms endlessly, )

247
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:32,742
(its beauty renowned far and wide.)

248
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:35,440
(I will live as you hoped, )

249
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,120
(unafraid of hardship and sacrifice, )

250
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:42,360
(and as a free-spirited,
joyful He Wei Fang.)

251
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:12,038
Coming!

252
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,603
(Fang Garden)

253
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:17,600
How can I help you?

254
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:19,720
You must be new here.

255
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:23,960
I'm the owner of this place.

256
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,240
You've got the wrong door.

257
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:28,863
I haven't been here in a long time.

258
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:30,460
It's no surprise you don't recognize me.

259
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:31,541
Where is the steward Mr. Gao?

260
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:34,124
- Call him here.
- There isn't any Mr. Gao here.

261
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:36,507
If you keep blocking the
door, I'll call the authorities!

262
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:49,090
(Fang Garden)

263
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,520
May the Buddha bless

264
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:15,400
my beloved daughter, Mu Dan,

265
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:17,320
with safety, health,

266
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:19,560
and a bright future ahead.

267
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:51,160
Mother,

268
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:56,225
the guiding light you lit for me
has always shone in my heart.

269
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:01,280
I will establish myself in Chang'an.

270
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,200
I will reclaim Fang Garden

271
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,280
with my own hands.

272
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,760
(Open)

273
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,480
Soy milk!

274
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:26,484
Steamed flatbreads!

275
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:28,365
Steamed sesame flatbreads!

276
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:30,125
Top quality sesame!

277
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:33,346
Buy two free one for twisted donuts!

278
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:20,800
I'm telling you, it's
absolutely not possible.

279
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:22,600
Sir, listen,

280
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:24,503
I can do the work of two people.

281
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,125
- I'm fine with less pay. - Just go.

282
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:27,900
I... I can do anything, really.

283
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:29,932
You don't have household
registration. Get out of here!

284
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:30,996
I can do anything.

285
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,440
Please reconsider.

286
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:35,000
Miss, we aren't hiring.

287
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,285
You should try elsewhere.

288
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:37,565
If the Flower Guild finds out

289
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:39,421
we hired someone without
household registration,

290
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:40,484
we'll be heavily fined.

291
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,204
Just go! Get out of here!

292
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Sir,

293
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:46,228
I'll figure out a way to
get my registration sorted.

294
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:48,272
- Please just hire me for a few days.
- No way.

295
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,845
Come back when you have your
registration, alright? Now leave.

296
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,760
If you ever need someone,
please let me know.

297
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:01,664
Goodbye.

298
00:24:01,826 --> 00:24:03,040
Don't come back.

299
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:05,772
You've come, miss.

300
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:07,440
Please come inside.

301
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:12,463
Miss, we can't hire someone
without household registration.

302
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,535
You should try somewhere else.

303
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,440
Come and take a look!

304
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:18,240
Thank you for your time.

305
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:21,600
Exquisitely crafted masks!

306
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:24,240
Ladies, take a look at these masks!

307
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,920
Just look at the quality,
absolutely exquisite!

308
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:30,680
Exquisitely crafted masks!

309
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:31,924
Wards off evil, brings blessings!

310
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,203
Perfect for rituals and prayers!

311
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:34,640
Ensures health and protection!

312
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,080
Come, take a look!

313
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:57,441
Hurry it up!

314
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:58,885
Boatman, over here.

315
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,326
Be careful, everyone, don't
bump into anything. Make way!

316
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:02,748
Boss, fetch some water.

317
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:04,120
Coming!

318
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:21,106
Why is it that men can
do this, but I cannot?

319
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,125
Thank you.

320
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,324
Miss, what would you like to drink?

321
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:37,600
Please have a seat.

322
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:39,867
I'm not here for a drink.

323
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:42,588
I was just standing outside. I saw
that you've been running around

324
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:44,866
managing everything in such a large tavern,

325
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,400
it must be exhausting.

326
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,500
Would you consider

327
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:51,240
hiring a helper like me?

328
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:53,760
This is a small family business.

329
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:56,045
We don't need to hire
outsiders. Please leave.

330
00:25:56,333 --> 00:26:00,273
- I'm fine with less pay.
- Save your breath.

331
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:01,640
Just leave.

332
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:06,747
Miss, please wait.

333
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,280
The shop is usually
managed by Wu Niang alone.

334
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:15,680
It's been exhausting for her.

335
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:19,458
This young lady has no family
or connections here in Chang'an,

336
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:21,456
and without household registration,

337
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:23,021
it's incredibly difficult for her.

338
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,626
We should help her.

339
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:28,893
Don't worry, I can handle
any dirty or tiring work.

340
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:32,120
Our tavern's business is modest.

341
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:35,705
- I'm afraid we can't afford...
- With a new face,

342
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:38,760
business might even pick up.

343
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:41,035
Let's hire her for a month as a trial.

344
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:43,720
- Yes, that'll be great. - My dear...

345
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,025
It's settled.

346
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,004
Now, get back to work.

347
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:54,680
My wife is a little aloof.

348
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,080
- Please don't take offence. - I won't.

349
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:00,360
What Wu Niang said earlier wasn't wrong.

350
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:03,200
Our small business is already
running on a tight budget.

351
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,560
Plus, hiring you is a risk.

352
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,320
So, for the wages,

353
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:09,465
I can only offer 30% of what others pay.

354
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:11,825
30%?

355
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:15,226
That's too little.

356
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:17,785
I've got an empty room in the shop,

357
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:18,945
and I'll cover your meals.

358
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:20,507
No other shopkeeper

359
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:22,427
would risk hiring someone

360
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:24,185
without household registration.

361
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:31,776
A bushel of rice costs twenty coins.

362
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,840
I only eat two flatbreads

363
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:35,320
and a bowl of porridge daily,

364
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:37,440
plus one set of spare clothes for washing.

365
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:40,556
I can arrange my own lodging.

366
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:45,005
Could you convert the food and
lodging into cash for me instead?

367
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:46,760
You can pay me

368
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:49,320
an extra 150 coins per month,

369
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:50,720
how about that?

370
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,740
You know how to do calculations?

371
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:54,840
I have some basic literacy.

372
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,153
You can entrust me with all
bookkeeping and accounts.

373
00:27:58,305 --> 00:27:59,905
I guarantee there won't be any mistakes.

374
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,920
If you sell me this jade abacus,

375
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,819
I will pay you 500 coins a month.

376
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,878
This is not for sale.

377
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:11,970
450 coins a month,

378
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:13,738
if you agree, I'll stay.

379
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:15,120
If not,

380
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:16,480
never mind then.

381
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:19,720
What if I said

382
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:21,872
I could obtain household
registration for you?

383
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,760
We're strangers who just met.

384
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:29,798
Other shopkeepers didn't dare hire me

385
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,280
after hearing my situation.

386
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:33,000
So, Mr. Wang,

387
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:34,760
why do you insist on helping me?

388
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,480
I love jade.

389
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,520
Your abacus may not be especially valuable,

390
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:41,543
but its smooth finish and
exquisite craftsmanship

391
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:42,960
have won me over.

392
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,880
I happen to have
connections at the local office.

393
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:47,878
If you let me take the
abacus as collateral,

394
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll help smooth things
over with the officials.

395
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:51,692
Within a month,

396
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:54,074
I can have your household
registration sorted.

397
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:57,640
Once you have that,

398
00:28:58,034 --> 00:28:59,553
finding work anywhere

399
00:28:59,658 --> 00:29:01,040
won't be a problem.

400
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:02,880
You're smart,

401
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:05,306
why be so attached to an inanimate object?

402
00:29:08,285 --> 00:29:10,240
I will use this as collateral.

403
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,560
But please draft a written agreement.

404
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:16,761
Also, could my wages be settled daily?

405
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:18,371
No problem.

406
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,042
I'll fetch paper and ink right away.

407
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:24,685
- Please wait a moment.
- Thank you, Mr. Wang.

408
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:32,400
Goodbye.

409
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:36,480
And that table.

410
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:37,960
Alright.

411
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,960
Wu Niang, there's something on your...

412
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:04,120
You've got ash in your hair.

413
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,280
We finally made some profits,

414
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:37,000
and you've smashed it all away.

415
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:38,880
You're obviously not cut out for this work.

416
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,480
Hard labor isn't for you,

417
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:43,520
just go back to wherever you came from.

418
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:45,000
Stop being an eyesore here.

419
00:30:46,257 --> 00:30:48,445
You can deduct the cost of
the plates from my wages.

420
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,000
Wu Niang,

421
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:58,000
I don't understand why you
harbor such hostility toward me.

422
00:30:58,485 --> 00:30:59,485
I came here

423
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:02,219
only to earn some money to support myself.

424
00:31:02,772 --> 00:31:04,452
I'll work even harder to prove myself and,

425
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,700
hopefully, change your opinion of me.

426
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,360
What's going on?

427
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:16,645
Mu Dan was being clumsy

428
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,600
and broke all the plates.

429
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:22,040
Replacing them will be a hefty expense.

430
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:24,000
She's nothing but a burden.

431
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:26,360
My dear, just send her away.

432
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:28,080
I told you,

433
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:31,000
you can deduct the cost of
the plates from my wages.

434
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,400
Since Mu Dan is willing to compensate,

435
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:36,240
let's leave it at that.

436
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,160
She also has sticky fingers.

437
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,240
I found this on her.

438
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:43,456
She must've stolen it from me

439
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,000
during the busy hours earlier.

440
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:47,320
How can you make baseless accusations?

441
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:49,280
Why are you picking on me?

442
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,040
My dear,

443
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:53,604
this woman is greedy
and now resorts to stealing.

444
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:55,787
Sooner or later, she'll squander all
the savings we've worked hard for.

445
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,360
We absolutely cannot keep her here.

446
00:31:57,758 --> 00:31:59,000
Is this true?

447
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:01,320
- It's not.
- I took you in out of kindness,

448
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:03,200
and this is how you repay me?

449
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,240
She bumped into me on purpose just now.

450
00:32:05,365 --> 00:32:07,480
That's how I dropped all the plates.

451
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:08,994
I chose to stay silent,

452
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:11,440
but now she's falsely accusing me of theft.

453
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:13,520
I know you might not believe me,

454
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:15,840
but I swear every word I've said is true.

455
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:24,681
I believe you.

456
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:30,720
Wu Niang,

457
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:32,840
you're trying to drive Mu Dan away,

458
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:34,312
aren't you?

459
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:36,657
I...

460
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:39,765
Since we hired Mu Dan,
business has improved significantly.

461
00:32:40,578 --> 00:32:42,600
If you keep sabotaging her,

462
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:45,360
it's our own business that will suffer.

463
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:48,787
Don't be so willful again.

464
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,450
Mu Dan,

465
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,040
I'm sorry you've been wronged.

466
00:32:58,637 --> 00:32:59,637
You're fair-minded.

467
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,758
I'm glad this is cleared up.

468
00:33:07,045 --> 00:33:08,320
Get back to work.

469
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:29,440
What exactly are Wang
Qing and his wife scheming?

470
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,120
No matter.

471
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,560
I'll just stay cautious.

472
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:38,480
When I have my household
registration, things will get better.

473
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:23,040
Have it all!

474
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:27,000
Beautiful!

475
00:34:29,404 --> 00:34:32,040
Beautiful!

476
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:34,120
These flowers aren't worth much.

477
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:36,000
Sir, if you really are impressed,

478
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,541
why don't you toss some money instead?

479
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:39,160
What bold words!

480
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,076
We're just worried that if we
threw gold nuggets up there,

481
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,180
they might break your head.

482
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:44,323
- Isn't that right, guys? - Yes!

483
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:46,052
Oh, my waist is quite flexible.

484
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:48,200
Why don't you toss
one and see for yourself?

485
00:34:48,372 --> 00:34:49,720
Try it!

486
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:51,400
Yes!

487
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:04,760
- Beautiful! - Yes!

488
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:09,746
Yes! Beautiful!

489
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:15,480
Come.

490
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:23,360
My master wishes to enjoy
the Huxuan dance in private.

491
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,480
Please come back another day, gentlemen.

492
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,680
What nerve!

493
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,480
Do you own this place?

494
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:33,160
Who are you to order us out?

495
00:35:33,274 --> 00:35:35,520
I'd like to see who your master is.

496
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:36,960
How dare he told me to leave!

497
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,964
Forgive me, Flower Bird Envoy.

498
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:45,844
I'll leave immediately.

499
00:35:45,925 --> 00:35:47,240
Forgive me.

500
00:35:56,965 --> 00:35:58,480
Let the music play.

501
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,640
Keep dancing.

502
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:18,520
Flower Bird Envoy, it
is an honor to have you

503
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:20,400
visit my humble tavern.

504
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:22,385
We do have private rooms available.

505
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:24,898
Perhaps you'd prefer one?

506
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:26,640
What you are doing now

507
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:28,600
is harming my business.

508
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:30,304
Private rooms are cramped and stifling.

509
00:36:30,328 --> 00:36:32,048
They're nothing compared to the space here.

510
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,840
My master wants all the
dancers to perform for him tonight.

511
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:36,480
No interruptions.

512
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:40,663
You're staying silent.

513
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,360
Are you calculating

514
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:44,440
how much you can earn from me,

515
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:46,880
or are you plotting

516
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:49,881
how you can kill me,

517
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:52,080
Chu Da Lang?

518
00:37:01,957 --> 00:37:05,280
I have important matters to
discuss with the Flower Bird Envoy.

519
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,920
Leave us the room.

520
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:24,680
Lackey Jiang!

521
00:37:24,858 --> 00:37:26,038
So, you found me today.

522
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:27,360
Fine, I'll admit my failure.

523
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:29,920
Kill me, torture me, do whatever you want.

524
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:33,160
Why is it that everyone from
Qingzheng Society says the same thing?

525
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:35,040
Even your leader isn't any different.

526
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:36,600
It's so dull.

527
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,760
Da Bei and other men haven't returned.

528
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:40,560
You captured them, didn't you?

529
00:37:40,918 --> 00:37:42,360
What did you do to them?

530
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:44,720
I'm the one who sent them to kill you.

531
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,320
If you want to vent your
anger, kill me, but let them go!

532
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,717
If I were here to capture outlaws

533
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:50,421
who dared to assassinate a court official,

534
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:52,640
I would've brought soldiers with me today.

535
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,336
What do you really want?

536
00:38:05,098 --> 00:38:06,720
In just a few short years,

537
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:09,400
Qingzheng Society has grown strong.

538
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,360
As its leader, you've got some skills.

539
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,748
You're loyal,

540
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:15,120
fearless,

541
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,720
and able to win people over.

542
00:38:17,638 --> 00:38:19,200
How about you bring your men

543
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:20,640
and assets

544
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:22,206
under my command?

545
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:23,440
Pah!

546
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:26,080
Dream on!

547
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,679
I'll never become a lackey
for a corrupt official like you.

548
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:33,587
Your fiery temper is really a family trait.

549
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:37,160
Whether you agree or not,

550
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:39,760
read this letter first

551
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,280
and decide afterward.

552
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:55,640
How is this possible?

553
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,500
Who could possibly forge Da
Bei's chicken-scratch handwriting?

554
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,240
If you still don't believe me,

555
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:02,999
go to Kaiyuan Temple tomorrow.

556
00:39:03,437 --> 00:39:05,045
Da Bei will be waiting for you there.

557
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:14,720
Young Master.

558
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,250
Chu Da Lang has talked to Da Bei.

559
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,720
They've agreed to join us.

560
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,840
With these aspired folks on our side,

561
00:39:26,043 --> 00:39:27,963
we now have eyes and
ears in the Western Market.

562
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:29,560
It'll make handling things much

563
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:31,000
easier in the future.

564
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:34,885
Thank you, Young Master.

565
00:39:36,848 --> 00:39:38,084
The day is still young.

566
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:40,221
Are you going to Huanyun
Pavilion in the Eastern Market

567
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,805
or the Hu Tavern in the Western Market?

568
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:46,720
If you visit the same
place two days in a row,

569
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:50,680
people will think you're captivated
by that fiery Huxuan dancer.

570
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:52,720
She's just spinning around in circles.

571
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:54,025
Nothing special about that,

572
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:55,400
and loud to boot.

573
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:58,040
Let's go to Huanyun Pavilion.

574
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:03,452
Ever since you got back from Luoyang,

575
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:05,576
all I've heard is how boring everything is.

576
00:40:05,756 --> 00:40:07,897
So, is it Chang'an itself
that you find boring,

577
00:40:08,012 --> 00:40:09,851
or the beauties in Chang'an?

578
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:13,040
Just go get the carriage ready.

579
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:26,125
Mr. Wang.

580
00:40:27,765 --> 00:40:30,131
Next time there's heavy
work like this, just call me.

581
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:32,732
It's fine. I can manage myself.
There's no need to trouble you.

582
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,032
You've been here for two weeks now.

583
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,656
Why are you still keeping your distance?

584
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:37,844
Yes.

585
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:39,560
It's been two weeks.

586
00:40:39,925 --> 00:40:42,000
About the household
registration you promised me,

587
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:43,840
have you obtained it?

588
00:40:46,325 --> 00:40:47,807
There's been an influx of refugees lately.

589
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:49,360
The authorities have been overwhelmed.

590
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:51,040
It'll take a few more days.

591
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:55,753
It's not easy for a young lady like
you to make a living in Chang'an.

592
00:40:56,443 --> 00:40:59,464
Have you ever thought
about finding an easier path?

593
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:03,187
Don't call me Mr. Wang from now on.

594
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:06,160
Call me Qing instead, alright?

595
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:07,459
I'll take good care of you.

596
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,280
Mr. Wang, you're drunk.

597
00:41:09,732 --> 00:41:10,960
What you said today,

598
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:12,480
I'll pretend I never heard them.

599
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:14,804
If you don't want to be a concubine,

600
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:16,044
I can sell off Wu Niang

601
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:17,160
and marry you as my wife.

602
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:19,125
This entire business will be ours.

603
00:41:19,206 --> 00:41:20,206
Absolutely not!

604
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,686
- Let go of me!
- You don't even have a household registration.

605
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:26,680
Why are you acting all high and mighty?

606
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:35,175
Let's see if your stubbornness

607
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:37,151
is stronger than my fists!

608
00:41:42,956 --> 00:41:44,400
Stop!

609
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:46,360
I agree!

610
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:47,960
Please stop hitting me!
