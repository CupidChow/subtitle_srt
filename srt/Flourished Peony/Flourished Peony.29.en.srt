1
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:36,184
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,011
(Episode 29)

3
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,698
You can't move on from her,

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,340
but look at yourself now,

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,541
how do you compare to Jiang Chang Yang in any way?

6
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,780
Survival comes first.

7
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,119
Being a concubine or a matrilocal son-in-law,

8
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,061
what do those labels even matter?

9
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,630
In this world,

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,341
the real win is having the ability to stay alive.

11
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,140
The crutch His Highness has prepared for me,

12
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,341
is it ready?

13
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,577
Can this medicine

14
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,101
get rid of my infertility?

15
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,381
Can you get rid of all those mocking voices around me?

16
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,501
Or can it make my relationship with Zi Shu

17
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,781
as affectionate as before?

18
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,860
Instead of coaxing me to take medicine,

19
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,599
it's better if you go and get rid of He Wei Fang.

20
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:47,715
You Zhen.

21
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,199
- You Zhen? - Zi Shu.

22
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,169
- Hurry and help me up. - Your Highness.

23
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,256
Be careful.

24
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,671
You Zhen.

25
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,159
Zi Shu, what's wrong with your leg?

26
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,420
I heard that you were injured.

27
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,020
I was anxious.

28
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
I fell from somewhere high due to my carelessness.

29
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,400
I regained my ability to walk today.

30
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,039
And, I thought of rushing here to see you immediately.

31
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,060
I see.

32
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,981
I thought you already abandoned me.

33
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,101
I thought you were tired of me.

34
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,260
I've already made up my mind.

35
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,500
If I'm unable to bear your child,

36
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,599
if you wish to cancel the marriage,

37
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,060
I have no choice but to take my own life.

38
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
How could you think of something like that?

39
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:58,555
You Zhen.

40
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,300
I have to depend on you

41
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,060
for the rest of my life, you know?

42
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,759
No matter if it's our future children

43
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:09,189
or the rumors,

44
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,079
none of them is important as you.

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,901
You Zhen, if you don't mind my disability,

46
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,232
I'm willing to marry into your family.

47
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,701
In the days to come,

48
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,959
there will only be the two of us.

49
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,016
What do you think?

50
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:51,382
Of course I won't mind.

51
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,513
No matter what you become,

52
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,240
you'll always be the Zi Shu I know.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've already told His Highness about my intention.

54
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,141
We shall get married in ten days.

55
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:23,909
Ten days?

56
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,380
Isn't it a little hasty?

57
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Of course not.

58
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,640
You Zhen, you have no idea.

59
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,180
I've been through so much.

60
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,180
My legs are broken as well.

61
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,581
I've already seen the errors of my ways. I seek a fresh start.

62
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,178
I can't wait to marry you.

63
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,180
I feel the same.

64
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,380
These are the most precious flowers in the flower market.

65
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,860
Did Her Highness not take a liking to any of them?

66
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,380
Although they're precious, they aren't rare.

67
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,860
All noble families use the same flowers for their decorations.

68
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,246
According to Her Highness,

69
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,221
she desires something unparalleled for the wedding banquet flowers.

70
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,480
The wedding banquet is going to be held hastily.

71
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,701
I'm sure we could invent

72
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,661
a unique product if we were notified a few months earlier.

73
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,300
But now, we only have three days until the wedding.

74
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,840
Why did you think the Lv family was the leader of the flower association?

75
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,198
It's all because you supplied flowers to our residence for 10 years.

76
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,021
If you can't satisfy Her Highness's demand,

77
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,879
forget about the fact that you will cease to be the leader.

78
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,559
I'm afraid Her Highness will think that the flower association is useless

79
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,781
and that it's pointless for it to exist.

80
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,781
Something unparalleled?

81
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,260
The Red Jade Orchid of Danzhou is considered rare.

82
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,821
But we have less than three days. We won't be able to get them in time.

83
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,778
Master, I don't know if I should say this...

84
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,360
Do you know the situation we're in? Out with it.

85
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,302
Although Her Highness has forbade noble ladies

86
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:46,056
from purchasing flowers from Blooming Abode,

87
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,320
Ms. He never gave up on inventing new varieties.

88
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,380
I heard that she rented a pond.

89
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,380
And, she managed to cultivate a rare variety of lotus.

90
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,181
She intends to win the noble ladies' hearts with this variety.

91
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,480
I've already given them a name. I call them Gold Lace.

92
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,140
Gold Lace?

93
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,341
Isn't that the herbaceous peony recorded in ancient texts?

94
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:17,070
Indeed.

95
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,479
According to the legend, the Gold Lace herbaceous peony

96
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,480
has two layers of yellow stamens in the petals.

97
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,855
It's a shame that we've never seen it for ourselves.

98
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,839
I was thinking that if I could cultivate something similar with the lotus,

99
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,701
we can honor it by borrowing its name for the plant.

100
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,221
The stamens radiate golden yellow towards the petals,

101
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,639
complementing the pink of the lotus petals perfectly.

102
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,301
The flower is full of overlapping petals.

103
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,821
It's as precious as the peony.

104
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,160
And, it's just as beautiful

105
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,723
as a herbaceous peony.

106
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,660
It does live up to its name, Gold Lace.

107
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:48,635
Ms. He.

108
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,083
No, I mean,

109
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,666
Madam,

110
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,140
you're talented indeed.

111
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,199
Leader, you're too courteous.

112
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,239
You may address me as Ms. He like usual.

113
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,633
All right.

114
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,900
Let's speak inside.

115
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,746
All right.

116
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:07,309
I suppose I don't need to tell you

117
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,000
how hard it is to cultivate a new variety.

118
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Naturally, I understand it the best.

119
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,839
Only officials who are fifth rank and above may wear a golden belt.

120
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,900
And, Gold Lace symbolizes good fortune.

121
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,679
The powerful and noble families of Chang'an,

122
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,020
eager for a prosperous career,

123
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,900
will surely flock to it.

124
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,140
This business opportunity is hard to come by.

125
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,260
I suppose you know that.

126
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:38,110
Indeed.

127
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,710
Ms. He,

128
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,301
I know that Gold Lace is precious.

129
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,181
I also know that this is the result of your hard work.

130
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,559
You and I are not acquaintances.

131
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,660
However, without your flower,

132
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,260
not only will the Lv family be bullied,

133
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,821
but the flower association will also be humiliated.

134
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,421
Ms. He, please allow us to take your flowers.

135
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,029
Please get up.

136
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,301
I offended you outside Fang Garden that day.

137
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,204
I hope you can forgive me.

138
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,540
I'm willing to do anything as long as you're willing to give us Gold Lace.

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,020
Leader, please get up.

140
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,160
We can talk once you're up.

141
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,854
Leader,

142
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,960
I said that Gold Lace was rare and precious

143
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,311
not because I was trying to extort you when you're in trouble.

144
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,260
Leader, if you're willing to sell Fang Garden to me,

145
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:44,096
I'm willing to offer you the business opportunity.

146
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,000
Ms. He, you're truly benevolent.

147
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,581
I'm ashamed of myself.

148
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,280
I'll tell my men to bring the title deed here immediately.

149
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,701
I know that my family is wealthy.

150
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,840
But I didn't know that we were this wealthy.

151
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,758
I never knew that Father owned such a huge piece of estate.

152
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,500
You wear plain clothing usually.

153
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,424
I thought you did it on purpose to conceal your wealth.

154
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,301
I never expected you to have no idea about how wealthy your family was.

155
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,375
The shops of the flower association spread across the nine provinces.

156
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,616
The noble and the wealthy will purchase flowers from the flower association

157
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,540
whenever they hold an event.

158
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,880
80% of all florists depend on the flower association to make a living.

159
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,072
Xiao Chun,

160
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,779
when it comes to family assets,

161
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,740
Mu Dan and I are no match for your family.

162
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,701
Mu Dan, the Lv family was able to avert the crisis all thanks to you.

163
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,941
Did Father sell you Fang Garden for a cheaper price?

164
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:56,448
He did.

165
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Her Highness requested unparalleled flowers for her wedding banquet.

166
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,140
Therefore, Leader bought out Gold Lace at five times the price.

167
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,880
That amounts to 50% of the total price.

168
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,581
I used the loan I took out from the treasury

169
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,260
to open our new shop.

170
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,199
Now, I don't have much cash with me.

171
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,981
Luckily, Leader was magnanimous.

172
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,240
He allowed me to pay half of it for the time being.

173
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,640
He allowed me to pay off the remaining payments gradually.

174
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
What's wrong?

175
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,316
Mu Dan,

176
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,941
you spent so much effort to purchase your mother's garden.

177
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,240
But since I was born into a wealthy family, I don't need to do anything.

178
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,740
I can lead a luxurious life without putting in any effort.

179
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,540
I just feel that life is unfair.

180
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,280
Although Mu Dan has made much more money compared to usual merchants,

181
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,000
to the noble and powerful, this sum is insignificant.

182
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,040
It's not even worth as much as them receiving a gift or hosting a banquet.

183
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:52,814
I wonder

184
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,701
why we're pouring our heart and soul

185
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,701
into our career.

186
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,221
What's wrong with you two today?

187
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,020
Although we're minor figures in the vast Chang'an,

188
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,701
we have the things we wish to achieve as well.

189
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,421
Our joy and sorrow shouldn't be determined by how others are doing.

190
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,260
We work hard in order to provide ourselves with better lives.

191
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,999
Now, I've taken back Fang Garden with my own effort.

192
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,461
Xiao Chun, your Qingshu Pavilion will open soon as well.

193
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,740
Our days are getting better and better. Aren't we supposed to be happy?

194
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,581
Enough. Stop frowning.

195
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,780
I'll buy you guys a meal today.

196
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,760
What about a meal at Fugui Restaurant?

197
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,341
- Sure. - Be happy.

198
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,564
If you keep drinking,

199
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:58,216
you might be too drunk to enter the wedding carriage tomorrow.

200
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,840
This is my first time getting married.

201
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,341
I'm inexperienced.

202
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,740
I feel restless.

203
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:15,948
What about you?

204
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,260
I feel elated.

205
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,301
I've finally taken back my mother's favorite Fang Garden.

206
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,780
I would've rushed there if it weren't for tomorrow's wedding.

207
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,020
I achieved my dreams.

208
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,301
We should drink until we drop.

209
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,581
Before this, I told you that I had a dream when I came to Chang'an.

210
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,572
This was my dream.

211
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,140
My mother first taught me how to cultivate peonies

212
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,581
in Fang Garden.

213
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
She said Fang Garden was the dowry left behind for her by Grandmother.

214
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,159
She said she would pass it down to me.

215
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,061
It's a shame that she couldn't witness

216
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,500
both of my weddings.

217
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,221
You were first married to a prideful coward like Liu Chang.

218
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,416
It's better if she doesn't attend the wedding.

219
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,600
She'll definitely be worried.

220
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,411
As for your second wedding,

221
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,680
you're getting married to a flamboyant and corrupt official like me.

222
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:20,991
If she sees this,

223
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,701
I'm sure she'll lose her temper.

224
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,461
Mother is very observant.

225
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,159
I'm sure she can tell that you're just pretending.

226
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,061
She'll know that you're a good man.

227
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,050
I told you before.

228
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,660
When the time comes, I'll set you free.

229
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,981
With this, it's easier for you

230
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:56,159
to conduct business in the future.

231
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,941
You've spent a lot of effort

232
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
in order to save me.

233
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:04,898
Thank you.

234
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,247
You may deliver the payment for the indenture to my residence.

235
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,279
Of course. Don't worry.

236
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,340
In the future, I'll devote myself to Blooming Abode.

237
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,580
Lord Jiang, just wait for your windfall.

238
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,346
Understood.

239
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,238
Be honest with me.

240
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,839
How do you feel

241
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,260
at this moment?

242
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,500
To be honest,

243
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,740
at this moment,

244
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:52,326
I feel safe.

245
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,117
Safe?

246
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,580
The night before my first wedding,

247
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,500
I was anxious and restless.

248
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:10,240
So, even a bold girl like you was afraid, huh?

249
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,141
Of course.

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,040
I was going to move into a place full of strangers.

251
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,941
I was going to live together with strangers.

252
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,661
Naturally, I was afraid.

253
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,661
However, I did so for my mother's sake.

254
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,901
I had no choice but to do so.

255
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,381
But this time,

256
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,421
I'm getting married to you.

257
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,025
Jiang Chang Yang,

258
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,421
you make me feel safe.

259
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,381
Although I know this is a fake wedding,

260
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,800
and that you decorated the residence to throw King Ning off,

261
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,621
all those lanterns imprinted with my name

262
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,020
and the peony decorations,

263
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,031
I saw them.

264
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,351
I know.

265
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,640
You've spent a lot of effort on it.

266
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
So, you saw them, huh?

267
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,136
I thought you were too busy making money to purchase Fang Garden

268
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,500
that you totally forgot about the wedding banquet.

269
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,260
If it weren't to save me,

270
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,199
with your character, I'm sure you would never have considered marriage.

271
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,500
Since it's just an act,

272
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,959
why did you pay so much attention to it?

273
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,600
How can I collect the wedding gifts

274
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,479
if the arrangements are not made properly?

275
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,740
You do have a point.

276
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,999
This is a great excuse to receive wedding gifts.

277
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,880
The greediest official in the world can't afford to miss out on it.

278
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,661
You can have all of it, then.

279
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,079
This way, I won't need to feel as apologetic to you.

280
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,680
Jiang Chang Yang, it must've been tough.

281
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,780
Not at all.

282
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,820
Anyway, from now on, we'll suffer together.

283
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:22,918
Once you're done,

284
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,421
you should head back and sleep.

285
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,260
Doll yourself up tomorrow.

286
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,260
Wait for me to pick you up.

287
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,143
(Jiang Residence)

288
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,907
Are you sleepy?

289
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,976
We still have to wait for some time.

290
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,701
Why don't you go and take a nap?

291
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,823
What are you saying?

292
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,381
I'm just moved to tears.

293
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,901
I'm happy for you.

294
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:14,652
According to tradition,

295
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:17,362
the husband should prepare the headpiece for his spouse.

296
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,421
Xiao Chun and I are considered your family.

297
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,840
Naturally, we have to prepare something for you.

298
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,941
We both chipped in and ordered a set for you.

299
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,239
Although it's not expensive by any means,

300
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,340
it contains all your favorite designs.

301
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,260
The Weaving and Dyeing Bureau made these overnight.

302
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,861
They're called the Golden Phoenix Crown

303
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,300
and the Golden Phoenix Bead.

304
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
Your entire piece of headpiece

305
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,340
is not even worth as much as a piece of turquoise on it.

306
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,560
The kind intentions of my family members

307
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,880
are much more precious than valuable accessories.

308
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,421
Of course I'll put it on.

309
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,679
What about this crown, then?

310
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,221
I'll put it on as well.

311
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,580
My neck is strong enough.

312
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,440
Da Fu, take a look.

313
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,679
Should I put it on like this? Does it look nice on me?

314
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,901
You mustn't cry today.

315
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,521
Otherwise, it would tarnish your reputation as a heroine.

316
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:41,422
Where's Xiao Chun?

317
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,500
I don't know. I told Xiao Chun about the time.

318
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,461
I don't know why she isn't here yet.

319
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,901
What's wrong, Xiao Chun?

320
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,853
Mu Dan,

321
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,100
I know that today's your wedding day

322
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,720
and that I shouldn't bother you.

323
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,580
But if I don't tell you about my woes,

324
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,901
I shall cease to exist in the world.

325
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,360
The Lv family will cease to exist as well.

326
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,320
With the sheng and xiao, the tune of the phoenix is played.

327
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,500
The drums welcome the honored guests.

328
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,060
He Wei Fang

329
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,861
is gentle, prudent, diligent, and virtuous.

330
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,981
Jiang Chang Yang

331
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,701
is noble and dedicated.

332
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,621
They're a match made in heaven.

333
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,461
Today, they form an everlasting bond.

334
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,381
Please welcome the bride!

335
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,535
I'm not an expert in reciting poems or obeying customs.

336
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,319
But I'll make sure all of you will get paid.

337
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,740
Everyone is looking at us.

338
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,820
We shouldn't delay it.

339
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,621
If anyone can open the door,

340
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,920
I'll pay them however much they like.

341
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,861
Da Fu is reliable indeed.

342
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,535
Madam, please practice wise judgment.

343
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,479
I checked every petal and leaf of the Gold Laces

344
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,701
before delivering them here yesterday.

345
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,160
They were in perfect condition.

346
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,221
But now, they're wilting.

347
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,780
This is a bad omen.

348
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,495
If you guys dare to neglect the imperial family,

349
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,239
even the execution of the entire flower association won't be enough.

350
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,439
Father, I've brought the florist who cultivated these flowers.

351
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:19,500
She can tell the issue at first glance.

352
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,040
Miss, thank you for your aid.

353
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,640
I shall never forget your kindness.

354
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,621
Why is she covering her face when she's a member of the association?

355
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,780
Her face is covered with pimples. That's why she's covering it.

356
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,740
May I request the cook

357
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,221
to prepare ten bowls of peach and plum juice?

358
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,740
You're here to fix the flowers. And now, you're asking for a drink?

359
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,100
You think you can order our men around?

360
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,020
Can I order your men around, then?

361
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,839
Flower Bird Envoy, what are you doing here?

362
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,020
I thought you were getting a mistress today.

363
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,540
This is the florist my mistress

364
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,060
designated to decorate our courtyard.

365
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,100
I needed her service, yet you guys brought her here.

366
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,159
You guys better follow her instructions.

367
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,479
End this as soon as possible

368
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,319
so that I can rush back to my wedding.

369
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,661
Do not delay my wedding.

370
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,453
Yes, my lord.

371
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,960
Father, please get up.

372
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,559
What are you doing here?

373
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,661
I'll return very soon.

374
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,481
You already ran away from the wedding. Of course I have to come here.

375
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,260
This is a dangerous place, you know?

376
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,040
What if you encounter King Ning and Her Highness here?

377
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,160
Do you expect me to marry your ghost?

378
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,260
This is the larvae of the green thorn moth.

379
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,480
It resembles a butterfly in adult form.

380
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,981
Therefore, the servants here didn't chase them away.

381
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,540
They love to hide under lotus leaves and chew on the petals.

382
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,981
They love fruits even more.

383
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,580
That's why I used the peach and plum juice to lure them out.

384
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,820
This is King Ning's Residence.

385
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,679
Even so, they don't even know how to tend to lotus flowers.

386
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,095
Now, they're blaming the association for it.

387
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,279
Chun, do not spout nonsense.

388
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,760
I hope Her Highness will be pleased with this flower.

389
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,128
Let them go.

390
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,721
Yes, madam.

391
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,040
Thank you, Flower Bird Envoy.

392
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,080
Thank you, miss.

393
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,119
Leader Lv, you're too courteous.

394
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,208
I wouldn't be able to make it here today

395
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,901
if it weren't for your clever daughter.

396
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,340
Our wedding will be called off if we don't return now.

397
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,820
I think it lacks something.

398
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,653
Your Highness.

399
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,430
Wait.

400
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,338
Bring it here.

401
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,657
Yes, Your Highness.

402
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:09,519
This flower is...

403
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,416
Not only is the flower exquisite and beautiful,

404
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,616
but it also carries a fortunate meaning.

405
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,861
It's called Gold Lace.

406
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,381
Gold Lace, huh?

407
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,519
Zi Shu desires a belt full of gold and for his aspirations to be fulfilled.

408
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,421
I'm sure he'll like this.

409
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,257
Higher.

410
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,720
Higher.

411
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,165
That's the spot.

412
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,896
It's my first time seeing a groom riding the wedding carriage.

413
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,100
It's nothing surprising.

414
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,656
The groom is marrying into the family.

415
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,095
Naturally, he has to ride the carriage to the bride's residence.

416
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,941
But King Ning is holding a grand reception for it.

417
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,759
It's more glorious than the weddings of other noble families.

418
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,651
He's coming out.

419
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,340
Father, Mother, I've repaid you both

420
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,221
for raising me.

421
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,461
In the future,

422
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,780
I shall decide my own path.

423
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,060
I think Zi Shu is trying to disown us after this.

424
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,053
Master,

425
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,340
should we have refrained ourselves from pushing him this far?

426
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,300
Groom, please wait.

427
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,861
Scatter the beans!

428
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,879
And the three killings will be averted!

429
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,941
May you be blessed with purity, peace, and safety,

430
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,141
and may all evil spirits be forever departed!

431
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,340
Please proceed.

432
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,381
Roll the mat,

433
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,421
pass the seat, hand the bag,

434
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,340
these are traditions passed down for generations.

435
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,820
First, like flowers in full bloom!

436
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,260
Second, to fill the hall with gold and jade!

437
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,500
Third, to celebrate the prosperous union!

438
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,861
Fourth, to honor the family!

439
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,100
Fifth, to bring wealth and nobility to the family!

440
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,341
Sixth, to ensure eternal prosperity!

441
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,060
Seventh, to bring peace, health, and longevity to the ancestors!

442
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,381
Eighth, to return home with eight horses!

443
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,660
Ninth, to drive away evil spirits!

444
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,700
Tenth, to invite the eight great blessings!

445
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,060
Straddle the saddle!

446
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,580
One horse, one saddle.

447
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,140
The newlywed couple rides together, balanced and in harmony,

448
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,580
with everlasting marital bliss.

449
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,580
May they enjoy wealth and prosperity for a hundred autumns.

450
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,301
My lord, you have to straddle the saddle.

451
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,600
These are all good omens for warding off evil,

452
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,301
and welcoming fortune and blessings.

453
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,981
Father, Zi Shu's leg is injured.

454
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,540
The customs must be obeyed.

455
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,421
Zi Shu, what do you think?

456
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,700
Your Highness, you have a point.

457
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,660
Bow before the mirror!

458
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,060
The couple is united with ultimate happiness and eternal prosperity!

459
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,180
Bow!

460
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,901
Bow again!

461
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,540
Bow for the third time!

462
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,500
The belt is tied, and the makeup is set.

463
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,620
They shall enter the marital chamber!

464
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,960
I know fancy bridal decorations and expensive dowries

465
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,660
are nothing compared to your wish.

466
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,215
We're setting up the banquet in your courtyard.

467
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,400
I assume you're at ease.

468
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,781
Da Fu picked the gourd herself.

469
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,620
She picked 180 of them.

470
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,020
And, she kept the roundest for us.

471
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,341
Dear, shall we enjoy the nuptial wine?

472
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:04,227
Wait.

473
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:22,345
This is your first time getting married, and you did it for my sake.

474
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,460
I always wanted to express my thanks.

475
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,301
However, you lack nothing.

476
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,020
The only thing I can think of is to brew some liquor with roses.

477
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:36,020
I only hope that it won't leave you with any regrets.

478
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,160
Is there a name for this liquor?

479
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,315
It's called Taoyao.

480
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,102
Try it.

481
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,821
If you think it's nice,

482
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,301
I can sell them in Blooming Abode in the future.

483
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,381
You think about business 24/7.

484
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,301
We're truly cut from the same cloth.

485
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,140
To be with someone who understands me and grants me the freedom to act

486
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,741
is a rare and beautiful thing.

487
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,060
Life on earth

488
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,520
is like a traveler suddenly embarking on a long journey.

489
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,495
We drink, and though our conversation is light,

490
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,879
it is sincere and not superficial.

491
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,427
Let me offer you a toast.

492
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:32,575
I want to thank you as well.

493
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,620
I want to thank you for leading me to all those unexpected blessings.

494
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:39,322
You're too courteous.

495
00:39:39,488 --> 00:39:40,840
I want to thank you as well.

496
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:43,655
Because of you, I've come into all sorts of unexpected fortune.

497
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,901
My days have been getting interesting as well.

498
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,247
My lord.

499
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,913
My lord.

500
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,800
Da Fu and I have been busy entertaining all those guests.

501
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,580
However, we had great chemistry.

502
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,615
This is just a small reception, you know?

503
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,200
Now, you guys know how complicated and troublesome getting married is.

504
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,185
Xiao Chun? What are you doing here?

505
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:18,020
How is it? Is your family okay?

506
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,741
They're fine all thanks to you.

507
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:22,741
Father rewarded the florists with the reward he received.

508
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,920
I left the house in secret through the dog hole.

509
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,421
Sui Zhi.

510
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,364
Sui Zhi.

511
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,000
Mr. Xu, you don't go out usually. But you're here today.

512
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,180
I'm the accountant of Blooming Abode.

513
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,781
Naturally, I have to keep a lookout for our owner.

514
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,880
There are no outsiders today. Only our friends and families are invited.

515
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,840
We can enjoy ourselves and drink until we drop.

516
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,044
Please take your seats.

517
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:46,926
Nonsense!

518
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,135
- Mr. Xu is something else. - You think we're here to eat?

519
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,239
How dare he treat Flower Bird Envoy like that?

520
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,341
According to the ancient sages,

521
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,215
"There is heaven and earth, and then there are all things.

522
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:57,240
With all things, there are men and women.

523
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,660
With men and women, there are husbands and wives.

524
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,180
That is the beginning of the world."

525
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,500
We can skip the ordinary social interactions and superficiality.

526
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,861
However, the customs and bowing during the wedding ceremony

527
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,720
are a solemn declaration to Heaven and Earth.

528
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,376
It signifies that from this moment onward, the two are united as one.

529
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,800
They share both honor and disgrace.

530
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:18,503
That mustn't be omitted.

531
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,006
No need for that.

532
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,559
I don't think that's necessary.

533
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,700
Hurry. Come.
