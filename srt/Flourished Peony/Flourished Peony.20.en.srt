1
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:35,805
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:39,000
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,188
No wonder the business of Huanyun Pavilion is always good.

4
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:46,080
The bed is so comfortable.

5
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:51,760
Actually, tonight,

6
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,360
I've been wanting to find an opportunity

7
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,800
to have a good chat with you.

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,600
What do you want to know, Mu Dan?

9
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,360
I will tell you everything you want to know.

10
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:01,831
That's great.

11
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,158
I dared not disturb you

12
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,880
when I saw how busy you were today.

13
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,426
Thankfully, there are not enough rooms

14
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,738
so I can shamelessly enter your room

15
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,800
and learn about business from you.

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,101
You are also a shopowner.

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,101
Blooming Abode's business is booming.

18
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,900
What else do you need to know?

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,420
There are many things that I don't know.

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,781
Blooming Abode is just a shop right now

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,460
so I can still manage it barely.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,420
But I plan to open more branches

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,020
and serve more customers.

24
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,860
Mu Dan, you are ambitious and courageous.

25
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,700
I'm sure you can do it.

26
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,381
Miss Yun, tell me.

27
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,079
Huanyun Pavilion is an inn

28
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,221
that serves food and wine

29
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,101
with performances as well.

30
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:49,040
You have so many activities in your business.

31
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,860
How do you manage all of them?

32
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,740
If you want to expand your business,

33
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,541
you can't rely only on yourself.

34
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,821
You also need to depend on the capable people around you.

35
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,440
Everyone has their strengths

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,620
and weaknesses.

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,420
You must place everyone

38
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,580
in a position that they are best at.

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Let your helpers

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,661
show their strengths.

41
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,479
My Lord.

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,580
I'm extremely grateful

43
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,460
for the Princess' love for me

44
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,420
but what I get isn't what I want.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,420
If we are forced to get married,

46
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
it will only be unfair to the princess.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,061
I beg you

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,300
to cancel my marriage with the princess.

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,821
Did you argue with You Zhen?

50
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,880
She has been spoiled since she was young

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,341
so she has a willful personality.

52
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,580
You should be more accommodating to her.

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,580
I've considered it thoroughly.

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,740
I didn't ask for this on a whim.

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Please agree to my request,

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
My Lord.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,661
You Zhen is infatuated with you.

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,061
She begged me a few times for the sake of your position as an official.

59
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,461
You are suddenly asking to cancel the marriage now.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,060
Not only have you made her love for you go to waste

61
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,981
but you are also neglecting the royal family's reputation.

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,940
I broke my promise

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,860
regarding the marriage.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
I'm willing to resign as assistant revenue minister.

65
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
No matter how you punish me,

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,820
I have no complaints.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,141
Have you considered it thoroughly?

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Yes.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
All right.

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,380
As a father,

71
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,461
You Zhen's happiness

72
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,901
has been a worry of mine.

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,999
I was worried that you married her

74
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,300
for the sake of your career.

75
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,981
However, what you said just now

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,060
was the words of a gentleman.

77
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,060
You made me see you in a new light.

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Come.

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,060
You are a talent.

80
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,461
I'm sure you will achieve something great

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,221
after you go through some trials.

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,260
Well. Let me transfer you to another place first.

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,420
Whether you can be promoted

84
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,300
will depend on your ability.

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Thank you, My Lord.

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,380
I'm extremely grateful.

87
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,461
Master!

88
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,781
King Ning has agreed to the cancellation of the marriage.

89
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,901
There's no need to persuade anymore, Father.

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
I must beat you to death!

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,820
- Master! - I was unfilial.

92
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,141
I'm willing

93
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,581
to accept any of your punishment

94
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,981
but I must remind you, Father.

95
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,740
Lord Chen is entering the capital today.

96
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,300
With your abilities,

97
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,839
you can persuade him

98
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,101
to let you keep your position

99
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,760
and not be hindered by what I did.

100
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,940
Stand up.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,300
It was just an argument

102
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,300
between children.

103
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,879
Liu Shen said

104
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,319
he would

105
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,740
persuade Liu Chang

106
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,940
to reconcile with the princess.

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Liu Shen

108
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,180
is embarrassed to meet you

109
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,740
and begged me to help him

110
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,079
offer this month's tribute.

111
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,221
There are nine more boxes outside.

112
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,879
Since Liu Shen

113
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,461
became the Grand Treasurer,

114
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,661
the money he offered as tribute

115
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
has doubled.

116
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,300
Liu Shen

117
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,581
might be a coward

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,500
but he is a lapdog who is good at making money.

119
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,981
Your ambition

120
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,940
requires a lot of money to get things done.

121
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Why not

122
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,239
keep Liu as your money tree

123
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,021
for now?

124
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Forget it.

125
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,661
Since you are willing to say good things about him,

126
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,341
it seems like this person

127
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,820
can win people's hearts.

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
My Lord, you are wise.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,060
Don't worry. He will never be a part of

130
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,740
the higher officials' network

131
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,341
but there are troublesome people sometimes.

132
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,500
Liu is a good candidate

133
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,960
to be sent to protect

134
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,260
the minor officials.

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,620
You banished Liu's young master

136
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,061
to become an official at a place like that.

137
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,620
I'm sure he can't take it.

138
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,540
In a few days,

139
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,301
he will come back and beg for forgiveness.

140
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,860
Then, he'll go and comfort the princess.

141
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,421
How dare he humiliate my daughter.

142
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,341
Even if he regrets it in the future,

143
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,181
I must still teach him a lesson

144
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,620
during this period.

145
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,301
She Yan has a good life.

146
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,400
Young Master always

147
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,260
visits the Imperial Stable to choose horses for him.

148
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,199
She Yan risks his life for me

149
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,740
and is busy all the time.

150
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,540
I must prepare a few good horses for him.

151
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,880
You don't travel often

152
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,660
since you're always beside me.

153
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,540
Why are you feeling jealous?

154
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,479
That's not right, Young Master.

155
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,101
I've worked hard as well.

156
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,000
Look. I must fend off assassins

157
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,380
who appear from time to time

158
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,061
and have to put up an act together with you.

159
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Fine.

160
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,181
I know you've worked hard.

161
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,380
You may take the golden long-poled blade

162
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,759
at the warehouse.

163
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,639
Really?

164
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,941
Thank you, Young Master. I will do my best to serve you.

165
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,519
Young Master Liu.

166
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Come.

167
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,679
Try this delicious dish.

168
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,140
Official Ge, that's a water ladle used to wash horses.

169
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,701
How can it be used to drink water?

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,101
Why not?

171
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,380
Didn't you say it has been cleaned?

172
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,319
Are you neglecting your duties?

173
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,740
You are framing me.

174
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,559
Official Ge, why are you troubling me?

175
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,639
Why?

176
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Young Master Liu.

177
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,199
You are no longer

178
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,660
King Ning's son-in-law.

179
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,860
There's no need to drink water with a jade ladle.

180
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,981
This dirty tool

181
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,061
fits your status.

182
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,301
Pry his mouth open!

183
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Try it.

184
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,581
It's very delicious.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Not enough?

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,941
How about another ladle?

187
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,120
Official Ge, you are better

188
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,660
at training people than horses.

189
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,639
Lord Jiang, why are you here?

190
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,581
The newcomer is disobedient.

191
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,860
Sorry to let you see this, Flower Bird Envoy.

192
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,701
Are you here to choose a horse?

193
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,981
Let me bring you there myself.

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
No need.

195
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,301
I know Zi Shu well.

196
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,639
Let him

197
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,860
accompany me today.

198
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,941
Zi Shu, I'm seeing you in a new light.

199
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,920
You even dare refuse King Ning's wedding proposal.

200
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,960
King Ning used to matchmake you and the princess.

201
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,101
Didn't you refuse it as well?

202
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,981
The princess only likes you.

203
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,559
In my opinion,

204
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,540
she is firm on marrying you.

205
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,461
She is so persistent.

206
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,821
You could just go with the flow

207
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,919
so why did you

208
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
ask for trouble instead?

209
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,120
Lord Jiang, are you here to persuade me on King Ning's behalf

210
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,821
or are you persuading me

211
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,341
for your neighbor's sake?

212
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,500
It seems like you miss Jiang Residence's florist a lot.

213
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
She faked her death

214
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,061
and restored her identity

215
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,660
before establishing Blooming Abode in Chang'an.

216
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,660
I'm sure she had your help.

217
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,821
I'm just investing some capital

218
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,660
to make a profit without doing anything.

219
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,660
She achieved her current success

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,101
due to her own capabilities.

221
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,639
Why did you

222
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,421
help her get a divorce

223
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,919
in Luoyang?

224
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,421
She was badly bullied by the Liu family.

225
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,920
As her husband, you did nothing

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,860
and you wouldn't allow other people to help her?

227
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,140
I let her down in the past

228
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,861
but I will never be stuck in this stable.

229
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,240
When I get promoted,

230
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,900
I will propose to her

231
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,605
and treat her sincerely.

232
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,981
That's a wonderful wish.

233
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Have you asked

234
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,341
if He Wei Fang wants that?

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,020
I will move her

236
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,660
with my sincerity.

237
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,221
Lord Jiang, why do you

238
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,640
care about

239
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
who she marries?

240
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,301
Are you worried that she can't help you grow flowers and make money

241
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,941
or are you having some selfish thoughts?

242
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,500
That's not important.

243
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,860
But if the princess finds out about your intention,

244
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I'm afraid

245
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,860
Wei Fang's life will be in danger again.

246
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,301
That's all I'm going to say.

247
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,020
I hope you behave yourself.

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I thank you

249
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,679
for what happened just now.

250
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,039
Young Master,

251
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,581
why did you meddle in other people's family business

252
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,981
and make yourself upset?

253
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,540
What do you mean by family business?

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,380
They are no longer a family.

255
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,759
Jiang Xiao Hua is my money tree now.

256
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,061
You have lots of money in the treasury.

257
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,780
Do you really need this money tree?

258
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,279
You look so pretty.

259
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,181
We've purchased Blooming Abode's deed.

260
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,879
You are no longer Qin Wu'er who needs to rely on Wang Qing

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,341
but Shopowner Qin who has a shop in Chang'an.

262
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,919
You must return to Ning

263
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,101
with your head held high.

264
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,221
I've never returned home

265
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,821
in such a grand manner.

266
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,860
Do you think it's too flashy?

267
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,535
Going back in a nice dress will let your family

268
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:43,814
see you in a different light

269
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,421
and tell them that your life is different.

270
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,301
You are the most successful daughter in the family.

271
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,421
You have a great future ahead of you.

272
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,581
They will surely not underestimate you anymore.

273
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Here. Take it.

274
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
- All right. - Go home bravely.

275
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:30,479
Father! Mother!

276
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,559
I'm back.

277
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,001
- Sister-in-law. Quan'er. - Wu'er.

278
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,198
Wu'er.

279
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,559
- Aunt is back. - Close the door.

280
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,879
Come in quickly. Don't let other people see you.

281
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,039
- Give it to me. - A dumped woman still dare return in such a flash way.

282
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,821
How shameless.

283
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,380
If the neighbors see you,

284
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,900
they might gossip about you behind your back.

285
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,860
I was almost beaten to death by Wang Qing

286
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,581
so I got a divorce.

287
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,941
I wasn't dumped.

288
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,020
I had nothing to be ashamed of.

289
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,540
You were still

290
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,860
being chased out of your husband's house after all.

291
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,260
You embarrassed me so badly.

292
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,600
Wang Qing is very gentle.

293
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,020
I'm sure Wu'er disrespected him

294
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
and angered him.

295
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,399
Let me take a look.

296
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,039
- Si Lang. - Mother.

297
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,328
Let me see what she brought back.

298
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,981
An argument between husband and wife is normal.

299
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,981
A family can only live in harmony

300
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,421
when the woman is gentle and obedient.

301
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,101
Your sister-in-law is right.

302
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
You shouldn't be so pampered

303
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,981
as someone else's wife.

304
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,771
You can only have a good life

305
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,421
when your husband is happy.

306
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,399
Come.

307
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,279
Si Lang.

308
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,500
Mother. Don't move.

309
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,559
Don't you know what time it is? Go and cook.

310
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:01,479
Why are you spacing out?

311
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,559
Get to work.

312
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,039
Look at how lazy you are.

313
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,199
No wonder Wang Qing beat you.

314
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,279
Go and do the laundry.

315
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,839
Go and do the laundry.

316
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,020
Let's see if there's anything else.

317
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Sister.

318
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Sister.

319
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,319
You are finally back.

320
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,820
I miss you so much.

321
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,759
Liu Lang.

322
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,221
I miss you too.

323
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Sister,

324
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,359
you made osmanthus cake for me

325
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,381
whenever the flowers bloomed in the past.

326
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,941
Try the ones I made today.

327
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,820
It's so delicious.

328
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,039
Liu Lang.

329
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,740
You've grown up.

330
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,221
Sister, you should leave Wang Qing sooner.

331
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,941
I'm sure you are living a better life now.

332
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,359
You've become prettier.

333
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,421
This osmanthus tree

334
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,661
was the only bit of color in this house.

335
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,500
Why was it chopped down for no reason?

336
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,020
Brother wanted to make a wooden horse for nephew.

337
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,100
Why did you bring back so many useless things?

338
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,060
If you have money, buy some clothes for your nephew

339
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
or make him a silver lock.

340
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,181
Sister has sent a lot of money back home normally.

341
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,740
Everything you and Mother is wearing was bought by her.

342
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,000
What did Brother do for both of you?

343
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,060
I gave birth to her and raised her.

344
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,141
Shouldn't she do this?

345
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,861
If I didn't marry her to Wang Qing,

346
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,820
do you think she could go to Chang'an and live a comfortable life?

347
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,221
I could finally live a comfortable life after leaving Wang Qing.

348
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,941
I opened a shop with two of my friends.

349
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,300
All of these were made in our shop.

350
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:14,159
Its demand is higher than the supply in Chang'an.

351
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,621
In the future, we will still open branches.

352
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,381
Friends? Who are you calling friends?

353
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Open your eyes and take a good look.

354
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,461
The ones before you are your family members.

355
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,039
Family members?

356
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,981
What did you do for me?

357
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,300
Have you cared about my well-being?

358
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,701
You animal!

359
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,020
Father, what are you doing?

360
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,640
Women should prioritize their husbands

361
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,421
yet you are still feeling happy

362
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,141
when you no longer have a husband.

363
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,260
Wu'er.

364
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,540
You don't even know how to read yet you're starting a business.

365
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,381
Do you think you are cut out for it?

366
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,120
You could still survive

367
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,461
when you relied on Wang Qing.

368
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,680
Later, you made some friends and earned some money.

369
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,060
Then, you're acting all arrogant.

370
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,100
You are just a worker.

371
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,621
What else do you know without anyone helping you?

372
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Enough.

373
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,559
You're always showing yourself in public without being virtuous.

374
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,540
Which honest man will want to marry her?

375
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,360
Consider it!

376
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,500
- Enough. - Wake up. Move.

377
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Wu'er.

378
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,060
How can you go against your father?

379
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,381
Did some bad people

380
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,020
give you a bad influence?

381
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,920
Women should always marry someone.

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,279
Even if you make a lot of money,

383
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,300
it still means nothing if you have no children.

384
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,240
Why don't you find Wang Qing

385
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,340
and apologize to him

386
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,381
so you can go home and live a good life?

387
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,421
I didn't say I didn't want to marry

388
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,500
but Wang Qing

389
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,901
isn't a good person.

390
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,293
Do you think Wang Qing wants you back?

391
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,519
Dream on!

392
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,839
Go and cook.

393
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Wu'er.

394
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,820
We are doing this for your own good.

395
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,181
It's fine even if Wang Qing doesn't want you.

396
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Your father

397
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,461
has found you

398
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,861
a new husband.

399
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,861
Let's meet him later.

400
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,540
Who is he?

401
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,079
The head of the village.

402
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Zhou's family.

403
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,661
Zhou only has an eldest son.

404
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,461
He is more than 40 years old

405
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,181
and he has two children.

406
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,100
You are an abandoned woman

407
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,621
who had a miscarriage.

408
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
No one knows if you can still give birth in the future.

409
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,740
Who else would want you besides a widower?

410
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,780
Zhou's family has fields.

411
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,100
If you manage it well,

412
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,060
you will live a better life than you did in Chang'an.

413
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:58,347
All right. This is the last time I'm going to apply medicine for you.

414
00:21:58,428 --> 00:22:00,559
Whether you come in contact with water or soil in the future

415
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
is none of my business.

416
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,861
The cut is clean,

417
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,661
There won't be scars in the future.

418
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,160
Chun's skill in medicine is amazing.

419
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,260
You're great.

420
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,780
Enough, Mu Dan. Stop flattering me.

421
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,321
This is the herb's effect instead of the physician.

422
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,580
Anyone can treat you just the same.

423
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,181
No wonder Blooming Abode's employees didn't seem too happy

424
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,340
after they recovered when I asked them to visit you.

425
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,300
It's difficult to reply to your words.

426
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,020
Everything I say is the truth.

427
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,461
Why are they unhappy?

428
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,141
It's fine if you don't understand how to be tactful when facing others.

429
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,500
Just take it slow in the future.

430
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,799
Chun.

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,141
You said this cream

432
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,221
can get rid of scars and freckles.

433
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:45,165
I'm sure many women need it.

434
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,560
Previously, we used tree peony bark to make our fragrance powder

435
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:48,643
and it was well-received.

436
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Why don't we

437
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,479
add herbs to a cream

438
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,060
to make some beautifying cream this time

439
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,901
and sell them at Blooming Abode?

440
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,461
We'll be able to help more people if we do that.

441
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,320
Yes. I've thought about it.

442
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,880
If the cream sells well,

443
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,800
I will open a shop for you

444
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,981
so you can become a shopowner.

445
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,279
I just want to improve my skills in medicine

446
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,381
and treat patients.

447
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,020
I don't want and don't know how

448
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,820
to manage a shop and make money.

449
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,519
Think about it.

450
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,421
If you have your own shop,

451
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,181
you will have your own place

452
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,260
to practice medicine freely.

453
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,661
It's a good thing for you and your patients.

454
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,621
As for how you manage it,

455
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,100
I can help you

456
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,901
or hire someone to manage it.

457
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,621
If I can practice medicine freely,

458
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,141
I don't mind giving it a try.

459
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:37,260
However, can I really do that?

460
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,800
Don't worry.

461
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,861
I've never been wrong when judging people.

462
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,039
When the shop is opened,

463
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,239
I'm sure many people will visit especially for you.

464
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,679
When the time comes, Blooming Abode can take advantage of the fame as well.

465
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,260
Yes. We can take advantage of the fame.

466
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,999
You don't even know how to read yet you're starting a business.

467
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,661
Do you think you are cut out for it?

468
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,221
You are just a worker.

469
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,701
What else do you know without anyone helping you?

470
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Yes.

471
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,580
I know nothing.

472
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,060
You are just leading me

473
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,260
because you are kind.

474
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,221
Other people can also do good things for you.

475
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,820
When have I made you proud?

476
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,820
Chun, you will surely be a good shopowner

477
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,519
in the future.

478
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,160
You've sat here for a long time

479
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,661
and are always mumbling.

480
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,439
It seems like you have something to say.

481
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,901
What is it? Tell me.

482
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,060
It's nothing.

483
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:41,759
I...

484
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,060
If I tell you,

485
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
I'll be beaten up.

486
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,981
Understood. Being loyal.

487
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,060
Keeping a promise is important.

488
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,600
Don't tell us.

489
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,701
- We won't listen. - No. It's not that serious.

490
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,039
It's...

491
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,319
My mother

492
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,260
is suffering from constipation.

493
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,981
She has a bloated stomach

494
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,580
which causes flatulence every day.

495
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,260
It's troublesome for me.

496
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,500
Chun, if you can help her,

497
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,160
I can get you anything you want

498
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,981
including a ginseng spirit or a handsome man from another family.

499
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,100
Of course, I want the ginseng.

500
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,901
Why do I even need a handsome man?

501
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,279
Don't tell my mother.

502
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,519
If she finds out,

503
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,600
she will punish me.

504
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,840
My mother

505
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,260
might look like a friendly person but when she is angry...

506
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,461
Why did you come here?

507
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,839
I know you will also be here

508
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,260
at the child's death anniversary.

509
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,421
You feel sad about it. Do you think I'm heartless?

510
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,199
When I think of our children,

511
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,661
I still feel a lot of pain.

512
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,221
How pretentious.

513
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,181
You've never burned any paper offering previously.

514
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,100
I didn't want to accept it before this

515
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,861
but I've reflected on my mistakes.

516
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,880
I was careless

517
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,181
and neglected your health

518
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,479
so you had a miscarriage

519
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,559
because you were overworked.

520
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,039
Hit me.

521
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,141
Hit me. Hit me.

522
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,020
I hate myself more.

523
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,100
I let you go

524
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,181
because of my absurd actions.

525
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,421
Your friends

526
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,141
are not married.

527
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,880
They are not mothers

528
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,300
so they don't understand your pain.

529
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,981
After your miscarriage,

530
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:15,580
you are weak and afraid of the cold.

531
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,920
I brought this hand warmer to warm you up.

532
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,221
The child is gone.

533
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,100
Our relationship as husband and wife is over.

534
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,300
What's the point

535
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,901
of doing this?

536
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,060
Everything in the past

537
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,340
was my fault.

538
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,340
I hope Heaven

539
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,039
and you

540
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,701
can give me another opportunity.

541
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,981
I will cherish you, love you,

542
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,100
and protect this family.

543
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Wu Niang,

544
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,540
who else in this world

545
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,300
will miss you so much besides me?

546
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,020
I can't leave you.

547
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,141
I know it's also the same for you.

548
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,340
Let's get together again.

549
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,839
In the future,

550
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,060
we will have another child in the future.

551
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Wu Niang.

552
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Wu Niang.

553
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Wu Niang.

554
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Wu Niang.

555
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,221
Lord Jiang, I allowed you

556
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,381
to drink with me at the pavilion

557
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,800
but I didn't allow you

558
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,981
to steal my chicken.

559
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,679
Merchants will normally

560
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,260
send gifts to their major customers.

561
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,181
I am your biggest creditor

562
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,060
yet you won't even give me some food.

563
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,319
How can you do business

564
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,701
when you are so petty?

565
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,280
Who told you I didn't prepare food for you?

566
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:08,669
These are all for you

567
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,221
but not this chicken.

568
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:11,421
I'm saving it for someone else.

569
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,119
Who is it?

570
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,540
Are you interested in a young man?

571
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,941
Should I help you take a look?

572
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,901
When did you see me having an interest in young men?

573
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,661
Sheng Yi is coming back tonight.

574
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,861
I'm sure she is tired after her journey.

575
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:27,503
I prepared this for her

576
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,781
as a nourishment.

577
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Sheng Yi

578
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,381
is always working hard.

579
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:35,811
She never complains no matter how tired she is.

580
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,020
I know she is weak against the cold.

581
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,820
She probably got it when she was with Wang Qing's family.

582
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,701
She wouldn't let Chun take her pulse as well.

583
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
So,

584
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,181
I can only take care of her diet.

585
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,780
I lived in Jiangnan for a few years when I was a child.

586
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,260
Locals wrap chicken in lotus leaf before grilling it.

587
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,559
By doing that,

588
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,941
the grilled chicken will have the fragrance of plants.

589
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,661
I heard Physician Chun made medicine

590
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,560
and left a few pieces of lotus leaves in your house.

591
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,100
We can give it a try now.

592
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,039
Right.

593
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,701
Don't worry.

594
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,221
This is fire. Do you think I dare touch it?

595
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
You're right.

596
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,300
Don't touch my chicken.

597
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,759
My chicken!

598
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,861
Jiang Chang Yang!

599
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
Young Master.

600
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,621
I've delivered the dendrobium

601
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,901
to the backyard as you ordered.

602
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,260
However, Miss He is still angry.

603
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,580
She even called you

604
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,839
a chicken thief.

605
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:16,518
The dendrobium was given to me by His Majesty.

606
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,740
It is very precious.

607
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,861
Her mother used to open a medicine shop.

608
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,221
I'm sure she knows

609
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,221
this is more nourishing than the chicken.

610
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,799
Why did she still scold me?

611
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:26,430
Miss He said

612
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,022
you should be scolded for taking things away without asking for permission.

613
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,608
Young Master.

614
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,560
You knew there was nothing special about the chicken

615
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,981
so why did you steal it?

616
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
You know nothing.

617
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,500
I'm doing it for pleasure.

618
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Young Master.

619
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
He only said so much

620
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,412
after such a long time.

621
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,381
Most of it is false as well.

622
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,381
It's time to take it seriously.

623
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Cui Mao.

624
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,020
Was the wine I served you

625
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
strong enough?

626
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,060
Jiang Chang Yang.

627
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,060
You've always been putting on an act.

628
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,861
Aren't you afraid

629
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,060
that people might find out that you've brought me here?

630
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,319
You knocked out the guards and escaped.

631
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,020
It has nothing to do with me.

632
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,940
The officials who escorted you

633
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:23,718
were worried about being punished for negligence

634
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,340
so he reported that you died from illness.

635
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,799
Right now,

636
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,861
no one knows that you are still alive.

637
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,119
I have a habit.

638
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,758
I will prepare a good jar of wine

639
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,559
to those who enter this place.

640
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,319
If the person is innocent,

641
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,580
I will give this jar of wine to him.

642
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,300
If the person is guilty,

643
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,500
I will pour the wine

644
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,461
on his grave.

645
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,740
However,

646
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,141
you wouldn't confess.

647
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,060
The wine is already old.

648
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,141
I've said

649
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,621
everything I should.

650
00:33:58,231 --> 00:33:59,613
I'm the only one

651
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,921
who is responsible for the buying and selling of official positions.

652
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,661
Besides that,

653
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,300
I've never committed other crimes.

654
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,679
Is that so?

655
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,341
Huameng County's Merchant, Li,

656
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,901
had his goods robbed on the 27th day of the third month.

657
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,700
Soon after, his family jade pendant was possessed by Cui Mao.

658
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,261
Li reported it to the officials.

659
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,421
That night, his whole family was annihilated by bandits.

660
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,020
The Cui family

661
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,381
took 200 mu of Yang's field last autumn.

662
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,119
I forgot to tell you.

663
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,180
Those who entered this secret room

664
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,020
have never left this place as an innocent man.

665
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,140
If you don't confess,

666
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,341
I will keep finding evidence of your crime.

667
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,880
Robbery and taking other people's land.

668
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,381
Each of those is a serious crime.

669
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:56,781
You will surely die

670
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,320
but you can choose

671
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,981
to die with less torture.

672
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,341
You still won't confess?

673
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Fine.

674
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,781
I'm going to eat supper first.

675
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,180
What did you do to my son?

676
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,981
Do you feel helpless?

677
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,079
If you confess,

678
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,100
the mastermind will annihilate your family.

679
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
If you don't confess,

680
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,660
you are worried that I will kill your eldest son.

681
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,060
I will take responsibility

682
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,981
for all the crimes.

683
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,440
I beg you.

684
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,180
I beg you not to hurt them.

685
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,781
Your wife and children

686
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,140
know nothing about the crimes you committed.

687
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,400
They are not supposed to die

688
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,741
for your sake.

689
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,821
If I confess my crime,

690
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,580
and the testimony

691
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,821
is submitted,

692
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,741
King Ning will know that I'm still alive.

693
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,760
- When the time comes, I... - When the time comes,

694
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,560
I would've sent them out of Chang'an.

695
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,660
No one will find them.

696
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,941
However, I will send them away

697
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,500
without taking the money you obtained from bribery.

698
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,660
In the future, they will live their lives in poverty

699
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,020
but they will also be safe.

700
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,821
During your funeral,

701
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,500
your eldest son was crying without stopping.

702
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,079
I told him

703
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,861
I was powerful

704
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,821
and could send this rattledrum to the underworld

705
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:03,020
and give it to his father.

706
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
He believed me

707
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,140
and asked me to send you a message.

708
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,559
He said

709
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,741
he might not be able to see you again

710
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,261
but he will miss you forever.

711
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,840
He hopes you can become a good official in your next life

712
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,461
and continue your relationship as father and son.

713
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,119
Sheng Yi.

714
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,781
Sheng Yi, are you asleep?

715
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,079
Sheng Yi.

716
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,200
I saw you going back to your room as soon as you returned.

717
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,741
You seemed tired.

718
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,679
Did something happen

719
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,981
back at home?

720
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,941
Are you willing to share it with me?

721
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,262
It's still the same with my family.

722
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,421
I have nothing to tell you.

723
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Mu Dan.

724
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,079
I'm tired.

725
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,821
I want to rest earlier.

726
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,660
Drink this nourishing soup when it's still hot.

727
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,301
You will feel better after drinking it.

728
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,599
Call me any time whenever you want to tell me.

729
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Here you go.

730
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,140
You purposely made this for me?

731
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
What else do you think?

732
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,620
I roasted a chicken for you

733
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,861
but the one next door stole it.

734
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:01,140
Thankfully, he is sensible and sent this good-quality dendrobium.

735
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,480
Enough talking. Here.

736
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,639
Drink it while it's hot.

737
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,079
Rest early and don't overthink.

738
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,159
Young Master, the evidence is ready.

739
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,239
When should we depart?

740
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,741
The sooner, the better.

741
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,220
However, we need an excuse

742
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
to go to Luoyang.

743
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,140
His Majesty's teacher has passed away

744
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,140
and is feeling depressed.

745
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,240
The Flower Bird Envoy is trying to search for something

746
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,060
to ease his mind. How about that?

747
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
Call for lunch to be served.

748
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Start packing after lunch.

749
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,599
Yes.

750
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Lord Jiang.

751
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:04,079
Miss He.

752
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Greetings, Lord Jiang.

753
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,861
You were still scolding me last night.

754
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:15,981
Did you take the wrong medicine today?

755
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,861
It was the right medicine.

756
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,620
Thank you for delivering the dendrobium last night.

757
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,660
Sheng Yi is looking better after eating it.

758
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,301
I'm here to give you a gift as thanks.

759
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:27,941
I only get these few cakes

760
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,941
in exchange for the expensive nourishing herbs?

761
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,039
Enjoy, Lord Jiang.

762
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,719
I'm leaving.

763
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Wait.
