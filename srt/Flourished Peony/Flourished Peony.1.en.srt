00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:36,102
<i>[Flourished Peony]</i>

2
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:39,387
<i>[Episode 1]</i>

3
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,282
<i>[Luoyang]</i>

4
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,560
The son of the Liu family is getting married.

5
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,919
What a grand spectacle!

6
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,360
What kind of family background
does this bride have?

7
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,120
I've heard she's a merchant's daughter.

8
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,560
No one knows how she managed
to get connected to the Liu family.

9
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,120
The bride has arrived.

10
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,392
<i>[Winter Donkey-hide Gelatin]</i>

11
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,479
Six boxes of jewelry and trinkets.

12
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,280
Three boxes of precious medicinal herbs.

13
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,479
Five boxes of brocades. Gold and jade…

14
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,240
How can your family be like this?

15
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,560
The bride is still here.

16
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,599
This is outrageous.

17
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,496
Yulu.

18
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,399
A maid.

19
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,576
My lady.

20
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,744
Be careful.

21
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,879
Why don't I hear any guests moving?

22
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,680
There's not a single guest in the house.

23
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,279
All the Liu family members are gathered
around our dowry, busy with their abacuses.

24
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,000
The groom isn't coming
on horseback to welcome the bride.

25
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,680
It's already against the etiquettes.

26
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,160
Now they're not even setting up the banquet.

27
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,600
They even made us enter
through the back courtyard.

28
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,879
You can't treat the bride with such neglect.

29
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,639
Your mother is bedridden.

30
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,879
Your father is busy taking care of her.

31
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,639
We know that you are a filial child.

32
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,279
You're certainly worried and anxious.

33
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,160
You wouldn't be in the mood
to deal with guests.

34
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,000
That's why there isn't a grand celebration.

35
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,480
I don't care about these empty formalities.

36
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,519
Everything is up to your decision.

37
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,800
My lord, we're ready.

38
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,839
Now is the auspicious time.

39
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,920
Please ask the groom to go to the main hall.

40
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,992
Yes.

41
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,519
Dusk.

42
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,639
Dusk.

43
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,680
Getting drunk like this
on the day of your wedding.

44
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,199
How reckless!

45
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,319
Hurry over and pay your respects.

46
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,199
It's you who are happy,

47
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,199
not me.

48
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,279
Liu Zishu!

49
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,839
My lord,

50
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,439
don't get angry.

51
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,439
Zishu has always been courteous
and well-mannered.

52
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,959
Today he is being forced into marriage.

53
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,439
It's normal for him to be a bit temperamental.

54
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,439
Qiushi,

55
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,879
quickly help the groom over here.

56
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,632
Mr. Zishu.

57
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,759
Mr. Zishu.

58
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,480
- Kneel down.
- Kneel down.

59
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,519
Bow before the mirror.

60
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,319
Husband and wife unite,
forever blessed and prosperous.

61
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,160
Hasn't the groom arrived yet?

62
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,120
Not even a shadow in sight.

63
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,639
You are clearly the principal wife.

64
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,439
Yet you cannot enter his main chamber.

65
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,600
You're merely arranged to stay
in this secluded courtyard.

66
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,480
Isn't it just disdain for our merchant origins?

67
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,120
Your family runs
over a dozen herbal medicine shops.

68
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Since childhood, you have been

69
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,399
surrounded by piles of gold and jade.

70
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,879
Never have you suffered such grievances.

71
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,839
It's almost midnight,
I'll go look for Mr. Zishu.

72
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,399
Mr. Zishu.

73
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,920
I tell you, He Weifang,

74
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
if it weren't for my father

75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,759
relying on this dowry

76
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,360
to alleviate the urgent need,

77
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
you would have no chance

78
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,839
to attach yourself to our Liu family.

79
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,360
- Mr. Zishu.
- Go away!

80
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,000
Our Liu family, for three generations,
has held official ranks,

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,319
with noble carriages at our high gates.

82
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
Even if I

83
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,360
cannot marry the one I love,

84
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,319
I should at least be matched

85
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,560
with a noble lady of official nobility.

86
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Now I'm forced to accept

87
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,680
you, a merchant's daughter.

88
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,919
It is the greatest humiliation of my life.

89
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,679
You listen well.

90
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,480
This marriage between us

91
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,840
is in name only, not in reality.

92
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,159
From this day forth,

93
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,360
I shall never set foot

94
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,480
in this room again.

95
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,600
It's the wedding night.

96
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,879
How can Liu Chang be so rude

97
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,320
and speak ill words to you

98
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,600
insulting you wantonly?

99
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,519
That shouldn't be the behavior
of a gentleman from an official family.

100
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,872
My lady.

101
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,879
My lady.

102
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,840
Don't be too heartbroken.

103
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
No matter how the days ahead are spent,

104
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,399
I will always be by your side.

105
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,952
My Lady.

106
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,879
Has Liu Chang left?

107
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,720
He's gone. Now

108
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,159
he should have left the courtyard.

109
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
Finally gone.

110
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
If he still didn't leave,

111
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,639
my arms would stiffen from holding up.

112
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,759
He didn't hurt you, did he?

113
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,360
I knew you wouldn't be

114
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,240
upset over such an impolite person.

115
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,480
Upset?

116
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm too happy to even be upset.

117
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,840
He's not willing to marry me.

118
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,639
Am I willing to marry him?

119
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,759
Liu Zishu

120
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,480
is clearly a few years older than me.

121
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
But his temperament

122
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,919
is so childish.

123
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,960
Both of us were forced into this marriage.

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,440
I haven't even said anything.

125
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,039
Yet he's the one feeling wronged first.

126
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,679
Good Yulu, don't cry.

127
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,960
My mother has taken
the Liu family's tribute medicine.

128
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,159
Her complexion has greatly improved.

129
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,360
What do I have to be sad about?

130
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,879
Yulu, help me hold this.

131
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,919
My lady, where are you going?

132
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,840
It's about to rain, I can't
let my flowers get wet.

133
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,879
My lady, I'll help you.

134
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,679
Come on, Yulu, quick, together.

135
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,639
- Lift it up.
- Let's go.

136
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Put it here.

137
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,576
Alright.

138
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,360
The Liu family treats us so disdainfully.

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,320
Life will be tough from now on.

140
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,240
After Qiongtai Yulu is soaked in rain,

141
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,960
the leaves become even more
vividly green and elegant.

142
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:39,059
<i>[Spring of the following year]</i>

143
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,960
This jade pendant

144
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,320
has a fine luster.

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,120
A servant

146
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,639
wearing such an expensive item

147
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,320
isn't proper, is it?

148
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,200
Mother,

149
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,399
this jade is nothing extraordinary.

150
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,799
I just think

151
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,600
it matches with Yulu.

152
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,039
So on Yulu's birthday,

153
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,879
it was given as a gift for her to wear.

154
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,559
Your He family is
a major medicinal material dealer,

155
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,600
naturally looking down on such things.

156
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,039
But if a servant decks out in gold and jade

157
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,879
and it gets seen by outsiders,

158
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,200
they might think that our Liu family

159
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
throws money around like dirt
and lacks strict management.

160
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,160
Take it off.

161
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,600
Madam, you are right.

162
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,840
I will take it off as soon as I return.

163
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,159
I'm thinking of Yulu's best interest.

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,320
Being too ostentatious

165
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,000
will inevitably lead to gossip.

166
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,279
I'll keep this jade pendant safe for now.

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,480
On the day Yulu gets married,

168
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,960
it will naturally be included in her dowry.

169
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,759
Thank you for your concern.

170
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,559
As long as you understand my painstaking care.

171
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,519
Recently,

172
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,000
how have you been getting along with Zishu?

173
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Does he still not enter your courtyard?

174
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,240
No.

175
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,080
A wife must regard her husband
as her principle.

176
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,279
If you cannot win Zishu's affection,

177
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,440
it means you have lost virtue.

178
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,919
Do you understand?

179
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,240
It's my dull and uninteresting nature

180
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,639
that displeases my husband.

181
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,840
Please punish me.

182
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,720
I don't want to punish you

183
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,840
but to give you advice.

184
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
The Provincial Exam is forthcoming.

185
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,440
Although Zishu is already a scholar
with rural contributions,

186
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,240
if a person full of knowledge

187
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,759
cannot offer money for connections,

188
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,960
it would still be difficult for him
to pass the higher examination smoothly.

189
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,320
As his wife,

190
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
you ought to make some arrangements for him.

191
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,480
Given my husband's disposition,

192
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,559
I'm afraid he would not agree

193
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,000
to using money to manage official affairs.

194
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,879
Zishu is wholeheartedly devoted to his studies.

195
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,120
He certainly does not understand
these worldly affairs.

196
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,039
Mudan,

197
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,720
you come from a merchant family

198
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,159
and have a big gap compared to Zishu.

199
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,480
You can only contribute

200
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,639
through financial means.

201
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,159
I'm doing this

202
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,240
to bring you and your husband
closer together emotionally.

203
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,664
Do you understand?

204
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,600
I understand.

205
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,559
Zishu, you're here.

206
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,159
Mother.

207
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,559
Come and sit down.

208
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,880
Yes.

209
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,360
Zishu, you seem
to have lost some weight recently.

210
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,360
Preparing for the Imperial Exam
is certainly important.

211
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
But you must take good care of your health.

212
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
I understand.

213
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,759
Thank you for your concern.

214
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,240
Alright, let's eat.

215
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,559
Speaking of the Imperial Exam,

216
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
every time Mudan visits the Fuyun Temple,

217
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,039
she prays for your success.

218
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,440
You should thank her too.

219
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,360
The Imperial Exam relies
on genuine knowledge and learning.

220
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,919
There's no need to pray to gods.

221
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,519
Does she think I lack talent

222
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,519
and can only rely on the protection of deities?

223
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,240
I did not mean that.

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,399
Don't say that.

225
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,600
Mudan is considering your career.

226
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,600
Speaking of your career,

227
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,159
Mudan actually has some thoughts about it.

228
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,559
You can tell your husband now.

229
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,208
Yes.

230
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,200
When you step into officialdom,

231
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,159
it is necessary to manage relations
both above and below

232
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,320
and to make connections with the powerful.

233
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,720
I have set aside some money

234
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,240
to facilitate your future…

235
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,039
I have studied hard for many years

236
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,440
with the ambition to soar high.

237
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,559
After gaining recognition, I will
depend on my own ability

238
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,639
to serve the imperial court.

239
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,200
Do not use your merchant family's

240
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,360
narrow-mindedness

241
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,759
to sully my path to officialdom.

242
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,080
Why have you gotten angry again?

243
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,720
Mudan is thinking of you.

244
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Is she really considering for me

245
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,159
or does she think that I simply cannot

246
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,279
rely on my own talent

247
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,360
to rise straight to the top

248
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,799
and have to depend on these unorthodox methods?

249
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,559
It's not as serious as you think.

250
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,240
If you don't want to, just forget it.

251
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,960
I'll persuade Mudan.

252
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,488
Let's eat first.

253
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,960
I will take my leave now.

254
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,080
You are

255
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,559
quite blunt when you speak.

256
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Can't you say a few soft words

257
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,159
to cajole him a bit?

258
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,440
You saw it.

259
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,320
My husband has made up his mind.

260
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,720
I suppose further persuasion would be futile.

261
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,568
You…

262
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,879
You have been living in seclusion
for a long time.

263
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,159
You don't understand the ways

264
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,320
of the officialdom.

265
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,200
Zishu is an upright and principled man.

266
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
He is unwilling to personally give gifts,
seek favor,

267
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,759
or win people's hearts.

268
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,599
But for his career,

269
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,359
we must plan ahead for him.

270
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,119
But my husband

271
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,119
has just refused.

272
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,400
So what?

273
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,799
If you're afraid of displeasing him,

274
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,319
we'll just do it behind his back.

275
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,440
Mudan,

276
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,559
your father and I

277
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,359
will appreciate your kindness.

278
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,640
Good child,

279
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,279
you go ahead and raise the money
with peace of mind.

280
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,119
You're excused
from this month's courtesy visit.

281
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,200
Thank you, Mother.

282
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,759
Today,

283
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,599
you are going to Fuyun Temple
to pray for blessings.

284
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,960
You should not dress so flamboyantly.

285
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,400
Yes.

286
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,799
Remember to eat vegetarian meals.

287
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,279
Avoid meat and fish.

288
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,240
If the heart is not sincere,

289
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,559
the prayers for blessings
will not be efficacious.

290
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,920
Yes.

291
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,319
I am so pissed off.

292
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,799
Clearly, it's Madame Liu who wants
to spend money to smooth relations.

293
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,920
Yet she insists on making it
come from your mouth.

294
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,559
The two of them are a loving mother
and filial son,

295
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,200
making you do all the unpleasant tasks.

296
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
Moreover, you're not allowed
to wear new clothes

297
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,400
or eat meat or fish.

298
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,559
You're completely at their mercy
regarding clothing, food, and living.

299
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,039
Even the servants in this mansion
live more comfortably than you.

300
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,640
Look at you.

301
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,920
Your little face flushed with anger.

302
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,680
Say it three times with me.

303
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm not angry.

304
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,680
I'm not angry.

305
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,319
How can I not be angry?

306
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,799
A year ago, it was clear that Mr. Liu
had a deficit in officialdom.

307
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,519
They wanted to treat our He family
like a cash cow

308
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,599
and proposed a marriage alliance.

309
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,680
But what about them?

310
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,839
On the one hand, they ask you for money.

311
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,519
On the other hand, they find fault everywhere.

312
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,599
Liu Chang, even more so, time and time again

313
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,839
comes to humiliate you.

314
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
And there's this Women's Precepts.

315
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,279
They even want us to hang it up,

316
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,799
<i>[Women's Precepts]</i>
intending to discipline you.

317
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,119
This is simply outrageous.

318
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,079
Back then, my mother was gravely ill.

319
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,880
Only the imperial gifted Zixi pills
from the Liu family

320
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
could provide a glimmer of hope.

321
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,799
At that time,

322
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,200
<i>[Women's Precepts]</i>
no matter what demands were made,

323
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,279
I would agree.

324
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,319
But that tribute medicine was nothing
but an empty reputation.

325
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,640
Your mother nevertheless did not last long.

326
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,960
Life is unpredictable.

327
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,839
We can't blame others.

328
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,240
The Liu Mansion is a pit of fire.

329
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,279
Your mother was not saved

330
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,480
and your entire life was gambled away.

331
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,920
Yulu,

332
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,440
the Liu family kept their promise

333
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,839
and produced the tribute medicine.

334
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,599
How could we break our promise?

335
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,079
Rest assured.

336
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm not that fragile.

337
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,799
It's just cold treatment and disdain.

338
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,000
I can bear it.

339
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,799
Alright, let's set off.

340
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,216
Hurry on.

341
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:07,168
<i>[Fuyun Temple]</i>

342
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,960
Madam, please remember

343
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,680
to kneel for five hours.

344
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,279
Pray sincerely for blessings.

345
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,039
Burn incense and pray in silence.

346
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,759
Do not rise before the hour of You.

347
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
Now is the hour of Chen.

348
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,359
You may begin now.

349
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,640
I will wait outside the hall.

350
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,559
Please be assured, Madam.

351
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,680
Immortals above,

352
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,240
I've come to disturb again.

353
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,079
May sincerity move the heavens.

354
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,400
I hope my mother

355
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,799
can rest in peace in heaven

356
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,599
and will no longer suffer
from illness and pain.

357
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,720
My lady, Xiangfu has fallen asleep.

358
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,759
You can relax a bit now.

359
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,496
Are you alright?

360
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,319
Quick, money.

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,279
- Help me up.
- Okay.

362
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,960
Come on, slow down.

363
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,600
Slow down.

364
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,240
Yulu, help me keep an eye on it.

365
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,680
- Okay.
- I'll go ahead.

366
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,359
Exhausted, aren't you?

367
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,000
- Have some water.
- Thank you, Mr. Lin.

368
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,559
Drink slowly.

369
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,720
No rush.

370
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,799
Come on, have some dates.

371
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,839
I am truly exhausted today.

372
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,799
Thank goodness I could come to your place

373
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,119
to have a bowl of water and rest for a bit.

374
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,200
Among the gentlemen and their female companions

375
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,119
coming to the temple to pray for blessings,

376
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,559
only your husband's family

377
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,519
has extremely demanding requirements.

378
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,160
You've been kneeling for such a long time

379
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,599
and they don't even let you eat or drink.

380
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,200
Isn't this torture?

381
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,519
The Liu family head

382
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,079
heeds every word of the itinerant sorcerers,

383
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,160
insisting on making me kneel for five hours.

384
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,799
Otherwise, it cannot attain protection
for the Liu Mansion.

385
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,680
Madam, marrying into the Liu Mansion,

386
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,480
you have indeed suffered.

387
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,119
Back when you were at the He family,

388
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,799
in your own shop,

389
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,240
everyone would take care of you.

390
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,680
But now

391
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,599
you've become more haggard by the day.

392
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,000
If Mr. He knew it,

393
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,880
he would surely be extremely heartbroken.

394
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Now, my father's shop

395
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,759
has closed down another branch.

396
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,599
He's already distressed and upset.

397
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,680
I

398
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,000
don't want to worry him further.

399
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,240
Let's not talk about this anymore.

400
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,880
This is for Jiu's medicine, please take it.

401
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,759
No.

402
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,960
You take it.

403
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,039
I can't accept

404
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,200
your money anymore.

405
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,119
You have taken care of us
for the better part of this year.

406
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,559
Jiu's illness has improved significantly.

407
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,839
I really don't know

408
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,559
how I should repay you.

409
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,880
Having just recovered from a serious illness,
she should be taken good care of.

410
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
The last few doses of medicine
must not be delayed.

411
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,400
Mr. Lin,

412
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,839
you've been my father's old partner.

413
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,559
If the He family business

414
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,799
hadn't been going poorly these years,

415
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,720
closing one shop after another,

416
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,680
you wouldn't have lost your livelihood

417
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,000
and come to work in the temple.

418
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,039
This little help is what I ought to give.

419
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,680
Take it.

420
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,880
It's for Jiu.

421
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,872
Take it.

422
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,440
On behalf of my daughter,

423
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,200
thank you.

424
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
You're welcome.

425
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,519
What's the matter, Mr. Lin?

426
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,920
You've strained your back?

427
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,079
The old ailment has flared up.

428
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,880
It's not serious.

429
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,400
Where does this flowerpot need to be delivered?
Let me help you with it.

430
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,440
No.

431
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,240
This flower is to be sent to the south side,

432
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,680
the Grand Celestial Master Hall.

433
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,839
It's not a short distance.

434
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,400
You've forgotten it.

435
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,240
Since I was little, I had been raising peonies
with my mother,

436
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
carrying flowerpots
and flower fertilizer all day.

437
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,920
This small job is nothing.

438
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,680
Besides, it's about to sunset.

439
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,279
I must rush back to the main hall.
It's on the way.

440
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,752
I'm leaving now, Mr. Lin.

441
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,119
Thank you, my lady.

442
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
Please take a rest.

443
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,880
I thought immortals all look
kind and benevolent.

444
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,960
I didn't expect the Grand Celestial Master
to be so majestic.

445
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,759
No wonder he's known for slaying villains.

446
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,079
The Liu family are all petty people,

447
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,720
bullying me all day long.

448
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,640
They even forced me to pray
for blessings for Liu Chang.

449
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,920
Since it's so,

450
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,240
I shall make a vow to you.

451
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
May my husband

452
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,440
have no paper in the latrine,

453
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,720
lose hair while combing,

454
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,799
have his concubines betray him,

455
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,559
and miss the forecasted questions
in the Imperial Exam.

456
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,759
What Yulu said is correct.

457
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,920
The Liu family

458
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,079
is simply a pit of fire.

459
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,000
Back then, when mother was gravely ill,

460
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,200
my father humbled himself

461
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
and begged for the tribute medicine.

462
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,440
We had money

463
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,720
and they had the medicine.

464
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,880
Originally, a simple business deal
could have settled it.

465
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,759
But who would have known

466
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,359
the Liu family head

467
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,599
would believe the words
of an itinerant sorcerer

468
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,880
and insist that my horoscope

469
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,680
could prosper their Liu family?

470
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,920
They forcibly had me marry into their family

471
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,680
before they gave our family
the tribute medicine.

472
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,440
They treated me like a cash cow,

473
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,720
demanding fifty percent

474
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,960
of our family store's annual earnings,

475
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,839
which made my father's business

476
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,880
deteriorate with each passing day.

477
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,759
That wasn't the end of it.

478
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,319
They also embezzled my dowry secretly

479
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,599
and confiscated Yulu's jade pendant.

480
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,039
It was outright insatiable extortion.

481
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,079
Totally shameless.

482
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,816
Who?

483
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,160
I am

484
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,680
the Grand Celestial Master descended to earth.

485
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,279
Touched by your sincerity,

486
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,000
I have come specially to help you

487
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
overcome the difficulties.

488
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,960
Since it's so,

489
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,079
how do you

490
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,839
plan to help me?

491
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,720
Audacious rogue!

492
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,799
How dare you masquerade as a deity
in the Grand Celestial Master Hall!

493
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,680
You don't believe it, do you?

494
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,640
I have calculated with a twitch of the fingers.

495
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,359
You are the daughter-in-law of the Liu family.

496
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,799
Your father-in-law is Liu Shen, the regency
official in charge of the Eastern Capital.

497
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,728
Is that so?

498
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,720
The Grand Celestial Master

499
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,519
looks very majestic.

500
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,640
With your looks,

501
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,799
are you truly a Celestial Master?

502
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,799
How can you judge a person by their appearance?

503
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,680
I have manifested

504
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,680
with the intent to lend you a helping hand.

505
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,880
Just give me a hundred rolls of silk

506
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,519
and I will grant you your wish

507
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,599
and dispel the malicious.

508
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,920
So that's how it is.

509
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,519
I should hit you for lying!

510
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,240
Swindling money without even inquiring
about the market price.

511
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,319
Hiring a hitman costs but eighty rolls only.

512
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,920
You even tried to cheat me out of my money.

513
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,000
There is only one high-ranking official
in Luoyang

514
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,759
with the surname Liu. Everybody knows him.

515
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,319
No need for you to calculate with your fingers.

516
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,039
Gently.

517
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,319
As a lady,

518
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,599
how can you be so brash?

519
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,359
A sneaky person like you
dares to call me brash!

520
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,480
Let's go, I'll take you to see the official.

521
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,440
How can a Celestial Master leave the main hall?

522
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,799
Moreover,

523
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,440
it's already sunset time.

524
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,279
Who knows, the government office
might be unattended.

525
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,599
Consider yourself lucky today.

526
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,280
Excuse the disturbance.

527
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,519
That lady…

528
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,936
She has left.

529
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,400
Sir.

530
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,480
What happened?

531
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,400
The knockout drug I bought this time

532
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,920
seems not potent enough.

533
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,119
He suddenly woke up.

534
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,720
It gave me quite a scare.

535
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,119
I think you need a lesson.

536
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,400
Handling things so unreliably.

537
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,880
You said it'd knock them out for two hours.

538
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,519
I only rested for one hour

539
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,720
when he woke up

540
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,880
and caused such a commotion,

541
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,960
nearly getting us discovered.

542
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,359
I failed to keep watch effectively

543
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,359
and accidentally let him
kick over the candelabra.

544
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,848
Please punish me.

545
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,759
They say scholars have the strength
that cannot truss a chicken.

546
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,880
I don't think that's entirely true.

547
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,400
Don't be so angry.

548
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,799
You are the ones I've gone to great lengths

549
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:38,839
to invite here as honored guests.

550
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,559
Why must you torture these scholars?

551
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,359
Because it's interesting.

552
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,200
What are your plans next?

553
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,640
Will you settle down in the temple?

554
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,119
I came here this time

555
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,359
to accompany the County Princess for leisure

556
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,400
by the order of Prince Ning.

557
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,960
The County Princess is going to the Liu Mansion

558
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,119
to meet her old lover.

559
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,359
Of course, I have to go along.

560
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,759
Looking at it now,

561
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,519
this vile person's family is very interesting.

562
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,720
To not go and meet them

563
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
would be a pity.

564
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,840
<i>[To Zishu]</i>

565
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,640
<i>Zishu,</i>

566
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,839
<i>long time no see.</i>

567
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,640
<i>I've missed you very much.</i>

568
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,920
<i>This morning, I took up my pen</i>

569
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,000
<i>with both joy and worry.</i>

570
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,960
<i>I'm glad that my husband has passed away</i>

571
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,359
<i>and I finally gained my freedom.</i>

572
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,079
<i>But I'm worried that after years of separation,</i>

573
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,839
<i>I'm unsure of where your heart lies now.</i>

574
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,279
<i>The yearning is extremely intense.</i>

575
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,000
<i>Writing cannot fully express my feelings.</i>

576
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,880
<i>Fortunately, soon I shall travel to Luoyang
to ease my mind.</i>

577
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,799
<i>I'm calmly awaiting our reunion.</i>

578
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,536
It's been three years.

579
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,640
I never thought that the two of us

580
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,720
could meet again.

581
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,272
Youzhen,

582
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,519
I wonder

583
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,839
what you look like now.

584
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,960
My lady, it's time to apply the medicine.

585
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,040
Okay.

586
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,072
Come on.

587
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,360
Another area has swollen.

588
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,840
Mrs. Liu is truly ruthless.

589
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,920
Kneeling for so long without even being
allowed to use a cushion.

590
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,320
It's not a big deal.

591
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,360
Do you know?

592
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,880
Today, when I went to send flowers
to the Grand Celestial Master Hall,

593
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,840
I took the opportunity to make a wish.

594
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,239
I wished that Liu Chang

595
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,559
may go to the toilet without paper
and lose hair while combing.

596
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,079
I don't know if the Grand Celestial Master
could manifest his spirit.

597
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,639
Liu Chang is indeed very annoying.

598
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,679
You are pressured by Mrs. Liu
to raise money for him.

599
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,960
Not only is he ungrateful to you,

600
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,159
but he also cursed you.

601
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,559
If he were truly noble,

602
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,519
he would spit out all the money given as bribes

603
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,679
by your father.

604
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,440
Annoying Liu Chang, Liu Chang is annoying.

605
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,599
Shuai, you're right.

606
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,920
Liu Chang is annoying.

607
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Shuai is the cutest.

608
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,000
Mrs. Liu wants us to smooth relations
in secret without Liu Chang knowing.

609
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,159
If he finds out,

610
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,639
I'm afraid he might take his anger out on you.

611
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,280
Why not simply tell him the whole story?

612
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,719
So what if we tell him?

613
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,639
After all, I am an outsider.

614
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,679
They, mother and son, share a bond.

615
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,960
They won't

616
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,800
fight over me.

617
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,039
But you suffer from both sides.

618
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,800
It's too much to bear.

619
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,559
You have been lively and smart
since you were little.

620
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,400
Before you were married, you managed
the household accounts orderly and efficiently.

621
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,719
Since marrying into the Liu family,

622
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,440
you've been confined to this small courtyard.

623
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,760
Every time you see members of the Liu family,

624
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,239
you can only endure insults and humiliation.

625
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,199
I've been kneeling for the whole day.

626
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,440
My legs are numb.

627
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,599
Let me stretch a little.

628
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,960
Come on, Yulu.

629
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,648
Catch it.

630
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,639
Being forgotten in this little courtyard

631
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,079
isn't all that bad.

632
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,000
No one disturbs us. It's very peaceful.

633
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,559
Besides, I have you,

634
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,679
these flowers,

635
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,960
and Shuai by my side every day.

636
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,760
When there's nothing to do,

637
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,719
I just lift weights
and practice martial arts for fun.

638
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,199
Such days aren't too hard to endure.

639
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,119
As for Liu Chang,

640
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,119
although I dislike him,

641
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,440
I can understand

642
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,840
why he treats me this way.

643
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,679
Understand? What's there
to understand about him?

644
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:11,320
He is clearly just a pretentious hypocrite.

645
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,719
Liu Chang

646
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,239
has studied hard for many years

647
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,760
all for the sake of passing the Imperial Exam
with high marks

648
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,039
to bring glory to his family.

649
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,039
This shows

650
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,280
he is an ambitious person.

651
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,679
You always say so.

652
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,280
But if he really were that good,

653
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,320
you would have fallen for him by now.

654
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Fallen for him?

655
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,199
That's impossible.

656
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,320
Praise where it's due

657
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,440
and call out what needs to be condemned.

658
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,199
Liu Chang

659
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,159
hates this transactional marriage too much.

660
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,880
It's clearly the fate of the Liu family

661
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,000
that forced him to kneel

662
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,159
and the social status

663
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,800
that broke him up with the County Princess.

664
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,199
But he

665
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,599
cannot figure these out

666
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,360
and puts all the anger, resentment,
and unwillingness

667
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,639
upon me.

668
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,400
It shows that this person

669
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,159
is extreme and depressed by nature.

670
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,239
He is unfit to be entrusted
with a lifetime commitment.

671
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,039
Therefore,

672
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,519
we each live our own lives.

673
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,880
Living in peace without issues is very good.

674
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,400
You think things through clearly.

675
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,519
In the long years to come,

676
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,920
we'll keep flowers and tease birds together,

677
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,519
enjoying tea and being merry.

678
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,159
Tea drinking is so dull.

679
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,440
Go, fetch our wine.

680
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,560
Yes.

681
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,888
Shuai.

682
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
There is nothing to do tomorrow.

683
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,119
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

684
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,264
Okay.

685
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,440
My lady.

686
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,639
My lady, something's happened!

687
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,639
My lady, quickly wake up.

688
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,760
What's the matter?

689
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Is it that Mrs. Liu has again asked me

690
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,360
to stand by the rules at the family temple

691
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,440
or is there a lack of money in the house again

692
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,599
so that we have to ask my father for it?

693
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,719
County Princess Ji'an
will visit our house tomorrow.

694
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,800
What does it have to do with me?
No need to bother with her.

695
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,239
To receive her, Mr. Liu has people

696
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,119
dig up all the peonies in our courtyard.

697
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,159
When did this happen?

698
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,079
I heard from the servants
that they came to dig last night.

699
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,159
Quick.

700
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,432
Quick.

701
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,119
How did these flowers come to this state?

702
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,880
What kind of gardeners are you?

703
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,559
Even moving flowers is too much for you.

704
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,280
If the County Princess sees this tomorrow,

705
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,639
both of your heads put together

706
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,960
will not be enough to atone for this.

707
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,320
Father.

708
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,559
Mudan, you have finally come.

709
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,480
Please help me save these flowers.

710
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,280
Father,

711
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,719
if you need flowers,

712
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:28,000
I can personally go to the flower market
and choose some for you.

713
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,280
Why did you go through the trouble
of digging up my garden's flowers overnight

714
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,519
and bring them all here?

715
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,119
These famous peonies of yours

716
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,480
are extremely precious.

717
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,920
The common stock at the flower market

718
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,079
can hardly compare to them.

719
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,840
Moreover, I heard you were drinking last night

720
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,039
and you retired early.

721
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,199
I really couldn't bear to disturb you.

722
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,119
Mudan,

723
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,559
you won't blame me, will you?

724
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
I wouldn't dare.

725
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,239
Good child, I originally

726
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,920
didn't want to trouble you
to take action personally.

727
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,000
But I didn't expect these peonies of yours

728
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,679
to be so delicate.

729
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,760
The gardeners I hired

730
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,920
simply can't take good care of them.

731
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,000
Mudan, take a look.

732
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Can they still be saved?

733
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:10,559
Mudan,

734
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,360
you must save them.

735
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
The distinguished guests visiting tomorrow

736
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,280
include not only the beloved daughter
of Prince Ning,

737
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,320
County Princess Ji'an,

738
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
and the favored court figure Jiang Changyang.

739
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,280
You may not know about it
living inside the mansion.

740
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,400
Jiang Changyang

741
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,280
is not only the Vice Minister
of the Office of Imperial Ceremonies

742
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,559
but also serves as the Floral Envoy.

743
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,840
He collects rare and exotic treasures
for the emperor

744
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,360
from all over the world.

745
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,519
If they find no flowers at the feast tomorrow,

746
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,840
it would be tantamount
to deceiving the emperor.

747
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,199
Everyone in our Liu family

748
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,440
will be implicated.

749
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,480
Father, there's no need for further words.

750
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,760
No matter who comes to the mansion tomorrow,

751
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,159
I don't care.

752
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,639
What do you mean by this?

753
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,679
These peonies were my mother's legacy to me.

754
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,760
Regardless of whether the nobles come tomorrow

755
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,159
or whether the floral banquet is held,

756
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,880
I will do my utmost to save them.

757
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,119
Alright.

758
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,480
As long as you can revive these flowers

759
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
and make tomorrow's honored guests satisfied,

760
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,480
you can choose from the rare treasures
in the mansion as you like after the banquet.

761
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,719
These peonies are my treasures.

762
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,559
As long as they are well,

763
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,360
I desire nothing else.

764
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,960
Work on them with peace of mind.

765
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,159
If you have any requests,

766
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,760
just give the order.

767
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,599
Yulu, go get

768
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,599
the stored flower fertilizer

769
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,960
and the original soil in our courtyard.

770
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,248
Yes.

771
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,159
You two, these flowers must be irrigated
with well water

772
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,800
that has been set aside for two days.

773
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,079
If there isn't enough stored water
in the courtyard,

774
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,280
you have to go outside the courtyard

775
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,639
and fetch two buckets of river water.

776
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,840
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

777
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,008
Go quickly.

778
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,360
Excuse me, Father, please step aside.

779
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:14,920
<i>♫ The Luo River cleanses the moonlight haze ♫</i>

780
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
The County Princess does not like
the taste of ginger.

781
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,119
Be sure to replace the ginseng ginger drink

782
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,599
with jasmine pearl soup.

783
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,480
It can nourish the skin
as well as relieve fatigue.

784
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,656
- Understood.
- Additionally, remember to use dew.

785
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,400
My lady, is this okay?

786
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,280
- It's fine.
- Okay.

787
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,936
Mr. Zishu,

788
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,639
Ms. Mudan is working very hard

789
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,719
for the flower banquet.

790
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,159
Her hands are full of dirt,
and she is not well-groomed.

791
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,480
A lady of an official's household
shouldn't be like that.

792
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,599
The ginseng ginger drink is already made.

793
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,760
It would be a pity to pour it away.

794
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,112
Send it to her courtyard.

795
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,192
Yes.

796
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,736
