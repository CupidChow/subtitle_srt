1
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:35,600
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:38,960
(Episode 15)

3
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,120
Alright, stop it.

4
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,381
Don't scare the young lady.

5
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,680
Old man, I wasn't the one doing the scaring first.

6
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:14,007
Before this, she could scold someone to death.

7
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:15,600
Now, she can scare them to death.

8
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:18,861
You two dead men have certainly found each other's company.

9
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,259
As soon as you hear someone coming,

10
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,520
you two scramble like monkeys into the cupboard.

11
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:25,040
Address me as your teacher.

12
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:35,760
You're not a ghost.

13
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,000
You're not dead?

14
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,341
Didn't your relationship end long ago?

15
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,240
Haven't you two been like enemies?

16
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,480
What is going on here?

17
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,400
That's right. If our relationship wasn't broken,

18
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,720
this old man wouldn't have lived to see today, would he?

19
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,120
I see.

20
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:03,280
So, the one you killed that day wasn't Lord Xu?

21
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,343
Teacher always had the public's interest at heart,

22
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:07,010
and that angered King Ning.

23
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:10,520
That night, I went to Teacher's house to discuss the matter,

24
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:13,218
but he had not returned though it was late.

25
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,960
I was worried so I went to find him.

26
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,960
I didn't expect King Ning to be so impatient.

27
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,240
Luckily, there was heavy rain that night, and the river swelled.

28
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:11,800
I used a dead row prisoner with a similar build and age to Teacher

29
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,720
to switch places.

30
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:17,400
King Ning waited all night, but the assassins never returned.

31
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,880
So, he sent his men to search for them.

32
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,920
His men found nothing.

33
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,800
All they saw was the raging river.

34
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:28,840
All the dead bodies were fished ashore the next day.

35
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:30,496
The faces were unrecognizable,

36
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,040
so the coroner confirmed the identities

37
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:35,708
based on their clothing, accessories, and teeth.

38
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,640
King Ning had what he wanted and didn't pursue the matter further.

39
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:44,120
He bought the story of assassins and bodyguards killing each other.

40
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:02,560
It happened so suddenly.

41
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,720
If Sui Zhi hadn't arrived in time and handled things carefully,

42
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm afraid my life would've ended there.

43
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:13,120
Teacher is beloved by the people and supported by the righteous scholars.

44
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:15,320
King Ning could never allow him to live.

45
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,791
I managed to save him once, but couldn't manage to save him every time.

46
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:20,360
I had no choice but to take advantage of the situation.

47
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:27,720
Why are you telling me all this confidential information?

48
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:29,978
I just tested you.

49
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:33,960
Seeing that you're quite righteous and honest, I'm giving you a way out.

50
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:36,840
Teacher pretended to be a servant here to recover from his injuries.

51
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,320
It was an emergency decision.

52
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:40,960
But whether at the Jiang Residence or at Huanyun Pavilion,

53
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,920
there are too many high-ranking officials coming around.

54
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,441
Sooner or later, he will be exposed.

55
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:47,427
I understand.

56
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:54,120
Lord Xu, if you don't mind, how about moving into my shop?

57
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:58,720
The West Market is mostly common folk, rarely any nobles.

58
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:01,560
I can arrange a private room for you,

59
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,320
hidden from prying eyes in the city.

60
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,200
As long as you're careful, no one will notice.

61
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:09,280
That sounds good.

62
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:12,554
If I have to share the same roof with this brat,

63
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:15,760
even if I don't get killed, I'll die of frustration eventually.

64
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,960
As for me, I certainly won't take advantage of your hospitality.

65
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:23,000
I've got some modest expertise in accounting.

66
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:26,560
How about I serve as your bookkeeper?

67
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,804
I can't possibly accept that.

68
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:29,909
This...

69
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:33,360
How could the dean of the Imperial Academy be my bookkeeper?

70
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:36,960
If I make a wrong calculation, you can always collect the money from him.

71
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,800
Without you, she still asked me for money all the time.

72
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:44,560
With you around, she could clean out the entire Jiang Residence.

73
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:50,600
In that case, Lord Xu, please come with me.

74
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:52,307
Wait.

75
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:54,811
Chuan Yu.

76
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:09,680
This contains the medicinal powder for his foot bath,

77
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,929
as well as the tea he drinks every morning.

78
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:14,040
Come and collect them again when it's finished.

79
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,440
How considerate.

80
00:07:16,747 --> 00:07:19,080
This old man still has his uses.

81
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,040
Your life is tied to mine now.

82
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:23,920
Take good care of him.

83
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:25,920
If you let him get hurt or fall ill,

84
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:29,240
I'll make sure I get my due on your life, with interest.

85
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:32,121
Lord Jiang, please don't worry.

86
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,560
I value my life above all else.

87
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:41,960
By the way, Lord Xu, Li Xing is my cousin and also your student.

88
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,960
He was heartbroken when you passed.

89
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:49,177
Now that you're alive and well, could I send him a word?

90
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,420
No.

91
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:54,120
Li Xing is sincere, but he's simple, and he doesn't know how to lie.

92
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:59,520
If he finds out and slips up, I'll have another soul to avenge.

93
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:01,600
Stop scaring her.

94
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:04,800
If you keep frightening her, I might have to silence you too.

95
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,361
Some things are too dangerous.

96
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,080
For Li Xing's safety,

97
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,640
it's best not to tell him.

98
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,300
Understood.

99
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:20,200
Give me hay.

100
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:26,640
Be careful.

101
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,000
Alright.

102
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,920
Here, have some water.

103
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,320
Thank you, Sheng Yi.

104
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:38,200
A while ago, you mentioned that being dependent on others was inconvenient.

105
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,840
How is it that in the blink of an eye, you've built a pavilion?

106
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,800
Not moving anymore?

107
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,560
Moving is too troublesome.

108
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:49,800
It's better to make this place more comfortable and settle in.

109
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:53,080
With this pavilion, we'll have a nice spot to relax.

110
00:08:56,797 --> 00:09:01,480
Mu Dan, why did you suddenly bring back a bookkeeper

111
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,600
and set him up in the shop and forbid anyone to disturb him?

112
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:09,600
Did I make a mistake with the accounts earlier, and you're upset?

113
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:11,000
Not at all.

114
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,362
I just noticed you've been so busy lately

115
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,080
and wanted to find someone to help you.

116
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:18,040
Lord Xu is skilled in abacus calculation.

117
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:20,920
I paid a high price to bring him from a neighboring shop.

118
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:25,800
I kept his presence low to avoid trouble with the original owner.

119
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,760
Once he sorts out the accounts and stabilizes things,

120
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:31,520
we'll be able to focus on other matters.

121
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:35,400
But I still need you to deal with people and handle the flower business.

122
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,460
Okay.

123
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:45,480
With the Emperor's teacher's wishes and the Ministry of Rites' support,

124
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:47,772
we've finally revitalized the imperial examination system.

125
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,761
Although we can't fully apply a meritocratic approach,

126
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:51,080
at least we've shifted the ratio of

127
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,800
commoners to nobility entering the service from three to seven.

128
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:57,520
Now, students from humble backgrounds have hope.

129
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:02,920
I've supported many poor students in Luoyang,

130
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:06,080
and now they are studying diligently at Fuyun Temple.

131
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,800
After hearing this news, everyone is filled with great ambition.

132
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:12,064
What happened to the Qingzheng Society who assassinated corrupt officials?

133
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,040
They have been subdued and reformed by me.

134
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,880
In the future, they will rescue students oppressed

135
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,480
by the aristocracy in various places.

136
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:23,480
Lord Xu's faked death was a desperate measure.

137
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,840
Although the scholarly officials have lost their support,

138
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:30,040
they are able to use the reformation to restructure political landscape.

139
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:33,760
When the time is right, Lord Xu will reveal himself,

140
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,480
and it will be irrefutable proof of King Ning's cruelty.

141
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:41,280
Sui Zhi, you have skillfully maneuvered

142
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,240
to turn a losing situation into a winning one.

143
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:45,480
Unfortunately, as you are working with the dangerous forces,

144
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,972
you are viewed as one of them.

145
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,480
I feel sorry for you.

146
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,640
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

147
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:53,152
The insults from the students of the Imperial Academy

148
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:55,139
and the mocking poems from Li Xing don't bother me.

149
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:57,720
I find it amusing.

150
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,160
Being a corrupt official hated by the world

151
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:04,040
is much more enjoyable than living a miserable, hard life.

152
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,623
Besides,

153
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:09,040
the corruption and bribery of King Ning's faction is no secret to me.

154
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,680
When the time comes to account for the evidence,

155
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,222
I won't need to search far.

156
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,680
Sui Zhi, you have an open heart.

157
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:18,800
You're willing to sacrifice reputation for the greater good,

158
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:22,016
this kind of vision is beyond our reach.

159
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:27,040
Re-examining the selection of officials

160
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,280
may remove some corrupt bureaucrats,

161
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:32,343
but it won't hurt King Ning's foundation.

162
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,282
Vice Minister Cui who was impeached

163
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:37,953
was actually one of King Ning's spies in the Ministry of Personnel,

164
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:40,816
helping him control the appointment and dismissal of officials.

165
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:44,434
He has inextricable connections with various noble clans.

166
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,242
But he refuses to name his backers.

167
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:52,410
Although he's been exiled, no significant uproar has followed.

168
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:54,162
What a pity.

169
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,520
Not at all.

170
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,418
The Ministry of Justice follows the law,

171
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:00,840
and King Ning has his men watching,

172
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,640
so nothing will come of it.

173
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:06,354
But things will be different at Jiang Residence.

174
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,880
Hurry up, everyone, keep up.

175
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,024
Keep up.

176
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,120
Keep up!

177
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:20,523
Hurry up!

178
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:24,091
Hurry up!

179
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,520
- What are you doing? - Sir.

180
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,360
I suddenly have severe stomach pains.

181
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:33,280
The inn is still far away.

182
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:37,497
Could you please let me relieve myself?

183
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:39,040
You go with him.

184
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:41,075
Don't try anything funny.

185
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:44,120
Everyone else, squat down. All of you, squat.

186
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,340
Hurry up!

187
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:48,760
Right here's fine.

188
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,360
Don't play tricks on me.

189
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:51,651
Hurry up.

190
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:17,560
Is it done yet?

191
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,800
Hurry, we're on the move.

192
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:37,240
If you are not afraid of death, just keep running.

193
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:40,200
We'll see whether you can outrun me or my sword.

194
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:43,640
Sir.

195
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:45,480
I don't know if you're an enemy or a friend.

196
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:50,200
I have a lot of money. If you help me, I'll give it all to you.

197
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:53,960
Coincidentally, your father has no shortage of money.

198
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:21,760
Many customers settle their bills on credit at Blooming Abode.

199
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:24,760
To prevent defaulters and losses,

200
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:28,400
why don't you require old customers who spend over 100 strings of coin

201
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:30,444
to leave their family stamps

202
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:33,160
and sign for verification before they can put their purchases on credit?

203
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,080
We can settle the accounts at the end of the month.

204
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,280
Lord Xu, you have a great point.

205
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:41,080
But Lord Xu, you are the dean of the Imperial Academy

206
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,720
and also the teacher of Lord Jiang and my cousin.

207
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,320
You came here just to avoid trouble.

208
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:48,120
You don't have to do this.

209
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,800
It is to see the big picture from small details.

210
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,720
You think I'm just looking at the accounts of a flower shop?

211
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,760
No.

212
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,320
Only when the people are settled and prosperous will they spend money

213
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,080
on flowers and perfumes.

214
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm looking at the livelihoods and taxes of the people.

215
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm enlightened.

216
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,484
The house is a bit small,

217
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,927
the direction isn't ideal,

218
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,240
and the decoration is passable at best.

219
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:26,840
It really is a bit of an inconvenience for Teacher.

220
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,680
Since opening the store,

221
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,801
this is the first time Lord Jiang has personally come to inspect it.

222
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:36,120
Are you afraid that I will neglect Lord Xu, or are you here to find fault?

223
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:39,200
If the partner doesn't come to visit you, it's a sign of trust in you.

224
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,120
Since you're being ungrateful,

225
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm afraid you won't want to accept the gift I've prepared for today.

226
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:45,720
Chuan Yu, let's go.

227
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:48,720
Lord Jiang, you are noble and magnanimous.

228
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:51,480
How could I not welcome you?

229
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:56,248
You didn't have to go to such expense.

230
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:00,560
Such an exquisite scroll.

231
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:02,968
Who is the calligrapher behind it?

232
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,600
Mu Dan

233
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,200
is of

234
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:15,680
no use?

235
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:21,120
The four characters here flow like clouds, smooth and seamless.

236
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:24,480
It really does resemble the style of the great Zhang Zhi.

237
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,160
You flatter me, Teacher.

238
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:28,680
Mu Dan has been off the market.

239
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:31,320
Lord Jiang, you're a bit late in his gift-giving.

240
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:33,880
Isn't there just a Mu Dan standing in front of me?

241
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:36,320
Quickly hang it up prominently in the store,

242
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,868
so you can constantly remind yourself to be grateful

243
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:41,200
and never forget the kindness of your partner.

244
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:45,240
Are you insulting me or trying to cause trouble?

245
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:47,866
This is a genuine masterpiece from a famous calligrapher.

246
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,360
Just earlier, you were so thrilled to acquire it.

247
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,354
My young master is a master of cursive calligraphy.

248
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:53,640
Plenty of scholars will knock on our door,

249
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,880
offering huge sums for a piece of his work.

250
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,840
This is priceless treasure.

251
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,903
Miss He, you must cherish it.

252
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,920
Don't like it?

253
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:03,760
Fine, I'll take it.

254
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:07,000
I won't give it to you. Since it's a gift,

255
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:10,200
even if I have to sell it for money, I won't return it.

256
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,160
Since you've accepted it, you should appreciate it.

257
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:15,138
May your business flourish and your profits steady,

258
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:18,000
but more importantly, take good care of Teacher.

259
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,140
Goodbye.

260
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,640
Lord Xu, look at him.

261
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:35,810
Every time I think Lackey Jiang still has a bit of a conscience,

262
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:39,080
he does something that makes me want to draw my sword and fight him.

263
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:40,906
This student of yours

264
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,329
is like a face-changing actor from Sichuan opera—

265
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,640
his nature keeps shifting, layer after layer.

266
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:49,148
Is he good or evil? Loyal or treacherous?

267
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:52,080
Is he a demon or a heart of stone?

268
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:55,697
He's willing to bear the reputation of a villain

269
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,840
and take no offense,

270
00:17:58,134 --> 00:17:59,960
instead finding pleasure in it.

271
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:03,320
What kind of person is that?

272
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:06,840
A despicable one.

273
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,360
Take care. Welcome again next time.

274
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,400
- Okay. - Come in and take a look.

275
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:15,894
- You bought it in our store last time, right? - Yes.

276
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:18,000
Come and have a look at the new items. Come, come.

277
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:21,347
She's resolved the issue of restricted fertilizer

278
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:23,760
and hired unemployed farmers to do fertilizer work.

279
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:27,160
Now, the fertilizer she's selling can not only supply her own needs

280
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:30,279
but can also be sold outside at a lower price than others.

281
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:33,840
The Flower Association's fertilizer sales dropped nearly 20% because of it.

282
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:37,600
She's clearly set on competing with the Flower Association.

283
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:41,067
Alright.

284
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:46,240
Since she doesn't know when to stop, I won't hold back.

285
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Come here.

286
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:57,118
This is a good idea, but should we report it to Leader Lv?

287
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:59,746
Such small matters don't deserve troubling Leader Lv.

288
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,800
Just do as I say.

289
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:03,018
Yes.

290
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:27,160
There are no festivals recently.

291
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:29,480
Why is Jiang Residence so lively?

292
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:34,360
There's a big performance in the backyard.

293
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:35,945
I hope they won't ruin our flowers.

294
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:37,280
Let me go check.

295
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:17,440
I, Jiang Yuan Tang, have long admired your talents in poetry and painting.

296
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:20,080
Despite having met only three times,

297
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,600
you've captured my heart entirely.

298
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:27,680
I desire to be with no one else.

299
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:31,410
I must be bold and ask for your hand in marriage.

300
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:35,128
If I could marry you as my wife,

301
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:38,160
I will send away all the female servants in my house

302
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:42,600
and will never take a concubine.

303
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:45,409
I only want to stay by your side

304
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,200
as we grow old together.

305
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,016
Jiang, as a noble son of prestigious family,

306
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:56,360
if you only have a wife, you won't have a healthy line of descendants.

307
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:59,080
You will be criticized.

308
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,032
Even though there are many beautiful women in the world,

309
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:06,440
but my heart belongs only to one person.

310
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:09,480
If I don't have you by my side...

311
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:10,920
Chuan Yu.

312
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,560
Who is this Jiang Yuan Tang?

313
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:16,160
He's Young Master's father.

314
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,640
Madam's death anniversary is coming soon,

315
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,320
and this man is eager to win favor.

316
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:27,160
I didn't expect Jiang Chang Yang's father to be so devoted.

317
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:31,160
In common wealthy families, men always have concubines.

318
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,240
The Jiang family has served as officials for generations,

319
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,440
yet he managed to keep his household free of concubines.

320
00:21:35,722 --> 00:21:36,722
It's truly rare.

321
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:40,303
He married Feng Ruo Xin. Their love was deep and enduring.

322
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:43,920
Throughout her life, there was no other woman in the Jiang Residence.

323
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:48,600
Even after her death, Jiang Yuan Tang never remarried.

324
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:53,760
Their love story was renowned throughout the land and admired by many.

325
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,171
Quick.

326
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:13,811
Lord Jiang.

327
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:16,345
Madam Feng's 50th death anniversary is approaching.

328
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:19,906
I know Madam Feng's love for puppet shows,

329
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:25,000
so I specially wrote a play about your parents' love story

330
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:26,839
and hired a troupe to perform it.

331
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:30,177
I hope it will ease your grief for her.

332
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,200
What a good story. What a fine performance.

333
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:36,793
Reward them.

334
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:39,640
The musicians and performers each receive 50 strings of coin.

335
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:41,890
Thank you, Lord Jiang.

336
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,048
You've presented such a wonderful play.

337
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,383
How can I thank you?

338
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,440
I only wish to serve as an official in Chang'an.

339
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:56,360
I will always be at your command.

340
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:01,836
This...

341
00:23:02,937 --> 00:23:04,025
Chuan Yu.

342
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,800
Draft a document for me to send to the Ministry of Personnel.

343
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:09,440
This person is guilty of bribery and corruption, harming the local people.

344
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,202
Exile him to the northwest to feed the horses.

345
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,039
- Yes, My Lord. - Lord Jiang, where have I offended you?

346
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,680
Please, show mercy!

347
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:18,649
Lord Jiang, I meant well! Please show mercy!

348
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,280
Please, show mercy!

349
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,802
- Lord Jiang. - My young master has shown mercy.

350
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:24,168
If you continue to make a scene,

351
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,040
I'll make sure you never walk out of here alive.

352
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:27,241
Walk.

353
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:29,254
Lord Jiang.

354
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:50,480
This puppet is made with great care.

355
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,040
It does resemble you a bit , Mother.

356
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,680
If you were here today,

357
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:05,640
you'd surely be furious.

358
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:12,896
But it's alright.

359
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:20,482
At least I will always remember you.

360
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:23,240
If you miss me too,

361
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,311
come to my dreams more often

362
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:29,680
to visit me.

363
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,880
What's that smell?

364
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:56,148
Come here.

365
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:05,800
I find it strange.

366
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:09,560
The Jiang Residence has always had the scent of money and incense.

367
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,680
When did it start smelling like grilled meat from a street vendor?

368
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:17,280
I think Jiang Residence lacks a bit of warmth.

369
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:20,191
I originally planned to call you after finishing the grilling,

370
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:23,440
but your nose is so sharp, you followed the scent.

371
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,320
Sit down and have some.

372
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,520
If it tastes good, you don't have to reward me.

373
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:34,160
If it's bad, don't send me to feed horses in the northwest.

374
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm worried you'll end up selling those horses.

375
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:41,400
This stool is too hard.

376
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:42,933
Chuan Yu,

377
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,600
go get a soft cushion.

378
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:45,869
Yes.

379
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,250
Sit.

380
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:53,547
Here.

381
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:07,720
Is it because your mother's memorial is coming soon

382
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:11,760
that you're feeling upset? Do you miss her?

383
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:20,800
People say my parents were deeply in love, that their bond was fated.

384
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:23,920
But only I know that

385
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:27,200
what they call a romantic story is actually a joke.

386
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:31,299
That so-called loyal and devoted face

387
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,761
is what ruined my mother's life.

388
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:43,840
So, the flattery from that little official was all empty.

389
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:49,880
The story of your father's unwavering loyalty

390
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:51,880
was a lie?

391
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,960
Maybe it was true at first.

392
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:57,200
When I was young,

393
00:27:57,695 --> 00:27:59,160
my mother played the zither and wrote poetry,

394
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:01,880
while my father played the flute and painted. They were so affectionate.

395
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:06,400
But later,

396
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:09,329
our family moved to Chang'an,

397
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:12,113
and he was tempted by other women.

398
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,840
He fell in love with someone else.

399
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:23,945
Everyone knows your father never took a concubine.

400
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:27,320
Of course, he wouldn't dare break his vow.

401
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,226
Instead, he kept that woman as his wife in a separate house

402
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:32,806
and never returned home.

403
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:35,361
After my mother died of illness,

404
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:38,226
he couldn't wait to marry her.

405
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:40,379
I had to threaten to end my own life

406
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,240
just to preserve his reputation of loyalty and devotion.

407
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:46,600
And now,

408
00:28:47,598 --> 00:28:49,398
with everything settled in the dust,

409
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:51,920
he has it immortalized in a play?

410
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:54,760
Isn't it ridiculous?

411
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:07,800
So, when you told King Ning you'd never marry in this lifetime,

412
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:09,909
you meant it?

413
00:29:10,804 --> 00:29:12,840
Love is fleeting like floating clouds.

414
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,320
For men, their fickleness is excused as human nature,

415
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:19,800
but for women, it ruins their entire lives.

416
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:21,800
Why harm others and yourself?

417
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:29,720
When I helped you with your divorce, I thought of my mother.

418
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:33,240
I wish she could have let go of her obsession

419
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,887
and left gracefully, just like you.

420
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:41,320
Then, maybe she wouldn't have died heartbroken.

421
00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:46,760
Perhaps I'm just someone

422
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:49,880
who cannot love others more than I love myself.

423
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:53,760
Instead of being trapped in a household for a lifetime,

424
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:56,600
appeasing a husband against my will,

425
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,880
competing with concubines,

426
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,800
enduring in-laws' lectures,

427
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:03,640
I'd rather remain unmarried for the rest of my life

428
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,160
and live a carefree life by myself.

429
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:10,240
Though you divorced, you're still young.

430
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:12,800
It's very difficult for a woman to live alone.

431
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:16,240
As time goes by, you'll forget the pain of the past

432
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,200
and regret what you said today.

433
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,280
You'll want a family to rely on.

434
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,720
Home is where the heart is.

435
00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:29,560
Now I have a peaceful home,

436
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:31,880
and I'm very happy.

437
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:37,520
That's not fair. You're only a few years older than me.

438
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:41,440
Why does your vow count and mine doesn't?

439
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,817
With beautiful women around you all the time,

440
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm afraid your vow is more likely to be broken.

441
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:47,840
Care to place a bet on that?

442
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,640
Fine, let's bet.

443
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:52,520
But the stakes must be high enough to make you bankrupt

444
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,231
to make it worth my while.

445
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:56,960
Let's bet 100,000 strings of coin.

446
00:30:57,949 --> 00:31:00,509
We'll see if your residence's coffers are emptied

447
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:02,670
or if Blooming Abode will go bankrupt.

448
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:05,760
Let's put this in writing. No going back on your word.

449
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,356
This is the first time I've seen someone

450
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:08,801
so enthusiastic about giving away money.

451
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,292
I'll play along.

452
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,000
Wait, let me get a brush and ink.

453
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:13,321
No need.

454
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,480
I want to see how you'll sign your name.

455
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:36,626
Just sign it like this.

456
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,720
The fire's gone out.

457
00:32:43,413 --> 00:32:44,920
It's all burnt.

458
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,240
You are a grown man, but you are afraid of fire?

459
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:06,680
And you dare say it's not easy for us women to live alone?

460
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:11,040
Well, today I'll show you a fire-breathing trick.

461
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:12,999
Show me how brave Lord Jiang really is.

462
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:14,635
Jiang Xiao Hua, don't push your luck.

463
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,520
You're always bullying me, but I can't bully you back?

464
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,400
Fortunately, you didn't squash my flowers.

465
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,980
Is that so?

466
00:33:31,797 --> 00:33:33,240
Where are your tongs?

467
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:37,200
Oh no, my Moutan peony! Please don't catch fire.

468
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,960
Where are the tongs?

469
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,880
Where are the tongs?

470
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:07,200
Moutan peony is truly extraordinary.

471
00:34:08,276 --> 00:34:12,177
It's like a blazing fire, yet soft and gentle.

472
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,520
Didn't you say peonies were useless?

473
00:34:17,108 --> 00:34:19,920
This isn't a peony. It's a herbaceous peony.

474
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,520
And it's specifically chosen by my third brother.

475
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:26,280
You know your flowers well.

476
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:31,160
Seeing as the Moutan peony bloomed today,

477
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:32,640
let's drink wine to celebrate it.

478
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:43,587
Come.

479
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:47,120
It's chilly at night. Put this on.

480
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:50,202
What an ugly thing.

481
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:51,600
I don't want it.

482
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:53,508
It's embroidered with gold thread.

483
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,520
Your favorite Gold Nugget.

484
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:58,071
Gold Nugget?

485
00:35:00,587 --> 00:35:02,320
I love it.

486
00:36:18,908 --> 00:36:20,120
Who are you?

487
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:24,452
Aunt?

488
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:32,080
Tie Young Master up.

489
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:33,440
Yes.

490
00:36:38,474 --> 00:36:39,594
Be on your knees.

491
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:45,257
(I never thought I'd see the day my dreams came true.)

492
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:47,960
Stop moving.

493
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:50,456
If Ruo Xin knew you were lying drunk in a flowerbed

494
00:36:50,537 --> 00:36:52,520
with a woman in broad daylight,

495
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:54,290
she'd probably rise from her grave in fury.

496
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:55,734
You deserve a slap for that!

497
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,400
Aunt, I've told you 10,000 times.

498
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:03,477
We were just admiring the flowers. We were drunk and fell asleep.

499
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:05,320
Nothing happened.

500
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,880
She's just the gardener who tends to our gardens.

501
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:17,011
The flowers in the garden are thriving this year.

502
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:18,640
You've done a fine job.

503
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:22,480
Thank you for your compliment, Madam Feng.

504
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,960
I want both the flowers and my niece-in-law.

505
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:31,680
How old are you now?

506
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,350
If you don't get married this year,

507
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:35,464
I'll beat you on behalf of your late mother.

508
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,017
No matter what,

509
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:45,800
you've ruined this young lady's reputation.

510
00:37:47,284 --> 00:37:49,400
You have to take responsibility.

511
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:51,450
You'll have the engagement today

512
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:53,200
and get married on the eighth of next month.

513
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:55,200
It's a very auspicious day.

514
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,872
You've got it wrong. I have no romantic feelings for your nephew.

515
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:01,720
We're purely business partners.

516
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,692
Don't worry,

517
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:06,800
I'll give you 1,000 gold and 100 properties as betrothal gifts.

518
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:10,240
I won't let him mistreat you financially.

519
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:12,160
That's not what I mean. I...

520
00:38:12,364 --> 00:38:14,480
Aunt, you always know my heart.

521
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:18,040
I've admired Mu Dan for so long. I won't marry anyone else.

522
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:19,880
No.

523
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:22,000
Where are you putting your hands?

524
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:24,080
He is just my creditor.

525
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:27,040
If you think you have too much money, you can give me a cut of your share.

526
00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:29,304
I'm willing to be just a drinking buddy.

527
00:38:29,485 --> 00:38:31,482
But just a drinking buddy, nothing more.

528
00:38:31,604 --> 00:38:34,360
Don't even think about marrying me.

529
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:36,857
See, it's not that I don't want to marry her.

530
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,080
She doesn't fancy me.

531
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:41,720
I pour my affection into gold and silver,

532
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:44,160
yet I can't unlock Mu Dan's heart.

533
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,864
That's not what you...

534
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:47,987
Mu Dan.

535
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:50,880
I can lower my share or offer concessions,

536
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,200
can you give me a chance?

537
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:07,320
Fine.

538
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,800
You filthy pervert, you still want to take advantage of me?

539
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,960
I'll tell you, if you keep bothering me, I'll...

540
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:17,760
I'll hang myself in front of your Jiang Residence.

541
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:21,674
Mu Dan.

542
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:26,520
If I can't be with the woman I love, I'd rather never marry.

543
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:30,720
It seems I'm destined to be lonely for the rest of my life.

544
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:36,120
She's a merchant, but she never betrays her heart for money.

545
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:38,720
What a good lady.

546
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:44,233
After all these years, I've finally met someone who dares to hit you.

547
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:48,560
Don't worry, I'm set on

548
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,939
this niece-in-law.

549
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:53,600
No, Aunt.

550
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:02,465
(My young master said we can change the contract to a 70-30 split,)

551
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:04,240
(but Madam Feng is not easy to fool.)

552
00:40:04,356 --> 00:40:06,857
(Since we've agreed to play this game, you must reject her firmly.)

553
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:09,073
(You can't give Madam Feng any chance.)

554
00:40:11,668 --> 00:40:13,000
Madam Feng.

555
00:40:13,364 --> 00:40:15,184
no matter how much jewelry you give me,

556
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,600
I will never agree to this marriage.

557
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:19,305
Please give up on this idea.

558
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:21,160
Mu Dan, don't misunderstand.

559
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:26,529
These gifts are to apologize for my nephew's frivolous and rude behavior.

560
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,402
Whether you like him or not, you should accept these gifts.

561
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:35,640
I spent the night in a garden with Jiang Chang Yang.

562
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:37,690
If other madams saw me,

563
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:41,240
they would definitely scold me for being promiscuous and frivolous.

564
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:45,080
Moreover, I slapped him in front of you.

565
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:48,265
Don't you think I'm greedy and vicious?

566
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:54,437
If anyone should be scolded for impropriety and promiscuous, it's the man.

567
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:57,080
Why scold the woman?

568
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:59,800
My nephew is indeed reckless.

569
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:02,609
You did well to reprimand him.

570
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:06,040
As for being greedy, you're a merchant.

571
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,080
Making a profit is your nature.

572
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:09,960
What's wrong with that?

573
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:15,160
I didn't expect Jiang Chang Yang to have such a reasonable aunt.

574
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,560
My husband passed away when I was only 18 years old.

575
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:21,920
I never remarried.

576
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:26,080
Over the years, I've owned a fleet of ships and traded far and wide.

577
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:27,680
I've even traveled to foreign lands.

578
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:29,754
I've heard all manner of gossip.

579
00:41:31,373 --> 00:41:33,640
Without the ability to distinguish truth from falsehood

580
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:35,640
and the courage to defy societal norms,

581
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:37,520
how would I have survived until now?

582
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:41,440
Life for women is tough.

583
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:44,073
We should support and understand each other.
