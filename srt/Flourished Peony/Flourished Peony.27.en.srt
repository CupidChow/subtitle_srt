00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:36,184
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,011
(Episode 27)

3
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,700
Mu Dan works well with you

4
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,500
like she has known you for many years.

5
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,200
She has helped us so much.

6
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,981
Did you help me thank her?

7
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,461
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,181
It's all thanks to my perfect plan.

9
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,780
Someone like her

10
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,679
will rather accept a piece of gold

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,261
than a word of thanks.

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,780
She is discreet and clever.

13
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,860
Even Teacher speaks highly of her.

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,300
Her status as a merchant allows her to act more freely

15
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,239
and inconspicuously than either of us.

16
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,039
- Sui Zhi, have you ever considered... - Absolutely not!

17
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
Do you care for her so much that you can't bear to let her take risks?

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,860
She and I have no real connection.

19
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,381
Why should I drag

20
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,740
an innocent person into danger?

21
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,501
What happened to Princess Shouchang

22
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
was an accident.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It wasn't your fault.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,280
If I hadn't insisted on taking His Majesty to Mengzhou back then,

25
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,420
Princess Shouchang

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,160
wouldn't have met such a tragic fate.

27
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,239
When I entered the palace as a child, I had no one to rely on.

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,800
Her Highness treated me with the utmost kindness and affection,

29
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,460
like an elder sister.

30
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,599
And yet,

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,599
I couldn't even protect my family.

32
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,959
I think this clove-scented one smells lovely.

33
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,341
- Yes. - Ladies, how are you finding these cosmetics?

34
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,480
If you notice anything lacking,

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,920
please don't hesitate to speak up.

36
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,561
This face cream is wonderfully moisturizing,

37
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,981
but the fragrance is a little strong for me.

38
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,679
I prefer something more subtle.

39
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,759
Got it.

40
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,536
I, on the other hand, like stronger scents.

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,300
This one smells just right.

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
So you like this one?

43
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,300
Physician Chun,

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,860
am I suffering from an incurable disease?

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,720
The pulses of the ten people I just checked,

46
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,456
five have weak pulses and cold constitutions,

47
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,136
three are deficient in vital energy and blood,

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,500
and one has liver qi stagnation.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,400
If you keep focusing only on appearances and neglect your health,

50
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,440
you'll be plagued by illnesses when you're older.

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Is it that serious?

52
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,199
Dr. Geng Chun is just trying to scare you

53
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,840
into taking better care of yourselves.

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Isn't that right?

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,359
- But... - But you've given me an idea.

56
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,879
Perhaps we can develop some nourishing pills and tonics

57
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,119
to help strengthen your health.

58
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,199
What do you think?

59
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,279
That's a great idea.

60
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,341
Is there anything else we can do better?

61
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,420
I think this one is just perfect.

62
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
You like this one? Noted.

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,860
I think it could use a few more color options.

64
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,581
That's a great suggestion. More colors.

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,300
The way you talk

66
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,180
could scare even a healthy person into thinking they're sick.

67
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,060
But everything I said is true.

68
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,461
How is beauty more important than health?

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,940
Next time, I'll bring more hangover remedies and liver-protection pills.

70
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,380
Yes, yes, Physician Chun, you are right.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,976
But the women in the pavilion work to make a living,

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,255
their work schedule is irregular,

73
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,959
and it's their job to drink and entertain.

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
During the millet incident,

75
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,180
your tonics helped many people.

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,461
It's about time we move forward with setting up a shop for you.

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,820
But am I really up to it?

78
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,439
Selling health tonics and remedies,

79
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,119
providing a place for women who can't seek medical care elsewhere,

80
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,101
hasn't that always been your dream?

81
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,380
Besides, opening a shop gives me another source of income.

82
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,341
It benefits everyone, so why not?

83
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,020
The only problem is that you've kept your work

84
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:56,940
as a physician hidden from your family.

85
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,620
Opening a shop

86
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,820
might risk exposing that.

87
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,839
That's not a problem.

88
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,060
My father's been busy supervising construction at his new garden.

89
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,239
He's so caught up in it that he doesn't have time to pay attention to me.

90
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,079
If that's the case,

91
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,820
everything is ready.

92
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,701
Now it's just up to you to decide.

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Alright.

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I'll focus on developing health remedies

95
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,815
and work with you to get this shop up and running as soon as possible.

96
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,839
Perfect.

97
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Sorry about that.

98
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
What's wrong?

99
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,360
Nothing. You should go without me.

100
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,221
I have to talk to Miss Yun about something.

101
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,839
Miss Yun.

102
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,680
Mu Dan? I thought you had left?

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,341
Have you seen those guests before?

104
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,480
It's the first time I've seen them.

105
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,060
I just ran into them at the door, and something felt off.

106
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,860
They're quick and agile.

107
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,781
They seem more like martial artists than scholars.

108
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,839
And the scrolls they're carrying seem unusually heavy.

109
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,696
I'm worried that inside might be...

110
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Weapons.

111
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,415
Signal them to change the music.

112
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,439
Yes, Miss Yun.

113
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,399
We've got guests coming.

114
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,080
Aren't you coming with me?

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,662
If they see the room empty,

116
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
the secret passage might be discovered.

117
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
He's just a child.

118
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
You're quite agile.

119
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,559
Lackey Jiang!

120
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,775
You collude with King Ning and manipulate His Majesty.

121
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,860
You should die!

122
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:31,260
It's our misstep to fall into your hands today.

123
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,400
You can torture or kill me, I accept my fate.

124
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,719
But you can't kill all the righteous in this world!

125
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,679
My Lord, what should we do with him?

126
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,399
Take him back and tend to his wounds.

127
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,759
Treat him well.

128
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Pah!

129
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,000
You scoundrel, stop pretending to be a good person!

130
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,221
All I did was take some bribe money,

131
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,821
yet you people are always out for blood.

132
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
The one

133
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,181
peeking around outside,

134
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
just come in.

135
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Get up!

136
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,456
Jiang Chang Yang, you corrupt lackey!

137
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,902
You fuel His Majesty's indulgence and disrupt the court's order.

138
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,646
We're from the Qingzheng Society, and we're here to restore justice!

139
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,440
You certainly have a knack for recruiting all kinds of talent.

140
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
You flatter me.

141
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,919
What are you doing here?

142
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,581
I was here for business.

143
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,719
Thanks to Mu Dan noticing something off

144
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,655
about those scrolls the young men were carrying,

145
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,240
I was able to warn you in time

146
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,640
to send your esteemed guest away.

147
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Sounds like

148
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,500
San Lang owes you a favor now.

149
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,020
We're friends.

150
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,399
It's nothing.

151
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,780
Speaking of San Lang, where are you hiding him?

152
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,101
Don't tell me

153
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,439
you've got a secret room in this place.

154
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,839
We have to clean up this room.

155
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,500
Perhaps you could move to the next room instead?

156
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,919
Miss Yun!

157
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,399
Are you alright?

158
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
The blade was laced with poison.

159
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,140
It's monkshood.

160
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,660
I should've been more careful.

161
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,140
Go summon a physician now!

162
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Yes, My Lord!

163
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,686
There's no time. This poison acts fast.

164
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
There's time.

165
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,279
I think I've read about this poison in a book before.

166
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,500
Someone, quickly!

167
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,061
Bring the rose oil I gave Miss Yun,

168
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,216
along with licorice root, honey, mung beans, and ginger!

169
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,679
- Yes, Miss. - Go.

170
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,759
Hang in there.

171
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,780
The wound was cleaned promptly,

172
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,000
and the medication applied was effective.

173
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,740
The poison hasn't reached the organs.

174
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,719
Lord Jiang, you can rest assured.

175
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,040
Follow the prescription I'll provide and,

176
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,500
with some rest, she'll make a full recovery.

177
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,399
Thank you, Physician Fu.

178
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,559
It's nothing.

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,260
You still haven't told me

180
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,421
how San Lang managed to disappear.

181
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Fine.

182
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,480
I'll take you to see for yourself.

183
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,039
Qi.

184
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,479
Take good care of Miss Yun.

185
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,399
Yes, My Lord.

186
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,920
(Jiang Residence)

187
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,400
You're not even hurt.

188
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
Is it necessary to wrap yourself up like this?

189
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,821
Now the whole city knows you've been attacked again.

190
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,319
If word doesn't spread,

191
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,140
how will people know how hard it is to be the Flower Bird Envoy,

192
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,860
or how many enemies I have?

193
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,519
I appreciate your hard work.

194
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,520
With the Chen family imprisoned,

195
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,239
I pretended to support King Ning.

196
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,766
Now that I've been attacked,

197
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,581
it's the perfect way to ease King Ning's suspicions of me.

198
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,735
Your Majesty, the gold, silver, and fine wine have been prepared,

199
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,361
along with the medicinal supplies,

200
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:54,881
including this year's tribute of premium donkey-hide gelatin.

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,480
After so many assassination attempts,

202
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,279
you're finally giving me some compensation.

203
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,159
They're not for you.

204
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
What I did yesterday was nothing worth mentioning.

205
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,620
You shouldn't have.

206
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,421
Thanks to you, I got to avoid a fight.

207
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
So, you absolutely deserve this.

208
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,380
Besides, someone here is far too stubborn to admit it.

209
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:17,846
I'm not just here for myself,

210
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:19,126
I'm also here for him.

211
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,976
We want to thank you for your timely warning

212
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,300
and for saving Miss Yun.

213
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
I'll pass on the gold and silver,

214
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,480
but I'll gladly take this wine.

215
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,461
San Lang, you're so considerate.

216
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,839
You know exactly what I like.

217
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,581
That's thanks to a certain someone's reminder.

218
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,221
You're actually turning down money?

219
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,696
Don't tell me you're trying to keep San Lang indebted to you

220
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,600
so you can ask for something even bigger later.

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,839
When it comes to scheming and playing the long game,

222
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,941
no one compares to you, Lord Jiang.

223
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,336
San Lang, if you really want to show your appreciation,

224
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,399
perhaps you can visit Blooming Abode more?

225
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
We've just

226
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,821
launched a line of beauty products. Come take a look.

227
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,100
You could pick out some for the ladies at home.

228
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,820
They'd love them.

229
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,776
Alright. I'll buy some to support you.

230
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,633
Awesome. These are all our products.

231
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,341
How do you like the Moutan peony you bought from us earlier?

232
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,255
We've also cultivated a few rare night-blooming cereus plants.

233
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,039
They're about to bloom in the next few days.

234
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,280
Why don't you buy one home

235
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,280
and enjoy it under the moonlight with your wife?

236
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm afraid

237
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,221
she'd rather enjoy it with someone else.

238
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,821
Oh, Miss He,

239
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,679
you really know how to hit a sore spot, don't you?

240
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Is there a story here?

241
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,061
I'd advise you not to ask.

242
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,599
The more someone is troubled,

243
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,581
the more they should talk about it.

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,461
Who knows? Someone might just have a solution.

245
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,701
My wife grew up with me and my cousin.

246
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,182
We've always been close.

247
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,380
She was engaged to my cousin,

248
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,740
but after a tragedy in the family

249
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,742
and his passing,

250
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,141
she became my wife instead.

251
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,799
I know

252
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
she married me

253
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,701
only because of family duty,

254
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,239
not because she has feelings for me.

255
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,701
And what about you?

256
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,380
Do you have feelings for her?

257
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,439
I've been in love with her since we were young.

258
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
But unfortunately...

259
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,101
I never would've guessed

260
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,221
that Lord Jiang has such a deeply devoted friend.

261
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,581
San Lang, you love so deeply.

262
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,500
Fate truly has a cruel sense of humor.

263
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:49,919
I get that you're praising him,

264
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,599
but why are you mocking me?

265
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,421
Miss Mu Dan,

266
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,020
what can I do

267
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,981
to win her heart

268
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,200
and make her fall in love with me?

269
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,040
Relationships

270
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:06,373
are complicated,

271
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,262
but I believe

272
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,941
sincerity

273
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,181
is never the wrong approach.

274
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,020
Perhaps you could...

275
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Hang on!

276
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,901
Wait, that's not right!

277
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,260
I just realized something.

278
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,519
You say you love her,

279
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,176
but the way you love her is hanging out with Jiang Chang Yang for fun

280
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,760
and then trying to smooth things over with her with fancy gifts?

281
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,360
She's drunk.

282
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,560
But she's not wrong.

283
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,040
Your words and actions don't match.

284
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,719
You say you love her,

285
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,239
but have you made any efforts?

286
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,461
You've done nothing to show it!

287
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,844
Miss Mu Dan is right.

288
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Let me ask you this,

289
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,920
aside from sending her expensive gifts,

290
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,456
have you ever taken the time to understand what she likes or dislikes?

291
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,260
Have you ever done something she enjoys with her?

292
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
It's true

293
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,580
that I've never asked her what she wants.

294
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,340
See? I was right.

295
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,376
I didn't have the courage to ask,

296
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,981
and I don't know how to bring it up.

297
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,839
Nothing to be afraid of.

298
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,040
It's not as difficult as you think.

299
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,820
You could ask me for advice.

300
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,221
I can teach you a few tricks.

301
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,780
When it comes to love,

302
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,341
the key to winning your wife over is...

303
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,020
Why are you sitting here?

304
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,739
What does this have to do with you?

305
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,720
Don't tell me you've also got someone you love but can't have.

306
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,941
Me? I'm the esteemed Flower Bird Envoy,

307
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,741
who would possibly reject me?

308
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
You've seen the beauties around me.

309
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,015
Those women are just playing along for appearances.

310
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,840
Who would dare entrust their heart to you?

311
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,141
You probably don't even know what real love feels like.

312
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Forget it.

313
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,181
I don't care to hear your tips.

314
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,693
For the sake of all women in the world,

315
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:15,856
I wouldn't share my tips with you even if you begged.

316
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,540
Fine, don't share it. Who cares?

317
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,239
Don't sit here then.

318
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,640
Why can't I sit here? This is my house. This is the Jiang Residence.

319
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,839
He is mad because he lost the argument.

320
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,340
Don't believe everything she says.

321
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,661
Just you getting drunk during the day

322
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,319
would be enough to upset Consort Shu.

323
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,519
Sui Zhi,

324
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,519
have you thought of names

325
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:47,799
for the children you'll have with Mu Dan?

326
00:19:48,046 --> 00:19:49,486
What nonsense are you talking about?

327
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,060
We aren't even married.

328
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,740
And you're not denying there is mutual affection.

329
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,621
The only connection we have is over money.

330
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,820
She's a tenant, and I'm the landlord.

331
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,519
If that's all it is,

332
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,700
why didn't you just thank her yourself?

333
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Why did you have to lie that the wine was from me?

334
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,281
And just now, you two were sitting together on the swing,

335
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,781
flirting and bickering

336
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,621
like a loving couple,

337
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,186
while I was left on a cold stone bench,

338
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,740
completely sidelined like an outsider.

339
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,621
It's rare to see a woman who can handle you.

340
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,820
Why don't you just combine your two houses into one?

341
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,060
That wasn't flirting,

342
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,740
it was bantering and arguing.

343
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,300
Even bantering

344
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,480
is better than stiff pleasantries.

345
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,079
Sometimes, she and I

346
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,181
are worse than strangers.

347
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,941
You hopeless romantic.

348
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,421
Focus on your own problems first

349
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,141
and stop trying to lecture me.

350
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,456
Your Majesty, when you returned drunk yesterday,

351
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,999
Consort Hui happened to visit.

352
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,806
She took all the night-blooming cereus plants

353
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,500
and the cosmetics items with her.

354
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,416
Your words and actions don't match.

355
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,080
You say you love her,

356
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,640
but have you made any efforts?

357
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,861
You've done nothing to show it!

358
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Prepare my clothes.

359
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,120
I'm going to see Ling Ge.

360
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,039
Consort Shu moved to Xingqing Palace early this morning.

361
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,439
She said she wanted some time alone.

362
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,740
Should I prepare for you to visit Xingqing Palace?

363
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,599
Forget it.

364
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,181
If I go,

365
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,319
I'll likely disturb the peace she's seeking.

366
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,096
Young Master Liu hasn't left his residence,

367
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,340
but his attendant Qiu Shi is frequently seen lingering at Blooming Abode,

368
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,580
clearly acting on his orders.

369
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,696
That wretched woman has even extended her business into Pingkang House.

370
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,901
She's so shameless.

371
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,621
Your Highness, should we have her shop shut down?

372
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,621
Move aside! Move aside!

373
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,060
Get out! Get out!

374
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,959
- Quickly! - Don't leave.

375
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,279
Come on, hurry!

376
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,540
Everyone, please stay.

377
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,998
Who are you people?

378
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,456
Why did you drive away our customers?

379
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,040
Gentlemen, may I ask which residence you serve?

380
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,822
What brings you here today?

381
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:57,667
Miss He.

382
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,439
Who has Blooming Abode offended this time?

383
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:10,561
Word has it that Blooming Abode's cosmetics products are widely praised.

384
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,181
Princess Ji'an wishes to help you expand your clientele.

385
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,172
So, Her Highness has invited you to bring

386
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:16,956
your products to Xingqing Palace immediately

387
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,320
for the noble ladies to try them.

388
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,640
This doesn't look like an invitation, more like coercion.

389
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,461
This is a rare chance to connect with noble ladies.

390
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,861
You're of lowly status.

391
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,075
Having Her Highness take notice of you is a rare blessing.

392
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:30,320
Don't be ungrateful.

393
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,782
Since Her Highness has so graciously invited me,

394
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,780
how could I refuse?

395
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,896
There's no need to worry, everyone.

396
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,880
This is just a misunderstanding. Nothing's wrong.

397
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,981
You've heard it.

398
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,621
Even Princess Ji'an has heard of Blooming Abode's reputation.

399
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,780
That's why she sent so many people to invite me to the palace.

400
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,959
While our inventory is still full today,

401
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,535
you'd better hurry and make your purchases.

402
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,181
Once the noble ladies get their hands on these,

403
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,781
there might not be any left for you!

404
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,980
Please give me a moment.

405
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,621
I'll go to the palace with you.

406
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,759
Madam.

407
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,880
Don't panic, everyone!

408
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
Trust what our shopkeeper says.

409
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,480
Stay calm, there's no trouble.

410
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,160
Mu Dan, they're clearly up to no good.

411
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
You can't go.

412
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:21,933
I know.

413
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,480
Judging by their demeanor,

414
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,839
they're set on making things hard for me.

415
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,221
But if I refuse today,

416
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
what about tomorrow?

417
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,880
If they keep showing up to make trouble every few days,

418
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,720
we won't be able to run our business at all.

419
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,221
Give me a hand.

420
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,740
Left tent,

421
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,300
a point scored!

422
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,981
Greetings, Your Highness.

423
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,461
Congratulations on your engagement

424
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,040
and achieving your heart's desire.

425
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,540
It's such an honor to be invited here today.

426
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,281
I've brought some of our shop's latest products to share.

427
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,199
Ladies, please take a look.

428
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,540
Here we have rose powder,

429
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,020
clove powder,

430
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,580
and our Thousands Flowers Essence and Pure Thoughts.

431
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,141
These bottles contain newly developed floral essences.

432
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,760
If any catch your eye,

433
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,621
feel free to try them out.

434
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,261
How dare you offer goods meant for

435
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,300
commoners and lowly slaves to Her Highness.

436
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,420
Vulgar people like you care for nothing but money.

437
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,998
No wonder you would stoop so low

438
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,701
as to do business in pleasure houses.

439
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,335
I invited you here out of kindness to introduce you to potential clients,

440
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,046
but it seems they don't think much of you.

441
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,901
Someone like you

442
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,519
will probably only ever step foot in a royal estate once in your lifetime.

443
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,820
Leaving so soon would be a shame,

444
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,319
wouldn't it?

445
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,854
You should stand in the middle of

446
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,461
the field and take a good look around.

447
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,199
Consort Shu, it's Princess Ji'an.

448
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,775
She said earlier that she'd be bringing some noble ladies to play polo

449
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,106
and requested to use the field.

450
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,740
Shall I summon them to greet you?

451
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Never mind.

452
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,456
It's been a long time since I've played polo.

453
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,680
Let's go over and take a look.

454
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
What's going on?

455
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,000
Why are the horses avoiding that wretched woman?

456
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,941
Your Highness!

457
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,079
Your Highness!

458
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,896
Summon the imperial physician from the Palace Medical Bureau!

459
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Yes, Your Highness!

460
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,141
Greetings, Consort Shu!

461
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,896
You caused the County Princess to fall from her horse.

462
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,300
You should be detained and await her punishment.

463
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,176
If the county princess hadn't acted recklessly and stabbed the horse,

464
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,221
would it have lost control and gone wild?

465
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
The horse was innocent, and it was already killed,

466
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,320
are we going to sacrifice another innocent human life now?

467
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,809
Consort Shu, please understand,

468
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,313
this slave barged into the royal estate uninvited.

469
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,461
The county princess only did that to protect the royal family's honor.

470
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,720
When the county princess's people came to Blooming Abode to invite me,

471
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,100
many commoners witnessed it.

472
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,120
Just now, in full view of everyone,

473
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,461
I did nothing improper.

474
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:46,020
So, tell me, on what grounds would you detain me?

475
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,661
Are you from Jiang Chang Yang's residence?

476
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Yes.

477
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,740
His Majesty and Jiang Chang Yang are close.

478
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,679
If he learns that someone from his close friend's household

479
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,300
was humiliated in such a way,

480
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,540
it would surely incur his wrath.

481
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,559
Come with me.

482
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
No need to be so formal.

483
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,540
Sit in a more comfortable position.

484
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,319
Thank you, Your Highness.

485
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:58,727
To be honest,

486
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,300
my legs have been numb

487
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,119
for quite a while.

488
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,600
Since there's no one else here,

489
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,861
why don't you make yourself more comfortable too?

490
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Help me up.

491
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,540
My legs are numb too.

492
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,701
The palace gardeners are truly exceptional.

493
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,381
I've never seen such exquisite bonsai before.

494
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,095
This is my first time in the palace,

495
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,919
so I couldn't help but feel a little excited.

496
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,920
Forgive me if I've embarrassed myself.

497
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,359
Come, have a seat.

498
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,941
I used to think that the noblewomen in the palace

499
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,400
were all aloof and unapproachable.

500
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:18,560
I never imagined someone as poised, charismatic,

501
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,901
and approachable as you.

502
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,319
That's just your perspective.

503
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,580
To others,

504
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,621
they'd probably say I'm not gentle or virtuous enough.

505
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,381
Are you treating me so kindly

506
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,661
because of Lord Jiang?

507
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,340
I didn't know who you were

508
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,186
before you mentioned Blooming Abode.

509
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
All I know is

510
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,300
someone who has done no wrong shouldn't suffer unjustly.

511
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,340
I spend my days confined to the palace

512
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
and rarely hear of the outside world's amusements.

513
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,599
How about you visit me monthly to share some stories?

514
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,540
I'd be happy to. What would you like to hear about?

515
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,319
I've heard

516
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,682
that Jiang Residence is filled with beautiful women

517
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:09,106
and that the Flower Bird Envoy often invites his friends over to have fun.

518
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,279
Is it true?

519
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,141
Even Lord Jiang's escapades have reached your ears.

520
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,480
The rumors aren't far from the truth.

521
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,020
He also has a friend named San Lang,

522
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,300
who once fell over a wall

523
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,279
trying to sneak a peek at a woman tending flowers in her yard.

524
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
San Lang did that.

525
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,200
Your Highness, it's time to take your medicine.

526
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
Come in.

527
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Your Highness.

528
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,660
Your Highness, what medicine are you taking?

529
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,942
That's not something we can disclose.

530
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,160
I've been having trouble sleeping lately,

531
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,639
so I had someone prepare a herbal remedy for me.

532
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,840
I've hated bitterness since I was young,

533
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:28,461
so drinking medicine is always a struggle.

534
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,079
But it's nothing serious.

535
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,520
Would it be possible for me to have a copy of the prescription?

536
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,039
You know medicine?

537
00:34:38,086 --> 00:34:40,239
At the polo field earlier,

538
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:41,862
I caught a faint scent of alcohol.

539
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,100
Did you do something?

540
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,000
I know a little about horses.

541
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,279
I've learned that they dislike the smell of alcohol and vinegar,

542
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,720
so I applied some floral essence from my case to my wrists

543
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,459
to keep them from coming near me.

544
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,340
That's how I avoided harm.

545
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,462
That's very smart.

546
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,701
Thank you.

547
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,416
I do have some knowledge of medicine.

548
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,400
And I am often accompanied by a female physician.

549
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,981
Since you've been so kind to me,

550
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,159
I'd like to do whatever I can to help in return.

551
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,461
This prescription was prepared by the palace's finest physician.

552
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,079
Are you saying you can improve it?

553
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,100
I wouldn't dare alter the prescription.

554
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,201
However, since you dislike bitterness,

555
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:20,607
I thought perhaps I could

556
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,500
find medicinal foods or alternatives to replace it,

557
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,781
sparing you the struggle of taking bitter medicine every day.

558
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,360
(King Ning's Residence)

559
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,159
My Lord,

560
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,456
when Her Highness fell from her horse,

561
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,981
her abdomen was trampled by its hoof.

562
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,679
She has lost a lot of blood.

563
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
I fear...

564
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,000
Fear what?

565
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
I fear

566
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
she may no longer be able to conceive.

567
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
What did you say?

568
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,981
I've prepared a prescription,

569
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
but...

570
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,821
But the herbs

571
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,599
- can only help with recovery... - Get out.

572
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Yes, My Lord.

573
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,559
You Zhen.

574
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,559
Tell me.

575
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,060
How did this happen?

576
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Greetings, My Lord.

577
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,760
My Lord, Young Master Jiang is out drinking.

578
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,135
May I ask what brings you here?

579
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,461
Hand over that private slave named He Wei Fang!

580
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,640
I really did send her to Huanyun Pavilion to learn performance arts.

581
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,399
She's not coming back until she's mastered the Luyao Dance.

582
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,421
How convenient.

583
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,981
You just happened to send her away

584
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,700
right after You Zhen was injured.

585
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,381
I'll send someone to bring He Wei Fang back immediately.

586
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,159
Since it was my servant who has offended Her Highness,

587
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,941
it's only right for me to apologize to Her Highness with her.

588
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,381
Sui Zhi,

589
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,861
are you hiding something from me?

590
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,861
You're going to great lengths

591
00:38:41,393 --> 00:38:43,294
to protect a slave.

592
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,520
Have you forgotten all the trust and history between us?

593
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,199
To be honest, My Lord,

594
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,320
I've written the proposal to take He Wei Fang as a concubine.

595
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,981
I'm going to marry her soon.

596
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,720
I never thought something like this would happen.

597
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,781
You may find it amusing,

598
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:06,741
but I've had my eye on her

599
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,821
ever since we met in Luoyang.

600
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,660
Even Liu Zi Shu couldn't forget her after their divorce.

601
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,461
It's clear she possesses

602
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,400
some exceptional charm behind closed doors.

603
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,840
I'm only human, I couldn't resist it either.

604
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:26,494
Your reputation as a romantic is well-known.

605
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,140
But you just refused You Zhen's hand in marriage,

606
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:35,100
and now you want to take in a slave, a discarded woman, no less.

607
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,100
Is she really so special?

608
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:42,620
When I said I'd never get a wife in this lifetime, I wasn't lying.

609
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,140
I'm only taking her in as a beautiful concubine who makes money for me.

610
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Surely, you've hard,

611
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,880
she's already opened two shops

612
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,421
since arriving in Chang'an.

613
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,341
My only loves in life are beauty and wealth.

614
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:59,020
How could I not bring someone so capable into my household?

615
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,580
That sounds rather short-sighted.

616
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,006
Do you think what I could promise you would be

617
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,700
less than what a single woman can offer?

618
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,620
Your generosity is unmatched, of course,

619
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:13,301
but I've always been greedy.

620
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,480
I can't even bear to let a single coin slip through my fingers.

621
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,719
Besides,

622
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,580
I've reported this to His Majesty.

623
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,540
When he learned I was taking a concubine,

624
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,000
he was so pleased that he rewarded me with a grand gift.

625
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,421
I was just going

626
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,540
to discuss it with you.

627
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,141
The Chen family's fall

628
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,220
has left the position of Vice Commissioner of Transport vacant.

629
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,320
His Majesty has entrusted me to recommend someone capable.

630
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,700
I was hoping you could help me identify suitable candidates.

631
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,736
But if this marriage is called off,

632
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
I fear

633
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,519
the reward may also be rescinded.

634
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,180
His Majesty sees you as a brother.

635
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:06,941
He has always hoped for a dependable woman to take care of you.

636
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,140
We can't disappoint him.

637
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,159
Here's an idea.

638
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,700
You can choose another woman, someone beautiful and virtuous,

639
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,799
and take her as your concubine instead.
