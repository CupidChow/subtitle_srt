<i>[Episode 23]</i>

3
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,760
Yunniang found out

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,120
the County Princess was behind it.

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,439
So, I know it's not easy to save you.

6
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,799
My teacher wrote to me,

7
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,200
telling me to hurry back.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,480
He says if I fail to save you,

9
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,719
I won't need to go back to see him.

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Please thank Master Xu

11
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,128
and Yunniang for me.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,959
I came all this way to save you.

13
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,000
Aren't you going to thank me?

14
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,912
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

15
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,439
So,

16
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,439
I didn't come in vain.

17
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,144
Leave me here.

18
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,968
I'm leaving.

19
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,560
Mr. Jiang.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,159
I have a request.

21
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,639
Could you possibly buy me?

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,280
Otherwise, as an official servant,

23
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,199
I can never leave here.

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,719
I want to continue doing business.

25
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:41,120
- I want to--
- You want me to get you

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,319
out of trouble
so that you can return to Chang'an.

27
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
I heard

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,199
that your shop has already…

29
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,960
Yes, I've lost my shop.

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,080
I've lost everything.

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,240
Mr. Jiang.

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,639
You know it.

33
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,719
I have business acumen.

34
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,520
If you

35
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,120
help me leave this place,

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
I will surely rise again.

37
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,599
Anyway, I can be

38
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,840
a big money maker.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,199
If you agree,

40
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,800
we can discuss the ratio

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,439
of profit sharing.

42
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,199
I can give you an additional 20 percent.

<i>[Buyer: Jiang Changyang]</i>

44
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,919
You've already bought me.

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
So,

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,639
just to gain more benefits from me,

47
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,599
you didn't let me know?

48
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,199
I didn't mean it.

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,840
You mentioned profit sharing,

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,199
didn't you?

51
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,599
You can pay back the money

52
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,000
for buying you monthly.

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,319
You're cunning.

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
You can't suffer any losses.

55
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,879
That's why I can be your master.

56
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,879
Don't worry.

57
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,120
I never beat or scold my maids.

58
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,439
From now on, the money you earn is mine.

59
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,319
But your life

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
is still in your own hands.

61
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,976
I'm leaving.

62
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
What are you waiting for?

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,920
Waiting for me to get you on?

If you fall, I won't take responsibility.

68
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,056
Go home.

Your leg injury hasn't healed.

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,279
You can't go to the barracks.

75
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,319
Yes, Fu.

76
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,480
Take care of your leg.

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
I have no choice.

78
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
Mr. Jiang has yet to return.

79
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,879
We've done what we can.

80
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,319
How can I save Mudan if I don't try it?

81
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,480
We don't know if she's dead or alive.

82
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,879
Are we going to sit here and do nothing?

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,439
I will go with you.

84
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,000
We'll wait at the entrance of the barracks.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,319
Someone will eventually come out

86
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,639
to buy supplies or do things.

87
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,079
I believe that we can ask for news about Mudan.

88
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,488
Fine.

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,680
But I can't leave my home.

90
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,839
If my father finds out,

91
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,240
I'm afraid I can't get out again.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll prepare plenty of medicines and tonics.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,519
Just in case they can be delivered to Mudan.

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
There should be someone guarding the house.

95
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,959
Chun.

96
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,120
Don't let Wang Qing take Mudan's flowers again.

97
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,424
- Let's go.
- Go.

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,199
- Who's there?
- Go have a look.

99
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,759
- Mudan!
- Mudan!

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,232
I'm back.

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,319
How did you get out of the barracks?

102
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,000
Well…

103
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,000
It was Mr. Jiang.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,439
Mr. Jiang saved me.

105
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,759
I'm sorry, Mudan.

106
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,959
I failed to protect Huamanzhu for you.

107
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,639
All of our money

108
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,560
has been confiscated.

109
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,120
It's okay.

110
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,399
No big deal.

111
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,639
Anyway, I can open a shop again.

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,296
Wait.

113
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:44,832
Let's go.

114
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,360
What happened to Fu's leg?

115
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,040
When fighting with Wang Qing,

116
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,279
she got injured.

117
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,399
Don't worry about it.

118
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,959
Chun has already bandaged it.

119
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,600
I got you all into trouble.

120
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,600
Did the officials give you a hard time?

121
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,920
Mudan.

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,319
We are family.

123
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,040
Don't blame yourself.

124
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,120
Mudan.

125
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,600
Thanks to your benevolence

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,759
and far-sighted planning.

127
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,839
When I joined the incense powder business,

128
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,680
you advised me and Fu

129
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,879
to open individual accounts.

130
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,000
Well,

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,279
your property has been confiscated,

132
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,560
but mine and Fu's are safe.

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
We can make a comeback.

134
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Let's put it aside for now.

135
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,199
You and Fu are both injured.

136
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,720
You stay home for a week.

137
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
You both need time to recover.

138
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,319
Don't be so serious. I'm good.

139
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,328
Mudan.

140
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
Fu, be careful.

141
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,120
I know these things

142
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
are very important to you.

143
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,480
I hid them

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,199
before the officials arrived.

145
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
Thank you.

146
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,399
Don't mention it.

147
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,608
Everything will be fine.

148
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,040
You're severely injured.

149
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,160
W-Why am I crying?

150
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,759
I'm fine.

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,768
It's all right now.

152
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,240
Alright, let me check your body in the room

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,639
and see if you have more injuries.

154
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,392
Let's go.

155
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,360
What a ruthless person.

156
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,679
As bad as this fruit.

157
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,920
A rotten, sneaky person.

158
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,879
Mudan.

159
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,039
Don't be sad for such a person.

160
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,112
It's not worth it.

161
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,328
Be careful.

162
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,639
The Herbaceous Peony's blooming season is over.

163
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,960
It is now the season for summer flowers.

164
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,440
You're skillful.

165
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,399
Follow me to the Huamanzhu

166
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,000
to take care of the flowers.

167
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,720
I also need you

168
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,879
to make the incense powder.

169
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,120
So, can you--

170
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,240
I have told you.

171
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,480
I will never help you.

172
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,399
Nor will I manage the shop.

173
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,240
If you don't want to,

174
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,639
let's go to Madam He's home

175
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,000
to bring back her precious flowers.

176
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,399
We should keep them.

177
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,272
It's reassuring.

178
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,279
Fu is guarding Mudan's home.

179
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,720
Even if you can snatch those flowers,

180
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,952
you won't take care of them well.

181
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,240
Don't waste your time.

182
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,440
Madam He is just an outsider.

183
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,120
I'm your husband.

184
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,120
Booming business makes our life better.

185
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,120
Don't be angry anymore.

186
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,159
Well,

187
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,799
think about our future children.

188
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,672
Please.

189
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,120
Dear God,

190
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,879
if you truly exist,

191
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,080
I hope you protect Mudan

192
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,919
and make her return safely.

193
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,240
I'm as guilty as sin.

194
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,519
Even the gods don't forgive me.

195
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
A candle in the wind

196
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,559
requires two persons to light it.

197
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,936
With one person left,

198
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,336
it will go out.

199
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,928
Mudan.

200
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,096
You're back.

201
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,799
I didn't see you at the tavern.

202
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,240
I guessed you might be here.

203
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,159
You have had rough days.

204
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,840
In that case,

205
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,399
why did you betray me?

206
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,840
Why did you stubbornly

207
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,080
choose to do it?

208
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,440
I have never thought of betraying you.

209
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,519
The person I least want

210
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,039
to hurt is you.

211
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,799
All I want is to have a home.

212
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,559
I didn't know Wang Qing would trap me

213
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,120
to accuse you.

214
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,879
Anyway, it's too late

215
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,000
to explain.

216
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,440
I have hurt you.

217
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,279
If you wanted to reconcile with Wang Qing,

218
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,080
why did you not tell me in advance?

219
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,879
Am I not worthy of your trust?

220
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Have you forgotten

221
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,799
how Wang Qing hurt you?

222
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
He beat his former wife.

223
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,039
His sweet nothings

224
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,320
are like this candlelight.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It seems warm.

226
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,559
But it's not solid.

227
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,799
A gust of wind can put it out.

228
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,960
You have Chun

229
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,720
and Fu.

230
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,799
Mr. Jiang and your ex-husband pursue you.

231
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,120
But I have nothing.

232
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,639
I don't have a good family like Chun.

233
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
I can't make you laugh

234
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,480
like Fu.

235
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,799
I can't make you proud of me.

236
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,000
As Huamanzhu grows,

237
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,639
more capable people will be around you.

238
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,639
One day,

239
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,080
you will not need me anymore.

240
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,056
Shengyi.

241
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,000
We are friends in trouble.

242
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,559
When I had nothing,

243
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,080
It was you who stayed with me.

244
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,840
We started in this temple.

245
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,879
Nobody can replace my friendship

246
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,240
with you.

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,679
Fu and Chun are my friends.

248
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,279
But they're also your friend.

249
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,440
Shouldn't we help each other

250
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,919
and be considerate?

251
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,880
Now,

252
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,559
I've been reduced to a lowly status.

253
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,399
And you've had tough days again.

254
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,960
Shengyi.

255
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,679
Don't you think it's too costly

256
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,879
to see the truth?

257
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,519
I'm sorry.

258
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,080
Mudan.

259
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,759
I'm so sorry.

260
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,279
Whatever I do,

261
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,559
I can't repay you in the slightest.

262
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,600
Now seeing you well,

263
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,840
I am very content.

264
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,000
I won't appear before you again

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,360
to make you sad.

266
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
I just said so much

267
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,720
not to make you sad.

268
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,360
I wanted you to face reality.

269
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,919
Don't make the same mistake again.

270
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,088
Shengyi.

271
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,600
If you're not living well,

272
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,840
then come back.

273
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,328
I have told you.

274
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,799
I share the money I earn

275
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,679
in Chang'an with you.

276
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
I share my house

277
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,559
with you.

278
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,080
I didn't change my mind before.

279
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,480
I don't today.

280
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,559
I won't in the future.

281
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,759
I can never become Qin Shengyi.

282
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,440
I am still Qin Wuniang.

283
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,559
I can't go back anymore.

284
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,720
Why can't you go back?

285
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll eventually get Huamanzhu back.

286
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,160
In my heart,

287
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
you will always be Shengyi.

288
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,135
<i>[Sheng]</i>

289
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:24,341
<i>[Yi]</i>

290
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,079
I won't come here again.

291
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,272
Mudan.

292
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,359
May all whom you meet

293
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,440
be loyal friends.

294
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,200
Never meet someone

295
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,920
like me.

296
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,880
What are you doing?

297
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,079
Who?

298
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,279
Who sent you here?

299
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,720
Lady He.

300
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,119
Mr. Jiang has brought the items

301
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,079
from your hometown.

302
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,160
You actually

303
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
brought them all back to me.

304
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,240
Is there something wrong?

305
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,680
This was for Shengyi.

306
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,839
I thought

307
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,680
when she got married,

308
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,640
I'd give this to her as her dowry.

309
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,079
You've done what you can.

310
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,359
She refused to come back.

311
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,279
You're a carefree person.

312
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,000
Why are you

313
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,200
getting upset for nothing?

314
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,519
Outside the barracks,

315
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,720
who earnestly promised me

316
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,759
to make a comeback?

317
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,720
Sentimentality can't help you earn money.

318
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,119
Don't worry.

319
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,799
I'll reclaim Huamanzhu as quickly as possible

320
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,200
and bring you profits.

321
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,720
How much did these things cost?

322
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,440
I'll pay back the money for these things

323
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,680
and the money

324
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,759
you bought me

325
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,559
once I earn the money.

326
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,799
I can't remember all these things.

327
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,839
Count them later.

328
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,319
Report the amount to her tomorrow.

329
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,056
Yes.

330
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,720
- Try this candied fruit.
- These Hu cakes should be eaten soon.

331
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,599
Did you go to the Zhang's Starched Noodles

332
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,720
I recommended?

333
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,240
Sure, but I didn't eat.

334
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,920
Why not?

335
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,359
Too many diners.

336
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,960
There was only one bowl of noodles left
when I got there.

337
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,079
I happened to come across an old man.

338
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
He wanted to buy noodles

339
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,440
for his daughter who fell off a cliff.

340
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,400
As a good person,

341
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,680
I gave the noodles to him.

342
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,680
That old man misses his daughter.

343
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,519
I gave up the noodles.

344
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,880
So, he gave me some Hu cakes.

345
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,400
The heat is okay.

346
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,279
Give me the Hu cake. It's ready to bake.

347
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,640
Have a try.

348
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,920
Does it have a taste of home?

349
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,359
Is that man

350
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,720
in good health?

351
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,039
He's all well.

352
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,839
However,

353
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,319
he misses his daughter very much.

354
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,176
He fears

355
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,799
that she's a lonely soul
with no one to care for.

356
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,824
That's good.

357
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,359
A traveler is tired of seeking fame

358
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,240
and returns home when spring comes.

359
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,240
You've already been

360
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,359
back to He Weifang,

361
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,536
Go back home

362
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,519
if you're homesick.

363
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,920
You once asked me

364
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,480
why I didn't go back to my family

365
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,000
after leaving the Liu family.

366
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,039
Actually, I did go back then.

367
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,319
I returned by carriage.

368
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,039
When I was nearly home,

369
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,359
I saw the candlelight in my home.

370
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,680
I thought the candles were lit for my return.

371
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,400
But when I got closer, I saw my father standing

372
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,240
with the Liu family's servants.

373
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,359
They were about to search for me.

374
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,599
I heard my father say

375
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,079
that the Liu family was good

376
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,039
and a woman must get married.

377
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,680
If they found me,

378
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,400
they would send me back to the Liu family.

379
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,559
At that moment,

380
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,248
I realized

381
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,839
I could never return home again.

382
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,920
Parents love their children

383
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,119
and plan for them.

384
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,680
But sometimes, their plans

385
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,359
are not what the children desire.

386
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,480
The County Princess is loved by Prince Ning.

387
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,440
Yet she has to marry someone

388
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,759
she does not love.

389
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,440
My father loves me.

390
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,640
But he believes

391
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,279
the wisest choice for me is

392
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,880
to get married

393
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,240
and have my children.

394
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
He doesn't understand.

395
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,559
I don't want to be a paper kite
that is controlled by others.

396
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,400
I want to be a free-flying bird.

397
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,640
Moreover, he has a concubine

398
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,079
and Man'er.

399
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,839
He has to support a whole family.

400
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,240
Even if I go back home,

401
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,279
it will only bother them.

402
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,432
In that case,

403
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,056
it's better not to go back.

404
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,119
Anyway, I know he's living well.

405
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,504
Jiang Changyang.

406
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,240
Thank you for bringing this to me.

407
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
Chuanyu wanted to have noodles.

408
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,759
It's not a problem for me.

409
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,640
You've pretended to be a bad guy for too long.

410
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,680
Have you already forgotten

411
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,160
how to be a good person?

412
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,160
You helped me.

413
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,279
Yet you denied it.

414
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,279
I was wrong about you before.

415
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,839
In fact, even today, I don't know

416
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,279
what kind of person you are.

417
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,200
But I know

418
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,000
you are a good gentleman.

419
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,200
Whether I am an official's family member

420
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,039
a flower merchant, or an official servant,

421
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,039
you have never looked down on me.

422
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,176
Jiang Changyang.

423
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,359
You're my creditor.

424
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,000
<i>♫ Can this ten thousand miles
of roaming winds and waves ♫</i>

425
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,519
Other than that, can we

426
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,279
♫ Finally touch a sunny day ♫

427
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,720
become good friends?

428
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:19,799
<i>♫ Clouds are hidden by night ♫</i>

429
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:20,920
Are you drunk?

430
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,759
<i>♫ Fleecy clouds in the sky ♫</i>

431
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,279
Sure, I'm drunk.

432
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,799
That's why I had the courage to say this.

433
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:33,160
<i>♫ The moon falls on my shoulder,
a path of dim yellow ♫</i>

434
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,464
Well,

435
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,319
we've long been friends.

436
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,720
<i>♫ If the heart is like frost ♫</i>

437
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,471
<i>♫ What's the harm in a life of solitude ♫</i>

438
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:48,863
<i>♫ Yet you shine as light ♫</i>

439
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:52,768
<i>♫ Piercing through my heart ♫</i>

440
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,305
<i>♫ If love is like frost ♫</i>

441
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:59,808
<i>♫ There's a flickering candle ♫</i>

442
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,350
<i>♫ No words are said ♫</i>

443
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,712
<i>♫ Yet for you ♫</i>

444
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,880
<i>♫ I'll go ahead ♫</i>

445
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,752
My lord.

446
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,920
Any news?

447
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,720
She would rather be an official servant

448
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,839
than marry me?

449
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,279
That's impossible.

450
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,759
I will ask her personally.

451
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,480
My lord.

452
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,200
She has already left the barracks.

453
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,640
Previously, you couldn't

454
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,720
select a good horse.

455
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,079
Today, a good horse has arrived.

456
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,680
Mr. Jiang, see if you like it.

457
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,640
Thank you, Zishu.

458
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,079
You don't have to

459
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,519
deliver a horse personally.

460
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,920
I think you know

461
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,240
what I'm here for.

462
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,632
Get on the horse.

463
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,400
Take this horse for a walk.

464
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,912
Yes.

465
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,640
You failed to manage your family,

466
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,079
causing me to lose Huamanzhu, a money spinner.

467
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,240
Are you here for my compensation?

468
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,839
I can give however much you want

469
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,720
as long as you

470
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,279
sell He Weifang to me.

471
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,039
He Weifang is a human, not a horse

472
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,680
in the Stables Bureau.

473
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,359
I can't sell a human

474
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,839
to you.

475
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:44,359
That's not what I meant.

476
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,480
If you respect her,

477
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,720
you should ask her if she wants to go with you.

478
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,160
Or,

479
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,720
you know

480
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,799
that she will refuse you?

481
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,720
Why are you so certain

482
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,279
of what she is thinking?

483
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,319
We live side by side,

484
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,759
facing each other night after night.

485
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,839
What do you think?

486
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,640
Jiang Changyang.

487
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,440
Back in Luoyang,
did you have a thing for my wife?

488
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,240
You can have any woman if you like.

489
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,599
Why steal the woman I love?

490
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,319
It's not your place to judge me.

491
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,400
Moreover,

492
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,480
He Weifang

493
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,279
doesn't love you.

494
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,960
You're being narcissistic.

495
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,519
How proud He Weifang is.

496
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,319
If she has a choice,

497
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,119
she won't willingly be a maid.

498
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,799
Did you intercept the letter

499
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,279
I sent to the barracks?

500
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,759
I didn't see it.

501
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,440
When I arrived at the barracks,

502
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,160
she was nearly ravaged

503
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,079
and killed by those soldiers.

504
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,799
Liu Chang.

505
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,559
You don't need me to tell you

506
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,079
who ordered those soldiers, do you?

507
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,039
You never

508
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,008
understand He Weifang,

509
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,960
the County Princess,

510
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,079
and yourself.

511
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,039
Return the horse to Mr. Liu.

512
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,936
Let's go.

513
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,824
Yes.

514
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,759
You've been punished for what you did.

515
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,839
You don't have to give me this.

516
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,160
As long as you remain honest and upright,

517
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,359
there will still be a place
for you in the guild.

518
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,119
Thanks for your tolerance.

519
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,240
I'm very thankful.

520
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,559
However, I suddenly lost my position

521
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,000
as deputy head.

522
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,640
People gossip about me.

523
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,720
Mr. Lv.

524
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,440
Considering our old friendship,

525
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,279
can you be more merciful to me?

526
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,519
If possible,

527
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,880
give me another chance.

528
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,839
You have done something wrong.

529
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,000
There's no reason to change your punishment.

530
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,599
Do not mention it again.

531
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Yes.

532
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,119
Madame Tang

533
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,440
will celebrate her 80th birthday.

534
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Has anyone taken on her floral banquet?

535
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,440
Madame Tang

536
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,119
is fastidious.

537
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,839
She has a title.

538
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,319
Her words can crush a person.

539
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,119
Nobody dares to take her order?

540
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,559
As far as I know,

541
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,480
the newly appointed deputy head

542
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
does not have orders from nobles.

543
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,720
Why not let him do this job?

544
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,160
Aside from Madame Tang,

545
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,319
Tang Silang is a notorious man.

546
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,839
When his father's birthday banquet
was not well prepared,

547
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,240
he destroyed the restaurant responsible

548
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
for the banquet.

549
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,200
Yuying.

550
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,920
What are you up to?

551
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,759
You got the wrong idea.

552
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,440
I am just concerned for the guild.

553
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,640
Look,

554
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,079
we'll reply to the Tang family tomorrow.

555
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,480
If we refuse again,

556
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,559
Tang Silang will certainly

557
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,519
make a scene at the flower guild.

558
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,640
I'm afraid

559
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,279
we have to take this order.

560
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,792
Sir.

561
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,480
Sir, Wang Qing,
the new owner of Huamanzhu, is here.

562
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,839
Although Lady He is unyielding,

563
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,039
she truly loves flowers.

564
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,519
Wang Qing can't even plant flowers.

565
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,519
Yet he used despicable means

566
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,640
to take over Huamanzhu.

567
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,839
The guild doesn't welcome such a shameless man.

568
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,296
Kick him out.

569
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,064
What?

570
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,799
Did Wang Qing

571
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,839
say anything?

572
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,039
Wang Qing says

573
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,279
he wants to take the Tang family's order.

574
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,400
Why are you so late today?

575
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,480
I treated two patients

576
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,319
with abdominal pain.

577
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,720
Any news from the flower guild?

578
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,000
The flower guild gave that business deal
to Wang Qing.

579
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
Really?

580
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,680
Mudan guessed right.

581
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,039
After inquiring for many days,

582
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,599
I learned that nobody dares

583
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:09,079
to host Madame Tang's birthday banquet.

584
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,719
Wang Qing has never done business
with the noble.

585
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,440
He only knows he can make a lot of money.

586
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,559
Yet he doesn't know how hard it is

587
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,880
to earn money from the rich.

588
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,480
I just need to go with the flow

589
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,880
and use a small trick

590
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,719
to let him hear about this.

591
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,440
With his greedy nature,

592
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,559
how could he possibly miss it?

593
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,920
How did it break again?

594
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,679
The hoes I bought

595
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,880
are not very good.

596
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,199
Tomorrow, I will buy new ones.

597
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,360
Take a rest.

598
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,519
You've worked for so long.

599
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,079
Have some tea.

600
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,559
Come, Chun.

601
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,840
Mudan.

602
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,599
You designed such a big trap

603
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,679
for Wang Qing

604
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,960
not just to get Huamanzhu back

605
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,119
from him, right?

606
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,000
What do you mean?

607
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,519
Sit.

608
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,519
I've inquired a lot.

609
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,760
Many businesses order flowers.

610
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,440
But Mudan chose Madame Tang's order.

611
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,760
You know

612
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,519
Madame Tang is fastidious.

613
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,719
You also know

614
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,239
she's influential in the capital, right?

615
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,719
Exactly.

616
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,960
I established Huamanzhu.

617
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,519
I will take it back

618
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,119
and recover its reputation

619
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,280
ruined

620
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,400
by Wang Qing.

621
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,159
You want to host Madame Tang's floral banquet.

622
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,280
Since Tang Silang and Mr. Jiang

623
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,360
are good friends,

624
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,440
why don't you let Mr. Jiang pull some strings?

625
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,400
The regular customers of Huamanzhu

626
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,880
heard that I was saved by Jiang Changyang.

627
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
In their eyes,

628
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,119
I am no longer a shopkeeper

629
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,519
but a maid.

630
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,960
Moreover,

631
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,159
I have neither a store

632
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,760
nor sufficient floral materials.

633
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,360
How could I possibly take on this deal?

634
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,639
But Huamanzhu can.

635
00:36:03,904 --> 00:36:06,713
<i>[Huamanzhu]</i>

636
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,320
Well,

637
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,480
how come all the flowers have been sent back?

638
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,760
We've paid a considerable deposit, right?

639
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
How could you

640
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,239
deliver these terrible flowers
for Madame Tang's birthday banquet?

641
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
Before dawn,

642
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,239
we picked flowers and loaded them.

643
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,199
The Tang family's garden is outside the city.

644
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,920
Enough of excuses.

645
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,119
These flowers can't last a few hours.

646
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,039
What will happen tomorrow?

647
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,519
Deliver two carts of fresh flowers.

648
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,519
They're all the flowers I can deliver.

649
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,159
Please do me a favor.

650
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,320
Go away.

651
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,800
Whatever you do,

652
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,960
tomorrow's birthday banquet

653
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,199
must be successful.

654
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,159
If the flowers are fewer or wilted,

655
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,480
and you mess up the birthday banquet,

656
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,639
you won't be paid

657
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,239
or spared.

658
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,159
Sir, the servants of the Tang family
are that fierce.

659
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,360
If we mess up the birthday banquet

660
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,400
and offend the nobility,

661
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,079
I'm afraid we might lose our lives.

662
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,000
Why don't we buy some fresh flowers?

663
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,000
All the money was spent on these flowers.

664
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,719
I have no extra money.

665
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,280
What did the guild head say?

666
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,000
The gatekeeper didn't let me in.

667
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,480
According to the guild head,

668
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,079
Huamanzhu

669
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,679
isn't a guild-affiliated flower shop.

670
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,360
The flower guild has mercifully

671
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,960
sold many flowers to you.

672
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,679
But you can't

673
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,960
borrow floriculturists

674
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,199
from the flower guild.

675
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,688
What should we do?

676
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,840
What are you doing?

677
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,000
- Lady He.
- Shengyi.

678
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,719
I was instigated by this evil woman.

679
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,320
It was she who asked me to sue you.

680
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,440
Now, I have brought her here.

681
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,719
Do with her as you will.

682
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,760
Shengyi, get up.

683
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,480
Wang Qing failed
to deliver flowers to the noble.

684
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,679
You shut up.

685
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,440
Get out of here!

686
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,679
Do not touch her.

687
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,679
Shengyi, get up.

688
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,840
Get up.

689
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,128
Come on.

690
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,760
Are you alright?

691
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,039
I'll get a physician for you.

692
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,039
No need.

693
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,480
Don't dirty your clothes.

694
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,559
She's already a broken woman.

695
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,960
No one accepts her but me.

696
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,039
She will only be with me.

697
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,159
Lady He, there's no need to talk to her.

698
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,599
Let's talk.

699
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,800
I'm happy

700
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,119
to talk to Shengyi.

701
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,760
You shameless man,

702
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,760
didn't you say
you would make me lose everything?

703
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,119
What are you doing here?

704
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,280
I don't want to talk to you.

705
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,719
Get out!

706
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,199
I made a mistake before.

707
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,800
You're protected by the Floral Envoy.

708
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,760
A lowly person like me
can't afford to offend you.

709
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm here

710
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,840
because you and Wuniang

711
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
are good friends.

712
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,679
I know that after you return to Chang'an,

713
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,000
you have no means of making a living.

714
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,079
Coincidentally,

715
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,679
I have taken on a birthday banquet.

716
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:12,880
As long as you help me with that

717
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,320
and get it done successfully,

718
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
I'll sell Huamanzhu

719
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:19,079
to you at this price.

720
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,679
It is laughable.

721
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,360
Huamanzhu was mine.

722
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,360
You're doomed this time.

723
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,800
You're begging for help.

724
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,760
Yet you have the audacity
to sell my shop to me.

725
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,440
How do you know?

726
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,920
Generally, the birthday banquet for the noble

727
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,239
is undertaken by the flower guild.

728
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Do you know

729
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,599
why you

730
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,320
got this business deal?

731
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,679
Madam Tang is extremely picky,

732
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,920
and Tang Silang is unscrupulous.

733
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,599
The flower shops in the flower guild

734
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,880
don't dare to take it on.

735
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,719
Huamanzhu

736
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,880
has not joined the flower guild.

737
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,679
Even if you mess this up,

738
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,719
it won't implicate them.

739
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,000
For him,

740
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,039
you're just a good scapegoat.

741
00:40:23,702 --> 00:40:29,976
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫</i>

742
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:38,514
<i>♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫</i>

743
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:46,388
<i>♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫</i>

744
00:40:47,382 --> 00:40:55,734
<i>♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫</i>

745
00:40:55,734 --> 00:41:03,277
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

746
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:12,118
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

747
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:19,929
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

748
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:27,826
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>

749
00:41:48,502 --> 00:41:55,385
<i>♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫</i>

750
00:41:56,686 --> 00:42:03,380
<i>♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫</i>

751
00:42:04,137 --> 00:42:11,439
<i>♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫</i>

752
00:42:12,123 --> 00:42:20,432
<i>♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫</i>

753
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:27,863
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

754
00:42:28,694 --> 00:42:36,950
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

755
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:44,374
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

756
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:52,828
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>
