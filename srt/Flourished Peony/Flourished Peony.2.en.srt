00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:39,200
<i>[Episode 2]</i>

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
- My lady, watch your step.
- Okay.

4
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:05,120
<i>♫ The Luo River cleanses the moonlight haze ♫</i>

5
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:11,009
<i>♫ Flowing into a scorching long river ♫</i>

6
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:17,344
<i>♫ A jade-like face not yet indulged
in mundane pleasures ♫</i>

7
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:24,457

8
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:29,632
<i>♫ Let not the secular world constrain ♫</i>

00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,800
<i>♫ How can they guess with mundane eyes ♫</i>

10
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,296

12
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,960

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,928
<i>♫ Smiling as the storm stir the dust ♫</i>

18
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:16,569
<i>♫ Flowers should bloom proudly ♫</i>

19
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,933
<i>♫ Reflecting the color of the sky ♫</i>

00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:26,319
<i>♫ Do not fail the varied fragrance ♫</i>

22
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,879
Minister Chen.

23
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,400
I've heard that your son

24
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,680
would soon go to the capital
to take the imperial examination.

25
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,719
My own son also wishes to participate

26
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,159
in this year's Provincial Examination.

27
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,960
Why not let them
travel to the capital together?

28
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,039
My son has gained
the favor of the County Princess

29
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,000
and is bound to be promoted.

30
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,039
In the future, our two families
should interact more

31
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,080
and support each other in official circles.

32
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,800
It will be beneficial.

33
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,520
Whoever forms an alliance with Prince Ning

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,680
will become my comrade.

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,120
The Floral Envoy accompanies
the County Princess

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,680
to relax here.

37
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,080
It's obvious who is the son-in-law

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,919
favored by His Highness.

39
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,199
I must remind you

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,120
to beware lest all your efforts be in vain.

41
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
Your Highness, we have arrived.

42
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,720
Greetings, Princess.

43
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,839
- No need for formalities.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

44
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,368
Your Highness.

45
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,800
Zishu.

46
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,199
Long time no see.

47
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,920
How have you been recently?

48
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,480
All is well.

49
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,199
I've heard about what happened.

50
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,839
Please don't worry too much, Your Highness.

51
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,600
The floral banquet is ready.

52
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,360
Please invite the Floral Envoy.

53
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,519
The Envoy is resting after the tiring journey.

54
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,319
Please wait a moment.

55
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,832
Very well, very well.

56
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,399
My lord, it's time to get up.

57
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,808
Everyone is waiting for you.

58
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,199
Greetings, Floral Envoy.

59
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,160
Greetings to everyone.

60
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Where did you get drunk last night?

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,279
You slept all the way and made us wait.

62
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,399
I wanted to leave more time

63
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,399
for the County Princess' pleasantries.

64
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,399
Mr. Liu, you wouldn't blame me, right

65
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,519
Of course not.

66
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,759
The presence of the County
Princess and Floral Envoy

67
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,040
is honoring to my house.

68
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,240
Come, please.

69
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,280
My lady.

70
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,079
Your Highness, please.

71
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,240
Please watch your step.

72
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
This environment and these flowers
have been specially prepared

73
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
for your arrival.

74
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,279
Your Highness, look over there.

75
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,160
There are a few very rare varieties.

76
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,440
Come on, have a look.

77
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,120
It's really beautiful.

78
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,879
The Luoyang officialdom is
full of hidden talents.

79
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,439
Mr. Liu has put in great effort

80
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,560
to gather so many

81
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
renowned items rarely seen even in Chang'an.

82
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,639
My daughter-in-law is skilled
at cultivating peonies.

83
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,040
She can cultivate
even the most novel varieties.

84
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,600
Floral Envoy, if there's any you want,

85
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,519
you can take it home to enjoy
to your heart's content.

86
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,960
That's your dowry, my lady.

87
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,879
If they belong to the young lady.

88
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,879
I'll pass.

89
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,960
A true gentleman

90
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,000
does not take what others love.

91
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,240
Today, I wanted

92
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,440
to adorn my hair with fresh flowers.

93
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
But the inn was so shabby

94
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,039
that I couldn't find a suitable one.

95
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,080
But this garden full of peonies

96
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,559
does seem fitting.

97
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,320
This one, right? I see.

98
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,576
Hold on.

99
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,200
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

100
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,679
the peonies are flattered

101
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,679
by your affection.

102
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,639
But these peonies

103
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,279
are the dowry given by my father and mother.

104
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,480
Even if I am dull,

105
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,960
I dare not be unfilial.

106
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,080
I hope Your Highness can show mercy.

107
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,840
Whether you are filial or not

108
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,000
is of no consequence to me.

109
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,600
Youzhen.

110
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,639
Since it is her dowry, let it be.

111
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,639
Zishu, it's just a flower.

112
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,679
Can't you bear to part with it?

113
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,759
But…

114
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,799
As the daughter of the imperial family,

115
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,679
you must have seen all the rare things.

116
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,440
To be honest,

117
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,600
these peonies

118
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,080
are just ordinary flowers

119
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,600
in your eyes, Your Highness.

120
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,159
But to me,

121
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,159
they are of considerable value
to carry with oneself.

122
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,159
I hope you can show leniency.

123
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,720
Why bother quibbling with a woman
of no significance like me?

124
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
After all is said and done,

125
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
it's all about money.

126
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,279
Indeed.

127
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,039
Peonies are flowers in our eyes.

128
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,919
But in the eyes of merchants,

129
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,639
they are nuggets of gold.

130
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,399
That's true, Your Highness.

131
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,679
As long as we take the branches of these
flowers, plant them in the soil,

132
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,120
and tend to them diligently,

133
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,799
next Spring, they will bloom,
one flower becoming two.

134
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,440
They're more than just nuggets of gold.

135
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,120
They're practically a wealth-bringing
deity that generates money annually.

136
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,552
Enough.

137
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,720
My wife is a vulgar huckster

138
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,120
and has offended the County Princess.

139
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,840
Your Highness,

140
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,320
please don't stoop to her level.

141
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,039
The County Princess is naturally beautiful.

142
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,360
Even without fresh flowers adorning her,

143
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,600
her grace stands out.

144
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,519
Other vulgar powders and
rogue creams in the garden

145
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,720
cannot hold a candle to her.

146
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,759
Let it be.

147
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,399
Let's leave these nuggets of gold

148
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,440
to the young lady.

149
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,720
I am magnanimous.

150
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,816
So be it.

151
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

152
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,399
Your Highness.

153
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,840
Allow me to take you to the Water Jade
Pavilion for a rest. This way, please.

154
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,960
Your Highness.

155
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
To do as one says,

156
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,360
I've come to help you

157
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,600
get rid of the troublemakers.

158
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,559
Do you want the 100-set way

159
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,759
or the 80-set way?

160
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
I won't let go of even a single flower.
I am very stingy.

161
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
So how can I afford to summon the Floral Envoy?

162
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,200
Moreover,

163
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
my own troublemakers

164
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,240
should rightfully be dealt with by myself.

165
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,399
No need to trouble you.

166
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,424
Floral Envoy.

167
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,960
Keeper Chen.

168
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,399
Long time no see.

169
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
You are as dashing and suave as ever.

170
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,840
The Liu Mansion has never
been this lively before.

171
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,320
Look at the lady of the house
with that sycophantic look,

172
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
they even mock you for being vulgar.

173
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,759
Where are they any better?

174
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
If I don't pretend to be

175
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,559
greedy for money,

176
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,480
how could the County Princess have
so easily given up just now?

177
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,159
These peonies

178
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,200
are the keepsakes my mother left me.

179
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,799
I must protect them.

180
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,840
What does it matter
if people disdain me a little?

181
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,208
Are you here for the flowers?

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,344
There are more over there.

183
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,320
How brazen.

184
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,600
Don't say that. These are
the young lady's golden goose.

185
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,720
The County Princess looks at
the lord with deep affection.

186
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,919
She must have old feelings for him.

187
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,679
That's why she deliberately made
things difficult for you, my lady.

188
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,879
It doesn't matter.

189
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,159
If Liu Chang and the County Princess

190
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,519
wish to rekindle their past relationship,

191
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,279
they certainly won't make room for me.

192
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,399
If he initiates the divorce,

193
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,360
it would be the Liu family breaking
the marriage contract first.

194
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,080
I have no reason not to agree.

195
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,879
To me,

196
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,759
this may be a good opportunity.

197
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,080
But once divorced,

198
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,320
others will regard you as a cast-off wife.

199
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,039
Arranging another marriage later on might be…

200
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,519
Silly Yulu.

201
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,559
Life

202
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,840
is yours to live.

203
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,919
Why bother about others' views?

204
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,159
These two are the daughters of Commandant Wang.

205
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,200
Heye, Hehua.

206
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,399
Greet the Floral Envoy.

207
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,720
I've always thought

208
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
that corrupt officials are either fat-headed

209
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,559
or weasel-faced.

210
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,200
I've never expected the Floral Envoy

211
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,799
to be so dashing and handsome.

212
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,320
Look at those unmarried ladies.

213
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Their eyes are practically glued to him.

214
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,240
Common folks

215
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
tending to their own plot of land

216
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,320
are seen as vulgar and coarse

217
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,679
in their eyes.

218
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,399
While the officials insatiably greedy

219
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,519
who accept bribes

220
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,200
are the best marriage material

221
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,799
and the ladder to climb up the ranks

222
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,480
in their eyes.

223
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,399
The Current Officialdom

224
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,399
is becoming more and more miasmic.

225
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,159
Ladies and gentlemen.

226
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,320
Noon has arrived.

227
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,080
Please take your seats.

228
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
Please.

229
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,159
Mr. Chen, apologies
for the imperfect hospitality.

230
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,480
This is a small token of my feelings.

231
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,159
Come, please.

232
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,240
Mr. Chen.

233
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,328
Please.

234
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,720
- After you.
- Please.

235
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,399
Your Highness, please.

236
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,480
Please take the upper seat.

237
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,159
The County Princess

238
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,159
actually took the seat
of the Liu family's young lady.

239
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,279
Isn't this openly slapping Madam He's face?

240
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,279
The County Princess, recently widowed,

241
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,279
went nowhere

242
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,639
but Luoyang.

243
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,919
This Mr. Liu

244
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,480
is a minor judge today,

245
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,960
but in the future, he might just be
transferred to the capital and rise rapidly.

246
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,519
Your Highness, this is not proper etiquette.

247
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,720
Zishu, it has been a long time since I saw you.

248
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,159
I don't want to be too far from you.

249
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,360
Please, sit down.

250
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,840
My lady, shall we…

251
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,799
It's alright.

252
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,360
There are seats over there, let's go.

253
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,440
This garden is full of peonies.

254
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,279
There's no place for the Albizia flower.

255
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,960
No flowers, no fruit.

256
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,480
It does match.

257
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,679
Zishu, sit down.

258
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:20,448
Okay.

259
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,679
This family of troublemakers

260
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,279
is truly interesting.

261
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,000
This wine is good.

262
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,208
Chuanyu.

263
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,400
My lord.

264
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,599
How is this dance compared to the Pear Garden

265
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,864
in the palace?

266
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,559
Naturally, it can't compete.

267
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,640
But it is quite presentable.

268
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
It's more than just presentable.

269
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,599
The look in the eyes and the posture
of holding an umbrella

270
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,400
clearly have a familiar

271
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,640
murderous aura

272
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,240
of martial artists.

273
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,799
Youzhen, be careful.

274
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,559
Protect the County Princess.

275
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,839
My lady, get up quickly.

276
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,992
Quickly.

277
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,559
Go.

278
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,840
Don't move.

279
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,559
Treacherous official Jiang,

280
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,079
you let the emperor indulge in pleasure,
bringing chaos to the court hierarchy.

281
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,359
The Integrity Society is here

282
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,519
to act for heaven.

283
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,559
Overestimating one's own ability.

284
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,799
Does the Floral Envoy know kung fu?

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,119
I've never heard of it.

286
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,559
This is an imperial sword
bestowed by His Majesty.

287
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,839
When the sharp blade is unsheathed,

288
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,279
it's as if His Majesty has arrived in person.

289
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,680
What are you waiting for?

290
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,720
Protect the royal sword.

291
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,759
Be careful.

292
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,119
Don't splatter blood everywhere.

293
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,960
Staining the beautiful garments of the ladies

294
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,079
would be a pity.

295
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,799
Be careful, Yulu.

296
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,039
Don't cut my flowers. Fight over there.

297
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,272
My lady.

298
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,200
My lady, you scared me.

299
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,759
How could you just charge out like that?

300
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,759
I was scared.

301
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,279
I thought they had cut my flowers.

302
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,160
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine, are you?

303
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,880
- I'm okay.
- Control your strength well.

304
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
Do not harm the flowers.

305
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,680
The gold nuggets of the young Lady Liu

306
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,160
are too expensive to compensate.

307
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,240
He was previously acting as a ghost

308
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,599
inside the Fuyun Temple.

309
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,839
And now he fully reveals

310
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,319
the posture of someone borrowing power.

311
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,839
This favored one by His Majesty

312
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,839
is indeed not ordinary.

313
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,480
Kneel.

314
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,039
It was due to my negligence

315
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,480
in checking identities thoroughly

316
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,319
that the thieves mixed into the assembly.

317
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,079
Fortunately, the County Princess
was not injured.

318
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,960
But still, it disturbed the elegant interest
of the County Princess and the Floral Envoy.

319
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,599
Please forgive me.

320
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,440
The Liu family failed to inspect

321
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,519
and startled the County Princess
and the Floral Envoy.

322
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,119
Please show great magnanimity

323
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,160
and deal with it leniently.

324
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,400
Zishu, what are you doing?

325
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,784
Get up quickly.

326
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,440
Get up.

327
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,240
For the sake of you,

328
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,752
I won't pursue it.

329
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,480
What do you say, Floral Envoy?

330
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Forget it.

331
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,359
This matter can't really be blamed on Lord Liu.

332
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,480
You…

333
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,599
It was just a matter of poor luck.

334
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,000
If today the one receiving us
was the Keeper Chen,

335
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,759
there would still be such a commotion.

336
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,279
Assaults, assassination attempts.

337
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
It happens several times each month.

338
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm already used to it.

339
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,000
Look how skilled my subordinates are.

340
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,039
Mr. Liu, no need to take it to heart.

341
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,400
Everyone, get up.

342
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,799
Thank you for your clemency,
Your Highness, Floral Envoy.

343
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,640
Having committed many evils,
he has invited pursuit and killing.

344
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,759
He doesn't take it as a warning,

345
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,079
and yet, he's proud of it.

346
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,319
You have broad minds.

347
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,720
I am ashamed for not measuring up.

348
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,599
Thank you, Your Highness.

349
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,160
Didn't you change the way
of addressing me just now?

350
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,400
Why are you reverting to it again?

351
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,440
I still prefer you to call me by my name.

352
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Youzhen, it's chaos here.

353
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,519
Let's go admire the flowers somewhere else

354
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,559
so that the servants tidying up
won't bother you.

355
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,359
- Okay.
- Please.

356
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,680
Ladies and gentlemen.

357
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,119
Thank you for coming.

358
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,400
Please forgive me for my poor hospitality.

359
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,599
Mr. Liu.

360
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,640
You are humble.

361
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,720
In today's floral banquet,
the peonies are dazzling.

362
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,920
We

363
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,240
were honored to feast our eyes

364
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,519
in the light of the County Princess

365
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,799
and the Floral Envoy.

366
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,799
The County Princess and the Floral
Envoy are staying here.

367
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,640
It will certainly lead to many banquets
and feasts in the future.

368
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,880
Our two families

369
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,240
must interact with each other more frequently.

370
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,920
Of course.

371
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,720
Floral Envoy.

372
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,079
This banquet cannot continue.

373
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,559
I shall take my leave first.

374
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,039
Everyone, please hold on.

375
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,079
Now that the assassin has been captured,

376
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,799
where is everyone going?

377
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,680
Let's continue drinking

378
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,759
and the entertainment.

379
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,599
That's the proper thing to do.

380
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,119
Exactly, exactly.

381
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,319
I will summon people to clean up immediately.

382
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,160
- Servants.
- No need for that.

383
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,240
Leave it to my men.

384
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,000
They are experienced.

385
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,839
Chuanyu.

386
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,392
Yes.

387
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,359
You know what to do.

388
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,160
- Take the assassin away. Tidy up the scene.
- Yes.

389
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,839
Aren't all corrupt officials afraid of death?

390
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,799
Even so, the Floral Envoy still has the mood

391
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,160
to continue feasting.

392
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,119
One who is shameless never
worries about anything.

393
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,720
- Shameless Jiang.
- Kneel properly.

394
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,920
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

395
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,000
Please move to the garden.

396
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,824
This way, please.

397
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,720
Seeing how proficient these subordinates are,

398
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,880
I can't help but want to shout 'bravo'.

399
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,440
Although I don't mind assassination,

400
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,599
before I came,

401
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,920
His Majesty specifically instructed me

402
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,720
to see if Luoyang

403
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,799
is as outstanding and spiritually
vibrant as the rumors say.

404
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,440
How should I report

405
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,279
today's events to His Majesty

406
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,799
when I return to Chang'an?

407
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,759
I…

408
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,119
Mr. Liu, there's no need for this.

409
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,640
I don't need your courtesies.

410
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,359
Well, Floral Envoy,

411
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,640
how much tangible courtesy

412
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,359
can exempt one from the crime of negligence?

413
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,319
This crime

414
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,799
can be big or small,

415
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,079
depending on how fast

416
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,440
my returning carriage goes.

417
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,599
I am a forgetful person.

418
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,839
If the journey back is long enough,

419
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,920
by the time I return to Chang'an,

420
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,039
I will have forgotten everything.

421
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,519
Then, His Majesty will only know that Luoyang

422
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,559
is warm with flowers blooming
and the common folk prospering.

423
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,720
The gifts for His Majesty

424
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,160
and the Floral Envoy

425
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,839
will be enough to make it difficult
for the horses to take a step.

426
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,000
Please rest assured.

427
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,279
Mr. Liu is a clear-headed person.

428
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,640
In the future, you will certainly

429
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,000
rise rapidly through the ranks.

430
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,920
Thank you, Floral Envoy.

431
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,279
Having had plenty of wine and food,

432
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,720
why not play something

433
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,960
to stretch our limbs a bit?

434
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
I remember that Zishu is quite fond of archery.

435
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,039
Do you have a target for archery?

436
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,319
Yes, yes.

437
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,160
County Princess, please.

438
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,944
Please.

439
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,720
Mudan, go prepare some refreshments.

440
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,400
- After you, Suizhi.
- Please.

441
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,519
How did it go off-target?

442
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,480
Jiang.

443
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,079
A gust of spring breeze just came by.

444
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,680
Although it messed up your aim,

445
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,640
it is a good omen of success
in the spring breeze.

446
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,759
Jiang.

447
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,319
Joyous events are approaching.

448
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,359
You have such sayings in Luoyang.

449
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,440
Well…

450
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,039
No competing for the colors of spring,

451
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,880
in autumn, it shall ascend
into the cloud-filled skies.

452
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,200
Floral Envoy.

453
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,519
This truly is a great omen of good fortune.

454
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,640
- That's right.
- Well said, well said.

455
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,720
Great fortune, great fortune.

456
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,559
Great fortune, oh great fortune.

457
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,720
Archery is uninteresting.

458
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
Better to switch to pitching pots, huh?

459
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,799
- Alright.
- Pitching pots.

460
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,799
Right, right.

461
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,480
Pitching pots, pitching pots is good.

462
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,680
Let's all go to the garden to pitch pots.

463
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,759
County Princess, please.

464
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,720
- Let's go.
- Please, please, please.

465
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,400
After you.

466
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,000
- Jiang.
- You go ahead.

467
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,359
<i>Why does this person
deliberately hide his abilities?</i>

468
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,559
<i>And why did he aim solely
at this wealth-attracting copper coin?</i>

469
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:52,799
A small token of appreciation.

470
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,440
- Thank you.
- Take care, take care.

471
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,720
Mr. Li, here you go.

472
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
Thank you.

473
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,640
Mrs. Zhang, please take care on your way.

474
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,119
- Thank you.
- See you again.

475
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,512
Thank you.

476
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,079
I just ran into that lad at the second gate

477
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,160
and found out

478
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,119
that those carriages brought
by the Floral Envoy

479
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,240
were all empty.

480
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,039
Those carriages were personally
bestowed by His Majesty,

481
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,160
representing the supreme
honor and favor of His Majesty.

482
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
And the rule of the Floral Envoy is

483
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,720
to travel with empty carriages

484
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,039
and return fully loaded.

485
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,720
Indeed, he is the number
one greedy official in the world.

486
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,240
The Floral Envoy is unfathomable,

487
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,000
and not as simple as he appears.

488
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,480
Let's not interfere with this matter.

489
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,599
The most important thing is to go
and find the lady of the house

490
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,599
to move the peonies back
to my courtyard as soon as possible.

491
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,720
Only then can I be at ease.

492
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,480
But it's impossible for Mudan to raise
so much money all at once.

493
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,920
And there is no way to get it from home.

494
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,799
It seems

495
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,599
that the only option is to sell
the imperial-granted Zixi pills

496
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,759
in order to raise the funds.

497
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,039
The tribute medicine can save lives

498
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,480
when the time comes.

499
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,920
They can never be sold.

500
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,519
When He entered the family,

501
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,400
didn't her father give us a large sum of money?

502
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,519
Now it's all spent.

503
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,759
How have you been managing the household?

504
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,839
My Lord.

505
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,079
Two distinguished guests have come.

506
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,559
Not to mention the expenses

507
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,920
of the banquet hosted for them,

508
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,319
they are going to stay here for a while.

509
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,400
Even if we had a gold mine,

510
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,480
it would not be enough.

511
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Women simply

512
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,599
lack foresight.

513
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,039
The future career prospects of our son

514
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,119
and the Liu family's reputation

515
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,599
all depend on these few days.

516
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,799
But right now…

517
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,119
Didn't someone make an offer

518
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,880
on He's dowry,

519
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,960
those few shops?

520
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,880
Have Xiangfu take the accountant

521
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,000
and sell them.

522
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,119
It should tide us over for a while.

523
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Don't even think about touching
the tribute medicine.

524
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,839
We must not let He discover

525
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:37,279
that what we gave back then was a forgery.

526
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,880
If her father gets wind of it,

527
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,039
it will be difficult to ask him for money
to grease the wheels in the future.

528
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,039
Don't act impulsively.

529
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,680
Let's go back first.

530
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,344
Let's go back,

531
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,759
I thought…

532
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,000
I thought Mother was too ill.

533
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,839
Even with the expensive Zixi pills,

534
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,440
it didn't turn the tide.

535
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,160
But I never expected…

536
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,440
I never expected the pills to be fake.

537
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,400
Why did they deceive me?

538
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,559
Why?

539
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,720
I clearly could have had more time.

540
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,640
I could have more time

541
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,880
to look for other miraculous medicines.

542
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,000
My lady.

543
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,039
My lady, don't be like this, my lady.

544
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,032
My lady.

545
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,880
It's all because of my incompetence.

546
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,119
It's all because of my incompetence.

547
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,160
If I had discovered earlier

548
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,880
that the Zixi pills were fake,

549
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,160
I could have wasted no time

550
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,480
in seeking medical advice.

551
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,279
Mother…

552
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,200
Mother might have been saved.

553
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,279
She wouldn't have left me.

554
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,720
I was foolish, I was too foolish.

555
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,960
I was foolish, I was too foolish.

556
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,079
Don't be like this, my lady.

557
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,480
Don't be like this.

558
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,160
My lady.

559
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,680
The Master has been selling
medicine for so many years,

560
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,640
but he's never seen a real Zixi pill.

561
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,519
The fake medicine and the one
described in the medical books

562
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,119
smell and appear exactly the same.

563
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,880
Furthermore, as soon as Madam took it,

564
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,799
there indeed was some improvement.

565
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:06,200
It's only natural that you didn't notice.

566
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,639
It's the Liu family to blame,

567
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,679
not you, my lady.

568
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,719
My lady,

569
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,719
if Madam sees you

570
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,320
this heartbroken and self-reproaching,

571
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,039
she will definitely be heartbroken.

572
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,639
That's right.

573
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,960
I shouldn't torment myself for such a family.

574
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,679
Their lies have delayed

575
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,760
the treatment period for Mother.

576
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,079
I will certainly make them

577
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,360
pay the price.

578
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
I will certainly make them

579
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,199
pay the price.

580
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,400
But we are weak and alone.

581
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,639
How can we fight against them?

582
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,360
If we confront them now,

583
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,239
they will surely deny everything.

584
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,679
How about…

585
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,760
How about we tell

586
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,840
the Master about this

587
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,239
to seek justice?

588
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,760
No.

589
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,199
We have no evidence now.

590
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
Even if we involve Father,

591
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,840
it would be of no help.

592
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,039
Even if we turn Liu's house upside down

593
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,599
and find the real tribute medicine,

594
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,159
they will not admit it.

595
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,840
When that happens and the families fall out,

596
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,199
we of the He family, being mere merchants,

597
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
might bear the stigma

598
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,480
of being ungrateful and treacherous.

599
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,440
What we can do now

600
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,480
is to withdraw from the Liu family intact.

601
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,920
Once we get home,

602
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,960
we'll plan our next step.

603
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,952
In any case,

604
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,719
I cannot stay a moment longer

605
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,000
at this place of cruelty.

606
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,400
My lady, you want a divorce.

607
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,200
That's right.

608
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,119
Liu Shen insisted on me
marrying into the Liu family

609
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,360
for my birth characters.

610
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,599
He will surely not let me go easily.

611
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,679
Tomorrow the Liu family will accompany
the County Princess on a trip.

612
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,440
We can take this opportunity

613
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,119
to take back the dowry shops.

614
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,320
We must not let them sell them at will.

615
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,240
My lady.

616
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,679
Liu Shen does not want to let me leave.

617
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,719
But the County Princess and Liu Chang

618
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,280
can't wait for me to disappear.

619
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,719
Yulu, pass the message for me.

620
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,679
Why did you

621
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,216
call me here?

622
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,800
Everyone thinks

623
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,679
that peonies are exclusive to the nobility.

624
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,000
But they forget

625
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,239
that they originate
from the mountains and forests

626
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,559
and once bloomed

627
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,960
and withered away freely.

628
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,920
The flowers before us

629
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,199
are the fine specimens

630
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,519
gathered by Mother while accompanying
Father on his business trips

631
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:44,760
traveling across all regions.

632
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,480
Mother brought them to me

633
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,159
and taught me how to cultivate them with care.

634
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,000
Without my mother,

635
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,679
there wouldn't be the grand spectacle

636
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,119
that made the County Princess
and the Floral Envoy

637
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,159
praise unanimously.

638
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,000
Did you call me here just to tell me

639
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,400
how precious these beloved
golden nuggets of yours are,

640
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,800
how rare they are,

641
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,280
and how magnificent you were
at today's floral banquet?

642
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,800
If you wish to bestow a reward,

643
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,440
you may say so directly.

644
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,920
For the sake of these flowers,

645
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,159
as long as it's not too excessive,

646
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,519
I can agree to it.

647
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,840
I want a divorce.

648
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:38,816
What did you say?

649
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,672
I said,

650
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,679
I want a divorce.

651
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,952
What nonsense are you talking about?

652
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,840
Is it because of me and the County Princess?

653
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,519
My relationship with Youzhen…

654
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,159
That's right.

655
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:05,719
You and the County Princess
are mutually in love,

656
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,440
a match made in heaven.

657
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,880
While my status is humble,

658
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,199
detrimental to your reputation, so,

659
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,719
I am willing to leave the Liu family

660
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,840
to make your relationship possible.

661
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,559
You speak so many self-deprecating words

662
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,239
to grant yourself a favor, don't you?

663
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,000
Indeed.

664
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,599
Merchants value profit over righteousness.

665
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,639
Don't forget

666
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,840
that it was the He family

667
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
who came asking for medicine.

668
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,400
And now that the benefits are exhausted,

669
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,199
you think of breaking the agreement.

670
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,760
Our marriage began

671
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,159
all because of a sorcerer's words.

672
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,920
Even if there's no commiseration,

673
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,679
you should understand the other's helplessness.

674
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,400
Since you're weary of me

675
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,480
and this marriage arrangement,

676
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,800
why not let me leave?

677
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:58,840
This way, you'll also be free.

678
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,159
I disagree.

679
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:03,936
Why?

680
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,000
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

681
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,199
What I want

682
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,639
is not for you to decide.

683
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,159
You married into the Liu family.

684
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,800
Where you go and what you do
is all decided by me, your husband.

685
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,320
I have not yet said I will divorce you.

686
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,480
On what grounds do you
bring up divorce with me?

687
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,320
Matters of divorce

688
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,039
won't be my initiative.

689
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,199
You can submit documents to the authorities.

690
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,159
In the eyes of the public,

691
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,400
it will be you getting rid of me.

692
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,280
In your eyes, do I care that much

693
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,320
about how those unrelated people

694
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,920
see me, is that it?

695
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,159
- Liu Chang.
- What I truly care about

696
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,559
is whether my marriage stays or ends

697
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,880
is all up to me.

698
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,360
Others have no right to manipulate me,

699
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,519
let alone you.

700
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,679
He Weifang, listen well to me.

701
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,440
Although our marriage lacks substance,

702
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,880
the name of it

703
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,679
is not for you to just discard.

704
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,800
Unless I divorce you,

705
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,199
otherwise, don't think of leaving this place.

706
