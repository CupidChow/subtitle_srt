<i>[Episode 14]</i>

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,920
You dare to curse the County Magistrate

4
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,640
to justify your divorce.

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,680
You are truly a heroine.

6
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,000
I think that Liu Chang
is quite different from his parents.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,719
He knows to apologize and reflect himself,

8
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,760
does not swerve one's principles for wealth.

9
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,560
He is much better than Wang Qing.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,439
His sincerity towards you is genuine.

11
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,719
You could be on the mind of such a gentleman,

12
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,560
I really envy you.

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,560
Silly Shengyi, it's not like that
if he really cares for me.

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,599
He doesn't care what I think
and persistently pester me.

15
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,240
This is not sincerity, but selfishness.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,360
Don't envy me on this.

17
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,800
Right, have you sent the invitation
to the flower guild?

18
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,360
I went to send it,
but the servant didn't accept it,

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,000
and said that only the shop owner's
personal visit would show sincerity.

20
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,120
I just don't understand.

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,680
Our business is going well,

22
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,759
why do we go join the flower guild

23
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,759
and to be looked down?

24
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,840
Each industry has its own rules.

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Whether it is stabilizing prices
or collecting taxes,

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
it is all the responsibility of the guild.

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,479
And all the flower business in Chang'an
is controlled by the flower guild.

28
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,120
If we want our business to go smoothly,

29
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,520
we must join the guild.

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,639
Before, we were running a small business

31
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,240
and couldn't catch their attention.

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
But now,

33
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,319
we have to interact with them.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,639
The guild head has great prestige,

35
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,479
must not be offended.

36
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,319
Previously, Wang Qing had a dispute
with the head of the wine guild.

37
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,439
A single word from him
nearly caused us to shut down.

38
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,360
Later on, we pleaded
multiple times at their door,

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,560
only then did we receive his forgiveness.

40
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,039
This is outrageous.

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,240
This is the truth. The guild head
is the head of this market.

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,800
Right. We should

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,000
try to keep a low profile and be generous.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,680
If we can successfully join the guild,

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,120
our future business could run more smoothly.

Understood.

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,639
Why are you here again?

50
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,008
I told you to ask your shop owner
to come in person.

51
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:00,800
I am…

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,199
I am here to see the guild head,
please lead the way.

53
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,400
Mr. Bai, please.

54
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,759
We were here first.

55
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,480
Why do you let them go in first?

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,319
They are the shop owners themselves.

57
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,560
And you are three young ladies.

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Such negligence, don't you know the rules?

59
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,560
- We are…
- I am the shop owner of Huamanzhu.

60
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,439
The two of them opened the shop with me.

Let's go.

68
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:56,519
Master, the lady shop owner of Huamanzhu
has been waiting for long,

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
and her companions are getting impatient.

70
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,199
Guild head, Master,
would you like to meet them?

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,680
They think of joining the guild
only after the shop is opened.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,519
We must curb her arrogance.

73
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,240
Keep refilling with water
after they finished the tea.

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,560
We'll go see them when it's time.

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't come anymore.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,072
Yes.

77
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,879
Yuying, let's go once we finish this cup.

78
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,240
Mr. Lv, you're too kind.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,560
She's just a young lady.

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,160
Leave her hanging longer and she'll panic.

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,199
Then it'll be easier for us
to talk about serious matters.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,639
Okay, then we'll do as you say.

83
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,639
I heard your third daughter is betrothed.

84
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,639
Congratulations!

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,040
Likewise!

86
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,319
I have to thank the deputy guild head
for being the matchmaker.

87
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,399
Yuying, you are not acting fairly.

88
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,279
My Chun's marriage is still not settled.

89
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,959
Any gentleman to recommend?

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,480
Mr. Lv, don't be joking.

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,519
Your Chun is raised so well,

92
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,759
elegant, gentle and refined.

93
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,800
I think she deserves to marry a top scholar.

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,360
Indeed.

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,600
Our daughters all learn needlework
at the guild head's house.

96
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,720
This handkerchief was embroidered
by my third daughter the other day.

97
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,160
Look at this bamboo, so vivid.

98
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,959
Guild head, this was embroidered
by my young daughter.

99
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,600
See if it's better than
what his third daughter did.

100
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,560
I've heard

101
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,560
that the embroidery skills
of your daughter Chun are the best.

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,120
Guild head, may we see it?

103
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,432
Right.

104
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,639
Recently I've been busy
with a business deal in Jiangnan,

105
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,079
it's been three days since I went home.

106
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,319
It's still not delivered.

107
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Father, you're still coughing,
yet still not resting properly.

108
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
You are making me worry.

109
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,600
Chun, why are you here?

110
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,879
Greetings.

111
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,759
I'm worried about you,

112
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,160
so I have specially cooked
a nourishing ginseng soup.

113
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,944
Take a look.

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,519
Father, drink it while it's hot.

115
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,320
Okay.

116
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,000
Chun is really filial.

117
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,959
Chun, we were mentioning you just now

118
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,439
that your embroidery skills are excellent.

119
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,279
Did you bring
the newly embroidered handkerchief?

120
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,959
Your father just saw that we all have one,

121
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,399
and he was really envious.

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,544
Indeed.

123
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm flattered.

124
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,360
All others' embroidery skills are excellent.

125
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
She brought it.

126
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,056
Take a look.

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,399
T-This is…

128
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,959
Balloon flower and green onion.

129
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,560
You have been coughing recently,

130
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,279
so I've added them to the ginseng soup

131
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,519
to nourish you.

132
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,480
Don't you like it?

133
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,639
Yes.

134
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,519
It's so vivid.

135
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,576
- Good.
- Take a look.

136
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,304
Okay.

137
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,199
The shop owners who entered before us

138
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,279
left right away after finishing the job,
in less than a quarter.

139
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,519
While, we've waited from morning till dusk.

140
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,680
What does this mean?
You did it on purpose, right?

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,759
Fu, calm down, have some water.

142
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,800
Mudan, the guild head might not come.

143
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,680
There's no one to pour the water.

144
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,759
Anyone to pour water?

145
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,839
- This child is…
- Here he comes.

146
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,839
She's really filial.

147
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,976
Here he comes.

148
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Guild head, Deputy guild head.

149
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,792
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

150
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,960
The flower guild has lots of affairs.

151
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,919
We are all grateful for the two of you
taking the time to be here.

152
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,600
The Huamanzhu's business is flourishing.

153
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,559
It's rare for you to come here

154
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,879
yourself.

155
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,200
I've just arrived. Previously,
we just ran a small business,

156
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,080
and we were not familiar with the rules.

157
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I've come today to apologize.

158
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,312
Fu.

159
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,240
The flower guild prospers,
all thanks to both of you.

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,559
I would like to join the flower guild today.

161
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,679
I hope to contribute my part to the guild.

162
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,279
I hope the two of you will agree.

163
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,208
Please take a seat.

164
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,128
Thank you, guild head.

165
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,039
The women usually do business
by setting up stalls in the market.

166
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,440
Those who can open shops
in the West Market rely on their husbands.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,120
Once you are married,

168
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,000
the shop will have to be sold off.

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,759
Why not hand over the shop
to the guild to manage today?

170
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,240
We will give you a fair price.

171
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,440
You can work as a floriculturist
in the guild's shop,

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,639
so your talent won't be wasted.

173
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,279
I have no intention of getting married.

174
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,960
You seem to be
about the same age as my daughter.

175
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,399
I guess you might not mean it.

176
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,600
You will have to support your husband,
raise children, and respect your in-laws.

177
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,799
It's hard to manage the family affairs well.

178
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,320
We are doing this for your own good.

179
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,279
Once you are married and have children,

180
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,919
you will have no time
to take care of the business.

181
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
We carefully select shops

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,080
qualified to be in the guild.

183
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,799
If you work for few years
and then suddenly quit,

184
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,559
it's the guild's reputation that is lost.

185
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,759
After a man gets married and has children,

186
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,480
it does not hinder the operation of the shop.

187
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,080
Even if I do get married one day,

188
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,279
it will not affect the business.

189
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,320
If a man can…

190
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,399
Why are you so stubborn?

191
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,120
Can you do the same as a man?

192
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,639
Doing business is not as simple as you think.

193
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,080
Guild head, our shop involves much.

194
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,879
We still owe money to others now.

195
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,879
To tell you the truth,

196
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,120
we rely on Huamanzhu to make a living.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,919
We hope the two of you
will show us some leniency.

198
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,799
Huamanzhu is willing to purchase
from the flower farmers and florists

199
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,799
that the flower guild designated

200
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,039
and will definitely abide by the rules.

201
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,080
Since you say so,

202
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,159
the flower guild
is not a place without negotiation.

203
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,320
If you want to quiet the debate,

204
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,448
you have

205
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,759
to accept more share
than that of the shops opened by men.

206
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,799
Do you accept?

207
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,639
How much of a share do you want?

208
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,759
Fifty-fifty.

209
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,960
Fifty-fifty?

210
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,200
We already have a greedy creditor.

211
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,120
If we split fifty-fifty with you,
what can we earn?

212
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,848
You guys are outrageous.

213
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:43,936
Fu.

214
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,480
Why do women have to pay more than men?

215
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,159
How are we any worse than them?

216
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,799
All of you were born and raised by a woman.

217
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,480
Fu, stop it.

218
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,679
Look, I told you.

219
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,960
Only women and mean people
are hard to reason with.

220
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,519
Guild head, you wanted to give them a chance.

221
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,159
Look, how crude and rude!

222
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,159
If such people were to join the guild,

223
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,159
that's beyond imagination.

224
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,799
Who are you calling crude and rude?

225
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,519
It was you who interrupted Mudan first.

226
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,336
Moreover,

227
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,559
why do you care about
when we marry and have children?

228
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,120
- Stop it.
- Who do you think you are?

229
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,200
You're not my father.

230
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,848
Fu.

231
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,536
Go back.

232
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,264
Fu.

233
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,960
Don't act impulsively.

234
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,919
Guild head, a fifty-fifty share
is truly hard for us to accept.

235
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,960
Huamanzhu's business is thriving now.

236
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,639
You surely know this.

237
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,799
Such disdain. Is it just because we are women?

238
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,320
Before, there was no precedent
for a lady shop owner to join.

239
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,960
If you join and sit on an equal footing
with all the men,

240
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,159
it may be difficult to stop the public debate.

241
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,919
If you really find it difficult,

242
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,879
a forty-sixty share works as well.

243
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,879
I hope you could consider it carefully.

244
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
It is already showing you some mercy.

245
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
When asking for favors, don't be ungrateful.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,240
I came here with sincerity,

247
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,159
wishing to share honor
and disgrace with the guild.

248
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,440
I did not expect

249
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,279
that the guild would have
such unreasonable rules,

250
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,039
disdaining us women.

251
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,440
Since then, there is nothing more to discuss.

252
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,360
I take my leave. Let's go.

253
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,279
Don't act on your emotions.

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,919
We can't afford to offend the flower guild.

255
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,440
Maybe we should talk to them again.

256
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,480
Although Fu has a bad temper,

257
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
her words are reasonable.

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Since we already have

259
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
a non-negotiable profit-sharing contract,

260
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,039
if the guild oppresses us like this,

261
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,840
then what's the point
of running this shop? Let's go.

262
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,360
Lady, I'm not only doing business
with you alone.

263
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,919
The flower guild has said

264
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,799
you disrespect to the guild head
and defy the industry rules.

265
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,240
If I keep supplying Huamanzhu with fertilizer,

266
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,080
then I can't do business
with other shops in the guild.

267
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
We'll buy from you in secret,

268
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,200
and the guild will never find out.

269
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,360
This has happened before.

270
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,559
But the guild has eyes and ears everywhere.

271
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,600
And the amount of fertilizer you want
is really too much.

272
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,039
You can't hide it from them.

273
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,120
I'm really sorry.

274
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,039
Please leave.

275
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,159
We can transport it at night.

276
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,279
The price is negotiable.

277
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,679
Forget it, Fu, let's go.

278
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,639
The guild is so ruthless,

279
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,039
cutting off all our channels
for getting fertilizer.

280
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,320
Mudan, if we buy fertilizer from farther away,

281
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
can we apply the fertilizer later?

282
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,320
No, once we miss
the optimal fertilizing period,

283
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,279
no matter how we make up for it later,

284
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,960
this batch of flowers won't bloom well.

285
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,519
Then shall we go to the guild

286
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,039
and give in to them?

287
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,039
How can that be?

288
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,559
Sometimes, when a woman shows weakness,
she can gain a man's pity.

289
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,799
Let's just bear with it

290
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,279
and get through this difficulty first.

291
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,759
No, if we give in now,

292
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,120
it would only make them
look down on us even more.

293
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,519
Do you really want
to go for a sixty-forty share?

294
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,519
The guild

295
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,200
is belittling us women in business.

296
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
Since we've chosen this path,

297
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,279
we're going to face
more difficulties in the future.

298
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,879
Are we to yield and give in every time?

299
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,440
There is a saying, "A moment of patience
can prevent a great disaster".

300
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,679
If a moment of patience
can bring future stability,

301
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,960
then it's worth it.

302
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,639
The guild treats us this way,

303
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,399
wanting to let us bow down.

304
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,279
If we tolerate them this time,

305
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,759
they will act even more outrageous.

306
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,200
And others will follow suit,

307
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,000
then anyone can bully us.

308
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
If we want to earn others' respect,

309
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,279
we must be self-dignified first.

310
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,919
Then the flower fertilizer…

311
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,159
If we can't buy it, let's make it ourselves.

312
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,799
The spent dregs from the pharmacy,

313
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,679
the discarded feathers and manure
from the butcher,

314
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,279
and the leftover bones and fish bones
from the restaurant.

315
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,200
They are all good materials
for making fertilizer.

316
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,639
Let's collect them at a low price,

317
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,679
find a piece of uncultivated wasteland
and work hard for some time,

318
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,080
then we will surely make our own fertilizer.

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,480
There are always ways out. Let's eat first.

320
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,248
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

321
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,919
Dishes are here.

322
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,568
Come on.

323
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:51,955
<i>♫ The Luo River cleanses the moonlight haze ♫</i>

324
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Be careful.

325
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,832
Don't drop it.

326
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
Fu.

327
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,656
Come on.

328
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:16,416
<i>♫ Let not the secular world constrain ♫</i>

329
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,392
<i>♫ How can they guess with mundane eyes ♫</i>

330
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,152
Take it slow.

331
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,232
Take it slow.

332
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,728
How is it?

333
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,880
- Done.
- Done.

334
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,200
- Great!
- Done.

335
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,240
Come on.

336
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,032
<i>♫ Reflecting the color of the sky ♫</i>

337
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:33,920
<i>♫ Never withering ♫</i>

338
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,592
Come on.

339
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,320
My lord.

340
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,736
Stop.

341
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,552
What are you carrying?

342
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,240
Socks and shoes for the children, by Lady He.

343
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,359
Why do you smell so bad?

344
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,400
Thanks to her.

345
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,319
Neither you nor the things are allowed in.

346
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,519
My lord, aren't you curious about
what happened to Lady He?

347
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,839
I don't need to ask you,

348
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
and you will tell me yourself.

349
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,119
You really know me well.

350
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,000
Lady He refuses to bow to the flower guild,

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,079
so she offended the guild head
and got banned from buying fertilizer.

352
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,279
Pitiful, a pretty young lady

353
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,559
has to deal with rotten meat and feces all day.

354
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,720
She used to smell of money,

355
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,599
but now it's turned into a foul smell.

356
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,792
Pathetic.

357
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,920
Go take a bath.

358
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,200
Take these shoes and socks out to air them.

359
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
Send them to the children
after they have been scented.

360
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,392
Yes.

361
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,024
Come in.

362
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
I won't go in.

363
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,920
Wait.

364
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,920
Mr. Jiang, I paid my rent monthly

365
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,839
in full without exception.

366
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,400
Your coming here at night
seems somewhat improper.

367
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,440
I have knocked on the courtyard door.

368
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,079
But you didn't hear me from inside.

369
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,400
So I had to knock on the house door.

370
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,279
You invited me in yourself,
yet I didn't even enter.

371
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,039
I thought it was Shengyi.

372
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,319
Mr. Jiang, what brings you here
so late at night?

373
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,640
I've received the shoes and socks
you gave to the children.

374
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm here to thank you on their behalf.

375
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,119
Additionally, here's a return gift.

376
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,144
No need.

377
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:35,232
Chuanyu

378
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,200
has to take a bath
after he comes here to pick something up.

379
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,272
It's really troublesome.

380
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,319
You got banned from buying the fertilizers.
It isn't a big deal.

381
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,599
Tomorrow, go to the guild and say my name.

382
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,920
They will not dare to cause you any trouble.

383
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,519
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

384
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,000
But I can't owe you any more favors.

385
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,440
Mr. Jiang, your status is special.

386
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,519
If

387
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,480
standing up for
an anonymous merchant girl like me

388
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,839
brings you rumors,

389
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,839
I can't bear it.

390
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,720
Besides, I don't want to

391
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,000
make your notorious reputation

392
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,440
even worst.

393
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,000
No matter what situation you encounter,
you remain resolute and decisive.

394
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,160
It seems I have judged you right.

395
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,384
I'm leaving.

396
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,640
Next month,

397
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,200
remember to use this bath beans
I gave you to take a bath

398
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,680
before coming to the Jiang Mansion
to give me the bonus.

399
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,240
Okay, take care, Mr. Jiang.

400
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,264
- Madam, here's yours. Take it.
- Thank you.

401
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:56,319
- Come again next time.
- Give it a try.

402
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,640
Take care.

403
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,656
Take a sniff.

404
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,519
Look.

405
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,480
We've also added vine flowers to it.

406
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,000
The deposit for the four pots
of Herbaceous Peonies.

407
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,240
We are relying on ourselves without giving in
to anyone. It is truly satisfying.

408
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,319
The homemade fertilizer
has solved the urgent need,

409
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,119
but it is not a long-term solution.

410
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,839
If this continues,

411
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,559
I'm afraid this shop remains,
yet we'll be worn out.

412
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,480
We must find an opportunity

413
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,599
to completely resolve
the issue of the fertilizer.

414
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,376
Go get busy.

415
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,799
Check out, please.

416
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,848
Okay.

417
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,440
Someone came to us the other day
and ordered Mengdiexiang,

418
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,359
but the delivery location left
was not a mansion or a shop,

419
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,440
but a bridge.

420
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,319
We found it weird.

421
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,240
But the visitor was dressed properly,

422
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,480
looking like a maid from a wealthy family,
so we didn't pay much attention.

423
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,039
But today when I passed by,

424
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,480
the flower pot was still there.

425
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,359
I thought the buyer had forgotten to take it.

426
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,880
But upon closer inspection,

427
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,759
the flowers were broken off and discarded,
and the roots were gone.

428
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,720
Look,

429
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,680
the cut is neat, must have been done
with a sharp instrument.

430
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,920
What a pity for these flowers.

431
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,240
Since they bought flowers,

432
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,759
why discard the most expensive parts

433
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,759
and take away the roots instead?

434
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,880
We worry that it's the guild.

435
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,640
Impossible.

436
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,400
They know the value of flowers well,
why would they give up the essence?

437
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,119
Could it be that they have
some sort of eccentricity?

438
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,160
Today that maid came to buy flowers again,

439
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,480
and the delivery location is unchanged.

440
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,920
Do we sell the flowers to them?

441
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,984
Again?

442
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,440
It depends on who they are.

443
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,960
It's nice that you love it.

444
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
There's another one ahead.

445
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,240
Don't keep looking over there, Fu.

446
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
Buy one Youshi Hall facial cream,

447
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,839
get one hand cream.

448
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,720
It's a lady.

449
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,640
Could she be the buyer?

450
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,768
Let's wait.

451
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,320
Hold on.

452
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,680
Fu.

453
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,880
In broad daylight, are you trying to rob me?

454
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,480
Did you buy this flower?

455
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,240
Yes, I bought it at Huamanzhu.

456
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,808
This is the proof.

457
00:24:58,195 --> 00:25:00,416
<i>[Huamanzhu, one pot of Mengdiexiang]</i>

458
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,240
Who are you?

459
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,039
I am the shop owner of Huamanzhu.

460
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,319
I saw that you had already destroyed
one pot of Herbaceous Peony before.

461
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,759
I really can't bear to see
this one damaged by you again,

462
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,319
so I came to stop you.

463
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,880
If I startled you just now, sorry about that.

464
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,960
So you are that lady shop owner.

465
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,200
Do you know how much care it takes
to cultivate an Herbaceous Peony

466
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,759
until it blooms?

467
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
Since you have already bought it,

468
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,640
why not take good care of it

469
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,960
and break it?

470
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,839
I have my reasons.

471
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,319
I've heard that Guild Head Lv has a daughter,

472
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,519
named Lv Gengchun.

473
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,368
Her age and appearance seem to match hers.

474
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:47,968
<i>[Lv]</i>

475
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,319
You are the daughter of Guild Head Lv?

476
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,480
<i>[Chen's Tavern]</i>
Well, you ban us from buying the fertilizer.

477
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
And now you want to ruin our flowers as well?

478
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,319
Tell me, what does your father
want you to do here?

479
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,440
My father is totally unaware
of everything I've done.

480
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,160
Please don't get me wrong.

481
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,039
Well, I will never cut your flowers again.

482
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,799
Even if you come to buy,

483
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,240
we will not sell them to you anymore.

484
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,440
The guild is forcing us step by step.

485
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,240
We might use this matter.

486
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,480
If the people of the flower guild

487
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,559
find out that Guild Head Lv's daughter
is privately ruining Herbaceous Peonies,

488
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,759
his reputation will certainly be damaged.

489
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,359
If he does not want
to make a big fuss out of this

490
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,680
and is willing to reconcile with us,

491
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,519
then perhaps
the issue of the fertilizer can be resolved.

492
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,200
Trying to run away? Come back.

493
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,559
Stand here.

494
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,359
This really has nothing to do with my father.

495
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,920
You can hit me or scold me.

496
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,519
But please don't tell it to the guild.

497
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,519
I'm begging you.

498
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,079
Fu, let her go.

499
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,224
Well…

500
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,848
Let her go.

501
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,079
Shengyi, give her the money back.

502
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,799
We're not selling anymore. Let her go.

503
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:55,840
Mudan.

504
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,000
No matter how hostile our relationship
with the guild may be,

505
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,680
these are all matters of business.

506
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,960
Family members should not be involved.

507
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,720
Besides, she has paid.

508
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,680
She has right to dispose of the Mengdiexiang.

509
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,440
We are only here to stop her
just because we cherish the flowers.

510
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,000
The world is often harsh on women.

511
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,680
If we make this a big deal,

512
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,480
I'm afraid it will become a fuss,

513
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,440
causing her reputation ruined.

514
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,792
You may go.

515
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Thank you.

516
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,880
Mudan, you are so kind-hearted.

517
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,319
Just let her go?

518
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,839
Aren't you afraid of future troubles?

519
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,640
I saw her speaking frankly,
with a sincere expression.

520
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,359
She didn't seem like a person
with sinister motives.

521
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,079
Perhaps she wasn't lying.

522
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,640
This matter really has nothing to do
with the guild.

523
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,200
Then, she simply enjoys
destroying Herbaceous Peonies?

524
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,359
They grow flowers on their own.

525
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,880
Why doesn't she cut the flowers
from her own garden?

526
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,720
What flower is this?

527
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
I've never seen it before.

528
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,720
This is not a flower for appreciation,

529
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,680
but the medicinal herb Gentian.

530
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,832
Lady He.

531
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,759
I'm here to pay Mr. Jiang last month's bonus.

532
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,960
Right now, he…

533
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,119
If he is busy,

534
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,359
I can wait outside. There's no rush.

535
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,400
Come in.

536
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,872
Please, Lady He.

537
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,792
Mr. Jiang.

538
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,200
This is your interest money.

539
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,599
You were always bargaining in the past,

540
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:17,119
why do you pay this interest money
so punctually today?

541
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,720
I really appreciate your kindness to me.

542
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,920
I wouldn't dare owe you money.

543
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,216
Rest assured.

544
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,599
I've burned incense
and wiped every coin in here.

545
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,359
There is not the slightest foul smell.

546
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,799
This clearly shows my sincerity to you.

547
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,759
The shop has already opened,

548
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,440
but this interest money is not enough.

549
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,759
It's inevitable to invest more money
at the start of a new shop.

550
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,559
But the interest money next month
will definitely be much more.

551
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,319
I will surely not fail you.

552
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,000
If you don't trust me,
you can check the ledger.

553
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,319
Where every coin you gave me has been spent

554
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,240
is clearly recorded here.

555
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,480
I don't have time to check this.

556
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,559
Just go and reconcile it
with the accountant of the Jiang Mansion.

557
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,839
As long as you don't fabricate
or conceal anything,

558
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,079
and the interest money each month
is more than the last,

559
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,799
then you could run this shop smoothly.

560
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,359
I understand.

561
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,599
It's fine now, you may leave.

562
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,039
I shall take my leave.

563
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,400
Mr. Jiang, the blooming period
of the Qiongtai Yulu has ended.

564
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,832
Your Highness, Minister Liu…

565
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:33,920
What is so urgent?

566
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,720
My lord is still taking his afternoon nap.

567
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,200
Why don't I go and announce it for you?

568
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,839
Suizhi is so close to me.

569
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,519
Zishu is also not an outsider.

570
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,400
Why bother with such formalities?

571
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,160
Your Highness.

572
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Today, the imperial court
was in complete turmoil.

573
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,440
Suizhi, you are really in a pleasure,

574
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,200
hiding here at home,
toying with flowers and plants.

575
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:06,119
Court affairs are well dealt with by you.

576
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,559
Nowadays, all departments are endlessly
arguing over the imperial examination reforms.

577
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,960
Why would I offer myself as a target?

578
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,759
Zishu?

579
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,640
After our parting in Luoyang, now
you enter the Ministry of Revenue.

580
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,960
Your wedding is coming soon,
yet I haven't offered you my congratulations.

581
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,000
Zishu.

582
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,319
Suizhi had praised

583
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,359
the magnificent peonies
in your old mansion in Luoyang.

584
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,559
It seems that you are old acquaintances.

585
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Whether it's serving as an official
or appreciating flowers,

586
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,319
you should all work together
and consult with one another.

587
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,744
Yes.

588
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,799
However, the spring is already over.

589
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,079
Suizhi, why would you place

590
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,279
a pot of withered peony in the room?

591
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,559
The servants are being lazy
and forgetting to move it out.

592
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,440
Your late wife, Lady He,
was the best at caring for peonies.

593
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,319
Zishu, does it remind you of someone
when you see the flowers?

594
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,039
<i>This Jiang!</i>

595
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,559
<i>Why does he mention it?</i>

596
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,599
Suizhi, don't be kidding.

597
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,880
That's all in the past.

598
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,720
My former wife was not fond of
the zither, chess, calligraphy, or painting,

599
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,559
only liked to care for flowers.

600
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,319
She never quite fit in with the Liu family.

601
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,960
Previously, I had little leisure
to appreciate such things.

602
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,559
I'm sorry about her death,

603
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,519
yet she got freed from constraints,

604
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,200
which can be considered a good thing.

605
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,160
Zishu, what a noble statement.

606
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,200
It is rare for Your Highness and Zishu
to visit my mansion.

607
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,519
I have a newly hired floriculturist,

608
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,079
who has redecorated the garden.

609
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,839
Why not take a look together?

610
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,000
When it comes to these things,
Suizhi is really the master.

611
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,680
I really look forward to it.

612
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,768
Come on.

613
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,376
Zishu, please.

614
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,920
With the old man dead,

615
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,640
the scholars from the Imperial Academy
are petitioning one after another,

616
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,359
reviving the proposal
to reform the imperial examination

617
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,799
and the selection process
for officials by Master Xu.

618
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,039
For the sake of
their master-disciple relationship,

619
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,160
His Majesty has softened,
and graciously approved it.

620
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,799
However, rest assured.

621
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,280
These scholars of humble backgrounds
are like rootless duckweed.

622
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,320
Even if they enter the imperial court,
they can't stir up any trouble.

623
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,480
These scholars claim

624
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,119
to change the recruitment ratio between public
and private school graduates to six to four,

625
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,559
but completely forget

626
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,840
that the gentry and nobility
are the foundation of our country.

627
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,000
Now they want to support those
from humble backgrounds,

628
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,920
while also oppress the gentry's sons
who attain office through the selection process.

629
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,920
What a reversal of rank and status.

630
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,440
If any trouble occurs,

631
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,039
we couldn't let
the late Master Xu rest in peace.

632
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,519
In my opinion, if it's to express condolences,

633
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,280
a ratio of seven to three
is already more than enough.

634
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,599
I understand.

635
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,239
As for His Majesty, please rest assured.

636
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,000
There's one more thing.

637
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,400
If there is a suitable
Deputy Fourth-Rank official position,

638
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,000
please keep an eye out for Zishu.

639
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,920
Zishu is of virtue and talent.

640
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,199
If you wish to promote him,

641
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,239
there is no need for my help.

642
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,440
Master Xu has just passed away,

643
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,960
and these scholars and censors
are constantly making a fuss.

644
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,480
After all, he is my son-in-law.

645
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,400
Why give people cause for gossip?

646
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,159
Zishu's talent will surely
be appreciated by His Majesty.

647
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:48,639
In the future, his promotion
will be justifiable and aboveboard.

648
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,159
No one dares to object.

649
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Zishu,

650
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,119
if you were half as smart
and sensitive as Suizhi,

651
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,320
then Youzhen wouldn't…

652
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,280
I will take my leave first.

653
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,239
What did you see?

654
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,760
Nothing, I saw nothing.

655
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,039
I didn't see anything.

656
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,000
That's not what you said

657
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,239
after you've passed out.

658
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,960
You said, "Injustice has its source,
and debts have their debtors.

659
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,920
To seek revenge, look for the Jiang."

660
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,920
What I said was

661
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,960
"To seek money, look for Mr. Jiang."

662
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,656
No need to pretend anymore.

663
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,960
The night I killed Master Xu,

664
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
you were there.

665
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,519
I didn't hurt you
because I thought you're tight-lipped.

666
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,000
But today, you can control
your mouth when awake,

667
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,639
yet you can't control your sleep-talking.

668
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,760
I still can't keep you.

669
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,840
Mr. Jiang.

670
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,639
I must have been possessed by a ghost just now,

671
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,360
so I spoke without thinking.

672
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:11,920
Rest assured. If others are by my side,

673
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,119
I will definitely not fall asleep.

674
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,920
I will never reveal this matter
to another person.

675
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,360
I am not that ruthless.

676
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,719
I'll leave your body intact.

677
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:26,280
Any last wishes, speak them now.

678
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,719
Shengyi and the others know nothing of this.

679
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,519
I hope you can let them go.

680
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,816
Okay.

681
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,639
I established Huamanzhu on my own.

682
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,800
And the employees in the shop
all rely on it for their livelihood.

683
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,880
I hope you…

684
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,000
I will have Yunniang take over it.
Rest assured.

685
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,960
You'd better keep your word.

686
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,360
Otherwise, I will not let you off,
even as a ghost.

687
