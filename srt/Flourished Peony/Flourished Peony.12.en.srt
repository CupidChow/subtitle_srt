<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,879
Fu,

4
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,680
we are already friends.

5
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,480
We can dispense with the ceremony
of becoming sworn sisters.

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,400
How can that be acceptable?

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,840
Today, we captured the villain together.

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,799
Administering justice on heaven's behalf
is a bond stronger than life itself.

9
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,159
How can we treat it lightly?

10
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,159
But the rites of sisterhood are complex.

11
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,000
The required implements are numerous.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
We are unprepared at home.

13
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,480
Indeed.

14
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,080
What does a righteous person
have to fear from this difficulty?

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,960
The torches are ready and the three sacrificial
animals are waiting to be slaughtered.

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,759
I will make sure to prepare
all the necessary implements one by one.

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,039
We don't have the God
of Heaven and Earth at home.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,039
Maybe we should just forget it.

19
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,360
The God of Heaven and Earth?

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,199
There is one twenty li away.
I will go and invite it.

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
No need.

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,599
Let's take the oath now.

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,439
Who is this? Will it work?

24
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,360
This is the God of Wealth.

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,639
Sincerity brings divine response.

26
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,479
All the gods and immortals
under heaven are one family.

27
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,479
The God of Wealth will surely
pass our message on.

28
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,080
He surely won't quibble with us.

29
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Let's just take the oath.

30
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,544
Alright.

31
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,199
The stars are brilliant tonight.

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,280
Let's turn off the lights
and watch the stars later.

33
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,456
Yes.

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,240
Why is there a light over there?

35
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,000
I've heard that Lady He has hired a new hand.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
It's the female vigilante who helped them

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
punish the wicked on the street today.

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,719
They're now taking the oath
of sisterhood by torchlight.

39
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,560
She has recruited another enforcer.

40
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,280
Is she doing business or becoming a bandit?

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,639
With the supreme heaven above
and earth below as witness,

42
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,280
today, the three of us wish
to form an alliance here,

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,639
wishing our united hearts' words
be fragrant as orchids

44
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,479
and our pact as solid as stone.

45
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,599
Joining…

46
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
Joining hearts and efforts.

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,759
Joining hearts and efforts. Entrusting…

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,560
Entrusting each other in life and death.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
Entrusting each other in life and death. A…

50
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,199
A complete mess.

51
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,159
<i>[Sisterhood scroll]</i>
Why is forming a sisterhood so troublesome?

52
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,960
She has a child's temperament after all.

53
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,759
Fu, stop looking.

54
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,919
Do you think it's okay to say it this way?

55
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,520
Not seeking to be born
on the same year, same month, and same day,

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,319
but seeking to be rich on the same year,
same month, and same day.

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
Fine, this is pleasing to the ear.

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,839
Let's say it this way.

59
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,008
Come on.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,680
Not seeking to be born
on the same year, same month, and same day,

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,720
but seeking to be rich on the same year,
same month, and same day.

62
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,040
Ms. Sun said

63
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,720
the incense powder uses cornmeal as the base.

64
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,879
Fragrant materials are spread on top of it.

65
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,120
But the cornmeal will cover the smell
of the fragrant materials,

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
resulting in the peony scent
being not very rich.

67
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,959
Huaixiuxiang is more aromatic
than the common peonies.

68
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,360
But still, it can't surpass the likes
of magnolias and other flowers.

69
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,439
So if you make incense
using traditional craftsmanship,

70
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm afraid it won't be satisfactory.

71
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,680
Madam, I think it might be better

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
if we directly add floral materials
into the base powder.

73
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,240
This way the peony fragrance
can be more intense.

74
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,272
What do you think?

75
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,000
Alright, I have never seen any incense shop

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,439
add fragrant materials into the base powder,

77
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,279
especially not such expensive peonies.

78
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,000
If this can be made,
it is certain to make a name.

79
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,399
But this way, the usage of floral materials
will be greater.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,759
Wouldn't it be more prudent
to use traditional methods?

81
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,079
Peony incense powder is unique
in the two markets.

82
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,079
Even with less floral materials,
it can sell very well.

83
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Since we have decided
to make peony incense powder,

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,720
we must make it the best.

85
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,759
Every step must strive for excellence.

86
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,560
We cannot just take the name.

87
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Only then can we be worthy
of our garden full of peony flowers

88
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
and be worthy of each
of our trusting customers.

89
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,120
Since no one has any objections,

90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,199
let's start working.

91
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,560
- Okay.
- Let's get to work.

92
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,744
Come on.

93
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,360
<i>Mudan, the making of incense powder
is divided into five steps.</i>

94
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,639
<i>The first four steps are all
about making the powder.</i>

95
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>Selecting fragrant materials.</i>

96
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,519
Can they be used as fragrance?

97
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,399
Yes, they can.

98
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,920
Great, I'll cut some more.

99
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,480
<i>Making the incense powder.</i>

100
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
<i>Steaming flower essence.</i>

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,560
The flower essence is ready.

102
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,352
Mudan, come and see.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,008
Take a sniff.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,016
I'll smell it.

105
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,600
That's right, this is the scent.

106
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,839
Sweet and fragrant.

107
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,279
<i>Mix the powder with the floral essence.</i>

108
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,360
<i>After drying, make it into base powder.</i>

109
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,000
<i>Then comes the final step,
blending the fragrance.</i>

110
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,336
Marvelous.

111
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,879
Mudan, thanks to your reminder,

112
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,759
the rich scent of peony root can
be incorporated into the fragrance.

113
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,920
In doing so,

114
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,600
our peony incense powder

115
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,160
will be effective for invigorating blood
and removing spots.

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,120
Madam, regarding this final step
of blending the fragrance,

117
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
does it have any particular requirements?

118
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,839
Blending scents isn't difficult.
Anyone can do it.

119
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,759
The intensity of the fragrance
and the amount used

120
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,199
all depend on the shop owner's preference.

121
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Everyone has put in effort together.

122
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,480
How can it be decided just by my preference?

123
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,639
Let's blend it together.

124
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,240
Shengyi, you first.

125
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Peony is noble and elegant.

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I think the incense powder should
also be subtly elegant.

127
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,879
It makes it more extraordinary.

128
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,919
Yours is too mild.

129
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,559
It dissipates with a gust of wind.

130
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,279
It's fine for ladies to use indoors.

131
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,639
For someone like me who does physical work,

132
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,679
I need a rich and long-lasting scent.

133
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,559
No, that's wasteful.

134
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,960
We don't have many Huaixiuxiangs left.

135
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,879
If we blend it this strong,
we can't make many boxes.

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,039
Well, that's not a problem.

137
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,679
Besides Huaixiuxiang,

138
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,639
don't we have
many other floral materials to use?

139
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,639
We can

140
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,759
sell a variety of incense powder together.

141
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,519
Customers will have more choices.

142
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,480
But making the base powder
has already taken a long time.

143
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,360
Now we have to blend fragrances,
package them, and sell them.

144
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,519
I'm afraid we are short-handed.

145
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
I actually have an idea.

146
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,919
Without worrying
about the strength of the scent,

147
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,120
it also solves the problem
of insufficient manpower.

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,120
Now, at last, one can blend their own.

179
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,399
I want a kind that is unique and captivating.

180
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,320
I have some pepper stored at home,
can it be added?

181
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,600
- Yes, it can.
- Really?

182
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,919
Okay.

183
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,008
- Thank you, Madam.
- This way.

184
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,960
Uniquely original, a thousand scents
for a thousand people.

185
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,879
Choose and mix your own.

186
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,120
Everyone, come and take a look!

187
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:30,208
Shengyi,

188
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,000
we have earned back all the money
we invested in the Chunyiwan fertilizers.

189
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,559
That's great.

190
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,399
Once this batch of Chunyiwan sells out
successfully,

191
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,600
we'll be able to recoup
all of our lost capital.

192
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,360
Not only that, we could even
make a profit by then.

193
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,496
Shengyi,

194
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,264
this is for you.

195
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,424
<i>[Silver Note]</i>

196
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,799
The business is something we do together.

197
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,320
Of course, the money earned
should be shared equally.

198
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,399
I've opened an account
in your name at the bank.

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
All of this month's profits
have been deposited there.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,080
Before long, you'll be able
to bring your younger brother over

201
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,279
and you can be reunited.

202
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,679
Mudan, thank you.

203
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,720
We don't need to say these things between us.

204
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,600
From now on, this will be your pocket money
for leisure.

205
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,480
You will no longer need
to look at other people's attitude.

206
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,000
Shengyi, remember,

207
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
from now on, you only need
to act in accordance with your heart.

208
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,879
Be free and easy.

209
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:57,632
<i>[Silver Note]</i>

210
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,360
Your Highness is unwell. Why not take a leave?

211
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,840
It's just a minor illness,
hardly worth mentioning.

212
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,120
State affairs should take precedence.

213
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,200
Your Highness loves the people
and cares for all things.

214
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,039
I'm ashamed of not measuring up.

215
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,639
Since when has the court become a theater?

216
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,600
Every day, the act of loving the people
as one's own children is performed.

217
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,279
Aren't you tired? I am already weary
of watching it.

218
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,320
Gentlemen,

219
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,600
I bring a message from His Majesty.

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,960
Having diligently studied throughout the night,
His Majesty has caught a chill.

221
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:02,080
He will not attend court these days.

222
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,120
You have just presented a batch
of rare and exotic items

223
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,960
and then His Majesty fell ill.

224
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,440
Such unfortunate timing.

225
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,759
Given that His Majesty is ill,

226
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,240
what politics are there left to discuss?

227
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,639
Gentlemen, quickly follow me
to visit His Majesty.

228
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,376
Master Xu, please wait.

229
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:22,399
What's up?

230
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,320
His Majesty specifically instructed
that no one should go to see him.

231
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,840
He does not wish to delay
state affairs on account of himself.

232
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,799
Everyone should go on
discussing the matters at hand.

233
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,519
Isn't Prince Ning is here?

234
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,480
Let all decisions be made by him.

235
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,320
Master Xu, you are most sympathetic
towards the sovereign.

236
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,039
You wouldn't fail to appreciate
His Majesty's hard efforts.

237
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,440
Gentlemen, please continue
with the discussions.

238
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,600
I wish to report on the matter
of the Ministry of Revenue's taxes.

239
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,720
Since the new tax law replaced the old,

240
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,919
the court has reduced taxes and corvee
on farmers year after year.

241
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,120
However, upon examining the regional reports,

242
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,559
I found that although land taxes were reduced,

243
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,840
the farmers are still burdened
with many levies of tribute.

244
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,240
Consequently, the people's burdens have not lightened,
and the national treasury has not been filled.

245
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,159
The implementation of the new taxes
was overseen by Prince Ning.

246
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,440
Now there are discrepancies in the taxes.

247
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,320
Can it be so?

248
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,600
Presumably, it's due to the frequent changes
in the new tax laws

249
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,919
and different interpretations
from place to place.

250
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,279
That's why such oversights have occurred.

251
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,559
In that case, I will send someone
to inspect the situation tomorrow.

252
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,440
The issue will certainly be resolved.

253
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
This matter has far-reaching implications.

254
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,039
I fear that simply saying Prince Ning will
handle it will not solve the problem.

255
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,240
Don't you trust in this?

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,519
Let's discuss the next matter.

257
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,120
Having just finished playing the role
of a leader who loves his people like his children,

258
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,519
now there's an act
of a fox exploiting the tiger's might.

259
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,080
You really treat the court
as if it were your own backyard.

260
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,960
Floral Envoy, you are so biased.

261
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,480
How can we even discuss politics like this?

262
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,679
So what if I am biased towards Prince Ning?

263
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,320
I went to inspect Luoyang before.

264
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,480
The locals live in peace and contentment,
well-dressed and well-fed.

265
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,399
It's clear that the government affairs
are well-managed under Prince Ning's leadership.

266
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:44,519
How can the great affairs of the court tolerate
the reckless talk of a minor Floral Envoy?

267
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,879
Don't forget, Minister. I am also the Vice Minister
of the Office of Imperial Ceremonies.

268
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,559
Moreover, I am as close as family
to His Majesty.

269
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,399
How can I not speak?

270
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,080
Prince Ning and His Majesty
are even closer as blood relatives.

271
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,160
The political achievements over the years

272
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,880
are there for all to see.

273
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,759
Could it be that His Majesty does not trust
the two of us

274
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,759
and instead trust you, these ministers
of different surnames?

275
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,816
You!

276
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,200
Arguing with these old men
is really meaningless.

277
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,720
It's better to go play with my fish.

278
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,480
Please continue, gentlemen. Farewell.

279
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
I takes my leave.

280
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,640
The jumping clown has finally left,
good riddance.

281
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,240
Gentlemen, please continue the discussion.

282
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,519
Your Highness, Minister Cui from the Ministry
of Personnel, responsible for selecting officials,

283
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
has been accused by the students.

284
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,200
His judgments have been ghostwritten by others.

285
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,880
As a dutiful official,
I offer my remonstration.

286
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,200
Please, Your Highness, deal with this.

287
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,759
This matter is of great importance
and requires further investigation.

288
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,119
Perhaps it's better to put it aside for now.

289
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,400
Students are an important asset to the country.

290
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,799
How can we treat them with neglect?

291
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,599
Minister Cui's actions of forgery
are enough to prove

292
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,559
that our current system of selecting the worthy

293
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,279
has become a place for private dealings.

294
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,119
The prosperity of the country depends
on talents.

295
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,119
Therefore, the selection of talents
is of utmost importance.

296
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,680
Imperial examination reforms are imperative.

297
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,279
I have already drafted a strategy.

298
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,680
Please, Your Highness, make your decision.

299
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,599
First, standardize the selection system.

300
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,920
Those who serve in the court also need
to be re-evaluated and adjudicated.

301
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,000
Those whose virtue does not match
their position, dismiss.

302
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,000
Second, lower the threshold
for the imperial exam.

303
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,039
Redistribute the numbers
of successful candidates.

304
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
The admission ratio of official
and private schools

305
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,839
should be changed from the original nine
to one to six to four.

306
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,944
- Master Xu.
- Well…

307
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,519
The official school is established
by the imperial court.

308
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,759
The enrollees are all relatives
of the numerous officials.

309
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,400
It can be called a selection
of superior talents.

310
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,440
Naturally, they should be granted more spots.

311
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
But the character of the commoners is uneven.

312
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,799
If many are chosen for court positions,
there must be hidden dangers.

313
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,240
I myself am from a humble background.

314
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,256
I am the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor
favored by the late emperor.

315
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:31,839
Remonstrating Minister, are you belittling me

316
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,359
or the late emperor?

317
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,279
Master Xu, stop talking nonsense.

318
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,079
How dare I be disrespectful
to the late emperor?

319
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,319
A slip of the tongue.

320
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,920
Gentlemen, the country itself is composed

321
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,799
of countless ordinary commoners.

322
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,079
Only by letting them step into the officialdom

323
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,119
can they truly work for the benefit
of the common people.

324
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,880
Your Highness, if you truly have
the people's interests at heart,

325
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,640
I hope you will purge the corrupt practices
in the official circles.

326
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,720
From now on, deemphasize pedigree
and value capability.

327
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I agree.

328
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,480
I agree.

329
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,920
- I agree.
- I agree.

330
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,119
Xu Zuping is truly cunning.

331
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,640
Act first and report later,
leaving us no way to respond.

332
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,240
Rest assured, Your Highness.

333
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,559
I have already ordered someone
to write Minister Cui's petition.

334
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,160
Once the accusing students are settled,

335
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,680
order a halt to the local officials'
recommendation of tribute scholars.

336
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,519
Then we can make things work out from there.

337
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,240
Tens of thousands of commoner students

338
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,720
are just like this water.

339
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,079
Carrying the boat, overturning the boat,

340
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,880
all regard Xu Zuping as their leader.

341
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:04,519
Xu Zuping is the cup that can gather
the force of many waters.

342
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,839
If this cup breaks,

343
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,519
even steaming tea will spill instantly,

344
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,680
losing its power to gather together.

345
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,000
Xu Zuping is a prestigious veteran
of two dynasties.

346
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,240
Your Highness, perhaps you might reconsider it.

347
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,559
He neither retires nor submits.

348
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,440
He has interfered
with my grand endeavors several times.

349
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,920
It's just that His Majesty
deeply trusted this teacher

350
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,160
and I cannot overly defy him.

351
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,079
But I have tolerated him for too long.

352
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,759
I understand, I will go handle it.

353
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,680
Your Highness, Minister Liu
requests an audience.

354
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,680
Let him in.

355
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,752
Yes.

356
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,839
Greetings, Your Highness.

357
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,920
It seems you have not adapted
to life in Chang'an yet.

358
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,640
You still think of yourself
as the son of a judge.

359
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,440
Even the minor officials in the Ministry
of Revenue are aware of our relationship.

360
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,400
My son-in-law, assuming the position
of Additional Secretary,

361
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,079
you have forgotten it.

362
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,000
I hope you won't blame me.

363
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,599
I am not yet married to Youzhen.

364
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,720
I dare not rashly change my address.

365
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,319
Although I have your protection,

366
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,440
I still dedicate myself to my official duties
in the Ministry of Revenue.

367
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't wish to broadcast it widely
and be treated differently.

368
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,319
Gossip is not worth mentioning.

369
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,880
What brings you here today?

370
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,279
Father,

371
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,759
I have reviewed the Ministry of Revenue's
archives of the past few years

372
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,079
and found that the revenue and expenditure
of the ministry are unbalanced over the years.

373
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,599
Much of it is due to flooding.

374
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,920
If we want to resolve this situation,
we must prioritize water control.

375
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,400
I have studied the water systems
of various regions

376
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,839
and have prepared a policy paper.

377
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,880
I now present it for you to review.

378
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,640
Zishu, what is this?

379
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,440
In these past days, writing the policy paper,
I've hardly taken off my clothes.

380
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,200
I must have carelessly gotten some ink stains.

381
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,799
As the husband of the County Princess,

382
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,920
every word and action, every item
of clothing and accessory,

383
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,960
all represent my dignity.

384
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,720
When serving as an official outside, you
cannot lose your status and nobility.

385
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,576
Yes.

386
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,519
Besides, these clothes of yours

387
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,359
were all meticulously prepared by Youzhen.

388
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,640
You should cherish and love them.

389
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,400
Do not forget your duty.

390
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,712
I understand.

391
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,799
This policy paper…

392
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,079
I will read it later.

393
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,319
Recently, the late peach blossoms on the outskirts
of the city are blooming beautifully.

394
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,000
When you're free, go accompany Youzhen
and take a walk.

395
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,688
Yes.

396
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,759
I shall take my leave first.

397
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,279
Mudan,

398
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,359
have a taste.

399
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,000
The cake is sweet and fragrant,
the taste is excellent.

400
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,359
It's good if you like it.

401
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,799
You had me infuse the scent of flowers
into the fragrance.

402
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,400
That's when I thought of using it
to make cakes.

403
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,480
No matter what you wish to do,

404
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,519
I will always be with you.

405
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,096
You've loved the rose steamed cakes.

406
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:25,200
Eat some

407
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,839
so that you will have strength to help me
sabotage Liu family's deal.

408
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,720
After I finish handling the matter,

409
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,880
I will eat them together with you.

410
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,880
My lady, hurry to the shop.

411
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,920
I'll hold them off here.

412
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,599
Make way, move aside!

413
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,079
- My lady, hurry and go.
- Let me through!

414
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,240
Quickly, my lady, go!

415
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,039
Hurry, quickly stop the Young Madam!

416
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,079
- Quickly!
- Yes.

417
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,200
My lady.

418
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,319
Step aside!

419
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,599
My lady.

420
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,920
Yulu, don't scare me.

421
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,680
Yulu, could you wake up, please?

422
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,944
Tasty.

423
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,600
Mudan,

424
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,160
what's wrong with you?

425
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,968
Nothing.

426
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,200
I was just reminded of someone from the past.

427
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,480
If she were still here,

428
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,200
she would definitely love
the flower cakes you make.

429
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,928
Don't cry anymore.

430
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,359
Shengyi, these cakes are so delicious.

431
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,640
If we were to gift them to customers,

432
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,200
it would surely retain more customers.

433
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,920
How many of these cakes have you made?

434
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,640
Originally, I made fifty.

435
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,160
But as soon as they came out of the oven,
Chuanyu smelled them

436
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
and they took them away.

437
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,400
The Floral Envoy

438
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,519
even doesn't spare the snacks of the poor.

439
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,440
We toil from dawn till dusk.

440
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,200
Isn't it just to avoid owing him interest?

441
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,559
But he, on the contrary, takes advantage of us.

442
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,304
Where did they go?

443
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,400
Today, I'll go myself.

444
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,079
If you go,

445
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,759
who knows in whose stomach
these flower cakes will end up?

446
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,519
Then I won't go.

447
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,720
But if someone comes looking for you,

448
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,000
doubting why I didn't accompany you
to see the dancer,

449
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
what should I say?

450
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,920
Let them think about it.

451
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,480
If you were to go with me to see the dancer,

452
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,400
all lovey-dovey, would that be proper?

453
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,328
Farewell, my lord.

454
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,960
May I borrow a horse?

455
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,248
Thank you.

456
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Meeting the dancer, with Lady He following.

457
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,016
That's the right way?

458
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,799
- Again.
- Continue.

459
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,720
- Come on.
- This time it must be better than before.

460
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,920
I still want to test you.

461
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,799
I have seven cakes here.

462
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,200
I gave you one, how many are left?

463
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
Five.

464
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,559
Tang, if this still isn't clear to you,

465
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,000
I can't give you the cakes.

466
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,120
Sir.

467
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:46,880
Tang.

468
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,480
Mr. Wu said if I can't count properly,
I can't eat the cakes.

469
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,560
Tang, don't cry.

470
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,640
Don't cry.

471
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,728
Let me ask you,

472
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,880
Mr. Wu gave you three flower cakes

473
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:02,960
and I gave you two more.

474
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,440
Now, how many flower cakes do you have in hand?

475
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,880
Seven.

476
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,680
First go to Mr. Wu to get the cake.

477
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,319
Just say it was given by me.

478
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,920
- Sir.
- Look at you.

479
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,519
- Sir.
- Come on, what's wrong?

480
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,119
I can't shoot well
with the slingshot you gave me.

481
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,200
- I'll give you the cakes.
- Can you teach me?

482
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,319
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

483
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,319
- Okay.
- Don't cry now.

484
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,839
To shoot accurately, first hold the bow steady.

485
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,592
Aim at the target.

486
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,696
Release.

487
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,720
Thief, where do you think you're going?

488
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,039
You little boy are really interesting.

489
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,599
I'm not a thief, quite the opposite,

490
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,839
I'm here to catch a thief,

491
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,160
the thief who stole my flower cakes.

492
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,559
You stole my things to curry favor

493
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,720
and shamelessly throwing stones at me.

494
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,599
Setting such an example,

495
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,279
aren't you afraid of leading astray
with bad example?

496
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,480
This upper beam of mine
was never straight to begin with.

497
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,720
They might grow up straight
while being crooked.

498
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,839
I wonder why today's pastries

499
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,319
are tastier than usual.

500
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,599
Suizhi just loves to joke.

501
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,400
My lady, don't stoop to his level.

502
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,920
Come in quickly for a cup of tea.

503
00:30:42,816 --> 00:30:43,920
Run slower.

504
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,928
Okay.

505
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,224
Sir.

506
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,359
Mr. Wu, is this place for the care of orphans?

507
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,960
This is the home I share with the children.

508
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,119
Although they have lost their parents,

509
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,279
they are not orphans.

510
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,936
It was my narrow-mindedness.
Mr. Wu, please don't blame me.

511
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,079
It doesn't matter.

512
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,920
I just don't want the children

513
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,480
to feel that they are different from others.

514
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,640
They are being cared for
with great attention here

515
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,240
and they have so many brothers and sisters.

516
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,720
Compared to children from other families,

517
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,480
perhaps they are even happier.

518
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,759
That's true, indeed.

519
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,519
Although they can't compare with children
from wealthy families,

520
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,119
they are looked after by Suizhi.

521
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,000
They don't worry about food, clothing,
or other expenses.

522
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,480
There's the teacher

523
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,359
who comes here to teach them
reading and manners.

524
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,200
Had I not seen it with my own eyes,

525
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,640
I would hardly believe the Floral Envoy

526
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,079
would personally boil water and coax children.

527
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,839
Mr. Wu, the Floral Envoy seems
very familiar with you.

528
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,640
You said you are originally from Luoyang,

529
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
Why are you here now

530
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,960
helping him take care of these children?

531
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,079
I left home to work
at the Jiang Mansion years ago,

532
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,799
hoping to earn more money.

533
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,200
I had some knowledge of traditional medicine.

534
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
So the servants in the mansion

535
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,319
would come to me whenever they felt unwell.

536
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,240
Later, Suizhi's mother

537
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,599
promoted me to be the steward of her court.

538
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,359
You could say I watched Suizhi grow up.

539
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,079
No wonder he holds you in great respect.

540
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
Mr. Wu,

541
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,000
was the Floral Envoy such
a rebellious character in his youth?

542
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,279
Suizhi may seem untamed,

543
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,839
but in fact, his nature is pure and good.

544
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,000
After his mother passed away,
all the court staff were dismissed.

545
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,119
That year, unexpectedly, there was a famine.

546
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,720
Many children were left homeless.

547
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,359
Suizhi then asked me to come back

548
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,640
to help him take care of these children.

549
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
What are you doing?

550
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,920
Ms. Wang, who was supposed
to bathe the children today, has fallen ill.

551
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,200
If it weren't for the lack of hands,

552
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,799
do you think I would have allowed you
to come along?

553
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,608
The girls are your responsibility.

554
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,319
Even though you are my creditor,

555
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,319
at least I am a free person.

556
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:12,039
Not only do you not repay my money
for the cakes, but you also order me around.

557
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,359
Is there no justice in this world?

558
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,559
You're just so stingy.

559
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,200
Deduct the cost of the cakes and labor
from the dividends, okay?

560
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,839
Mr. Jiang doesn't use the right attitude
to ask for a favor.

561
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,200
But seeing how adorable you are,

562
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,920
I will take you to bathe, all right?

563
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,559
Are you his wife?

564
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,736
- No.
- No.

565
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,839
Why do you make flower cakes for him

566
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:45,079
and help him?

567
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,240
Of course, it's because she owes me.

568
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,960
Don't listen to him. He's talking nonsense.

569
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,992
Let's go.

570
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,759
Slow down.

571
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,159
I'm going to catch you.

572
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
Come catch me, Mr. Wu.

573
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:16,448
Come on, sit down.

574
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,519
I'm here.

575
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,760
I will teach you how to write it down.

576
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,800
You are peeking.

577
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,920
You are peeking.

578
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,239
Horizontal lines must be level,
vertical lines must be straight.

579
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,440
Can't escape, just can't escape.

580
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,639
They are indeed the children
you are taking care of.

581
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,960
Can't even take a bath without making a fuss.

582
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,728
Can't catch me!

583
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:38,760
Come on.

584
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,440
Ms. Wang is getting on in years.

585
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,039
Why don't you take over the job
of helping them bathe from now on?

586
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Alright.

587
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,599
As long as every month,

588
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,599
you deduct the labor costs from the dividends.

589
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,752
Alright.

590
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm here.

591
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,000
Jiang Changyang, when you are
with the children,

592
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,639
you really don't seem like a corrupt official.

593
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,519
You've finally noticed

594
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:10,400
the redeeming feature of me, a wealthy idler.

595
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,440
Clearly possessing a kind heart,

596
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,880
why do you conceal it?

597
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,880
Are you afraid of being discovered
by other people?

598
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,880
If I wished to conceal it,
how could you have found out?

599
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,760
If you want to go back and clear my name,

600
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,079
I certainly won't refuse.

601
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,000
But I'm afraid others
won't believe what you say.

602
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,960
Instead they'll accuse me of feigning virtue.

603
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:46,119
I'm not as noble as you think.

604
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's just that the treasury can't hold
all the money and goods.

605
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,679
So I take some out to do good deeds
and accumulate merit.

606
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,360
After all, you know,

607
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,760
too many people have cursed me to death.

608
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,559
Look, I'm here.

609
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,719
Come quick.

610
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,719
Quick, hide!

611
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,000
Hide!

612
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,880
<i>For the last batch of Huaixiuxiang,</i>

613
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,920
<i>I've thought of a way to improve it.</i>

614
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,079
<i>Don't be greedy for too many flowers.</i>

615
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,599
<i>At most, leave three flowers on one plant.</i>

616
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,280
<i>The leaves need to be pruned massively</i>

617
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,719
<i>to avoid stealing nutrients.</i>

618
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,400
<i>Use a bigger flowerpot.</i>

619
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,159
<i>Increase the thickness of the base fertilizer.</i>

620
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,599
<i>Ensure there's enough space
for the roots to grow.</i>

621
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,840
<i>Carve crescent patterns on the flowerpot</i>

622
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,920
<i>to remind buyers that this flower should
be kept indoors and not exposed to direct sunlight.</i>

623
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,920
<i>Every flower purchaser will receive
a jar of flower fertilizer as a gift,</i>

624
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,280
<i>making it more convenient
for buyers to care for the flowers.</i>

625
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,599
Mudan,

626
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,599
the Floral Envoy has indeed spent money
to buy our fresh flower cakes.

627
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,440
Chuanyu said that from now on, the Jiang Mansion
will order 100 each month.

628
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,119
He certainly keeps his word.

629
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,424
Shengyi,

630
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,280
what do you think of the Floral Envoy
as a person?

631
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,840
The Floral Envoy is always smiling.

632
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,079
He's not as detestable
as the outside rumors suggest.

633
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,800
Children are the most innocent.

634
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,199
They can't disguise their affection
for someone.

635
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,920
It shows he is sincere towards the children.

636
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,480
Perhaps the Floral Envoy is not bad by nature.

637
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,800
Maybe he's just greedy for money.

638
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,440
He

639
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
is stingy on regular days.

640
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:20,800
How could he be generous
and perform charitable acts?

641
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,800
Which side of him is the real him after all?

642
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,079
Mudan, why do you care so much
about the Floral Envoy's character?

643
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,679
Could it be that you've taken a liking to him?

644
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,079
What are you thinking?

645
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,192
He is our landlord and creditor.

646
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,360
Understanding his temperament

647
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,039
is all beneficial and not harmful
to our business.

648
00:38:44,512 --> 00:38:45,600
That's true.

649
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,688
Help out.

650
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,888
Slow down.

651
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,639
When you earn enough money,

652
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,199
haven't you thought about marrying
into a good family?

653
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,480
Life after marriage is certainly
not as free as it is now.

654
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,679
Besides, some marriages are very costly.

655
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,119
I'd better keep my distance.

656
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,639
Mudan, Shengyi.

657
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,416
How have you come back?

658
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,559
The peony incense powder is in small quantity.

659
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,039
It sold out in less than two hours.

660
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,760
My mother said she would look after the stall.

661
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,432
She asked me to come back and transport
all the Chunyiwan over.

662
00:39:18,432 --> 00:39:19,480
- Great!
- Great!

663
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,920
- All of these can be moved.
- Okay.

664
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,280
The improved Huaixiuxiang is growing very well.

665
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,440
Up till today, not a single person
has come back for a return.

666
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,440
Now the incense powder business
is also booming.

667
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
We really have gone through hardships
to reap the benefits.

668
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,400
Fortunately, we refunded the money in time.

669
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,639
The flower shop's business
has not decreased but increased instead.

670
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:42,119
After these peony flowers
are completely off the market,

671
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,840
relying on the money earned from selling
incense powder and Chunyiwan,

672
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,760
we can afford to rent a shop
in the West Market.

673
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,159
Really?

674
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,079
But the rent for a shop is not cheap.

675
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,760
Can we really open a shop?

676
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,920
What others don't have, we have.

677
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,199
That's the foundation for our shop.

678
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,559
Besides, we started our business
with potted peonies.

679
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,440
But eventually, it's just a seasonal gimmick.

680
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,440
If we want to last,
we must cultivate new products.

681
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,480
Actually, I've always felt

682
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,280
that our courtyard is still not big enough.

683
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,719
If we could rent a shop with a flower garden,

684
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,920
we could sell goods in the front space

685
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,320
and cultivate various flowers
in the inner yard.

686
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,559
Wouldn't that be killing two birds
with one stone?

687
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,480
As long as we can grow flowers
that others don't have,

688
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,360
those wasted flowers will be
our ready-made incense powder.

689
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,639
The incense powder business can
also last without decline.

690
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,840
That would be wonderful.

691
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,559
My mother spends all day at home worrying.

692
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,079
She's afraid that once the peony incense powder
is sold out, we'll be out of business.

693
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,239
If we always have novel base powders
as our signboard,

694
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,639
we won't fear others copying

695
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,360
our custom fragrance-making method.

696
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
That's right.

697
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,119
Yes, think about it.

698
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,920
Even if these peonies never go out of season,

699
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,880
everyone would get tired of them after a year.

700
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
Nothing compares to changing fragrances

701
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,800
in four seasons to retain customers.

702
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,960
That's true.

703
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,039
Fu, I'm good at growing flowers
on a normal day.

704
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,519
We'll have to rely more on Ms. Sun
for the incense powder.

705
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,328
Rest assured about that.

706
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,639
Shengyi, I have thought about it.

707
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,519
If we really open a shop,

708
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,039
besides selling some affordably priced
fresh flowers,

709
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,320
I also want to sell some famous brands.

710
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,000
You are the most skillful and meticulous.

711
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,159
You are already very proficient
at cultivating these common flowers.

712
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,760
In the future, I want to spend more time
cultivating new varieties.

713
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,360
I'll rely on you for the other flowers.

714
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,280
Leave this to me, rest assured.

715
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
When Chunyiwan is all sold out,

716
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,920
shall we mainly sell Herbaceous Peonies?

717
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,039
Of course, we can.

718
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,599
There are many varieties
of Herbaceous Peonies to sell.

719
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,039
Oh, right. I bought a few Herbaceous Peony
plants from the flower farmer.

720
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,400
Tomorrow we can transplant them
into the courtyard

721
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,519
to cultivate and improve them.

722
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,280
Tomorrow, you can be at ease
with your business.

723
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,199
Leave the flower stall to me and Fu.

724
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,224
Okay.

725
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,072
- Come on.
- It's almost done.

726
00:41:51,072 --> 00:41:52,079
- Almost done.
- Okay.

727
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,079
Steady it from the front again.

728
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:18,133
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫</i>

729
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:26,671
<i>♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫</i>

730
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:34,545
<i>♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫</i>

731
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:43,891
<i>♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫</i>

732
00:42:43,891 --> 00:42:51,434
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

733
00:42:52,088 --> 00:43:00,275
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

734
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:08,086
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

735
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:15,983
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>

736
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:43,542
<i>♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫</i>

737
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:51,537
<i>♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the fragrant garden ♫</i>

738
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:59,596
<i>♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫</i>

739
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:08,589
<i>♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫</i>

740
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:16,020
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

741
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:25,107
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

742
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:32,531
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

743
00:44:33,535 --> 00:44:40,985
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>
