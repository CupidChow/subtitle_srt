00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,816
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:39,000
(Episode 18)

3
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Miss Mu Dan.

4
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,759
Mr. Wu.

5
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,879
Miss Mu Dan.

6
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Sui Zhi

7
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,381
came here last night.

8
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,919
He has been sitting there ever since,

9
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,101
not saying a word.

10
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,781
I saw him like this

11
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,381
once before, many years ago.

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,300
Was it also

13
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,821
because of Madam Bai and her son?

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Mr. Wu,

15
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,221
he was there

16
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,840
when Madam Bai gave birth.

17
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,020
Do you know what happened?

18
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,341
Since Sui Zhi has shared that with you,

19
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,740
it must mean he trusts you

20
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,740
as someone he can confide in.

21
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,061
The day Madam Bai's son was born

22
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,860
was also the day Sui Zhi's mother

23
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,941
passed away.

24
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,341
Sui Zhi.

25
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,919
I'm here.

26
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,661
Your father...

27
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,501
Where is he?

28
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,940
Yuan Tang...

29
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,420
Sui Zhi,

30
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,541
I want to

31
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,101
see your father

32
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,500
one

33
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,581
last time.

34
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,839
Mother,

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
wait for me.

36
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,101
I'll bring him back.

37
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,879
- Let's go. - Master!

38
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Master!

39
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,456
Madam is in difficult labor.

40
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,073
There are signs of severe hemorrhaging.

41
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,820
My mother is dying!

42
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,759
She's fighting for her life because of me.

43
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,940
She's hanging by a thread.

44
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,039
I can't just leave her alone at a time like this.

45
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,120
Go home and tell your mother to hold on a little longer.

46
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,541
I'll return immediately once she's safe.

47
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,740
Mother has waited too long for you!

48
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,060
You once swore,

49
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,581
in your own handwriting,

50
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,940
that you would never fail her.

51
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,661
How could you

52
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,820
do this to her?

53
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,620
All she wants is to see you one last time.

54
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,661
What I owe her in this life,

55
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,901
I'll never be able to repay.

56
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
In the next life,

57
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,679
I promise I will make it up to her.

58
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,860
Oaths of love,

59
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,119
promises of never leaving in life or in death,

60
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,541
they're all just empty words

61
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,461
that wound others and destroy oneself.

62
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,820
"So her child didn't deserve to die,

63
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,341
but my mother did?"

64
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,260
So that's what he meant

65
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:28,860
by those words.

66
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,301
After Madam Jiang passed away,

67
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,181
Sui Zhi knelt by her bedside in a daze

68
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,701
for an entire night.

69
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
He didn't leave,

70
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,421
not even when he passed out.

71
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,380
When he woke,

72
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,620
he was like this.

73
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,181
He wouldn't say a word,

74
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,461
nor eat anything.

75
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,981
No wonder he vowed never to marry.

76
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,780
It must have been at that moment

77
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,780
that he stopped believing in love

78
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,540
and chose to live his life as someone cold and detached.

79
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,879
He may

80
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:19,821
seem like a cold person,

81
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,799
but he actually

82
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,581
repays even the smallest kindness.

83
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,101
A few years ago,

84
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,140
my entire family

85
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,221
back in Luoyang died from the plague.

86
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,900
I was overwhelmed with despair.

87
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,101
I wanted to

88
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,260
kill myself.

89
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,221
It was Sui Zhi

90
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
who saved me.

91
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,780
I was just a steward

92
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,061
in his mother's house,

93
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,780
a mere servant.

94
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,341
Yet, he personally went to Luoyang to bring me back.

95
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,221
He told me

96
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,500
these children here

97
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,221
were now my family

98
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,780
and gave me a reason to keep living.

99
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,101
His cheerful, carefree demeanor is all a facade.

100
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,461
Deep down, he carries a lot of pain.

101
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,879
Mu Dan,

102
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,780
even if you don't have feelings for Sui Zhi,

103
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,701
could you at least keep him company during his lonelier,

104
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,900
darker moments?

105
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,660
He's been so lonely all these years.

106
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,140
He must be

107
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,500
torn inside.

108
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,421
He knows

109
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,740
it was all his father's fault.

110
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,860
But if he helps Madam Bai and her child,

111
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,181
he would feel

112
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,660
as though he's betraying his own mother.

113
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,039
Yet, if he doesn't save them...

114
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,500
How could he bear to turn his back on them?

115
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,380
That is the dilemma

116
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,142
he's trapped in.

117
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,360
You've been carving for so long.

118
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,981
Have some flower pastries.

119
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Have some tea.

120
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm not thirsty.

121
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,301
I came to congratulate you.

122
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,341
Your enemy is about to die,

123
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,860
so you don't need to worry anymore.

124
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,660
You can return to your residence now.

125
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,540
They were so easy to fool.

126
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,262
I told them you and I were in odds

127
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,780
to lure them in

128
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,181
and arranged for a doctor to check the child.

129
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,701
Madam Bai actually thought she'd met a savior.

130
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,440
Little did she know that the boy's illness is extremely critical.

131
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,020
Only the sage physician, Physician Fu, can cure him.

132
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,221
With no one capable of curing him, his fate is sealed.

133
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,660
Where are they now?

134
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,341
Don't worry about that.

135
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,540
I've sent them away to an inn.

136
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,701
The boy won't make past

137
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,700
three days.

138
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,879
Thank you for stalling him to death for me.

139
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,981
I'll prepare his burial money.

140
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,821
Now the boy just needs to die.

141
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
To thank you for your trouble...

142
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,279
This is your reward.

143
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
What is this?

144
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
A gold bar.

145
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,919
Can't you tell?

146
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Miss.

147
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,679
Who are you?

148
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,260
My surname is Fu.

149
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,880
Last night, Lord Jiang said he was so overjoyed

150
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,740
about avenging his great grudge

151
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,821
that he drank too much and caught a chill, leading to a cough.

152
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,696
He asked me to come and take a look.

153
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,336
You've come to the wrong place. The Jiang's Residence is over there.

154
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,660
Zhao Cai, why did you...

155
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,240
After seeing Lord Jiang,

156
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,214
he said there's a lady in the back courtyard

157
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:20,100
with an injured tendon in her right hand.

158
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,581
He said since I'm already here, I may as well take a look.

159
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,221
Her hand has been treated by me.

160
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,919
There's no need for outside help...

161
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,375
Are you the legendary Physician Fu from the Imperial Medical Bureau?

162
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,799
I've memorized every one of your medical texts.

163
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,221
I never imagined I'd one day see you in person.

164
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,719
There's a child suffering

165
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,656
from a rare illness you wrote about in your books.

166
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,306
He urgently needs your attention.

167
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,421
Jiang Chang Yang fell ill at a convenient time.

168
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Lift your foot.

169
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,519
Go in.

170
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,301
Wait for me in there.

171
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,260
Madam, this money is for your child.

172
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,581
Thank you for saving my son.

173
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,559
We can never repay your kindness.

174
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,720
No need for thanks. Just take it.

175
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,639
Quickly, take it.

176
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,701
You have a compassionate heart.

177
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,581
But you're running a business for Jiang Chang Yang,

178
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,140
and yet you saved Fan'er behind his back.

179
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,079
Please be careful.

180
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,320
If he finds out, he might harm you.

181
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,559
I'm not the one you should really thank.

182
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,484
If he really wanted your son to suffer

183
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,228
from this illness for the rest of his life,

184
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,821
who in this vast Chang'an could have really saved Fan'er?

185
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
Chuan Yu.

186
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,680
Physician Fu's consultation fees aren't cheap.

187
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,860
Young Master said someone as stingy as you,

188
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,780
if you've paid it for him,

189
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,320
will surely find a way to demand it back tenfold later.

190
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,160
So he asked me to bring you the money now.

191
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,519
Well, in that case,

192
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,399
I will accept it gracefully.

193
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,140
Is there anything else you need?

194
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,066
Nothing more from Young Master,

195
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,740
but I...

196
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,096
Miss He, you're the only one

197
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,660
who can see through Young Master's act after all these years.

198
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,736
Since you understand his thoughts so well,

199
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,140
why didn't you persuade him to stop tormenting himself?

200
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,981
Letting go of hatred would make him much happier, wouldn't it?

201
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,239
He chose to save them

202
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,381
because his heart is soft.

203
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,239
Only a bodhisattva can forgive everything,

204
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,160
but being a bodhisattva must be so dull.

205
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,381
No meat, no wine, what's the fun in that?

206
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,221
If it were me,

207
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,500
I'd have made the same choice as he did.

208
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,279
So,

209
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,239
there's no need to let go of hatred.

210
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,119
Just let go of the burden on yourself.

211
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,621
There's nothing wrong with being an ordinary person.

212
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm off.

213
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,720
You think you understand me, huh?

214
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,020
I'm the most corrupt official in Chang'an.

215
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,260
I'm soft?

216
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,941
No, you're the soft one!

217
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,701
I threw the money right in Madam Bai's face!

218
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
I told her,

219
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
"Let me be clear,

220
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,621
this is burial money from Lord Jiang.

221
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,079
Whether you live or die in the future

222
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,060
has nothing to do with him.

223
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,199
If you dare show up in front of him again,

224
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,479
don't blame him for being ruthless enough

225
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,999
to bury you alive!

226
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,079
Got it?"

227
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Excuse me.

228
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,340
What you're saying

229
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,901
doesn't quite match Chuan Yu's report.

230
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,039
Outside the inn,

231
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,500
he saw you politely sending them off.

232
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,141
That was in public.

233
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,141
I had to save face for you.

234
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,421
But behind closed doors,

235
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,020
I was downright cruel,

236
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,960
doing all kinds of things that would send me straight to hell.

237
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,740
I won't go into details, though.

238
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,519
I wouldn't want to sully your ears.

239
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,400
Just know I got you your revenge.

240
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,701
I have plenty of money.

241
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,941
I could easily bribe all ten kings of hell.

242
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,159
If you were going to hell because of me,

243
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,901
I would personally bring you back.

244
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,300
Well, thank you for your generosity then.

245
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,661
I should be the one thanking you.

246
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,840
Thank you for your ruthless methods,

247
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,221
for relieving my hatred.

248
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,160
Thank you for stooping to my level,

249
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,661
for becoming my partner in crime.

250
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,775
And thank you for seeing through me so clearly,

251
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,799
for knowing...

252
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
No need to say more.

253
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,100
Everything is understood over wine.

254
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I get it.

255
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,780
Your hands are still recovering.

256
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
You shouldn't drink.

257
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,440
I will drink on your behalf.

258
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,759
Here's to

259
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,079
understanding me.

260
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,661
I drank too much.

261
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,240
What I said was just drunken nonsense.

262
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Don't take it seriously.

263
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
I know,

264
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,340
just drunken talk.

265
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,039
But, Lord Jiang, surely what you just said

266
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
about having plenty of money wasn't nonsense, right?

267
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,656
This was my first time playing the villain,

268
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,039
all that fighting, scheming,

269
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,800
buying medicine and even weapons.

270
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,160
It cost me quite a lot of money.

271
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
So, perhaps...

272
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,861
I'm in a good mood today.

273
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Go on, let's hear it.

274
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,421
Seeing as I put my heart and soul into this,

275
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,861
and since Blooming Abode is planning to expand,

276
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,520
how about we revise the contract?

277
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,736
Let's split it 60/40 instead.

278
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,856
Have you gotten addicted to playing the shrewd merchant?

279
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,999
Always pushing your luck!

280
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,340
You can't put it that way.

281
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,780
After all, I've been doing your dirty work, bullying the weak.

282
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,421
If you had done it yourself,

283
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,815
wouldn't you be condemned to the fiery depths of hell,

284
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,540
burned alive every day without ever dying?

285
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,181
How terrifying is that?

286
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,221
Lord Jiang, why does this charcoal seem to have gone out?

287
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,479
Look at it, My Lord.

288
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,679
Is it not burning?

289
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,221
I only have this one weakness,

290
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,100
and yet it's fallen into your hands.

291
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,359
Fine, as you wish.

292
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,221
Thank you, Lord Jiang.

293
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Alright then,

294
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,300
I must toast to you.

295
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,160
You shouldn't be drinking.

296
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,760
Why won't you listen to the physician?

297
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,519
It's fine. It's been a long time since I drank.

298
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,479
Watching you drink has been making me crave it.

299
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,121
Just one cup. Come on, pour me one.

300
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,279
No way.

301
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,760
- Jiang Chang Yang, just one. - No.

302
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,279
- One drink won't hurt. - No.

303
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,359
You...

304
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,999
You're unbelievable. Come on.

305
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,600
- No way. - Watch my injuries.

306
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,256
- That's why you can't drink. - Look at the charcoal.

307
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,560
- Still no. - Jiang Chang Yang...

308
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,080
- Put it down. - Look at this.

309
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Careful with that!

310
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,941
Why isn't it burning?

311
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,901
I had hoped to ask Physician Fu to visit other patients with me,

312
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,720
but he's too busy now and has returned to the palace.

313
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
It's so strange.

314
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,400
There are so few people in the palace

315
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,040
compared to the countless ones outside.

316
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,101
Those nobles are pampered with the finest food and care.

317
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,861
How could they be so frail and prone to illness?

318
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,136
He works for the Imperial Medical Bureau after all.

319
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,528
His duties are focused on the palace.

320
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:38,912
That he came out to help at all is already a rare courtesy.

321
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,920
But shouldn't a physician has a compassionate heart

322
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,221
and treat everyone the same,

323
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,141
whether they're nobles or commoners?

324
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,861
Which is exactly why we need physicians like you.

325
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,119
Honestly, Physician Fu is already quite remarkable.

326
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,519
He never looks down on women practicing medicine.

327
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,221
He even praised the way you handled the child's case.

328
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,199
If you ever encounter any difficult cases, you can note them down.

329
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:08,759
Physician Fu visits Jiang Chang Yang every month for a routine check.

330
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,381
You can consult him then.

331
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,519
That's wonderful.

332
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,697
He can manage the palace, and I'll handle those outside.

333
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:16,020
No patient will be neglected.

334
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,981
Why did you want to become a physician?

335
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,621
My grandfather came from a family of renowned healers.

336
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,020
He saved countless lives.

337
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,959
When he passed away,

338
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,421
the line of mourners stretched for two miles.

339
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,060
So you became a physician because of your grandfather.

340
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,381
At first, it was just admiration for him.

341
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,040
Then, by chance, I stumbled upon one of his medical texts.

342
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,221
Somehow, I became captivated.

343
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,580
Now, healing and saving lives is the most important thing to me.

344
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,320
If I go a day without seeing a patient, I feel uneasy.

345
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
In that case,

346
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,599
any flowers from Blooming Abode that can't be sold,

347
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,176
I'll send them to you for research and medicinal use. Alright?

348
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Really, Mu Dan?

349
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Thank you.

350
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,100
Your hands still need a few more days of treatment.

351
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,520
You can start trying to bend your fingers soon,

352
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,099
but if you feel pain,

353
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,320
you must stop immediately.

354
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Understood.

355
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,020
But can I hold a brush now?

356
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,540
The shop is about to launch new flowers.

357
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,559
I'd like to paint a few peony sketches to hang at the storefront.

358
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Absolutely not.

359
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,381
Painting takes too long

360
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,340
and puts too much strain on your tendons.

361
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,559
How about this, I'll do it for you.

362
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,376
I often practice sketching different medicinal herbs.

363
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,279
If you let me see the new flowers,

364
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,719
I'm sure I can paint them for you.

365
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,941
That's wonderful.

366
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,300
Thank you so much, Chun.

367
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,599
It's alright. You can touch them.

368
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,820
Just be gentle.

369
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Mu Dan.

370
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,759
What's wrong?

371
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,015
She was supposed to check your hands only,

372
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,461
why is she looking at flowers now?

373
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,981
We haven't launched these peonies yet.

374
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,600
What if she leaks it to Lv Wan Rong

375
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,661
and the Flower Association beats us to it?

376
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,461
She's here to paint for me.

377
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,199
Besides, flowers like Moutan peony

378
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,820
aren't cultivated in just a few days.

379
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,500
Don't worry too much.

380
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
You seem to

381
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,260
treat her differently from others.

382
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,181
Chun is indeed not like most women.

383
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,760
She has the compassionate heart of a healer.

384
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,621
She's someone worthy of trust and respect.

385
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,976
They were fine just a few days ago.

386
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,300
How did this suddenly happen?

387
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,820
What pest is this?

388
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
It's scale insects.

389
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,981
We've always used repellents to keep pests away.

390
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,340
Even if a few slipped through,

391
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,500
it shouldn't have affected all the flowers.

392
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,300
I even inspected them during fertilization last time.

393
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,141
I didn't see any insects.

394
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,839
Do we have any of the last batch of fertilizer left?

395
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,000
Someone has planted insect eggs in our fertilizer.

396
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,720
They're trying to destroy our flowers.

397
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,519
I...

398
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
I should've been more careful.

399
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,861
I should've noticed when applying the fertilizer.

400
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,981
Sheng Yi, don't blame yourself.

401
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Look at these eggs.

402
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,020
They're extremely tiny, impossible to spot with the naked eye.

403
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,621
Besides, they only hatch into pests two or three days after being planted.

404
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,977
- I've checked all the flowers. - And?

405
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,119
The Dream Fragrance in Blooming Abode are fine.

406
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,661
That's a relief. Looks like the tampering was limited

407
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,079
to the fertilizer at home.

408
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,759
Lv Geng Chun

409
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,333
stayed alone in the courtyard

410
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,760
for quite a while yesterday under the pretext of painting.

411
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,260
I was wondering why she was suddenly so kind.

412
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
She must have tipped off Lv Wan Rong.

413
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,616
The Flower Association must be afraid

414
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,335
we'd take over the market for premium peonies,

415
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,100
so they sent us to plant insects while we weren't paying attention.

416
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,600
Chun isn't the only one who knows we're cultivating premium flowers.

417
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,775
Anyone with knowledge of flowers

418
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,461
could deduce from the fertilizer blend

419
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,020
what kind of flowers it was meant for.

420
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,820
Besides, these insect eggs may have been planted

421
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,540
in the fertilizer before it entered our home.

422
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,815
But the fertilizer suppliers are our own people.

423
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,159
They'd have no reason to do this.

424
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
That's right.

425
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,621
The only outsider who has had access to the fertilizer

426
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,580
is Lv Geng Chun.

427
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,941
It really wasn't me.

428
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
Go back and tell your father that you've gotten what you wanted.

429
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,559
You're not welcome here. If you don't leave now, I will hit you! Out!

430
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,221
Da Fu, don't hurt her.

431
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,799
Mu Dan,

432
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,500
it really wasn't me.

433
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,701
Do you not believe me either?

434
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
I believe you.

435
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,575
If it was her, why would she come back here and let us catch her?

436
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,740
I don't think she knew.

437
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,461
Even if it wasn't her,

438
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,176
- Lv Wan Rong must've ordered someone to do it. - That's right.

439
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,500
You know the Flower Association has been sabotaging us.

440
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,480
It has to be her!

441
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,896
But my father isn't that kind of person!

442
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,479
Say that again if you dare!

443
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,559
Da Fu!

444
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,656
Our priority right now is saving the flowers.

445
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,000
When they're safe, we can discuss the truth of the matter.

446
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,180
I'll fetch water. You two, crush some sulfur

447
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,255
and mix it into the water to lure and kill the pests.

448
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,279
Go.

449
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,559
Go.

450
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Mu Dan.

451
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,861
Please let me help.

452
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,540
We're short on hands right now.

453
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,941
Join in and help.

454
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Come on.

455
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Here, Da Fu.

456
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,559
Mu Dan.

457
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,740
Your painting is excellent.

458
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Here.

459
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,800
Let me change your dressing, so it doesn't get infected.

460
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
Alright.

461
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,759
Mu Dan,

462
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,141
thank you for trusting me.

463
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,300
Don't blame Da Fu or Sheng Yi.

464
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,216
The Flower Association has made things hard for us many times.

465
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,861
It's only natural they'd be upset.

466
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:25,360
I know that business competitors would resort to underhanded tactics,

467
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,621
but my father loves flowers.

468
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,679
If he allowed me to pick our peonies freely,

469
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,159
I wouldn't have to sneak over to Blooming Abode to buy them.

470
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,661
One year, Chang'an suffered a pest outbreak.

471
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,599
Every peony in the city was withering.

472
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,901
My father developed a cure.

473
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,639
Back then, he was just a small-time flower merchant,

474
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,340
but instead of profiting from it,

475
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,999
he shared the method with everyone

476
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,260
and saved the city's peonies.

477
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,400
He always tells me,

478
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,720
"You can make money next year if you miss out this year.

479
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,239
But if the city's peonies don't bloom,

480
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,141
we miss the entire spring."

481
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,820
No wonder your father could become the association leader

482
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,580
and stay there for ten years.

483
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,901
My father does oppose women running businesses

484
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,621
and can be rather stubborn at times,

485
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,941
but he is not a man with ill intent.

486
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,689
Doing something as malicious as planting insect eggs to destroy flowers

487
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:22,054
would never be his way.

488
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,100
I believe in your father's character, of course.

489
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,740
But, Chun, your father is the association leader,

490
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,120
and Blooming Abode has taken a lot of guests from the Flower Association.

491
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,461
There are things

492
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,100
he wouldn't do,

493
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,420
but others might do them for him.

494
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,015
If the mastermind behind this really is someone from the Association,

495
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,239
you can apprehend them and confront my father directly.

496
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,520
He will not hesitate to punish them severely.

497
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,620
How foolish.

498
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,400
Repeating the same trick without even bothering to change it.

499
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,020
Whose topdressing is this?

500
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,896
It's from Mr. Cai. He just delivered it.

501
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
He is still at the door.

502
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:26,759
Miss.

503
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,079
Is there anything I can help you with?

504
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,820
Why did you put insects in my fertilizer?

505
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Insects?

506
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,039
What insects?

507
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,440
I don't know anything about that!

508
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,120
You're denying it, huh?

509
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,279
Da Fu, tie him up and take him to the authorities.

510
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,260
Wait, hold on! You have no evidence.

511
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,820
Dragging me to the officials won't do you any good.

512
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,381
I don't know anything.

513
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,320
At worst, they'll only convict me for negligence.

514
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,461
I can handle a few lashes as punishment.

515
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,100
Who said there's no evidence?

516
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,519
When you delivered fertilizer in the past,

517
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,621
you always wore old, well-worn clothes.

518
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,580
But now you show up in brand-new attire,

519
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,261
silk shoes and fine fabrics, no less.

520
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,540
With your wages,

521
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,540
there's no way you could afford such luxury.

522
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,879
If you still refuse to admit it, that's fine.

523
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,320
We'll report it to the authorities.

524
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,600
Whoever hired you to sabotage Blooming Abode

525
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,200
must have paid you a hefty sum.

526
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,660
That kind of money isn't spent overnight.

527
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,261
When the officials search your home, they'll find it.

528
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,100
Not only will you lose every coin,

529
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,399
but you'll also end up having to compensate me.

530
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,381
And don't think

531
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,941
you'll get off with just a few lashes

532
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,159
Now, let's go report this!

533
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,040
No, no, no!

534
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,439
Please have mercy, Miss!

535
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,159
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

536
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,320
Please spare me! I'll tell you everything!

537
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,461
It's my first time, please!

538
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Father.

539
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,402
You usually spend all your time in your room working on your embroidery,

540
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:00,606
only coming out for greetings and meals.

541
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:03,421
What made you decide to go out today?

542
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,215
I've been cooped up for too long.

543
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,639
So, I wanted to get some fresh air.

544
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Good.

545
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,039
Welcome.

546
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,140
Please refill my wine.

547
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,861
Leader Lv.

548
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,119
What a coincidence.

549
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,220
Blooming Abode's business must be thriving.

550
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,661
So much so

551
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,519
that you've started drinking and enjoying yourself this early.

552
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,119
Leader Lu, you've got it wrong.

553
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,861
I'm drinking to drown my sorrows.

554
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,559
A few days ago, my courtyard was infested with pests,

555
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,100
ruining many of my prized peonies.

556
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,015
With this humid and sweltering weather,

557
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,861
you'd best stay vigilant as well.

558
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,540
We usually relay messages through others.

559
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,700
What happened today that made you insist on meeting me in person?

560
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,981
You told me to infest Blooming Abode's peonies with pests,

561
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,180
but you didn't mention they were high-grade, premium flowers!

562
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,620
The reward you gave me before

563
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,360
is far too little for this.

564
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,580
You wretched rat!

565
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,599
The job isn't even done,

566
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,140
and you dare come asking for more?

567
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,301
Lucky for you it's not done yet.

568
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,620
If it were, would you admit it and pay me, Deputy Leader Cao?

569
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Ruining her entire garden of peonies is easy enough,

570
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,301
just pay me more.

571
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,920
- How much do you want? - Well...

572
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,639
Leader Lv, what are you doing here?

573
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,100
And what about you, Deputy Leader Cao?

574
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,170
We've caught you red-handed for bribing

575
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,899
a flower farmer to sabotage my flowers.

576
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,495
Not to mention the last time you hired charlatans

577
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,981
to spread malicious rumors about me.

578
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,941
I've held back long enough.

579
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,639
Leader Lv,

580
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,535
I have no desire to make an enemy of the Association,

581
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:06,239
which is why I haven't handed over the evidence to the authorities.

582
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,941
But I must ask, how do you plan to address this?

583
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,020
I've often reminded you

584
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:14,655
that while it's fine to keep the association members in check,

585
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,261
you mustn't go too far.

586
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,781
But not only did you ignore my warnings,

587
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,599
but you escalated your actions and tarnished their reputation.

588
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,416
Destroying flower is an unforgivable taboo in our association.

589
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,719
As the deputy leader, you knowingly violated this rule.

590
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,759
I must enforce our regulations and expel you from the association.

591
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,999
From now on, you are forbidden from engaging in any flower-related trade!

592
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,519
Wan Rong,

593
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,920
we've known each other for so many years.

594
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:42,500
You know how much I've sacrificed for the association.

595
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,079
If I'm not allowed to work with flowers anymore,

596
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,901
what am I supposed to do for a living?

597
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Wan Rong,

598
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,559
I wasn't thinking straight when I did those things.

599
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
I swear

600
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,100
I'll never do such things again.

601
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Wan Rong!

602
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,599
Wan Rong!

603
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,301
I'm not the victim here.

604
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,600
The person you need to seek forgiveness from

605
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,540
is the owner of Blooming Abode.

606
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:13,719
Miss,

607
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,620
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,781
I will compensate you for all your losses.

609
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
I only ask

610
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,060
that you show mercy

611
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,060
and spare me.

612
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,821
Leader, you're a kindhearted person.

613
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,781
I only seek justice,

614
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,861
not to ruin someone's livelihood.

615
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,726
It's not women merchants like us

616
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,821
who deserve to be looked down on,

617
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,020
but rather people like you,

618
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,500
who abuse their power to oppress women.

619
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,660
I can let this matter go,

620
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
but Cao Yu Ying,

621
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,240
you must compensate me at five times the market value for the damages.

622
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,959
And I hope the Association

623
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,759
will coexist peacefully with us from now on

624
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,821
and stop obstructing us.

625
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,160
Your generosity speaks volumes.

626
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,240
I thank you on Yu Ying's behalf.

627
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Yu Ying,

628
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,599
while this matter will remain private

629
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,279
to protect the Association's reputation,

630
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,381
you can no longer serve as the deputy leader.

631
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,695
I hope you'll dedicate yourself to cultivating flowers from now on

632
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,620
and stop harboring malicious intents.

633
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,461
I understand.

634
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Thank you, sir.

635
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,540
Thank you, Miss.

636
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,700
I underestimated you

637
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,261
because you're a woman.

638
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,821
I never imagined you'd succeed in cultivating the delicate Moutan peony.

639
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,180
If you want,

640
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:58,119
I can make an exception and allow you to join the Association.

641
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,240
Thank you for the kind offer,

642
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
but

643
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,039
the Association's rules for women are too restrictive.

644
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,519
I don't think it's a good fit for me, so I'll pass.

645
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,201
Changing those rules isn't something that can be done overnight.

646
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:13,020
It takes time and careful consideration.

647
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,421
If you join us,

648
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,941
you will have support from your peers

649
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,055
should you face pests or other challenges in the future.

650
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,220
A woman in business

651
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,580
faces a rough path.

652
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,660
Walking it alone is even tougher.

653
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:29,620
There are countless paths in the world. None of them are easy.

654
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:33,060
I'll consider this my way of paving the way for other women to follow.

655
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,519
Then it seems

656
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,981
we'll have to remain competitors.

657
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:43,159
Having competitors keeps us sharp and prevents complacency.

658
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,981
And wouldn't you agree

659
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,140
that a city like Chang'an is far more beautiful

660
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,981
with various blooming flowers competing in splendor

661
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:51,959
than with monotonous uniformity?

662
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,519
Goodbye.
