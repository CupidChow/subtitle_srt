1
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:35,676
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:38,920
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,120
What should I do for you to let her go?

4
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,360
Give me ten strings of coins,

5
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:47,983
and I'll draft a divorce agreement immediately.

6
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:50,320
Fine. I'll pay you ten strings of coins.

7
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,520
Draft a divorce agreement immediately.

8
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:00,247
Fine.

9
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:02,985
Wu Niang!

10
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,280
Wu Niang.

11
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,640
Wait for me.

12
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,120
Shopkeeper Yun.

13
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:22,272
I'll use my jade pendant as a mortgage.

14
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,024
I'll borrow ten strings of coins from you.

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,280
You can charge me interest according to your rules, okay?

16
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:29,520
You're barely surviving.

17
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:31,440
Can you still afford to save her?

18
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:34,240
Didn't you say that...

19
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:37,560
My late mother left this behind for me.

20
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,360
I can't bear to part with it

21
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:40,840
unless the situation calls for it.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
Please forgive me.

23
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:46,120
Have you truly made up your mind?

24
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:51,480
Wang Qing is an animal.

25
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:53,960
If he takes Wu Niang home,

26
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,840
he'll surely beat her to death.

27
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:59,800
Your mother left that jade pendant behind for you!

28
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,560
You mustn't pawn it!

29
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:04,800
No matter how valuable it is,

30
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,911
it will never be as valuable as human lives.

31
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm sure Mother won't blame me for this.

32
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:16,560
Shopkeeper,

33
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:18,920
I may be mortgaging my jade pendant now,

34
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:21,640
but I'll redeem it once I've made enough money in the future.

35
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,960
Is that okay?

36
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm willing to lend you the money without charging any interest.

37
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:32,545
Shopkeeper, I know you're righteous and generous.

38
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:33,808
I'm grateful to you for that.

39
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,232
However, the rules shouldn't be broken.

40
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:39,160
Take it.

41
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:50,520
Shopkeeper Yun.

42
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:58,520
Take this.

43
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:01,975
Wait.

44
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,520
You guys may have settled your debts,

45
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,600
but I think it's time for Shopkeeper Yun to settle hers.

46
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:13,491
Huanyun Pavilion spent a lot of money on the flowers and plants here.

47
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:15,418
Outsiders have damaged them due to their commotion.

48
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:18,080
Shopkeeper Yun, don't forget to make him compensate you.

49
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:20,822
I forgot about it since I was too busy just now.

50
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:22,406
Lord Jiang, thank you for the reminder.

51
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:29,680
Wang Qing,

52
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,240
the peony you've damaged is called Zhuyan.

53
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,000
It's worth at least 1,000 wen in the market.

54
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,760
This marsh orchid would sell for no less than 800 wen.

55
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,032
What kind of flowers are they? Do they actually cost that much?

56
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,440
Stop trying to scam me.

57
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,373
You'll know their prices once you inquire about them from the market.

58
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,880
How could I scam you?

59
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,400
Even if you report this to the authorities,

60
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:51,320
you'll only pay extra for the compensation fee.

61
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:54,880
Including all the plants you've damaged,

62
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,279
you have to pay us at least 20 strings of coins for them.

63
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:59,000
You don't have enough.

64
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,599
You still owe us 10 strings of coins.

65
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:07,320
Shopkeeper Yun, please decide how you want him to compensate you.

66
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,680
This is ridiculous!

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,920
You guys are ganging up on me to cheat me of my money!

68
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,927
Do you think this is your home?

69
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,542
You don't have enough money, huh?

70
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,200
That's fine.

71
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,019
One punch is equal to one string of coins.

72
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:24,000
Take ten punches from me, and your debt will be called off.

73
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,692
You guys are abusing your power!

74
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,760
It's reasonable for one to repay their debt.

75
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,240
How am I abusing my power?

76
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:31,927
My body is delicate.

77
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:33,640
When it comes to beating someone up...

78
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,417
Chuan Yu!

79
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:36,746
Yes, My Lord.

80
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:48,640
Chuan Yu, did you not eat just now?

81
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:50,760
Your punches look weak.

82
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,040
Miss Yun, why did you imitate her?

83
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:12,905
Are you trying to save the world as well?

84
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:14,265
My Lord, you may not know,

85
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,840
but this is a sign of loyalty and friendship between women.

86
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:55,626
Wu Niang.

87
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:58,145
What do you think?

88
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:02,040
Initially, I was still hesitating.

89
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:05,120
But when I saw that you could live a good life

90
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:07,920
even in a decrepit place like this,

91
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,800
all of my fears vanished instantly.

92
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:13,480
Losing our freedom is the most terrifying thing of all.

93
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,170
Come.

94
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:21,560
Let's have some fruits.

95
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:38,746
Wu Niang.

96
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,441
Look.

97
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,680
The sunset is gorgeous.

98
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:46,408
A gorgeous sunset like this

99
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:49,000
is shining upon the royal family.

100
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,600
At the same time, it's also shining upon the commoners.

101
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,577
If we look at it from that perspective,

102
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:58,457
at this moment, it makes us no different from them.

103
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,560
Usually, at this time,

104
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:11,040
I was always busy with chores.

105
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,240
I've never thought of admiring the sunset at all.

106
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,440
Mu Dan,

107
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:29,360
you illuminated my life, just like this gorgeous sunset.

108
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:33,800
You took the words right out of my mouth.

109
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:38,000
Although you feared Wang Qing,

110
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,920
you kept reminding me to leave.

111
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,280
You knew that he would beat you up if you helped me to escape.

112
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:48,480
Even so, you still supported me.

113
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:53,320
Wu Niang,

114
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:56,200
you're much braver and kinder

115
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:57,840
than you think.

116
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,760
It's all because you rescued me in the past.

117
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:03,880
That's how I'm able to rescue you now.

118
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:10,800
Don't cry.

119
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:12,560
It's over now.

120
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:15,440
It's all in the past now.

121
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,242
We've known each other for quite some time.

122
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,480
You still haven't told me your full name yet.

123
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,920
Since birth,

124
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,400
my mother only addressed me as Wu.

125
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:33,240
I don't have a proper name.

126
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,440
Can you come up with a proper name for me?

127
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:45,560
Sure.

128
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,120
Today is the day of your rebirth.

129
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,986
Let me come up with a good name for you as a sign of auspiciousness.

130
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:51,186
Wait for me.

131
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:03,407
I hope

132
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:05,840
that everything will go your way

133
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,320
and that you won't need to worry.

134
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:11,800
What about this?

135
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,266
Sheng.

136
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:24,345
Yi.

137
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,520
Sheng Yi.

138
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:29,800
Your name shall be Qin Sheng Yi. What do you think?

139
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:33,720
Although I'm illiterate,

140
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,480
a smooth life without any worries, huh?

141
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:39,320
Qin Sheng Yi.

142
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:42,247
I love it!

143
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,800
Sheng Yi!

144
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:48,160
You're Qin Sheng Yi.

145
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,440
My name is Qin Sheng Yi!

146
00:10:49,786 --> 00:10:51,080
Sheng Yi!

147
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,160
Sheng Yi!

148
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,504
When we search for jobs, it's either we're met with obstacles

149
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:18,680
or we encounter crooks like Wang Qing.

150
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,562
If we wish to settle down and make a living, we must own a shop.

151
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,800
Only then will we not be schemed against.

152
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:27,505
I can't do anything else besides brewing liquor and cooking.

153
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:28,920
And, we're women too.

154
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,360
Will this work out for us?

155
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,585
Miss, do you want to buy flowers?

156
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,111
We sell fresh flowers here.

157
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,640
We'll take a look first.

158
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,120
- Please buy from us later. - Okay.

159
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,680
- Flowers for sale. - Look.

160
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:39,840
So what if we're women?

161
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,200
What men can do, we can do as well.

162
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:46,040
You had no idea. You were actually the backbone of Wang Qing's tavern.

163
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:47,920
You're very capable.

164
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,200
Me too.

165
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:51,968
I have an ability that can help me make a living.

166
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:53,200
And that's gardening.

167
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,129
Chang'an is vast. There are plenty of opportunities here.

168
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:57,400
We'll become successful sooner or later.

169
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:01,031
But now, we have nothing.

170
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,600
We have to get a few more jobs and make more money.

171
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,002
If we save up enough money in the tenth month of the year,

172
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,746
we can purchase a batch of peony seedlings.

173
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:09,303
By then, we can open our own shop.

174
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:13,600
I think I should be able to master gardening in the next few months.

175
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:18,560
The purple peonies they sell look gorgeous.

176
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:20,192
Is this a famous species?

177
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:23,560
It's Ningyan Purple Peony. It costs at least 1,000 wen.

178
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,000
It's that expensive?

179
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:28,880
Why don't we ask them if they're hiring?

180
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,680
Since they can take such good care of such famous species,

181
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,586
I assume they don't lack excellent gardeners.

182
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,840
Let's check out that stall.

183
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,560
The flowers here look great too.

184
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,560
We've almost toured the entire flower market.

185
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,160
You've praised a lot of them too.

186
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,240
But why didn't you try to recommend yourself to them?

187
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:10,360
They did a great job in taking care of their peonies.

188
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:11,841
They don't need to hire anyone else to do so.

189
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,160
Let's check out the rest.

190
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,200
Let's check out the stall. Act accordingly.

191
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,266
Okay.

192
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:28,160
Ladies,

193
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,102
the flowers I sell here are the cheapest in the entire city.

194
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:32,720
You two are lucky.

195
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:35,240
I can tell. How much per plant?

196
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:36,640
50 wen.

197
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:38,681
50 wen?

198
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:41,720
But why are your flowers much smaller?

199
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,689
That's how it is for this particular variety.

200
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:45,720
You can buy a few of them first.

201
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,280
They're going to bloom soon.

202
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,520
Plant them in your courtyard once you head back.

203
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,240
Wait for them to bloom.

204
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:53,880
You can admire them for the entire season once they bloom.

205
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:55,560
Stop trying to deceive me.

206
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:57,040
These are dwarf peonies.

207
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,680
Both its stem and roots are short. They're hard to grow.

208
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,320
At least half of the buds cannot bloom.

209
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,200
Even if some of them do bloom,

210
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:08,160
they'll look withered, just like this.

211
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:09,984
Miss, you came here to inquire about them

212
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:11,602
even when you're more knowledgeable about them than me.

213
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:13,746
I suppose you're not here to buy them as decorations.

214
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,440
Miss, what about this? We can negotiate a deal

215
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,480
if you buy them in bulk.

216
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,785
I own a cake stall.

217
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:23,786
I wish to buy some cheap peonies so that I can use their scent and color.

218
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,608
Where did you get these flowers from?

219
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:27,986
Can you supply me if I buy them once every ten days?

220
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:29,186
Yes, I can.

221
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,440
I harvested them from Mount Qingliang in the suburbs of the capital.

222
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:34,480
Although it's not far from the city center,

223
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,760
the mountain path is steep and dangerous.

224
00:14:37,923 --> 00:14:39,872
Only a few flower farmers dare to harvest the flowers there.

225
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:42,440
I'm the only person who harvests the dwarf peonies there.

226
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,880
Ladies, how many of them do you need?

227
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:47,899
We'll head back and discuss it first.

228
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:49,963
What about this? We'll return after our discussion.

229
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:51,360
All right.

230
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:53,640
Miss, remember to buy them from me.

231
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,880
He didn't take good care of all those flowers.

232
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:01,720
Why didn't you ask him if he was hiring?

233
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,400
Why did you fish information out of him

234
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:05,545
and ask him where he harvested the flowers instead?

235
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,520
I could tell that he wasn't a proper florist.

236
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,947
Most of them are villagers who rely on the mountains for a living.

237
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:12,481
They sell whatever they can find in the mountains.

238
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:14,360
They won't keep selling the same products.

239
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:17,480
Initially, I was thinking

240
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,201
that I should save up enough capital first.

241
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:22,000
I never expected such an opportunity to appear right now.

242
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:24,040
Sheng Yi,

243
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:28,720
from today onward, we have to be shopkeepers.

244
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:32,561
Dwarf peony is worth less than 50 wen per plant in this area.

245
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:36,240
But I know how to take good care of them and sell them for a higher price.

246
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,377
Look. He's the only person in the market

247
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:40,821
selling dwarf peonies.

248
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:44,080
This is a great opportunity for us to make a fortune.

249
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,280
The dwarf peonies grow naturally in the mountains.

250
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,041
If we harvest them and sell them ourselves,

251
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:52,880
we don't even need any capital.

252
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:56,080
This is truly a great deal indeed.

253
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:57,680
It's not that simple.

254
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,349
This flower has small buds, which isn't very charming.

255
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,135
We have to buy fertilizers and grow the buds.

256
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,520
We have to make sure all of them bloom.

257
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:08,010
The courtyards of ordinary households aren't huge.

258
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,800
It's troublesome to grow them. And, they wilt easily.

259
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:12,760
But its roots are small and short.

260
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:14,441
It's the right plant to be turned into a potted plant.

261
00:16:14,465 --> 00:16:17,840
By doing so, not only can we lower its price, but we can also save space.

262
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,320
Although it sounds great,

263
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:23,680
we're struggling even with basic needs.

264
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:26,247
How can we afford fertilizers and flower pots?

265
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:30,400
Why don't we work for a few months

266
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:32,520
and save up some capital first?

267
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,065
The blooming period of dwarf peony is limited.

268
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,200
This is a rare business opportunity.

269
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:38,840
If we miss out on it,

270
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,385
we'll have to wait until next year.

271
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,600
I have an idea.

272
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:51,600
We can visit the God of Wealth.

273
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:53,600
I think we can give it a try.

274
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:56,696
Lord Jiang,

275
00:16:56,777 --> 00:17:00,137
I have a 100% profitable business deal for you. Do you want to hear me out?

276
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:02,640
I'm not interested.

277
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:05,749
But it's 100% profitable, you know?

278
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:07,040
You should take a look.

279
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,802
You just need to fork out 100 strings of coins.

280
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,640
In two months, it'll turn into 1,000 strings of coins.

281
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:12,985
If our business booms,

282
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,440
the 1,000 strings of coins will turn into gold eventually.

283
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,520
I won't fall for such lowly tricks.

284
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,642
You should give me the 19 pots of plants you owe me first.

285
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,200
If our potted peony business does blow up,

286
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,866
and we make a fortune every day,

287
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,640
I can give you the plants I owe you as soon as possible too.

288
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:29,872
Take a look.

289
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:31,800
I can engage in such grandiose talks as well.

290
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:34,322
This projection of yours is purely wishful thinking with no basis.

291
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,880
You should pick another target.

292
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:37,385
Pardon me for not seeing you off.

293
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:39,707
I'm not trying to scam you here. Lord Jiang, take a look.

294
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,600
Lord Jiang? God of Wealth?

295
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:46,560
Lord Jiang, don't you wish to take another look?

296
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:48,600
Chuan Yu, you're here too?

297
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,224
Jiang Xiao Hua,

298
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,000
I changed your name

299
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:56,720
in hopes that you could be an honest person.

300
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:58,322
Not only did you not thank me for saving you,

301
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,800
but you're also trying to scam your benefactor now.

302
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,480
That won't do.

303
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:06,800
Benefactor, I'm returning the favor by working together with you.

304
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,106
You shouldn't form prejudices against me and my abilities

305
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,600
just because I owe you money, right?

306
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:14,320
As the saying goes, a spark can start a prairie fire.

307
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:17,360
Even the best business requires start-up capital, right?

308
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,367
You should take another look.

309
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:22,786
You're really making yourself at home, aren't you?

310
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,890
Your skin is getting thicker and thicker by the day.

311
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:26,025
Excuse me.

312
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:28,720
Lord Jiang, did you forget?

313
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,306
We had a promise.

314
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,423
I'm supposed to tend to the Jade Orchid today.

315
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:35,960
It's been raining a lot lately.

316
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:37,846
Although the ventilation here is good,

317
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:39,425
it doesn't have sufficient lighting.

318
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:42,040
Why don't you shift it to the Jiang Residence

319
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:44,240
and place it in a room that's facing south?

320
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:46,216
This way, your aunt will be able to admire the blooming flowers

321
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,822
when she visits you.

322
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:52,680
Other people climb through windows to meet their lovers.

323
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:55,265
But you do so to tend to your flowers, huh?

324
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:57,935
You're truly a flower fanatic, huh?

325
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:02,346
I climbed through windows not just to tend to my flowers.

326
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm also doing it for its sake.

327
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:10,200
Peonies are very expensive. Only wealthy people can afford them.

328
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:13,425
The townsfolk of Chang'an don't have the habit of buying peonies.

329
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:16,520
Chuan Yu, that's precisely why selling cheap peonies is a great business.

330
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:18,225
The townsfolk of Chang'an

331
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:20,320
envy and admire the beauty of peonies.

332
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:22,160
But they can't afford them.

333
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,761
And, they don't have enough space to grow them.

334
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,266
The dwarf peonies I'm going to sell

335
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,726
grow in the wilderness. They're delicate plants as well.

336
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:30,049
If we turn them into cheap and beautiful potted plants,

337
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:31,560
I'm sure they'll sell like hotcakes.

338
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,065
It's an excellent business opportunity

339
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,960
that welcomes high profit with a low budget.

340
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:37,440
Lord Jiang, are you sure you want to miss out on it?

341
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,280
Peonies have a blooming period, you know?

342
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:41,880
Once spring is over,

343
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:44,578
your so-called business opportunity will vanish as well.

344
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:46,673
I intend to take advantage of this spring

345
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:48,797
to make a huge fortune and save up some capital.

346
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,120
As for the blooming period,

347
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:53,497
flowers of all kinds bloom during different seasons.

348
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:56,241
Even if its blooming period is over, I can still sell other flowers.

349
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:01,040
Lord Jiang, you know my capabilities well.

350
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,120
I won't let you incur any losses.

351
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Your business is more about quantity than quality.

352
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,920
And, you're doing it alone.

353
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:09,600
How can you manage it yourself?

354
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,360
Moreover,

355
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,666
where can you get that many dwarf peonies?

356
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:18,146
No matter if it's harvesting 10, 100, or even 1,000 of them,

357
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:20,200
I alone can do the job of ten men

358
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:22,000
as long as it can help me make a living.

359
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:23,920
Moreover, I have a helper too.

360
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:28,000
And, wild dwarf peonies can be found everywhere on Mount Qingliang.

361
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:36,985
Lord Jiang, if you don't believe me,

362
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:39,185
I'll head to the mountains and harvest them tomorrow.

363
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,240
Mount Qingliang is steep and dangerous.

364
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:48,642
You're a woman who doesn't know any martial arts.

365
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,825
You won't be able to hike the mountain.

366
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:53,840
It's just a mountain. I'm sure I can hike it.

367
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,640
By then, once you rest at ease upon seeing the flowers,

368
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,560
we shall sign our business agreement.

369
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,393
With a clap of the hands as our pledge,

370
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,080
the deal is done.

371
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:19,400
I did it.

372
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:23,305
Do you need my help?

373
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:24,560
No need for that.

374
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:13,426
Go!

375
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,736
My Lord.

376
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:21,585
My Lord, you're a born archer.

377
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,723
Your arrow pierced the eagle's eyes

378
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,200
without damaging its body.

379
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:26,480
It's the crossbow.

380
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,265
The arrow I fired flew a long distance

381
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:29,680
without any deviation.

382
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,040
If we establish the Sharpshooter Camp in the military

383
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,026
and equip them with such fearsome weapons,

384
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:37,930
we no longer need to fear the invasion of our enemies.

385
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:43,600
My Lord, what you said today

386
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:46,006
could ensure the peace of our borders for a century.

387
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:48,640
However,

388
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,440
we have already exceeded this year's military budget.

389
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:53,425
If we establish the Sharpshooter Camp now,

390
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:56,438
I'm afraid we'll have to support dozens more officials.

391
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:01,120
For the sake of the nation,

392
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:04,240
I'll request His Majesty to mobilize the national treasury.

393
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:06,680
Those who can command the Sharpshooter Camp are talents.

394
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:08,080
We must treat them well.

395
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,720
Let them be granted the title of Junior Fifth Rank,

396
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:12,781
Sharpshooters.

397
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:16,000
I've always cherished talents.

398
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,040
I'll select the candidates and send the name list to the minister soon.

399
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:22,602
Are we selecting them by ourselves again?

400
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:24,409
I'm afraid the censors will start another commotion...

401
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:25,433
My Lord!

402
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:26,800
Flower Bird Envoy!

403
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:30,480
No matter if it's selecting talents or weapons,

404
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:32,920
I've never feared the censors' opinions.

405
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:35,033
Minister Zhang, how do you think you were able

406
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:37,440
to take over the Ministry of War in the first place?

407
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:41,960
Minister Zhang, you can take the eagle as a gift.

408
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:43,280
My Lord.

409
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,160
Thank you, My Lord.

410
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,600
The male eagle is a ferocious beast.

411
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,400
However, without its eyes,

412
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:58,000
it's just a normal bird.

413
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:00,600
Minister Zhang, you just need to make sure

414
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:03,840
that His Lordship has an overview of the military

415
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:06,314
and that all of the armies are satisfied with His Lordship's command.

416
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:08,799
His Lordship has our back no matter what happens.

417
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:11,120
Sui Zhi,

418
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,200
the Imperial Academy is a place for scholarly teachings.

419
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:16,272
Xu Zu Ping is His Majesty's tutor as well.

420
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:18,320
You shouldn't stir up a ruckus there again.

421
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:20,362
Memorials requesting your impeachment

422
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:22,200
have filled the hall, you know?

423
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:25,360
My Lord, I'm innocent.

424
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:27,761
I went there to request leave on His Majesty's behalf.

425
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:29,320
Who said I was stirring up a ruckus?

426
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:31,920
People say that Old Fool Xu is the nation's pillar.

427
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:33,880
To me, he's just a blockhead.

428
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:35,800
The more his students

429
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:37,840
try to impeach me,

430
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:40,186
the more His Majesty hates handling state affairs.

431
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,608
Since His Lordship is assisting His Majesty in handling state affairs,

432
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:46,440
the officials are His Lordship's bows and arrows.

433
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,120
As his bows and arrows,

434
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:51,415
we need to know what our master intends to hunt.

435
00:26:53,674 --> 00:26:56,320
Jiang Chang Yang said I couldn't hike the mountain.

436
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:58,922
If there's no path, I shall establish my own path.

437
00:26:58,946 --> 00:27:00,480
Lo and behold, here I am.

438
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:27,640
By the way,

439
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:29,952
I heard that His Majesty has retrieved

440
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:32,753
the archives and memorials of the Ministry of Revenue for this year.

441
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:36,800
It's good that His Majesty cares about his people.

442
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:40,120
I know he intends to read all of the memorials in one go.

443
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:44,167
But as his brother, I'm worried about his health.

444
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:48,160
This year's memorials aren't enough for His Majesty.

445
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:51,706
His Majesty has retrieved all of the memorials for the past three years.

446
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,960
Ever since His Majesty had a headache,

447
00:27:59,232 --> 00:28:01,586
he couldn't take a walk or play ball in the Imperial Garden.

448
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,770
He was bored out of his mind.

449
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:04,946
Thus, he erected a goal with all of the old memorials

450
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:07,040
and played ball inside his room.

451
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,761
The imperial seal would've been shattered

452
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:11,040
had I not watched over him closely.

453
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:13,160
So that's the case.

454
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,120
That's simple.

455
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,265
Tomorrow, I'll instruct the Ministry of Works

456
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:22,200
to build a palace meant for him to play in.

457
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,320
This brother of mine

458
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:27,040
has a weak constitution since young.

459
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:29,216
It's time for him to exercise more often.

460
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,064
Sui Zhi,

461
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,960
You Zhen often praised you in front of me.

462
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,000
She said that you were good at everything.

463
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:45,800
You have to do your best to make His Majesty happy.

464
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,200
Of course.

465
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,360
My daughter is pitiful.

466
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:57,545
She has been depressed ever since the death of her spouse.

467
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:01,920
She lacks the company of someone as interesting as you.

468
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:04,760
Coincidentally,

469
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,241
you've known each other since childhood and have similar tempers...

470
00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:08,265
My Lord.

471
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:12,000
I think the person you were referring to

472
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:13,800
was Liu Chang of Luoyang.

473
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:15,480
Everyone knows

474
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:18,560
that Her Highness loves him deeply.

475
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:21,206
I shouldn't separate a loving couple like them.

476
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,280
It's been so long since I joined a hunt.

477
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:26,224
I saw a doe when I was here previously.

478
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:27,560
It was adorable.

479
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:31,520
Today, I must bring it home.

480
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:35,720
Sui Zhi,

481
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:38,201
your parents passed away when you were young.

482
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:40,640
I've always treated you as my son.

483
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,600
There are some of your affairs that I have to interfere with.

484
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:48,920
You were supposed to get married long ago.

485
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:51,160
What's so bad about You Zhen?

486
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:54,777
In terms of looks and demeanor, she's superior to other noble ladies.

487
00:29:55,346 --> 00:29:57,305
What else are you unsatisfied with about her?

488
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,882
Her Highness is an outstanding lady.

489
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:01,360
Naturally, I do admire her.

490
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:04,680
It's just that I'm used to being unrestrained.

491
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:06,360
And, I have peculiar tastes.

492
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:12,920
If you like songstresses or Chinese opera actresses,

493
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:15,256
you can keep them in your other residences.

494
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:19,706
I'm already used to seeing extraordinary songstresses

495
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,807
ever since I became the Flower Bird Envoy.

496
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:26,080
As for noble ladies,

497
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:27,720
they're proud and elegant.

498
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:30,200
They and I, a vulgar person reeking of money,

499
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:31,640
find each other annoying.

500
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,000
Sui Zhi,

501
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,280
you've been enjoying yourself all these years

502
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,720
without talking about marriage or your offspring.

503
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:40,440
I'm truly curious about

504
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,480
the kind of girl you like.

505
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:46,560
If I do intend to marry,

506
00:30:46,985 --> 00:30:49,367
I have to marry someone with the same preferences as me.

507
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,985
She doesn't need to be well-versed in the four arts,

508
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:54,160
but she needs to be a moneygrubber.

509
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:58,462
You see, we have to enjoy our lives together.

510
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:03,120
You're spouting nonsense to brush me off

511
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:04,760
because you don't trust me, right?

512
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:06,231
My words are sincere.

513
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:11,360
I like girls who have a sharp tongue and are rebellious.

514
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,520
The more unruly they are, the more capable they are of surprising you.

515
00:31:14,946 --> 00:31:17,120
There are only a few people in my residence.

516
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:20,000
Isn't it fun if she can come and rip the tiles off my roof

517
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:24,281
and bully me when she's free?

518
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:29,040
If an unruly girl like that does exist,

519
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:30,986
I'm sure she can never find herself a husband.

520
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:32,946
Sui Zhi,

521
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:35,600
you should seek a virtuous wife.

522
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:38,520
You mustn't satisfy your desires by giving in to your impulses.

523
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:40,320
In my opinion...

524
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:44,240
I think

525
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:47,015
I found the doe I was looking for.

526
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,920
This is a small plant

527
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,800
with delicate roots.

528
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,560
Luckily, it isn't damaged.

529
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:26,800
Why did it seem like I was targeting a person?

530
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:31,510
This is the royal hunt.

531
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:33,201
If someone were to trespass upon the hunting grounds,

532
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:35,440
they deserve to be shot.

533
00:32:36,178 --> 00:32:37,280
Someone!

534
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:38,465
Wait!

535
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:41,927
It looks like a beautiful lady.

536
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,320
The heavens must've sent her to me.

537
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:45,920
I have to take a look.

538
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:14,480
Beauty!

539
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,160
Beauty!

540
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:23,040
Beauty, are you okay?

541
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:25,346
Beauty!

542
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,400
You've trespassed upon forbidden grounds.

543
00:33:29,745 --> 00:33:32,265
Stay put if you wish to leave in one piece.

544
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:45,465
Sir, I was ignorant! I've trespassed upon here while harvesting flowers!

545
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:46,880
And, I've offended you, My Lord!

546
00:33:47,056 --> 00:33:48,360
Please pardon me!

547
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:54,680
Since she's still alive, send her to Jingzhao Fu.

548
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:58,560
Lord Jiang, do not let the wretch spoil our hunting mood.

549
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:01,120
Miss,

550
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:03,160
don't be scared.

551
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:05,346
I hurt you by accident as I couldn't see clearly.

552
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:06,680
I'm truly sorry about this.

553
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:08,040
Are you hurt?

554
00:34:08,194 --> 00:34:09,320
Let me take a look.

555
00:34:12,442 --> 00:34:15,720
My heart is beating so fast.

556
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:17,400
I feel giddy.

557
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,481
I...

558
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:19,840
Beauty?

559
00:34:20,218 --> 00:34:21,720
The lady has fallen unconscious!

560
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,016
Someone!

561
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:24,960
Where's the tent?

562
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,880
Someone!

563
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:32,248
Someone!

564
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:40,446
Your Highness, you loved riding horses.

565
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:43,000
Why didn't you join His Lordship for the hunt today?

566
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:44,729
Your Highness, since you didn't join them,

567
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:46,280
we couldn't join them either.

568
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,520
It's a shame that we don't get to admire the views on Mount Qingliang.

569
00:34:50,906 --> 00:34:53,960
I don't think you two miss the views there.

570
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:58,520
You two miss the good-looking noblemen on the hunting grounds.

571
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:01,160
We aren't as noble as Her Highness.

572
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:03,520
His Lordship will pick the best spouse for her.

573
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,800
She can get any kind of man she desires.

574
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,505
I heard that the Liu family of Luoyang has eagerly

575
00:35:08,593 --> 00:35:11,280
delivered the betrothal gifts here all the way from Luoyang.

576
00:35:11,505 --> 00:35:12,887
I'm so envious.

577
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:19,120
Your Highness, your marriage is nearing.

578
00:35:19,322 --> 00:35:20,960
Why are you pulling a long face instead?

579
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:23,720
Did His Lordship not agree to your marriage?

580
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:26,760
Could it be that His Lordship still favors Jiang Chang Yang over him?

581
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,480
Father knows that Jiang Chang Yang

582
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:32,919
is a wanderer with no lofty aspirations.

583
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,520
He only likes the fact

584
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:38,080
that he's His Majesty's trusted aide.

585
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,000
It's just

586
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:43,360
that my intention is fixed in place.

587
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,520
This time,

588
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:49,280
no matter how Father tries to coerce me,

589
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:51,640
I will never compromise with him.

590
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,990
I saw Jiang Chang Yang's carriage heading toward Mount Qingliang.

591
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:57,368
I'm afraid His Lordship

592
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,369
will take the opportunity to propose on your behalf during the hunt...

593
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:00,480
Bi Yu!

594
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:02,866
I'll prepare the carriage immediately.

595
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,720
The engagement will be completed

596
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:06,224
when his carriage reaches their tent.

597
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:07,911
Get me the fastest horse we have.

598
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:09,120
Yes, Your Highness.

599
00:36:32,418 --> 00:36:35,200
Your Lordship, I'm grateful that you intend to grant me a marriage.

600
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:38,441
However, I'm used to indulging in drunken pleasures.

601
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:39,825
I don't intend to settle down yet.

602
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:41,400
If I do marry now,

603
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:43,080
it'll put me under constraint.

604
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:45,280
Princess Ji'an will suffer as well.

605
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:47,981
Your Lordship, your effort would be wasted instead.

606
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:50,640
But if you have no wife or children,

607
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,197
you'll be just like a drifting lotus without any roots.

608
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:54,946
On the surface, you may seem carefree.

609
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,687
But in reality, you're lonely and helpless.

610
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:03,000
Your Lordship, you're right.

611
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:05,362
I'm only able to get to where I am

612
00:37:05,386 --> 00:37:07,486
all thanks to your nurture and concern.

613
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:09,169
King Ning, you're the reason I exist.

614
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,990
I dare not forget about my roots.

615
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,001
Your Lordship, Official Chen, who is your trusted aide,

616
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,126
requested you to make his son, Chen Zhang, an official in Chang'an.

617
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:22,866
However, Chen Zhang failed the imperial examination.

618
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:24,480
His actions were absurd as well.

619
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,569
Your Lordship, although you intend to promote him,

620
00:37:26,593 --> 00:37:28,855
you have to care about your reputation as well.

621
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,280
Sui Zhi,

622
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:34,920
do you intend to share my burden with me?

623
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:37,600
Naturally.

624
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:43,687
Back then, I mentioned the notion

625
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:45,025
in front of His Majesty

626
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:46,200
while he was having fun

627
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:47,680
during his stroll.

628
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:50,327
His Majesty has already agreed to it.

629
00:37:50,946 --> 00:37:53,080
Chen Zhang will be a granary manager in Luoyang.

630
00:37:53,386 --> 00:37:54,800
Since he's not in Chang'an,

631
00:37:54,946 --> 00:37:56,880
the censors will have nothing to complain about.

632
00:37:57,089 --> 00:38:00,080
Your Lordship, you'll be able to take care of your men as well.

633
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:04,280
That Chen fellow,

634
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:07,160
he's pretty smart.

635
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,760
He found the right person.

636
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,960
Granary manager, huh?

637
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:13,466
Although it's a lowly position,

638
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:15,840
he can oversee

639
00:38:16,152 --> 00:38:17,344
the local taxes,

640
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:20,080
granaries, and farmland.

641
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:23,520
Sui Zhi, I appreciate your effort.

642
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,086
I was too shallow.

643
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:34,640
To think that I almost took pity on a corrupt official.

644
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,320
Sui Zhi,

645
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:44,120
the hunt today wasn't the best.

646
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:46,360
You didn't manage to hunt the doe you want.

647
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:49,040
However, I managed to hunt a leopard.

648
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:52,760
Your trip shouldn't be in vain.

649
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:54,400
I'll give it to you.

650
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,880
Your Lordship, Her Highness has arrived.

651
00:39:00,817 --> 00:39:02,120
The princess is here?

652
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:08,600
I got myself a beauty today.

653
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,346
Your Lordship, you gave me a reward too.

654
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:12,280
Today is a fruitful day indeed.

655
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:15,200
I have to tend to the injured beauty.

656
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,160
Your Lordship, I shall not interrupt your chat with Her Highness.

657
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:32,360
That Jiang Chang Yang,

658
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,319
he's truly intelligent.

659
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,120
It's a shame that You Zhen

660
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:42,395
is disappointing to say the least.

661
00:40:10,746 --> 00:40:12,000
Stop pretending.

662
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:14,040
You eavesdropped on us, right?

663
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:20,120
Seems like you're concerned about Her Highness's marriage.

664
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:22,440
Why don't you catch up with her?

665
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:24,520
Lower your volume!

666
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:26,400
She hasn't arrived yet.

667
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:28,120
Look at how terrified you look.

668
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,240
Lord Jiang, you used me as an excuse to escape.

669
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:40,000
Not only did you not thank me for it,

670
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:42,600
but you're also being sarcastic to me.

671
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:45,880
They were holding a royal hunt on Mount Qingliang today.

672
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:47,752
Why didn't you tell me about it?

673
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:50,465
I already told you not to come, yet you insisted on coming.

674
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:52,345
Why should I make things difficult for myself?

675
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:57,680
If I do come here, you can use me as an excuse to escape.

676
00:40:58,314 --> 00:41:01,080
If I don't come here, you can turn down our deal.

677
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:03,441
Lord Jiang, your plot is so elaborate

678
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:06,640
that even the most devious shopkeeper in Luoyang has to bow down to you.

679
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:10,000
Luckily, you didn't encounter any ferocious beasts.

680
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,200
If not, I would have to take all the blame.

681
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:14,720
You guys have hunted down

682
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,720
all of the ferocious beasts on the mountain.

683
00:41:17,025 --> 00:41:18,720
I can never encounter them here.

684
00:41:19,306 --> 00:41:22,360
There was Tao Qian, who wasn't willing to yield for five dou of rice.

685
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:24,306
Now,

686
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:26,866
there's the Flower Bird Envoy, who pledges his loyalty

687
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:28,840
for a leopard.

688
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:30,601
Flower Bird Envoy, seems like admiring flowers

689
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,006
isn't your only hobby.

690
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,611
I suppose you like taming ferocious beasts even more.

691
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,360
Your thinking is too shallow.
