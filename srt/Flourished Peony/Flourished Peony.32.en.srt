00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:36,184
(Flourished Peony)

2
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,011
(Episode 32)

3
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,551
Your mother hoped that you would get yourself a good husband, right?

4
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,910
Since you helped me to deal with Lian Zhou,

5
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,551
I shall stage an act with you as well.

6
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,030
Tricking someone like King Ning is fine.

7
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,190
But there's no way my late mother will fall for it.

8
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,319
Get up.

9
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,150
Get out.

10
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,511
I'm happy by myself

11
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,870
no matter if I get a good husband or not.

12
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Mother,

13
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,910
I already realized all the promises I made when I first came to Chang'an.

14
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,030
Are you seeing this in Heaven?

15
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,723
This nu'er hong wine is quite strong.

16
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,391
I'll go outside and take a breather.

17
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,991
I have some of it in reserve.

18
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,847
You and your mother

19
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,391
can enjoy it.

20
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,190
He might be my fake husband,

21
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,231
he's my true bosom friend.

22
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,039
Mother,

23
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,841
now, I'm leading a carefree life.

24
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:21,814
You don't need to worry.

25
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,551
Let's have a drink.

26
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,519
Mother,

27
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,430
was that you?

28
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,111
I'm sure you felt sorry for me

29
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,430
after hearing about my tale, right?

30
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,830
The path of a businessperson

31
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,319
is indeed much more complex and tougher than I thought.

32
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,591
But don't worry.

33
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,711
Now,

34
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,711
I'm more than just your daughter.

35
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,151
I'm the shopkeeper of our shop as well.

36
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,270
Everyone is depending on me.

37
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,830
I can hang in there.

38
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,279
Who has violated the curfew?

39
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,199
Flower Bird Envoy?

40
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,991
The streets are dark since it's curfew.

41
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,151
Let me light up the path for you and send you back.

42
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,031
I'm taking a night walk with my spouse. How could I bring an outsider?

43
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,519
- Go now. - Yes, sir.

44
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,630
Who was talking just now?

45
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,079
No one.

46
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
You can keep on sleeping.

47
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,750
Who are you again?

48
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,639
Me?

49
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,911
I'm Jiang Chang Yang.

50
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,591
Jiang Chang Yang? I know him.

51
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,750
So, the Jiang Chang Yang you knew,

52
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,671
what kind of person is he?

53
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,830
He always wears a cheerful smile.

54
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,390
People say that he has malicious intentions.

55
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,950
But I know

56
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,671
that he's troubled by something.

57
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,231
I know it's a tough deal for him.

58
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,351
Although I don't know what it is,

59
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,270
I know

60
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,991
that he's my husband.

61
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,551
Let me tell you a secret.

62
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,279
He's my fake husband.

63
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,550
It's late at night!

64
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,870
It's late at night!

65
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,879
Mu Dan, wake up.

66
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,519
We're home.

67
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,951
I shouldn't have drunk that much last night.

68
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,111
Florist Hu.

69
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:03,289
Stop digging for now.

70
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,478
This pit of yours,

71
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:07,088
it's too deep.

72
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,892
It'll affect the peonies' growth.

73
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,259
Florist Wang, the pit you dug is too shallow.

74
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,700
It'll neglect the roots, resulting in weak and fragile branches.

75
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,877
Look. Let's take this plant as an example.

76
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,447
The planting depth should be the same as

77
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,950
the part where the roots meet the branches is level with the ground.

78
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,515
This pit is too deep.

79
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,270
You guys have to fill it up later.

80
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,030
Ms. He?

81
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,301
Madam Tang?

82
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,401
Ms. He, a handsome mister was looking for you just now.

83
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:40,319
I said you were busy as you were teaching the florists.

84
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,479
I told him to come back in two hours.

85
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,160
He gave me this before he left.

86
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,753
He said it was a token of gratitude for you.

87
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,351
Don't tell me it's Jiang Chang Yang again?

88
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,390
It's food.

89
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,128
- Come. - Thank you, Madam Tang.

90
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,300
Everyone, take a break. Let's have some snacks.

91
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,451
- Here, Madam Tang. - Give it to me.

92
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,519
Distribute them to everyone.

93
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,439
Here. Ms. He, you should try one first.

94
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,591
Thank you, Madam Tang.

95
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,510
Come, Florist Wang.

96
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,679
- Thank you, madam. - Have one.

97
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,759
Thank you, madam.

98
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Isn't this osmanthus?

99
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,036
Madam Tang, what was he wearing?

100
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:16,223
Where was he heading?

101
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,111
He headed in that direction after leaving the residence.

102
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,311
Madam Tang, tend to the place for me.

103
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,191
That's the legendary tale of our heroine.

104
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
Thank you, everyone.

105
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,399
Hurry up! The rain is getting heavier!

106
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,399
Let's hurry and close our stall.

107
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Not bad at all.

108
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,799
The tale of Qin is legendary indeed.

109
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,510
It was a satisfying experience.

110
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,159
Indeed.

111
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,799
Her life is truly extraordinary and legendary.

112
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,240
That's right. Come.

113
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,550
The rain is getting heavier.

114
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Qin Liu Lang?

115
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Ms. He.

116
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,919
- Time to get the gravel and stones. - All right.

117
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
How is it?

118
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,150
His coughing and shortness of breath are chronic conditions.

119
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,030
He requires the nourishing of cistanche and agarwood to recover.

120
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,790
However, these are rare herbs.

121
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,351
I don't think he can afford them.

122
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,390
Sheng Yi didn't have a good relationship with her family.

123
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,019
The only kin she was close to was this brother of hers.

124
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,390
After Liu Lang's father died from illness,

125
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,575
his brother and his spouse took over his land. They didn't want him around.

126
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,783
He came to Chang'an alone.

127
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:07,326
He's penniless.

128
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,790
Even so, he prepared a token of gratitude for me.

129
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,069
I'll pay for his medical fee.

130
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,044
Remember,

131
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,679
do not write the real names of the herbs on the prescription.

132
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,071
Just write the names of inexpensive herbs like licorice and so on.

133
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,901
Do not let him find out.

134
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,319
Don't worry. I've created a lot of pills and hired testers

135
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,150
so that Qingshu Pavilion could operate smoothly.

136
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,991
I'll just tell him that he's one of my testers.

137
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I think he won't mind it.

138
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,431
And, I'll provide him with some donkey-hide gelatin as well.

139
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,431
Why did you leave after preparing the meal?

140
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,030
Fang Garden doesn't make people work for nothing, you know?

141
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,595
Ms. He, you allowed me to stay so that I could recover from my illness.

142
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:12,001
I have no way to repay you.

143
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,440
My only choice was to prepare some food for you as thanks.

144
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,390
I'm staying under your roof. I'm a lowly commoner.

145
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,510
I dare not have a meal at the same table as you all.

146
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:22,256
Everyone in Fang Garden is a part of the family.

147
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,231
There's no distinction of title or status.

148
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,448
It's the same for you as well.

149
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:34,958
But if you head there now,

150
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,473
I'm afraid the pork legs and drumsticks are finished by now.

151
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,452
Why don't you come to the West Market with me?

152
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,092
I'll take you to Sheng Yi's favorite noodle stall.

153
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
All right.

154
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,759
- Flatbreads for sale! - Try it.

155
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,191
These dried fruits are delicious.

156
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,818
Ms. He, you should have them first.

157
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,076
Five coins per bowl!

158
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,111
Sheng Yi and I were framed by Wang Qing for selling withered flowers.

159
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,111
We had to give out refunds and compensate our customers.

160
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,471
After that, we only had enough for one bowl of noodles.

161
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,712
Thus, we came here.

162
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,707
We planned to pull ourselves together after having this meal.

163
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:24,591
But when we were here,

164
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,002
when the stall owner asked us what extra ingredients we wanted,

165
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,390
she said dried shrimp

166
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,200
while I said mutton.

167
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,745
My sister loved mutton.

168
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,790
I loved dried shrimp.

169
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,510
Ms. He, thank you for taking pity on me.

170
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,394
Thank you for telling me about my sister's past experiences.

171
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,072
Sheng Yi is my best friend.

172
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,032
Although I still feel a little upset

173
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,346
whenever I bring her up,

174
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:03,079
my heart feels warm.

175
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:08,882
It's because someone else is still thinking of her.

176
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,270
You can ask me whatever you like. I'll tell you everything I know.

177
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,879
Sheng Yi, she has suffered all her life.

178
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,335
The greatest blessing in her misfortune was encountering you.

179
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,829
I was also fortunate enough to encounter her.

180
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,870
Sheng Yi lived a cautious and timid life before.

181
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,218
I'm sure she doesn't want you to lead the same kind of life.

182
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:42,495
Although she's no longer around,

183
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,390
if you're willing,

184
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,130
you can treat me as your elder sister.

185
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,510
Therefore, since we're a family,

186
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,390
you can eat whatever

187
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
you want.

188
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,053
- Eat up. - Okay.

189
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,422
I saw you walking with difficulty before this.

190
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:18,617
I'm sure your shoes were too small.

191
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
They didn't fit your feet.

192
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,315
They'll cut your heels if you wear them for too long.

193
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,476
I bought you a pair of shoes after assessing your height.

194
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:27,878
I don't know if they'll fit or not.

195
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,959
Give them a try.

196
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,990
Ms. He, you've already bought me a rope and a leather belt.

197
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:33,128
You've already spent a lot of money on me.

198
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
As for the shoes...

199
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:36,640
What did I say just now?

200
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:37,961
Why are you still calling me Ms. He?

201
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,471
Sister Mu Dan.

202
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,172
Since I'm your sister, it doesn't matter if I spend money on you.

203
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:50,872
Here.

204
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,799
Put on the new shoes.

205
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,157
Let's head home.

206
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,519
May the road ahead be secure and steady.

207
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,130
Thank you.

208
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:11,096
Sister Mu Dan.

209
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Please take care.

210
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,103
Everyone,

211
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,110
At Qingshu Pavilion, we use herbs in our skincare products.

212
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,279
We provide everything that everyone needs.

213
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,120
Miss, I feel that my hair has been dry lately.

214
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,790
Do you have something for my hair.

215
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Take a look at this.

216
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,270
This is Tresses Pill, which is meant for our hair.

217
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,485
Take it as you need.

218
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,759
Miss, my mouth feels dry, my breath is heavy,

219
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,439
and my tongue feels bitter.

220
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,920
I wonder if there's anything that can freshen my breath.

221
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't worry.

222
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,631
We have Fresh Breath, which can be taken orally.

223
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,799
Please take a sniff.

224
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,799
Miss.

225
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,320
I've been neglecting my sleep and meals lately. I have blemishes now.

226
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:00,750
What should I do?

227
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,120
The solution is right next to you.

228
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,270
Look. This is our Beauty Pill.

229
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,871
It can nourish your complexion and remove blemishes.

230
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,199
Miss, my complexion

231
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,759
- Here you go. - is way inferior now.

232
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,310
Look. It's pale and dry.

233
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,030
Is the Beauty Pill suitable for me?

234
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,079
What about this?

235
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,999
This is our Rose Mask. It moisturizes one's complexion.

236
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,239
- You can try it. - Thank you, miss.

237
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,319
Sure.

238
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,921
- What do you think? - It's very moisturizing.

239
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:24,030
Guys, take a look.

240
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,510
It's great indeed.

241
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,959
There's no rush. One at a time.

242
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,039
It's pretty good, huh?

243
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,911
Here. You can retrieve the medicine there.

244
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,279
Thank you.

245
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,279
Next.

246
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,599
Come.

247
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,319
Be careful.

248
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,231
How long has the condition lasted?

249
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,119
Two or three days.

250
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,160
Madam, you loved extravagant clothing.

251
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,550
What's with your attire today?

252
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,590
Think about Jiang's status for once.

253
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,830
I'm sure he's sick of all those lavish clothing.

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,590
That's why he likes He Wei Fang, who's like a breath of fresh air to him.

255
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Since that's the case,

256
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,711
I can also forgo all those fancy accessories.

257
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,550
I'll use some flowers as my accessories

258
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,786
so that I can please him.

259
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,039
Madam, you have great taste indeed.

260
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,750
You look more elegant and refined with that flower on you.

261
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,391
I suppose the flowers He Wei Fang had planted are still useful.

262
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,991
This is Mu Dan's garden! Who gave you permission to visit?

263
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,239
How dare you pick her flowers?

264
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,431
Miss Zhu Fu, don't worry.

265
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,431
Mu Dan and I serve Jiang together.

266
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,991
We should be friends.

267
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,191
I merely plucked one of her flowers.

268
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,120
She isn't someone petty.

269
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,471
Who wants to be your friend?

270
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,151
It's called stealing if you take without permission.

271
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,359
Give it back!

272
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,630
Madam!

273
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,080
Zhu Fu, how dare you push me?

274
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,360
Not only will I push you, but I'll also beat you up!

275
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,199
Listen! You have to get through me

276
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,560
before you can pick our flowers!

277
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,920
Get out!

278
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Madam!

279
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,160
Get out! Don't ever come back!

280
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Hurry and go!

281
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,550
How dare you humiliate me? You'll pay for it!

282
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Madam, are you okay?

283
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,039
It must've hurt.

284
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,350
Tresses Pill and a scented pouch,

285
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,671
the total is 85 coins.

286
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,830
Ms. He, here are 100 coins.

287
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,047
Ji Xiang,

288
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,668
later, relay my message to Ms. Xiao Chun.

289
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,151
Tell her that I'm unwell.

290
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
I'll return to Fang Garden first.

291
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Yes, Ms. He.

292
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,319
Where did this quack doctor come from?

293
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,191
The other physicians said that my wife would be fine after taking medicine.

294
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,350
How come you're saying that she doesn't have much longer to live?

295
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,070
There's no need to trust their words of comfort.

296
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,720
Just listen to me and save your money. If so, you guys can...

297
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,321
How dare you jinx my wife? I'll wreck your shop!

298
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:07,920
Sir, please calm down. It's just a misunderstanding.

299
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,871
Let's calm down. It's a misunderstanding.

300
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,350
I'm sure she has offended you.

301
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,590
I'll apologize to you on her behalf.

302
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,830
This condition is subtle and varies from time to time.

303
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,750
Different physicians at different times of the day

304
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,880
may give out different diagnoses.

305
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,790
What about this? We won't charge you for the consultation fee.

306
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,484
You guys may get a diagnosis from another physician. Is that okay?

307
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,228
- Miss. - Let's go.

308
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,840
Miss, please be careful.

309
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Be careful.

310
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:37,880
Ji Xiang, see them off.

311
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,951
- Yes, ma'am. - We're truly sorry about this.

312
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,631
That couple just now came here for a diagnosis

313
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,191
even though they've sought the help of other physicians.

314
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,550
I assume they already had the answer.

315
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,711
It's just that they're not willing to accept it.

316
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,030
They hoped that other people could help them deceive themselves.

317
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,750
This way, they would feel better.

318
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,998
But I'm a physician.

319
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,951
I'm not a quack doctor who deceives people for a living.

320
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:15,227
Yes. I understand your feelings.

321
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Mu Dan,

322
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,671
I don't think I can own a shop.

323
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,519
Don't say that.

324
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,151
You've already done a great job on your first day.

325
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,030
In the future, I'll assign an eloquent staff to you.

326
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,830
He shall assist you.

327
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,310
I'm sure this won't happen again.

328
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,391
Ms. He!

329
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,911
Madam Tang, what's wrong?

330
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:44,550
Ms. He, you should hurry back and take a look.

331
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,800
Man thought that Tao's music was bothering her while she was embroidering.

332
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,600
I was thinking of changing their rooms for them.

333
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,239
But when I was picking the room,

334
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,480
Tao and Ms. Jin argued.

335
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,920
And Gui, he was building a water canal.

336
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,120
He mixed the soil he dug out together with Florist Hu's flower soil.

337
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,279
Florist Hu was upset about it. He reprimanded him.

338
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,199
But Gui, he stopped working.

339
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,830
They had a fight instead.

340
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,471
All of them are worrying.

341
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Come on. Let's go and check on them.

342
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,319
Come.

343
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:20,295
Mu Dan!

344
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,550
Ms. He!

345
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:41,673
Mu Dan.

346
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,279
You're awake.

347
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,310
That was terrifying.

348
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,051
Xiao Chun said you were worn out and didn't have enough energy.

349
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,230
You caught a cold as well.

350
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,231
Your body was getting weaker and weaker.

351
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,431
That's why you fell sick.

352
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,160
You must rest and recuperate for the next few days. Don't work

353
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
or think about work, okay?

354
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,542
Da Fu, why don't you tell everyone that Mu Dan is awake?

355
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
This way, they can rest at ease.

356
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,279
All right. I'll go and see if Xiao Chun's medicine is ready.

357
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:32,161
How are the affairs in Fang Garden?

358
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,897
It won't fall into pieces even if you don't do anything about it.

359
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:37,688
You should tend to your health first.

360
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,231
That's the first thing you ask after waking up, huh?

361
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,350
Don't you have anything else you wish to ask?

362
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,079
So,

363
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
what are you doing here?

364
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,177
My spouse is sick.

365
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:55,076
If I don't visit you, forget about the fact that Lian Zhou will suspect us.

366
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,510
Zhu Fu will never let me off, you know?

367
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,191
It was the opening of your new shop.

368
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,631
You've put on quite the heavy makeup there.

369
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,279
Wipe them off.

370
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,648
This way, you can sleep better.

371
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Sister Mu Dan.

372
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,576
Mu Dan, this is?

373
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,220
- He's... - I'm Mu Dan's husband.

374
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:27,270
You must be Qin Liu Lang.

375
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,172
Mu Dan sees you as her younger brother.

376
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:32,006
If so, you're my younger brother as well.

377
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:33,934
In the future, you may call me Brother-in-law.

378
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:35,536
There's no need to observe the formalities.

379
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,750
So, it's the Flower Bird Envoy.

380
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,030
Although I address Mu Dan as Sister,

381
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,584
we're not related by blood.

382
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,631
I dare not claim ties with you.

383
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Sister,

384
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,711
this is locust leaf cold noodles.

385
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,830
It's made from the juice of locust leaf and noodles.

386
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,431
Not only does it look appetizing,

387
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,680
but it's also refreshing and sweet.

388
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,079
It's the right food for you.

389
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,590
Liu Lang, thank you for the noodles.

390
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Let me feed her.

391
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,431
We should take care of patients thoroughly.

392
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,671
How could we let them do everything by themselves?

393
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,628
Come. Sister, let me wipe your face for you.

394
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,110
Liu Lang, thank you for the reminder.

395
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:19,586
I'll wipe her face myself after she finishes her meal.

396
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,070
You'll spill the noodles. I can do it myself.

397
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
It's just a slight fever.

398
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,471
My limbs aren't severed.

399
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,231
I can do things myself.

400
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,431
Why are Florist Hu and his men looking for Gui again?

401
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,671
Are they going to fight again?

402
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,959
- Let's go and check it out. - What's going on again?

403
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,039
No.

404
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,600
I'll just take a look.

405
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,871
I'll return soon.

406
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,110
Sister, don't worry. Madam Tang will help everyone to settle down.

407
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,359
Liu Lang,

408
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,191
you should check on the medicine.

409
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,911
I wish to stay here and look after Sister.

410
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,070
We have some personal matters to discuss.

411
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,871
Kids like you shouldn't be here.

412
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,590
What do you have to say to me?

413
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,191
You even went out of your way to send him away.

414
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,680
Do you think you can leave if he keeps sitting here?

415
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Finish the noodles.

416
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,391
I shall join you in checking out the situation later.

417
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,319
Da Fu, that's not it.

418
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,151
That's the agarwood meant for Liu Lang.

419
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,544
This one.

420
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,697
This is the one you should use for Mu Dan's prescription.

421
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,871
Wasn't I taking licorice?

422
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Why was it agarwood instead?

423
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,519
Liu Lang, what are you doing here?

424
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,279
So, the prescription I took usually was this expensive?

425
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,270
Why did Sister hide this from me?

426
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,951
Mu Dan was worried that you might not take it due to its costly price.

427
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,310
That's why she hid it from you.

428
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,270
Since Mu Dan sees you as a family member, naturally, she'll be nice to you.

429
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,471
You just need to treat her better in the future.

430
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
By the way,

431
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,750
she forgot to hand this to you

432
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,550
since she fainted by accident.

433
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,960
Did Sister make these cookies as well?

434
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,711
She was worried that you would miss Sheng Yi.

435
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,471
That's why she tried learning how to make her cookies.

436
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,070
She made these flower cookies for you.

437
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,991
No one paid any attention to me

438
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,391
or treated me like this

439
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,991
ever since Sheng Yi left the house.

440
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:31,759
It's delicious.

441
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,226
They're the same as the ones made by my sister.

442
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Really?

443
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,590
Liu Lang!

444
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,070
Is there something wrong with your taste buds?

445
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,790
You call this delicious?

446
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,110
It's terrible.

447
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
Be careful.

448
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'll be fine.

449
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
What are you doing?

450
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm fine.

451
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,951
Florist Hu is angry

452
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,270
because the flower soil he prepared meticulously

453
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,880
was tainted by the soil Gui had dug out.

454
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,550
He was worried that it might affect the flowers. That's why they argued.

455
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,880
I need to prepare the soil required for tomorrow's planting

456
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,471
to prevent them from arguing.

457
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,110
I may have allowed you to leave the room,

458
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,631
but that doesn't mean you can work.

459
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,110
I'm fine now.

460
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,110
My fever has subsided.

461
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,830
I'm serious. Touch my forehead if you don't believe me.

462
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,676
Here. Touch it.

463
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,151
I don't care if it's hot or not.

464
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,759
I only know

465
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,590
that you fainted due to fatigue not long after our marriage.

466
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,759
If you were to fall unconscious again due to work and die in the process,

467
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,471
outsiders will say that I'm a jinx to my spouse.

468
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,350
Lord Jiang, no one will know if you keep quiet.

469
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,151
Don't forget. Lian Zhou is still living in my residence.

470
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,671
If you don't recover soon,

471
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,559
everyone in the city

472
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,191
will gossip about you.

473
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,231
They'll say that the owner of Qingshu Pavilion has terrible health.

474
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,480
If so, the healthcare products she sells will certainly be ineffective.

475
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,191
You're no longer just the owner of a small stall

476
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,070
or a small shop.

477
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,270
In the future, your business will grow bigger and bigger.

478
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,310
If you have to do everything by yourself,

479
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,911
when can your subordinates be independent, then?

480
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,640
Yeah, yeah.

481
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
You're right.

482
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,070
But we have to overcome this trial first, right?

483
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,750
What should we do with the flower soil, then?

484
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,991
Don't tell me I should just leave them be?

485
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,991
I'll help you overcome this trial.

486
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
I'll enrich the soil on your behalf.

487
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,559
You should rest.

488
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,871
You? Forget it.

489
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,671
Do you even know how to do this?

490
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,959
Besides, I can't afford to hire you, Flower Bird Envoy.

491
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,400
No. Give it to me.

492
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,110
- Just give it to me. - No.

493
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Come here.

494
00:33:01,617 --> 00:33:02,633
Come here.

495
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,750
It's your garden. Why are you being sneaky?

496
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,431
I'm sick. I don't want them to see me working.

497
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,350
They'll reprimand me. They'll worry about me.

498
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,231
What about me, then?

499
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Cut the crap. Come here.

500
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,631
If they do start a fight,

501
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,231
should I make an appearance or not?

502
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,079
What are you doing?

503
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,750
There was a bug on your face just now.

504
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,911
I didn't feel anything.

505
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,231
I was too impatient today.

506
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,030
Florist Hu, please don't hold it against me.

507
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,951
I was too reckless. I'm sure Ms. He fell sick because she was too worried.

508
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,698
In the future, I'll definitely be extra careful when I build the canal.

509
00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:54,231
I won't damage Ms. He's flowers.

510
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,783
It's my fault too. I was too harsh.

511
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,350
From now on, let's stay united

512
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,759
and build up the garden.

513
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,471
We mustn't make Ms. He worry again.

514
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,480
- That's right. - Brothers, let's get to work.

515
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,590
- Let's get to work. - Yeah.

516
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,351
Bring that over here.

517
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,110
Come. Let's head down there.

518
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,911
They reconciled all because of you.

519
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,391
Mu Dan, seems like you're a great business owner.

520
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,751
I'm just lucky enough to get great business partners like them.

521
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,896
The last batch of flowers will be ready soon.

522
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,719
When the days come,

523
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,230
the water canal will flow,

524
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,190
the warmth will melt the snow,

525
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,391
and countless branches will bud,

526
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,150
while flowers will bloom in full glory.

527
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,471
This garden

528
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,871
will become the true Fang Garden by then.

529
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,599
This is pretty nice.

530
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,039
Can you do the stamen part with mixed threads?

531
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,271
All right. I'll give it a shot.

532
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,670
Make the inner part of the petals more natural.

533
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,311
This dish is made by steaming century eggs.

534
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Is it nice?

535
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
It's very refreshing.

536
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:25,973
- Make the design better. - All right.

537
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,089

My lord, your mutton soup is here.

You can't hit me!

556
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,550
Chuan Yu, where are you?

558
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,769

It looks great.

566
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,271
The flowers smell great.

567
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,999
It's a shame that we can't take them with us.

568
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,079
What a shame.

569
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,791
Miss, as long as you're willing,

00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,760
you may take any flowers you like.

571
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,871
As for the peonies in the garden, you may admire them during spring

572
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
and make orders for the coming autumn.

573
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:29,808
Over here, please.

574
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,110
Do you guys sell any other rouges besides Drunken Rouge?

575
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,079
The garden view delights the heart while the fragrance lingers.

576
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,599
This is how we treat our customers at Fang Garden.

577
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,079
- Please. - Thank you.

578
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,391
Everyone, you all may take your favorite fragrance home

579
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,230
and admire them with your family.

580
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,519

585
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,831

586
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,070
