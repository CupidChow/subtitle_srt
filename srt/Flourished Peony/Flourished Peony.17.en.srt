<i>[Episode 17]</i>

3
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,944
Help!

4
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Help!

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,808
Help!

6
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,199
No matter who hired you,

7
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm willing to pay double to save my life.

8
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,080
Cang Lei, don't hurt her.

9
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
My lady, you're frightened.

10
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,608
Cang Lei.

11
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,432
Get up.

12
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
It's alright.

13
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,400
Thank you.

14
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,039
Thank you for saving me.

15
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,344
Get up.

16
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,176
It's alright.

17
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,952
Thanks.

18
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,120
I can't forget the favor of saving me.

19
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
Please tell me your name.

20
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,520
Tomorrow, I'll come to pay my respects

21
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,759
and return this fine clothing.

22
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,439
Our meeting in the mountains today

23
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,680
is a stroke of fate.

24
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
It's just a piece of clothing.

25
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
Don't bother returning it.

26
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,840
Saving you

27
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,159
also accumulates good karma.

28
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,680
On your journey,

29
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
you've been escorted by soldiers.

30
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,479
I can see your honor.

31
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,120
I think you probably
don't care about rare treasures.

32
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,439
The only thing I can offer

33
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,680
is my talent in raising flowers.

34
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,520
If you don't mind,

35
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,719
I'd like to present you

36
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,919
with some herbaceous peonies

37
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,080
to brighten up your mansion.

38
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,000
I've just arrived in Chang'an.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,599
I don't have a place to live now.

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,519
We are both women.

41
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,680
We should help each other.

42
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,199
No need to be polite.

43
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,639
If you keep this up,

44
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,480
I won't be able to save any more lives.

45
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,976
He Weifang.

46
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,480
Mr. Jiang, why are you here?

47
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Why can't you change that sly look

48
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
when you're back home?

49
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,160
My aunt's judgment is too poor.

50
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,639
What brings you here so late?

51
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,712
I want to eat grilled fish.

52
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,800
I'm not feeling well today.

53
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,079
I'll do it another day.

54
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,519
Goodbye. I won't see you out.

55
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,704
Wait a moment.

56
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,560
This outfit of yours

57
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,839
doesn't look the same as before.

58
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,360
What's going on?

59
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,399
Nothing.

60
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,920
I'm just…

61
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,199
When I was climbing the mountain,

62
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,279
I accidentally fell.

63
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,600
The thorns scratched my hand. It's okay.

64
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,952
I'm not a fool.

65
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,519
Whether it's a knife
or grass that cut your hand,

66
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,399
I can tell how much blood it would shed.

67
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,560
You were acting suspiciously just now.

68
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,639
You didn't want your two sisters
to see this blood-stained clothing, right?

69
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,000
Lower your voice.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,480
If you don't come clean,

71
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,319
I'll call them out right now to take a look.

72
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,800
No. Please don't.

73
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,639
That's how things are.

74
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,720
But fortunately,

75
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,759
I have great luck and fate.

76
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,319
Do you know who did it?

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,040
In Chang'an,

78
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,639
I only have that one enemy.

79
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,199
Not necessarily.

80
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,879
Competition among merchants is common.

81
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,040
While the flower guild has never done

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,279
such ruthless tactics.

83
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,519
Indeed.

84
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,160
If it were just business competition,

85
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,680
there would be no need to take my life.

86
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,312
The real fear is

87
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,600
that there's someone else behind this.

88
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,319
I will have Chuanyu investigate it.

89
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Thank you.

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I didn't expect that

91
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,360
Mr. Jiang would care a little for me,

92
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,399
a small laborer.

93
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,079
You're welcome.

94
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,839
I can't stand someone
meddling with my money bag.

95
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
Given that,

96
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,639
can you just do the full good deed?

97
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,120
Could you send someone
with great martial arts skills

98
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,680
to accompany me
to Qingliang Mountain again tomorrow?

99
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,752
For what?

100
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,120
I want to retrieve the herbaceous peonies
I left by the stream.

101
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,120
Others might forget the pain
once the wound heals,

102
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,920
but your wound hasn't even healed yet.

103
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,279
Can't you just calm down?

104
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,399
No.

105
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,639
Once those flowers are properly grown,

106
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,920
a single one could fetch at least ten strings.

107
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,160
It's really a waste to toss them.

108
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,519
I've never met anyone as frugal as you.

109
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,600
Your clothing is so tattered,

110
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,639
but you don't throw it away

111
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,000
and insist on bringing it back.

112
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,680
This piece of clothing

113
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,240
was bought for me by Shengyi

114
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
after we earned our first sum of money.

115
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,920
Naturally, I can't throw it away.

116
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,240
Indeed.

117
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,439
You are surrounded by fair-weather friends.

118
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,720
You wouldn't grasp the deep friendship

119
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
we have forged in tough times.

120
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,639
It's late. Why isn't Mudan back?

121
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,279
Let's go out to meet her.

122
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,296
Okay.

123
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,936
Let's go.

124
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,919
They've gone.

125
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,208
You can go back.

126
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
Look.

127
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,120
Why is there a cat?

128
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
It seems to be injured.

129
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
Its wound has already been dressed.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,759
You'd better be careful with your hand.

131
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,559
How come it's bandaged the same way I am?

132
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,399
Did you bandage it?

133
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,879
Of course.

134
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,879
I…

135
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,159
I commanded Chuanyu to bandage it.

136
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,168
Come here.

137
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,480
It's not afraid of you.

138
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,679
You seem very familiar with each other.

139
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,399
Don't be fooled by its docility now.

140
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,480
I

141
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,639
have taken care of it for a whole year.

142
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,080
Yet it still refuses to stay.

143
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,759
It often appears and disappears unpredictably.

144
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,960
Occasionally, it comes back wounded.

145
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,240
But since it's there,

146
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,000
there are no more rats in the house.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,399
It's got half a conscience.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,159
If it's caged and loses its freedom,

149
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,240
no matter how many delicacies it has,

150
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,399
they'll all taste bland.

151
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,759
Outside, it might starve

152
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,879
or face dangers.

153
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,360
But the world is vast,

154
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,519
with endless possibilities.

155
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,039
It's indeed a clever

156
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,600
and spirited kitten.

157
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,679
You're quite sympathetic with it.

158
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
It's so good!

159
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,240
Little ears.

160
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,600
Little belly.

161
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Little tail.

162
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
I got my men to investigate

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,600
the list of people who came in
and out of Chang'an when you were stabbed.

164
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,600
This one is the most likely culprit.

165
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,039
He comes from the Liu family.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
Indeed, this issue involves the Liu family.

167
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,240
They know I'm alive.

168
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,960
They also know my identity is fake.

169
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,639
They operate in private
without notifying authorities.

170
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,759
I'm sure they don't want to
let County Princess Ji'an know about this.

171
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,000
Clever.

172
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,600
Thank you very much.

173
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
If I've been on guard against the wrong person

174
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,960
and only narrowly escaped this time,

175
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,559
I'll surely be done in by them in the future.

176
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,679
How much is your

177
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,799
sincere gratitude worth in gold?

178
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
Shall we consider returning

179
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,679
to our previous profit division?

180
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,879
That is impossible.

181
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,320
Do you want me to discipline them?

182
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,399
You help me find out

183
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,600
the puppeteer.

184
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm very grateful.

185
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,879
How can I trouble you further?

186
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,480
I've never forgotten

187
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,519
to avenge my mother and Yulu.

188
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I will sooner or later

189
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,159
meet them again.

190
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,759
With a sly person like you watching,

191
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,840
I will wait and see the day

192
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,600
when the Liu family rises high and falls hard.

193
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,639
We'll worry about the future when it arrives.

194
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,799
How are you going to

195
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,879
handle today?

196
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,840
You can't be constantly on the lookout, right?

197
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,159
Liu Chang knew I was in Chang'an beforehand.

198
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,519
The Liu family did such brutal lengths,

199
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,120
likely due to Liu Chang's feelings for me…

200
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,840
You want to make him give up the feeling.

201
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

202
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,279
Now I have a false identity.

203
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,279
I don't dare make too much of it.

204
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,000
I can only dispel their

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,440
thought of taking actions again.

206
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,919
No matter how cruel

207
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,279
his parents are,

208
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,399
Liu Chang is at least a law-abiding man.

209
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,679
Moreover,

210
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,159
he has always been guilty about the matter

211
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,320
of tribute medicine.

212
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,799
Perhaps this guilt

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,480
can help me resolve this matter.

214
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,600
Don't let your lord come down.

215
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,120
If seen by others,

216
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm afraid there will be
even more misunderstandings.

217
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm glad that you asked to meet with me.

218
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,320
What's wrong with your hand?

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,240
My hand

220
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,399
was injured by the assassin
sent by your parents.

221
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,824
Liu Chang,

222
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,120
I nearly lost my life again.

223
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,759
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,080
I didn't expect that they would
find out you are still alive.

225
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
I will immediately look for a safe mansion.

226
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,759
You can stay by my side.

227
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,080
I will definitely protect you.

228
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,559
I won't let them hurt you again.

229
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,512
Don't get off.

230
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,360
The closer you are to me,

231
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,399
the faster I will die.

232
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,559
Liu Chang,

233
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,039
do you really think you can defy your parents?

234
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,440
As long as you and I still have ties,

235
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,399
they will try every means to kill me.

236
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,919
The protection you speak of

237
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,559
is nothing but their knife to kill me.

238
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,639
This is no different

239
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,080
from you killing me yourself.

240
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,960
Please tell your parents.

241
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,080
I won't disturb your marriage
to County Princess.

242
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,000
Nor will I hinder

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,759
your glory and wealth.

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,440
He Weifang is already dead.

245
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,159
Please ask them to show mercy.

246
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,320
And please you

247
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,752
let me go.

248
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,519
Father. Mother.

249
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,919
Please let He Weifang go.

250
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,759
We are educated and refined.

251
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,480
Don't commit such acts
of killing and sin anymore.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,240
How do you know

253
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
He Weifang isn't dead?

254
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,360
Has she come to pester you?

255
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,279
No.

256
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,039
I discovered by chance that she is still alive.

257
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,000
I was the one who looked for her.

258
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,120
Why did you look for her?

259
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,000
Do you intend to bring her back to Liu Mansion?

260
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,399
Since you've agreed to
the marriage with County Princess.

261
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,440
If County Princess and Prince Ning find out

262
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,159
that your principal wife is still living,

263
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,399
it's equivalent to defying Your Majesty.

264
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,000
A capital punishment wouldn't be unwarranted.

265
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,320
County Princess is infatuated with you
and wouldn't bear to kill you,

266
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,679
but once the marriage falls through,

267
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,919
your career won't be preserved.

268
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,159
Zishu,

269
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,360
back then, because of your affair
with County Princess,

270
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,960
we were driven out of Chang'an

271
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,960
and even forced to sell our ancestral home.

272
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,720
Having barely managed to return here.

273
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,679
Should those past issues arise again,

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,799
your father and I

275
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,000
might not be able to survive for long.

276
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,159
I don't mean to betray the Liu family.

277
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,039
I just implore you

278
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,200
to ease her life.

279
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,559
On the official records,

280
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,519
she's already marked as deceased.

281
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,639
She's no longer my wife.

282
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,440
It is not us who want to kill her.

283
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,480
It's you.

284
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,200
If you can't resist seeing her,

285
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,759
and then He Weifang is still alive.

286
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,919
She will stand between you and County Princess.

287
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,080
If you truly can treat her as if she were dead,

288
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,919
naturally,

289
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,799
we wouldn't need to make her die again.

290
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,152
Alright.

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,039
I promise you.

292
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,720
I won't see her again.

293
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,599
And then,

294
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,839
both of you

295
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,359
can be at ease.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The Jia family has such strict rules.

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,319
They insist on having incense powder
delivered right to their doorstep.

298
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,920
It's incredibly fussy
and difficult to deal with.

299
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,359
It's not a bad thing.

300
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,640
The incense powder in this box

301
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,960
has mostly been sold out.

302
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,680
We've earned money, haven't we?

303
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,119
That's true.

304
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,720
Besides, going out for a walk

305
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,960
is just like loosening up
our muscles and joints.

306
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,599
Yes, you are right.

307
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,039
Stop.

308
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,480
- Don't run.
- Stop. Don't run.

309
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,240
The doctor looks very familiar.

310
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,319
Stop.

311
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,880
He seems to be Lv Gengchun.

312
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,799
Lv… Fu

313
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,839
Hurry up.

314
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,680
Don't run.

315
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,799
Stop.

316
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,160
Don't run.

317
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,759
Stop.

318
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,799
Who's that? Watch where you're going.

319
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,960
What are you doing?

320
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,759
I'm sorry.

321
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,839
Stay back.

322
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,200
I'm so sorry. Look at what I've done.

323
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,559
- That person.
- I'm so sorry.

324
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,640
Hurry up! Come with me.

325
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,680
<i>[Hanging a Gourd to Help the World]</i>
What about that lady?

326
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,720
She's very skilled.

327
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Let's wait for her at the store.

328
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,920
- Hurry up. This way.
- My medicine.

329
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
Hurry up. Forget it. Let's go.

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,440
Lady Lv,

331
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,200
why is it that every time I meet you,

332
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,920
your behavior is so strange?

333
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Look.

334
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,232
Look.

335
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,240
If she wants to harm you,

336
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,599
she wouldn't help you today.

337
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,880
If you don't trust us,

338
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,728
and then you can go away.

339
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,039
I'm just trying to save lives.

340
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,000
When you previously bought flowers,
you only took the roots and stems.

341
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,720
It was for use in medicine.

342
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,119
I heard that Huamanzhu has

343
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,160
a unique scent, Mengdiexiang.

344
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
I just wanted to see
how its medicinal properties

345
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,799
differ from those of other herbaceous peonies.

346
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,240
Healing the sick is a noble act.

347
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,319
Why act so furtively?

348
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,839
A woman practicing medicine
often encounters prejudice.

349
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,519
When some folks see that I'm a female,

350
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,839
they immediately question my medical expertise.

351
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,880
If patients are skeptical of me,

352
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,680
how can they expect to get well?

353
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,039
Why were those people chasing
and beating you today?

354
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,720
Have you treated anyone poorly?

355
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,920
No0

356
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,880
Whenever I encounter an ailment
beyond my medical skills,

357
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
I certainly dare not overestimate my abilities.

358
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,119
But for all the conditions that I can treat,

359
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,359
all of them are cured.

360
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,440
Your medicinal herbs

361
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,000
are worth far more than the fees you earn.

362
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,279
You charge too little

363
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,599
and break the trade rules.

364
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,680
You must have been scolded
by other medical clinics.

365
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,400
Hemorrhaging funds from patient visits.

366
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,799
Are you the daughter of Guild Head Lv?

367
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,640
My father is truly unaware of this.

368
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,680
If I get caught

369
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,240
and reported to my father,

370
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,640
I'm afraid I won't be able to sneak out

371
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,079
to practice medicine in secret anymore.

372
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,319
If you feel unwell in the future,

373
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,599
please seek me for treatment.

374
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,839
I will surely not charge a penny

375
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,039
as gratitude for today's kindness.

376
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,519
You almost got caught being a female doctor.

377
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,839
You're not worried about
losing your reputation,

378
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,720
but about not being able to

379
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
treat patients anymore.

380
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:27,680
Some of my patients need regular injections,

381
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,240
If the treatment stops
and their conditions relapse, what will happen?

382
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,119
Oh. There's a patient

383
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,839
who is waiting for me to deliver medicine.

384
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,839
I must take my leave first.

385
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,888
Wait a moment.

386
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,319
What if you go out now

387
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,440
and run into those people again?

388
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,640
We'll deliver the medicine for you.

389
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,920
You can change back
into women's clothing first.

390
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,599
Only if you get through today safely,

391
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,680
can you continue
practicing medicine in the future.

392
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,279
What injured your hand?

393
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,720
How long has it been like this?

394
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,519
Seven days ago,
it was cut by a sharp instrument.

395
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,079
It was no big deal after being bandaged.

396
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,319
I understand a bit of pharmacology,

397
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,519
so I prepared some

398
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,799
medicines to dissipate stasis
and stop bleeding.

399
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,759
It's just that sometimes

400
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,200
I get a little shaky now and then.

401
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,759
You try to make a fist.

402
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,952
Make a fist?

403
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
Now, you try to squeeze my hand.

404
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,376
You can try harder.

405
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,680
What's wrong?

406
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,160
Is there something inappropriate?

407
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,640
Does it hurt a lot?

408
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,200
Quick, send someone to boil water,

409
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,119
and bring some clean cloth and wooden boards.

410
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,200
Fu has already sent the medicine.

411
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,200
What are you doing?

412
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,359
Don't panic. She's treating me.

413
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,240
Your skin wound looks okay on the outside,

414
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,960
but the injury to the finger tendons

415
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,279
wasn't fixed right away,

416
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,400
causing the trembling.

417
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,720
If we don't cut open the injured area

418
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,839
and put the tendons back in place,

419
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,599
your hand might be useless forever.

420
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,599
That's not it.

421
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,319
It was almost healed.

422
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,000
How could the tendons suddenly get damaged?

423
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,599
Her words can't be trusted.

424
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,200
She is the daughter of Lv Wanrong.

425
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,359
Maybe.

426
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,440
She just wants to take this opportunity

427
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,839
to destroy your hand.

428
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,799
No, I wouldn't harm anyone.

429
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,359
Your hand has been delayed for a long time.

430
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,400
It must be treated immediately.

431
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
It can't be delayed any longer.

432
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,079
Your father views me as a nuisance.

433
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,279
Why do you want to help me?

434
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,039
Because I'm a doctor first,

435
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,240
and then I'm Lv Gengchun.

436
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,119
I have heard of those rumors.

437
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,839
But I believe in my father's character.

438
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,960
Although he may be a bit rigid,

439
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,279
he is an upright person.

440
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,319
Those dirty tricks

441
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,720
could never have been his.

442
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
Of course, you'll defend your father.

443
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,720
Mudan, you can't trust her.

444
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,480
I don't understand business matters.

445
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,799
I only know that top-notch healers

446
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,359
help anyone in need,

447
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,079
no matter if they're close or far.

448
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,119
I've seen your hand's injured,

449
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,279
so I must do something about it.

450
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,279
If you don't trust my medical skills,

451
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,880
you can send someone to find out

452
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,680
if I've ever messed up treating any patient.

453
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,079
I now know who you really are.

454
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,240
If my hand deteriorates

455
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,680
after your treatment,

456
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,920
I'll have you arrested.

457
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,519
You won't just get a beating.

458
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,720
Your reputation
and your family's name will suffer.

459
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,400
Even with that risk,

460
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
are you still willing to treat me?

461
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,640
If it's because of my ill intentions

462
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
or poor skills that leave you disabled,

463
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
getting a beating is nothing.

464
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
I should be the one to have my hand disabled.

465
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,279
This is the handkerchief

466
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,400
you left when we first met.

467
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,240
Even the Gentian

468
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,000
embroidered on it is medicinal.

469
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,440
It's clear you're truly obsessed
with medical skills and pharmacology.

470
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,944
I believe you.

471
00:24:58,944 --> 00:24:59,960
Mudan.

472
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,680
I trust what I feel and what I see

473
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,839
more than whose daughter she is.

474
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,416
Chun.

475
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,440
Just call me Chun.

476
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,319
I will surely help you recover.

477
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,880
I will never betray your trust.

478
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,920
Alright.

479
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,279
Then I entrust my hands to you.

480
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,160
Doctor Chun.

481
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,359
Where did you find such a charlatan?

482
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,279
Why are your hands wrapped up like a fan?

483
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,480
You have taken too much interest.

484
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,599
I can only afford

485
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,599
to hire a charlatan.

486
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,759
This statement is inappropriate.

487
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,119
Our share was agreed upon long ago.

488
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,000
Might you renege on your promise?

489
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,799
What I've promised,

490
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
I'll never go back on.

491
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,759
On the contrary,

492
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,440
I want to send money to you.

493
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,240
What are you scheming now?

494
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,160
My hands are like this.
What scheme could I have?

495
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,200
Mr. Jiang,

496
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,720
could you please not judge

497
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,559
a gentleman's heart with a petty mind?

498
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,079
What I'm talking about is

499
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,400
Qiongtai Yulu that is pawned at your mansion.

500
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
It's time to redeem it back.

501
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,119
That's easy to say.

502
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,559
Let's see how tonight's

503
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,680
supper tastes.

504
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,440
Someone has just brought me

505
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,039
the finest meat.

506
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,359
The barbecue is too smoky.

507
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,519
I'm afraid it'll stain my mansion.

508
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,880
It's still your little shitty yard
that's suitable for it.

509
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,152
Mr. Jiang,

510
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,160
my hands are like this.

511
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,039
I can't serve you food and drink.

512
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,160
During the healing period,

513
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,119
you might as well seek pleasure elsewhere.

514
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,720
Your right hand is inconvenient,

515
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,920
but the left one can be used, right?

516
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,680
Or you don't want to

517
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
redeem that flower anymore?

518
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,440
During the day, I specially had someone

519
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,880
send over a swing.

520
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,440
It's also to add some charm

521
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
to your courtyard.

522
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,480
I truly thank you.

523
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,240
You know I can't eat certain things
and have to eat sesame cakes.

524
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,519
You're not only going to

525
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,079
eat meat in front of me later,

526
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,359
but also ask me to help grill it.

527
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,664
That's quite a move.

528
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,920
Let everyone's talents shine
and make the most of everything.

529
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,039
Your right hand should do something, too.

530
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,119
Come over

531
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,519
and fan me later.

532
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,440
If I fan for you, how can I roast?

533
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,240
Mr. Jiang,

534
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,720
how about

535
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,039
I perform a trick

536
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,519
for you?

537
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,880
How about

538
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,960
I show you how to breathe fire?

539
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,680
You see.

540
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,480
Hold on.

541
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,759
I've brought you something to eat.

542
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,960
It's the top-grade tribute white honey.

543
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,759
It's good for relieving pain
and boosting energy. I'm considerate, right?

544
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,960
Bring it here.

545
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,039
Back then in Luoyang,

546
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,519
the baked cakes you sent me

547
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,920
also had a layer of honey brushed on it.

548
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,799
This is my family's

549
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,400
exclusive roasting method.

550
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,759
I don't usually pass it on to outsiders.

551
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,400
You're in for a treat today.

552
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,984
Have a taste.

553
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,160
Sweet and crispy.

554
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,640
It's really nice.

555
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,168
Break a piece for me.

556
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,079
No wonder it's called tribute honey.

557
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
It's incredibly sweet.

558
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,079
Are you getting addicted to bossing me around?

559
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,272
Break it yourself.

560
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,448
Be careful. It's hot.

561
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,119
I'm grilling meat for you,

562
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,960
and you break the sesame cakes for me.

563
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,920
It's just a matter of reciprocity.
What's wrong with that?

564
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,519
Why haven't I eaten meat yet?

565
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,559
It's not ready yet.

566
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,160
There are two mouths

567
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,319
and one hand.

568
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,240
I can't starve myself.

569
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,480
You should wipe the honey
from your mouth first.

570
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,119
Who is it?

571
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,776
Your creditor.

572
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,759
Haven't you had enough roasted meat?

573
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,279
They are…

574
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,359
Thank you very much, Mr. Jiang.

575
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,720
Tomorrow, I will send the money to you.

576
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,359
I'll help you move them in.

577
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,872
Thank you.

578
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,000
But there's no need

579
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,640
to rush with sending flowers.

580
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,559
Why go through the trouble
in the middle of the night?

581
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,160
Considering the effort
you've put into grilling meat.

582
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,279
I give you a return gift.

583
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,559
Doctor Fu of Imperial Medical Bureau

584
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,039
personally made this ointment.

585
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,400
It's specifically for treating
damaged tendons and veins.

586
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,880
Can you be that kind?

587
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,319
It's worth 1,000 wen.

588
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,359
I can't afford it. You keep it for your own.

589
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,480
No need for you to pay me.

590
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,359
I'm counting on your hands

591
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,160
to make money for me and grill meat.

592
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,839
If you don't get better soon,
I'll be the one at a loss.

593
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,240
I'll just do it myself.

594
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:03,559
Do you know the special way

595
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,864
to apply this medicine?

596
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:35,232
<i>♫ If the heart is like frost ♫</i>

597
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:38,371

603

Jiang Changyang,

00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,440
you're a decent guy

605
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,160

<i>[Jiang Mansion]</i>
Please.

623
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,440
Let me see Floral Envoy.

624
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,920
Who is this lady?

625
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,039
How dare she make a racket
in front of Jiang Mansion?

626
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,320
To ask Floral Envoy for help?

627
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
He's not that kind.

628
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,599
Please.

629
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,920
Please let me see Floral Envoy.

630
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,480
Please.

631
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,800
Please let me see Floral Envoy.

632
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,440
Mother.

633
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,199
- Fan'er.
- I'm in pain.

634
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:38,159
I want to go home.

635
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,599
Good boy, Fan'er.

636
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,000
Your elder brother will save you.

637
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,719
Please.

638
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,039
Please let me see Floral Envoy.

639
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,280
Please let me see Floral Envoy.

640
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,719
Jiang Changyang,

641
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,320
he is your younger brother.

642
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,119
He is also your only kin.

643
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,360
Are you just going to watch him suffer

644
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,199
and not say anything?

645
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,239
Mother.

646
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,360
- You can't go in.
- Let's go home.

647
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,719
I'm fine.

648
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,159
You hate me.

649
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,800
You can kill me.

650
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,599
But how can you just stand by

651
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,599
and do nothing for your own kin?

652
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,639
I beg you to save him.

653
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,039
I beg you to save him.

654
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,599
I beg you to save him.

655
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,360
I beg you to save him.

656
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,800
I beg you to save him.

657
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,679
Please save him.

658
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,119
Please save him.

659
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,239
Please save him.

660
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,559
Are you alright?

661
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:39,760
Jiang Changyang,

662
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,519
please save him.

663
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,239
Please save him.

664
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,880
Please save him.

665
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,159
I beg you to save him.

666
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,039
Jiang Changyang,
please save your younger brother.

667
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,559
Lady He, just don't go.

668
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,400
No one's persuasion will work.

669
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,679
She is the concubine of My lord's father.

670
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,800
My lord will definitely not care about her.

671
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,519
I know.

672
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,920
Jiang Changyang,

673
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,559
come out and take a look.

674
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,679
The clear sound of the zither

675
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,559
can't cover the cries outside.

676
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,920
If you find them annoying,

677
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,960
just have someone

678
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,239
get rid of them.

679
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,760
Let Chuanyu give them some money and fabric,

680
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,079
and send them off to the infirmary.

681
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,239
Who are they?

682
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,239
Why bother?

683
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,159
Who are you

684
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,920
to meddle in my affairs?

685
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,800
I'm not in your business.

686
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,679
Just now at the entrance,

687
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,000
I saw that little kid.

688
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,960
He was in unbearable pain all over,

689
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,079
spitting up blood.

690
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,320
But he kept holding

691
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,119
onto this grasshopper tightly,

692
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,128
never letting go.

693
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,079
This is still in your mansion.

694
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,000
I thought

695
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,039
I should let you know

696
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,159
in case

697
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,599
there's some hidden story behind it.

698
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,800
There's no hidden story.

699
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,800
I just don't like

700
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,920
the mother and son.

701
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,719
If it were merely because Mrs. Bai

702
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,519
took the favor that originally
belonged to Madam Jiang,

703
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,599
you wouldn't have vented anger on that child.

704
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,719
Although to outsiders,

705
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,119
you are seen as an unforgivable sycophant,

706
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,079
I've known you for quite some time.

707
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,184
I know very well

708
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,880
that you are not like that.

709
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,576
You think

710
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,800
I should save him.

711
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,519
I can't judge this.

712
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,400
But I think

713
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,599
you want to save him.

714
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,239
You think I'm too merciful.

715
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
Do you know why that child is frail and sickly?

716
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,039
When she was about to give birth,

717
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,000
Mrs. Bai had a difficult labor
and almost lost her life.

718
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,960
Her screams were extremely agonizing

719
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,679
far surpassing those of today.

720
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,128
Wonder

721
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,239
how I know this?

722
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,360
Because I was just outside

723
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,800
their main gate.

724
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,960
Her child didn't deserve to die.

725
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,519
But what about my mother?

726
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,079
Fan'er.

727
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,280
Mudan,

728
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
will we offend Floral Envoy

729
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
by doing this?

730
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,440
He didn't say others couldn't save him.

731
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,280
I thought he was a good man,

732
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,920
but I didn't think
he'd be so cruel to his brother.

733
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,159
Don't jump to conclusions lightly.

734
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,559
This is his family affair.

735
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,679
We can't understand the grudges involved.

736
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,584
How's the boy?

737
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,159
I've just applied acupuncture,

738
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,360
and the child has fallen asleep.

739
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,159
His illness is quite bizarre.

740
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,480
He suffers from limb pain and weakness,

741
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,639
with the left lower limb swollen
and sensitive to touch.

742
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,440
I initially suspected it might be a tumor,

743
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,239
but there's no redness

744
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,239
or ulceration on the skin.

745
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
In my opinion,

746
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,840
it seems like he might have
ghostly bone disease.

747
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,239
What disease is this?

748
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,920
I've never heard of it.

749
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,079
The disease causes the bones to wither
and the marrow to diminish.

750
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,119
When it strikes,

751
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,360
the patient feels as if millions of insects
are gnawing at his body,

752
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,944
causing unbearable pain.

753
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,320
Is there any hope for recovery?

754
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,039
Although the disease is not fatal,

755
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:22,280
it is extremely difficult to cure completely.

756
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,760
With my current medical skills,

757
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,039
I can only provide temporary relief.

758
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,239
But I've read a book by Master Doctor Fu
of Imperial Medical Bureau.

759
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,159
The book mentions this disease.

760
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,480
To truly cure this,

761
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,280
it seems only he has the capability.

762
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,360
It seems we have to rely on Jiang Changyang.

763
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,519
My lord is truly not in the mansion.

764
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,360
Lady He, don't bother searching for him.

765
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,976
Come in.

766
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,480
Have something to eat.

767
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,559
Is there still no news of Mr. Jiang?

768
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:14,527
<i>♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫</i>

769
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:23,065
<i>♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫</i>

770
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:30,939
<i>♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫</i>

771
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:40,285
<i>♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫</i>

772
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:47,828
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

773
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:56,669
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

774
00:42:56,669 --> 00:43:04,480
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

775
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:12,377
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>

776
00:43:33,053 --> 00:43:39,936
<i>♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫</i>

777
00:43:41,237 --> 00:43:47,931
<i>♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫</i>

778
00:43:48,688 --> 00:43:55,990
<i>♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫</i>

779
00:43:56,674 --> 00:44:04,983
<i>♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫</i>

780
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:12,414
<i>♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫</i>

781
00:44:13,245 --> 00:44:21,501
<i>♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫</i>

782
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:28,925
<i>♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫</i>

783
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:37,379
<i>♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫</i>
