1
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,640

2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,950

3
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,220
 Ms. Yeon Woo called the CEO Mi Dam her mother,

4
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,690
 and CEO Lee suddenly asked for this shirt.

5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,760
 Every day is full of spectacles.

6
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,340
 I am sorry.

7
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,140
 You looked so much like my mother...

8
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,340
 That is fine.

9
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,750
 That could happen.

10
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,230
 Did you say you were Yeon Woo?

11
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,100
 Yes.

12
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,180
 If it's okay with you, could you show me your skirt?

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,370
 It's so unique and pretty.

14
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,970
 Did you make this from a hanbok by chance?

15
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,790
 Yes. I made it myself...

16
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,810
 Oh, my goodness. You made this yourself, Yeon Woo?

17
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,300
 You're so talented!

18
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,120
 Really?

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,200
 You did very well.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,230
 It's magnificent.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:06,930

22
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,580

23
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,050
 You learned from your mother how to embroider and make clothes?

24
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,180
 Yes, ever since I was young.

25
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,040
 If it's all right, can I accept your offer right now, Deputy CEO Kang?

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,440
 Our offer?

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,080
 Of course.

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,880
 In return, I have one condition.

29
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,460
 I want to work with Yeon Woo.

30
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,630
 Will that be possible?

31
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,990
- Let's get some tea. It's been a while. 
 - Sounds good.

32
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,060
Let's go.

33
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,580
Goodness. How long has it been?

34
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,620
Goodness, how many years has it been?

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,090
Really. Goodness, seriously.

36
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,790
A collaboration with Midam?

37
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,450
Great work. Congratulations.

38
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,100
It looks like things worked out, thanks to your wife.

39
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,360
Great work.

40
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,060
It's all thanks to you, Directors.

41
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,990
We should go.

42
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,490
Those bat-like bastards. They just switch over in an instant.

43
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,980
What are you, a double-sided tape?

44
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,430
They stick over here and then over there. Geez.

45
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,340

46
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,030
What brings you here?

47
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,890
I thought I should at least congratulate you.

48
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,090
That was quite something. Or did you just get lucky?

49
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,060
I have nothing more to say to you, so please leave.

50
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,850
Okay. Good luck.

51
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,540
Especially since Grandfather has high expectations for you.

52
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,560

53
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,890
Ms. Yeon Woo, you should go home first with Sa Wol.

54
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,360
I suddenly have something to take care of.

55
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,140
Sa Wol?

56
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,050
What is he saying? He's so ridiculous.

57
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,760
Isn't that right—

58
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,380
What is it?

59
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,860
Did something get on the norigae? 
  (An accessory for a hanbok)

60
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,020
I thought this part that turned black was strange.

61
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,100
What?

62
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,620
It was where my husband's blood was.

63
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,250
- Blood? 
 - I saw it in a book

64
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,370
that silver turns black when it touches poison.

65
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,370
Poison!

66
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,610
Poison?

67
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,170
Wait! Are you saying your husband got poisoned?

68
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,920
I don't know about that... but I've got a bad feeling.

69
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,370
Are you feeling unwell?

70
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,510
Of course, I can't feel good,

71
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,540
when you're here, Min Hye Sook.

72
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,220
What did you say?

73
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,920
It's time for a meeting.

74
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,320
Deputy CEO!

75
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,480
Are you all right?

76
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,890
Quiet!

77
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,990
People will hear you.

78
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,100
Did you hear?

79
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,590
There's shocking news!

80
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,230
The one who persuaded Midam... was Kang Dro's wife.

81
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,510
The Deputy CEO's wife?

82
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,280
Then how about the tabloids? It said she was weird.

83
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,140
That was all a lie.

84
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,480
But who is she?

85
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,080
Is she a third-generation conglomerate?

86
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,480
A celebrity? A famous person?

87
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,970
I'm going to stop by the PR team for a second.

88
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,530
Okay. Take care.

89
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,540
You should go to the hospital first. I'll contact Dr. Choi.

90
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,470
No, I can't.

91
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,600
Until the first-anniversary event, no... until Grandfather gets surgery

92
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,000
and things are wrapped up with Park Yeon Woo, don't make a fuss.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,970
Deputy CEO!

94
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,420
It's not a request, but an order.

95
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,540
All right.

96
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,270
 It is just a temporary sound of a drum beating.

97
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,450
 Don't worry.

98
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,110
 You will soon get better.

99
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,650
It's embroidery that has been passed down my mother's family line.

100
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,480
It's about 200 years old.

101
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,860
200 years?

102
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,600
It's an irregular cross stitch and jaryunsu. 
  (A type of stitch technique)

103
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,810
It's almost identical in color arrangement and shape to the one Yeon Woo did.

104
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,530
Not only that, even the butterfly wings are made with overlapping threads.

105
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,170
This is why you accepted our offer?

106
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,800
I was reminded of this cloth after seeing Yeon Woo's embroidery.

107
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,370
I was curious about Park Yeon Woo.

108
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,390
Of course, I did fall in love with her embroidering skills.

109
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,730
Secretary Hong!

110
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,190
How could you be useful when you're so weak as a man?

111
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,080
I see you didn't leave yet, Sa Wol.

112
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,440
For the Lady's and your first night—

113
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,870
I mean, for your health, I was preparing some food, Young Master.

114
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,620
Please quickly wash up and come out.

115
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,620
She...

116
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,510
just smiled at me. Right?

117
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,480
Excuse me?

118
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,530
So cool...

119
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,310
Sa Wol.

120
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,500
C-Chicken... 
  (He means to say "chicken skin" which means "cringe" in Korean)

121
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,410
What is all this?

122
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,290
Where do you think you're sitting?

123
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,330
P-Pardon?

124
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,850
Why? Mr. Hong should eat with us.

125
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:12,000
I only prepared a small portion so the two of you can eat by yourselves.

126
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,440
This is...

127
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,370
for you.

128
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,700
Can't we all just eat together?

129
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Yeah, let's all eat together. Sit down.

130
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,310
Absolutely not.

131
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,660
Let's hurry up and go while I'm telling you nicely.

132
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,710
Where?

133
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,140
Hurry up, and let's go!

134
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,750
Where are we going? Deputy CEO!

135
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,210
Gosh!

136
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,250
Sa Wol!

137
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,510
Enjoy the food, and don't leave any leftovers!

138
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,710
- Hurry, hurry, hurry! 
- Sa Wol, Sa Wol, Sa Wol!

139
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,950
- Quiet! Hurry! 
 - Just a bit slowly! Goodness!

140
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,570
What's wrong with you?

141
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,020
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

142
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,450
All right. It is night.

143
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,630
Yes.

144
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,920
And the Young Master has come home.

145
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,900
Then we should have the sense to leave.

146
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,680
So, why?

147
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,300
That is...

148
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,010
your homework.

149
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,030
You can figure it out by the next time I see you, or not.

150
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,540
N-N-Next time?

151
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,550
Next time, when?

152
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,340
- Sa Wol! I'll give you a ride home. 
 - What?

153
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,910
Sa Wol!

154
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,310
As I thought, CEO Lee looked very similar to your mother, Yeon Woo.

155
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,120
So much so that it breaks my heart.

156
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,660
I don't know what fated connection we have.

157
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,600
I would like for you to take CEO Lee's offer.

158
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,300
No, please take it.

159
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,310
As Deputy CEO of SH Seoul, I need you, Designer Park Yeon Woo.

160
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,250
It's late. Let's go.

161
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,820
If you need time to think about it, I will give you time. But try to think about it positively—

162
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,740
 Hey, Yeon Woo!

163
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,220
 What is it? Why are you here?

164
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,910
 - Where are you going? 
 - To eat tteokbokki.

165
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,030
 Hey, why are you getting in between a couple?

166
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,440
 Whatever. Why?

167
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,710
The name Park Yeon Woo...

168
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,820
never really belonged to me.

169
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,390
That is why I was always jealous of the new Joseon people...

170
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,840
since they live with their own name.

171
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,780
Then, isn't my offer also good for you, Yeon Woo?

172
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,370
There's a difference between what is good and okay to do.

173
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,200
Our marriage is necessary for both of us, but I have no intention to cause any harm.

174
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,090
If things get more noisy at work because of me—

175
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,470
I'll handle that myself.

176
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Also, I'm a businessman. I made the offer for your potential.

177
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,410
I dressed up a bit since it's my first day.

178
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,270
What do you think?

179
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,310
You look pretty...

180
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,900
I'm talking about the clothes.

181
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,060
Let's go.

182
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,130
I'll take a taxi.

183
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,530
We can't get caught.

184
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,740
It's fine, so let's ride together to the area near the office.

185
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,590
Everything should be clear-cut.

186
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,250
From now on, we are strangers.

187
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,000
She really has no middle ground.

188
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,950
They're from Midam for our first-anniversary event.

189
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,370
Hello, I am Lee Mi Dam.

190
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,140
This is Manager Do Yoon Jae of Midam.

191
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,150
This is guest designer Park Yeon Woo.

192
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,100
Designer?

193
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,180
You will be working closely with these two from now on.

194
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,980
You were a designer.

195
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,690
No wonder. That's why your style was unique.

196
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,010
I hope to produce a good product together.

197
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,650
I look forward to working with you.

198
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,780
I also look forward to working with you all!

199
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,250
Gosh, that scared me.

200
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,530
Wow, you're full of energy.

201
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,300
I'm sorry. I just got so nervous.

202
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,660
What? Park Yeon Woo is participating as a designer for Midam?

203
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,810
Ridiculous.

204
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,510
CEO, I think we should wait and see this time.

205
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:05,240
Since he brought in Park Yeon Woo with a major event coming up, there will definitely be a problem down the line.

206
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,480
Tae Ha wouldn't have brought her in without a plan.

207
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,100
Still, it's not bad since we have another person to target.

208
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,730
More than anything, it's still too dangerous to keep attacking Chairman Kang.

209
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,550
Attach someone to Park Yeon Woo immediately, and report every detail about how the event prep is progressing.

210
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,840
Okay, I will do so.

211
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,410

How about we add a few more dresses besides those you bought at Milano?

212
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,630
Manager Do Yoon Jae and I prepared a few more drafts.

213
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,620
It would definitely help with the promotions as well.

214
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,640
What do you think, Deputy Yoo?

215
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,840
How about we make a story with Park Yeon Woo's design included?

216
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,970
A concept that shows Midam connecting to the next generation and SH's new vision.

217
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,760
It's a good idea.

218
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,660
How about we make one of the sections with that concept?

219
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,190
Okay. That would be meaningful and fun.

220
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,060
How about we review a design draft first before we decide?

221
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,670
Park Yeon Woo's outfits...

222
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,900
Honestly, I don't know how I feel about them yet.

223
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,480
Well, I think—

224
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,730
Of course, she'll do well.

225
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,590
She is an honorary designer of Midam.

226
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,500
What do you think, Yeon Woo? Will that be all right with you?

227
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,970
Someone who makes clothes should talk with their clothes.

228
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,850
If you give me the chance, I will answer you with my clothes.

229
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,800
 Find more files on it.

230
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,570
You were so cool earlier, Park Yeon Woo.

231
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,610
Yeon Woo? Yeon Woo.

232
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,110
Well, okay.

233
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,620
But will you be okay? You blatantly entered the tiger's den.

234
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,670
If you mind your own business, I'll be totally fine.

235
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh? I don't want to, though.

236
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,570
- I'll keep getting involved in your business. 
 - Quiet.

237
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,990
Stop it.

238
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,770
Why don't you want me to?

239
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,720
It looks like Ms. Yeon Woo is quite friendly with Tae Min.

240
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,540
She's really good at befriending people.

241
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,980
Friendly, my foot.

242
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,230
Secretary Hong, should I buy you some eyeglasses?

243
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,960
I have a 20/20 vision.

244
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,690
I was an elite marksman.

245
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,160

246
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,570
This is yours, Yeon Woo.

247
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,890

248
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,600
Wow, it's my name.

249
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
You like it that much?

250
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,040
I feel bad now.

251
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,680
It was upsetting earlier in the conference room, huh?

252
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,010
A bit.

253
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,910
But I'll do a darned good job, so just watch.

254
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,530
Pardon?

255
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,030
You're quite scary.

256
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,510
Could you give me your number so I can save you in my contacts?

257
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,910
Okay.

258
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,840
Oh, not that one.

259
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,150
- Four. 
 - Oh, four?

260
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,100
What's this? Why are they so close?

261
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,880
What are you doing, Deputy CEO?

262
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,440
Oh, did you come to spy on us?

263
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,890
If it's not that, then—

264
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,640
Oh, the thing is...

265
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,420
We should have a company dinner.

266
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,850
Let's have a company dinner, everyone.

267
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,460
Wow, a company dinner! I like company dinners!

268
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,450
We're having a company dinner! What are we eating?

269
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,250
It's nice to have new members.

270
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,260
We even get to have a company dinner at such a nice place like this.

271
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,980
I know, right?

272
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,280
And the Deputy CEO came, too.

273
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,900
The Deputy CEO's attendance rate was usually 0% before.

274
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,760
Gosh, what's with your personality?

275
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,160
You should be more friendly with everyone.

276
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,820
Park Yeon Woo, I see you speak your mind, even in front of the Deputy CEO.

277
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,400
Words are meant to be spoken,

278
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,210
and this meat is meant to be chewed and eaten.

279
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,520
They say meat someone else buys is the most tasty.

280
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,050
This meat is so tasty.

281
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,750
Since it's a company dinner, how about we all have a drink?

282
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,100
No, I think I'll decline.

283
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,890
- Sounds good! 
 - Yes, yes, yes!

284
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,290
- Ma'am. 
 - Yes?

285
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,620
Give us five more beers.

286
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,770

287
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,180
All right, cheers to the first-anniversary opening event!

288
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,630
 Cheers!

289
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:23,060
All right, bottoms up! Drink up!

290
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,500
Gosh, you drink very well, Yeon Woo.

291
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,820
Cheers?

292
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,470
Yeon Woo, you should slow down. You'll get drunk like that.

293
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,790
 Who cares if she gets drunk or not?

294
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,600
Oh, this meat is just so tasty that it makes me crave drinks.

295
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,110
 Why does she keep smiling at him?

296
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,680
Then you should eat up.

297
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,960
 And why is he getting involved?

298
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,590
Deputy CEO, should I pour you some water?

299
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,120
No, I'm fine.

300
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,450
Please give me some.

301
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,570
You should pour it yourself.

302
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,610
Goodness, does Midam only pick handsome guys and pretty girls?

303
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,890
Manager Do and Yeon Woo look so good together.

304
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,080
You two often get mistaken for being a couple. Right?

305
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,050
Stop teasing us.

306
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,350
I'm fine, but Yeon Woo will feel uncomfortable.

307
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,940
Pardon?

308
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,770
U-Uncomfortable? About what?

309
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,510
I'm perfectly fine.

310
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,920
What is this?

311
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,490
The two of you are...

312
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,240
Oh, my. Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!

313
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,750
- Team Leader Oh! 
 - Hey!

314
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,170
- Give us some more meat! 
 - Okay.

315
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,540
Yeon Woo, do you want one more glass?

316
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,800
No, no, I shouldn't drink a lot.

317
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,040
If I get drunk, there's something I tend to do really well.

318
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,730
 Whenever I get drunk, I tend to do that very well.

319
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,520
Something you tend to do very well? What is that?

320
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,400
Oh? If you find out, you'll get hurt!

321
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,870
So, let me tell you what that is...

322
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,500
Stop!

323
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,620
The company dinner is over!

324
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,440
Why aren't you coming out? Is it that good?

325
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,020
Oh, okay.

326
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,570
Gosh, thank you for the food.

327
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,330
Gosh, I ate so well.

328
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,150
- I'm so full. 
 - That was so good.

329
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,790
- It was so tasty. 
 - I ate too much.

330
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,540
Yeon Woo, do you want to take my car?

331
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,930
We can talk about the design on the way, too.

332
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,720
Oh, I'll give Yeon Woo a ride home—

333
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,190
Okay, sounds good.

334
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,380
I had something to ask you anyway.

335
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,990
You sure you're not tired?

336
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,380
I'll give Park Yeon Woo a ride.

337
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,320
Manager Do, you drank, right?

338
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,740
It would be best if Yeon Woo took Secretary Hong's car back home.

339
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,230
I didn't drink because I brought my car.

340
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,080
I should take Manager Do's car, then.

341
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,290
I drank a bit.

342
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,860
Hey, Junior! Where are you going?

343
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,430
You should go to the second round with us.

344
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,350
Karaoke! Karaoke!

345
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,810
- Karaoke! 
 - We should go, too.

346
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,120
Let's go to the second round, Marketing Team!

347
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,240
We should all go together!

348
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,160
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

349
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,360
I'll be going.

350
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,110
D-Deputy CEO, we should go home now, too.

351
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,670
I'm going, I'm going, gosh!

352
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,050
Why do you keep nagging me!

353
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,240
It's nice seeing him express his anger and all.

354
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,070
This is... Yeon Woo effect?

355
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,620
That Manager Do or whatever his name was...

356
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,920
Who the hell is he to not drink by himself?

357
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,270
What is she doing that she's still not here?

358
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:33,640
She acts like we're strangers at work, and now they're just having too much fun!

359
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,000
I'll never have a company dinner again!

360
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,870
Kang Tae Ha, why do you have to hide?

361
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,640
Is this your house?

362
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,120
No, it's nearby, but I wanted to walk a bit.

363
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,330
I'm just too full.

364
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,360
Okay, then.

365
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,910
What is that in your hair?

366
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,180
Are you going to take that home?

367
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,330
Hey!

368
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,160
You were outside?

369
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,010
I just wanted to get some air.

370
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,680
You came back really early.

371
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,780
Oh, Manager Do knows so much about clothes.

372
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,740
He was absolutely amazing.

373
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,990
Absolutely amazing? Where did she learn that from?

374
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,100
Manager Do supposedly learned about clothes in Europe.

375
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,630
I wanted to see clothes from other countries outside of Joseon, so I was so jealous.

376
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,970
But Manager Do... Manager Do said...

377
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,920
So Manager Do...

378
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,780
Manager Do. Manager Do. Manager Do!

379
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,890
And Manager Do...

380
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,520
Manager Do! Manager Do!

381
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,070
I should pray to Moon Rabbit to let me do well at work.

382
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,300
Oh, the Moon Rabbit?

383
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,050
That will be no use.

384
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,610
That rabbit doesn't live there.

385
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,750

386
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,480
This is the real moon.

387
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,700
There is no air there, and there are only rocks.

388
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,830
So, there is no rabbit grinding grain or eating grass there.

389
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,580
Oh, too bad.

390
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,790
I'm the one who got her hired, but all she talks about is Manager Do.

391
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,320
Stop right there!

392
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,670
Stop!

393
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,720
Stop! I said, stop!

394
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,840
Why, what?

395
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,890
Did you have to tell me about Moon Rabbit today at this moment?

396
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,830
Why are you ruining my good mood?

397
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,360
I did so because I could.

398
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,540
Do I have to consider your mood, too?

399
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,580
"You"?

400
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,070
I said not to call me that! Did I not?

401
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,390
How dare you drop honorifics!

402
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,100
You started it!

403
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,950
You! You with your nasty temper!

404
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,200
You mean bastard!

405
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,010
You're the one with a major problem whenever you get drunk!

406
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,350
What? What are you talking about?

407
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,460
Don't be pathetic and pick at my flaws.

408
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,530
- Pathetic? Pick at your flaws? 
 - What?

409
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,480
- You were going to do it earlier, too! 
 - Do what?

410
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,570
The kiss you do so well when you get drunk!

411
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,050
K-Kiss?

412
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,480
What are you talking about?

413
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,490
What I tend to do well is headbutting!

414
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,650
Not brush lips, but butt heads!

415
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,420
I didn't remember back then, so I misspoke.

416
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,350
H-Headbutt?

417
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,810
That would make sense.

418
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,740
Gosh, forget it. Let's stop talking about this.

419
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,280
The end.

420
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,110
Gosh, seriously.

421
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,830
Headbutt...

422
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,520
It was headbutting?

423
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,080
Whoa, I thought it was something else...

424
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,650
Gosh, that's a relief.

425
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,440
Why is that a relief?

426
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,400
Whether I headbutt or kiss someone, why would he get mad?

427
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,440
Gosh, whatever.

428
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,660
It's so embarrassing!

429
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,380
What does this mean?

430
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,300
Aren't you going to work? You're late.

431
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,520
Night, have the sense to leave...

432
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,050
Look at you.

433
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,970
What? Reading them isn't enough, so will you write them now? An R-rated one at that?

434
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,280
What do you mean, R-rated?

435
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,940
It's pretty clear.

436
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,260
The Young Master is coming at night, so have the sense to leave. Why?

437
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,290
For a steamy night.

438
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,680
Steamy night...

439
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,050
Steamy night?

440
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,870
That was it?

441
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,960
That was it?

442
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,200
 - That was it!  
 - Where are you going, Brother?

443
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
Brother!

444
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,910
Oh, my gosh. Why... Why are you so strong?

445
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,030
That hurts!

446
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,200
No.

447
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,460
You can't do that with my Deputy CEO, Sa Wol.

448
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,020
What sort of nonsense are you spewing from the morning?

449
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,610
I solved the homework.

450
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,730
Night, Young Master, have the sense to leave...

451
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,720
I know our Deputy CEO is handsome, but you can't!

452
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,660
Because...

453
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,700
Because!

454
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,150
Hey. You're making a fuss all by yourself.

455
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,890
Why would you match me with that pale, weak-looking guy?

456
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:16,410
It's been said that 80% of the man is all about the body.

457
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,400
Body?

458
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,300
Oh, b-body?

459
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,280
What's with him?

460
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,610
Then, that's not it! What a relief!

461
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,150
What relief?

462
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:32,610
W-Why is that a relief? I-I just don't get what he's thinking.

463
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,790
Oh, that will be...

464
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,030
your homework as well.

465
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,830
That homework...

466
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,610
I don't have to solve it. Right?

467
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,950
Pardon?

468
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,380
Sa Wol!

469
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,590
April! 
  (Sawol means April in Korean)

470
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,550
I definitely gave you homework! Make sure to solve it!

471
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,330
It should be good for about five years.

472
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,840
All right, great work.

473
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,930
You take great care to get it restored every time.

474
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:13,220
It's not even worth that much to keep. I don't know why you care for it so much.

475
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,380
I'm sorry.

476
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,730
You don't want to make money?

477
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,800
No, no.

478
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,850
Then, enjoy looking at the painting.

479
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,350
I can't seem to fix this watch.

480
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,530
They say it's not broken.

481
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,680
It's strange.

482
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,820
Since it has always been like this, there's nothing we can do about it.

483
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,880
- Yeon Woo. 
 - Yes?

484
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,550
When you're done with your design, scan it with this, and give it to me as a PDF file.

485
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,890
I have to submit a draft.

486
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:30,690
Oh, but I don't know how to do that.

487
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,290
How does that make sense?

488
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,460
It is the most basic of tasks.

489
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,080
How are we going to cooperate like this?

490
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,690
- You don't know how to use a computer? 
 - No.

491
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,600
But I can do it once I learn it.

492
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,420
Forget it. Just hand over your design to Seok Joo when you're done.

493
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,440
All right.

494
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,190
Hey, Mourning Clothes.

495
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,000
So, how's the work?

496
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,040
It's not bad.

497
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,590
Hey, give it to me!

498
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Should I help you?

499
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,990
Nothing happened with Yeon Woo yesterday. Right?

500
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,740
You seemed really angry after the company dinner, Deputy CEO.

501
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,390
Me?

502
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,640
No, what would I get mad about?

503
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,740
Ms. Yeon Woo!

504
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,750
I guess it wasn't her.

505
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,410
 Try going there for now!

506
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,040
 Try going there. Just go that way.

507
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,420
You can't. You're at work!

508
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,020
I'm sure you're worried about Yeon Woo, but many people are watching.

509
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,820
It's because of Tae Min, not Park Yeon Woo.

510
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,630
Gosh, that's the same thing.

511
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,960
You were so antsy because of Manager Do last night, too.

512
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,660
It's okay.

513
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,660
When you live in the same house, it's natural to grow affectionate and start liking her.

514
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,830
And Yeon Woo is very charming, after all.

515
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,520
I don't understand what you're saying at all.

516
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Just bring me the checked list of VIPs to invite to the event.

517
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,360
What is this confusing feeling?

518
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,320
Am I off?

519
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,180
Let go of my hand while we're walking!

520
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,820
Hello.

521
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,700
I'm an employee of the marketing team. Can I ask you something?

522
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,930
Yes.

523
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,470
You don't usually wear a hanbok normally. Right?

524
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,860
Why do you think that is the case?

525
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,930
Well, probably because it's uncomfortable. Right?

526
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,560
And the design is usually the same, and it's hard to wash.

527
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,500
It's really not cost-effective.

528
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,510
Then, what if there's a hanbok that is comfortable and easy to wash?

529
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,890
That would be good.

530
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,710
That would be so great. I never even thought of that.

531
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,210
Hanbok. What do you think about hanbok?

532
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,130
Isn't it too uncomfortable?

533
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,680
Even the order to put them on is difficult.

534
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,870
Yeah, and it's too hot in the summer.

535
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,960
Jeans. Couldn't you wear jeans and sneakers with a hanbok?

536
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,580
If they go well together, I guess.

537
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,420
But could they possibly go well together?

538
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,010
How about if the top is short-sleeved or the dress comes down to the knees?

539
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,500
Would that be okay?

540
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,260
Why not? I think that wouldn't be so bad.

541
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,130
Really?

542
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,650
Don't you think it will be okay?

543
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,910
Thanks to you, I learned a lot.

544
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,750
Hey, thanking me with only words?

545
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,490
You should pay me for my efforts.

546
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,840
You know, like a date.

547
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,550
Date...

548
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,790
Is that something you eat?

549
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,120
Wow, that's such a new way of setting boundaries.

550
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,460
What a surprise.

551
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,830
I didn't think you'd come into the company.

552
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,430
Lots of people are watching. You should stop.

553
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,320
Regardless of what Tae Ha promised you,

554
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,050
you are just a pawn he can throw away at any point.

555
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,250
- Did you know that? 
 - I said, stop it!

556
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,580
A pawn just has to fight as long as it needs to before withdrawing.

557
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,170
I know that well, so don't worry.

558
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,760
You think we're letting you be because we don't know anything?

559
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,870
Should I scream like a madman?

560
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,990
Go, Mourning Clothes.

561
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,240
I said, go!

562
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,350
What are you doing with her?

563
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,510
I'm not doing anything yet.

564
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,520
She's just a weird girl, but she keeps catching my eye.

565
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,370
And it's fun when I'm with her.

566
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,540
So, I'm looking into why that is the case.

567
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,940
- Kang Tae Min! 
 - Is it the annual general meeting soon?

568
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,000
Who knows if I may be of help to you?

569
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,710
In the end, your target is Kang Tae Ha.

570
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,110
So I'm telling you not to mess with me or that girl.

571
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,160
No way.

572
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,850
I like that princess?

573
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,790
No, no. No way. There's no way—

574
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,430

575
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,000
I must be out of my mind! Why did I come here!

576
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,550
Gosh, you scared me!

577
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:42,210
Why did you suddenly scream, Deputy CEO?

578
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,990
What's wrong?

579
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,390
Is something wrong?

580
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,130
Oh, the thing is...

581
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,730
Yeon Woo.

582
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,710
The fabric sample is here. Let's go check it out.

583
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,150
Right now? Okay.

584
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,800
All right, then.

585
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,140
- They came out nicely. 
 - Really? That's good.

586
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,350
Separate a bit while you walk!

587
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,460
Deputy CEO, Chairman is looking for you.

588
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,470
Yes.

589
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,840
Thank you.

590
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,320
Hey, Sa Wol.

591
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,760
By chance, did you do the homework?

592
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,430
Gosh, that darned homework...

593
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,190
If you drink all of this,

594
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,530
I'll solve it then.

595
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,180
No.

596
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,050
If I drink all this, today is our day one together.

597
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,750
Secretary Hong, when did you come?

598
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,500
H-Hey, Sa Wol! Sa Wol!

599
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,550
Secretary Hong! Secretary Hong, you know it. Right?

600
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,800
Yeon Woo's identity. Is that tabloid news true?

601
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,150
Yes, I know it very well.

602
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,200
What?

603
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,570
 The Italian Mafia?

604
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,460
 In other words, she's the Godfather.

605
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,290
God... father?

606
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,140
Did I call you in when you're busy?

607
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,980
I should come if you call for me, even if I'm busy, Grandfather.

608
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,240
Is something wrong?

609
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:48,430
Well, Director Choi will suggest making you the CEO of SH Seoul at this general meeting.

610
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,000
- Director Choi? 
 - Yeah.

611
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,640
That would look the best.

612
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,980
Also, how about you remove Yeon Woo from this first-anniversary event?

613
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,190
Midam will handle the design.

614
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,760
I think you're putting too much pressure on Yeon Woo.

615
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,580
Well...

616
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,140
I think it will be all right.

617
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,970
It was Midam's condition, and Yeon Woo likes her work.

618
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,720
Don't worry.

619
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,940
Is that so? I'm like this because I have more worries as I grow older.

620
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,150
You must be tired. Please go in and rest.

621
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,940
No, no. Let's walk a bit more.

622
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,410
I still have things to talk to you about. Let's go.

623
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,060
Will you be able to enter this annex now?

624
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,190
I trust you to overcome whatever difficulties and hardships you face,

625
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,970
but I know you won't be able to as long as CEO Min is around.

626
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,470
It's fine. Take your time.

627
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,730
In return, until SH is in your hands,

628
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,040
don't show even the smallest weakness to CEO Min.

629
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,960
That is why I'm worried about you and Yeon Woo.

630
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,530
I'm sorry that I make you worry.

631
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,270
There's no need to be sorry. You're my child.

632
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,470
Just know that.

633
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,150
 Help! Is anyone there?

634
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,060
 Help! Help!

635
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,640
Tae Ha! Tae Ha! Tae Ha...

636
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,770
♫  One day I had a dream  ♫

637
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:16,430
♫  I woke up and was in a daze for a long time  ♫

638
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:23,070
♫  I sat there helplessly for a while  ♫

639
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,470
​♫  and thought of your face  ♫

640
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:37,330
♫  I'll think I'm dreaming for a moment  ♫

641
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,870

Don't worry.

642
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:43,200
I won't sleep until I'm done with all this.

643
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:52,160
♫  I'll hold on to the moments we had together  ♫

644
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,400
♫  As if nothing had happened  ♫

645
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,900
♫  Come by my side at any time  ♫

646
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,580
What do you think, Manager Do?

647
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,550
Not only is the design sensible,

648
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:14,040
but the flowers and knots that will be woven into the fabric are quite impressive.

649
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,740
Honestly, I like it very much.

650
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:26,440
Park Yeon Woo, does this knot have a special meaning?

651
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,950
This knot is me...

652
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,990
and us.

653
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,310
I believe that the threads of people's lives intertwine and

654
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,880
and produce a single knot.

655
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,180
I wanted to create clothes with this knot that represents such a beautiful connection.

656
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,330
Clothes of connection.

657
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:55,200
How about we make that our main concept?

658
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,980
The connection between SH and Midam.

659
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,810
Our destiny with our customers who will wear our clothes. What do you think?

660
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,240
I think it's great.

661
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,690
I think we can use what Yeon Woo said as our tagline.

662
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,260
Then, let's use this for our briefing at this board meeting.

663
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,520
Yoo Ha Na, please prepare for that.

664
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,630
Okay.

665
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,740
Thank you.

666
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,240
Tell Team Leader Oh if you need anything,

667
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,840
and please take good care of our first-anniversary event.

668
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,180
Yes, got it.

669
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,100
But will it really be okay

670
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,850
for you to entrust me with such a major event?

671
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,430
I mean, I'm confident in making clothes,

672
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,870
but I don't know if I can do a good job since I came from Joseon.

673
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,760
Should I pull you from the team, then?

674
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,190
N-No, that's not what I mean!

675
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,920
I don't want that! I refuse!

676
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,340
No matter where you are, you are the one who makes the clothes.

677
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,700
As long as you don't forget that, I am sure you will do well.

678
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,910
 If you remember who you are in your heart,

679
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,200
 no matter where you are and what you become,

680
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:17,500
 the fact that you made such beautiful clothes will not change, Maiden.

681
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,110
 I am sure you will fly to and land where you want.

682
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,580
Na Rae, it's me.

683
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,070
You know the norigae you found for me last time?

684
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,150
I want to ask you a favor regarding that.

685
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,900
Drink up. It's one of my favorites.

686
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,240
It smells nice.

687
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,810
It's worth its value.

688
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:11,420
I just have to throw it away if it isn't worth its value.

689
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,830
What about you?

690
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,380
I'm talking about your value.

691
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:22,140
It should be enough to have SH.

692
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,560
You're wrong.

693
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,190
Helping Tae Ha is your job.

694
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:31,560
Prepare well for this board briefing session...

695
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,810
by Tae Ha's side.

696
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,600
You want me to just serve as his sidekick?

697
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,240
Just like when I married Jung Hoon?

698
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,520
You're the one who wanted Jung Hoon.

699
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,130
All I did was grant what you asked of me.

700
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,470
Is that so?

701
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,740
I guess I didn't know that.

702
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,990
Now that I smell it,

703
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,860
it's terrible.

704
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,800
You should rest.

705
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,930
 How long—

706
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:50,200
 How long will you hold onto a dead person?

707
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,400
 What am I to you?

708
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,580
 I asked what I am to you!

709
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,970

710
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,970

711
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,980
 It appears they set it off after attaching it to the interior of the tires and the wheel.

712
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,520
Do you think it was CEO Min?

713
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,910
It means she will do whatever it takes now.

714
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,440
Won't this become dangerous for Yeon Woo as well?

715
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:14,330
I'll have to make sure CEO Min can't easily mess with her.

716
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:15,530
How?

717
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:21,230
When there are many people watching, CEO Min won't be able to act rashly, either.

718
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,000

719
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,170
This first-anniversary event will be a collaboration between SH Seoul and Midam.

720
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:51,340
We wish to show the whole world

721
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,160
the traditions and aesthetics unique to the hanbok.

722
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,690
That is why the vision we have chosen is...

723
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,890
"Connection."

724
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,670
Why did he tell me to wait here?

725
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,860
Yeon Woo, you've waited a long time. Right? This way.

726
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:34,730
Now, CEO Min Hye Sook will give us a concluding message.

727
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:38,830
You should stay seated. I'll handle it.

728
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:52,720
We have clearly seen SH's new vision here today.

729
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,190
From now on, SH must...

730
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,130
throw away the old...

731
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,410
and enter the future into a new age.

732
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,020
That is my will and that of Deputy CEO Kang,

733
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:12,350
and I believe that is what the executives of SH want.

734
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,880
It's all done. You just have to take credit now.

735
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,620
Thank you, Chairman, for your words.

736
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:39,350
Finally, I want to use this opportunity to introduce a few people.

737
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,630
They will be handling the special exhibit for this first-anniversary event.

738
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:52,350
CEO Lee Mi Dam of Midam.

739
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,200
Manager Do Yoon Jae.

740
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,020
And...

741
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,670
 I've never seen her before.

742
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,560
Designer...

743
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,610
and my wife, Park Yeon Woo.

744
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,100
 Wife?

745
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,860
Gosh, why are you following us out?

746
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,210
Hurry up and get back to work.

747
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,420
I will explain to you about today separately.

748
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,730
Hey, am I a separated rice soup? 
  (When rice and soup are served separately)

749
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,560
Why would you explain to me separately?

750
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,970
It's fine. Forget it.

751
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,610
Hey, Director Choi, let's go.

752
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,880
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

753
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,850
I guess Tae Ha cares about Yeon Woo a lot.

754
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:20,960
Too bad for Father.

755
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,910
Wait! Are you saying Deputy CEO Kang likes Park Yeon Woo?

756
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:28,140
Though it's just a contract marriage?

757
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,750
How did he end up falling in love?

758
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,270
I should encourage that feeling.

759
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,420
I'm glad it looks like the first-anniversary event will go without a hitch, Chairman.

760
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:55,690
But I really had no idea that the designer was your granddaughter-in-law.

761
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,740
You've grown quite old, too.

762
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,900
You talk too much.

763
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,120
Pardon? I didn't mean to—

764
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,820
Have a safe trip home, Chairman.

765
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,260
- What's with you? 
 - No, what's with you, Trickster Guy?

766
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,530
Why did you announce that there without consulting me? Why?

767
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:31,350
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance, but that was the best way.

768
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,920
The best for what?

769
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,550
What if people find out we have a contract marriage, and this becomes a problem?

770
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:40,870
I already told you I don't want you to face harm because of me!

771
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,940
I feel the same way. I did that because I didn't want you to suffer because of me.

772
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,850
How would I suffer?

773
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,160
Did you forget that I said CEO Min is dangerous?

774
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,820
If everyone finds out you're my wife, she can't do anything to you.

775
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,120
This was the only way I could protect you.

776
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,700
Then, why didn't you say so sooner?

777
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,650
Look at you making a fuss now. How could I have told you?

778
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,930
In any case, you should consult me first from now on!

779
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,520
Everything, from the first to the last!

780
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,020
What you said was true, Yeon Woo.

781
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,690
They said the norigae turned black because of poison.

782
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,590
It was arsenic.

783
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:46,750
Na Rae, I would like to keep this between us.

784
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,280
Don't worry about that.

785
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,400
I have to go now because of my part-time job.

786
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,070
Thank you for helping me.

787
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,680
This is also a part-time job for me.

788
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,030
I'll see you next time.

789
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,690
Someone tried to kill...

790
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,620
my husband?

791
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,530
Cheon Myeong.

792
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,500
It's been a while, My Lady.

793
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,610
Is it you?

794
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,620
You sent me to this place. Right?

795
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:22,260
That is true and false at the same time.

796
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,130
Why? Why did you do this?

797
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:29,000
You must find the answer to that, My Lady...

798
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,530
if you want to return home.

799
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,810
I can return?

800
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:35,320
How? What must I do?

801
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,100
The start of a connection is decided by fate,

802
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,630
but its end is decided by humans.

803
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:12,510
Just like that knot, bring an end to the repeated intertwining connection.

804
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:16,080
Then, you will be able to see the answer.

805
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,880
Also...

806
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,980
 The end of a repeated connection?

807
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,440
Park Yeon Woo?

808
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:43,700
She looks like CEO Min's secretary.

809
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,720
Team Leader Oh.

810
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,820
Is Park Yeon Woo, I mean, the Deputy CEO's wife in the office?

811
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,070
- Yeon Woo? 
 - Yes.

812
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,890
She just went somewhere with Secretary Choi.

813
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:56,100
S-Secretary Choi? CEO Min's Secretary Choi?

814
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,510
Yes.

815
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,300
Wait. But...

816
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,750
is Yeon Woo really the Deputy CEO's wife?

817
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,290
Oh... yes.

818
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:14,890
Wow, our team was the gathering place for the royal family.

819
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:30,780
- Yes. 
  - Deputy CEO, Ms. Yeon Woo is at your family estate's annex.

820
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,800
The annex...

821
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,670
Okay.

822
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,120
She said to wait here?

823
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:53,000
Yes. The CEO will arrive soon if you wait inside.

824
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,480
All right.

825
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,010
Great work.

826
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,920
No, just watch.

827
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,810
Kang Tae Ha.

828
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:21,050
I wonder how far he can go.

829
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:53,850
Yeon Woo!

830
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,260
Are you all right? Were you hurt?

831
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,230
Tae Ha.

832
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,010
Are you all right?

833
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,830
Let's leave first. Let's go out and—

834
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,350
What's wrong? Are you unable to breathe?

835
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,870
Please...

836
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:32,960
You will soon see the true nature of fate repeating itself.

837
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,570
 My name is Tae Ha.

838
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,700
 Kang Tae Ha.

839
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,070
 I am Kang Tae Ha.

840
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,980
 I had a severe heart ailment from a young age.

841
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,880
 So, I did not consider marriage at all.

842
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:54,310

843
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,940
 If you remember who you are in your heart...

844
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,810
 As long as you don't forget that...

845
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:01,450
 No matter where you are...

846
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,960
 I am sure...

847
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:16,800
♫  You are trying to come to me again  ♫

848
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:23,630
♫  I pretend not to notice and turn around. Even when I turn my head  ♫

849
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:29,700
♫  The tears blur like cloudy rainwater  ♫

850
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:37,240
♫  I couldn't forget you today, either  ♫

851
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,100
 It was you, Dear Husband.

852
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,540
 That is why I'm worried that our fate will repeat itself.

853
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,420
 Why? You think there might be poison in it?

854
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,140
 What's wrong with this?

855
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,740
 There is a problem with Yeon Woo's design?

856
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,830
 Go without my design. The show is more important than me.

857
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:54,740
 Stop working on the first-anniversary event.

858
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:57,970
 Neither Yeon Woo nor I will give up on the first-anniversary event.

859
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:01,620
 Tae Ha started going against Father's wishes.

860
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,530
 Please help me.

861
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:05,670
 Did you do that because of me?

862
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,840
 Don't listen to what other people say.

863
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,760
 Because you belong to me, Yeon Woo.

864
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:16,000
 Everything, including me being here, feels like a dream.
