1
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,390

2
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,220
 I feel so bad for her. Oh, my god!

3
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,660
Goodness.

4
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,330
Goodness, My Lady...

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,620
Goodness, Madam...

6
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,860
Let go of me.

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,920
Let go of me!

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,050
She is not our Yeon Woo.

9
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,320
I must check for myself!

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,740
They say her face is so messed up that you cannot recognize her.

11
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,700
I would know if I saw her!

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,780
Because I am her mother...

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,550
I would know if I saw her.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,700
Our Yeon Woo is not the type of girl who would die such a futile death.

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,130
Please, please, please!

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,360
Please let me at least check her face!

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,890
Dear Wife.

18
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,340
- Please! 
 - Dear Wife!

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,530
There is no way!

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,570
It is not Yeon Woo! It is not her!

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,890
- Wife... 
 - It is not Yeon Woo...

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,250
It is not Yeon Woo...

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,450
Yeon Woo...

24
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,800
Yeon Woo...

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,480
Yeon Woo, my baby...

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,550
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo.

27
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,470
Dear Wife!

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,390
Are you all right? Dear Wife!

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,440
Yeon Woo.

30
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,830
Yeon Woo.

31
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,750
Yeon Woo.

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,600
Dear Wife! Wake up, Dear Wife!

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,590
Dear Wife!

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,100
Dear Wife...

35
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,240
Yeon Woo died as a Loyal Wife? There is no way.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,680
Something definitely happened.

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,560
I will make sure to find out who did this to you and—

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,410
Mother...

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,760
Father...

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:23,260

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,860
- My Lady! 
 - Ms. Yeon Woo!

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,180
My Lady!

43
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,350
Yeon Woo.

44
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,210
Yeon Woo.

45
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,420

46
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,520
Please leave.

47
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,970
- Sa Wol. 
 - Your family...

48
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,660
tried to kill My Lady, Young Master.

49
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,340
How dare you think you can come here?

50
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,190
Leave.

51
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,680
I said, leave!

52
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,450
Can't you hear me? I said to leave!

53
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,570
- Hey, Sa Wol. 
 - Leave!

54
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,150
Sa Wol, what is wrong?

55
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,810
Why do you think the Kang family received a memorial headstone for a loyal wife?

56
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,390
Why? Why?

57
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,020
Stop doing this and let's go out together.

58
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,830
Hurry.

59
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,410
There is no worse ill-fated relationship than this.

60
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,300
So, the Deputy CEO's family killed Ms. Yeon Woo 200 years ago

61
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,070
and received a memorial headstone for a Loyal Wife?

62
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,560
Evil bastards.

63
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,400
Inhumane bastards.

64
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,540
How could a person...

65
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,770
Don't cry, Sa Wol.

66
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,690
My Lady...

67
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,400
I feel so sorry for her.

68
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,570
What is going on here?

69
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,850
 Your family tried to kill her, Young Master.

70
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,020
Are you awake?

71
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,420
This embroidered cloth was passed down through my mother's family.

72
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,940
It is about 200 years old.

73
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,420
I had made this...

74
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,950
for my mother before my wedding.

75
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,590
I had my doubts...

76
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,550
but the butterfly from the letter and the diary was really you, Yeon Woo.

77
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,890
Diary?

78
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,370
Actually, I came because of this.

79
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,300
Originally, the diary was only filled in up until your wedding,

80
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,820
but today, new content appeared after it.

81
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,140

82
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,530
Are you saying that words filled the diary by itself?

83
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,430
That's right.

84
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,320
 The Kang family received government positions, thanks to the memorial headstone for a Loyal Wife.

85
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,180
 It is clear that woman, Madam Yoon, did something evil to Yeon Woo.

86
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,910
What I saw was true...

87
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,010
Mother...

88
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,040
Father...

89
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,170
It's okay.

90
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,810
It's all right.

91
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,080
The two of them died because of me.

92
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,510
At first,

93
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,470
I thought everything was a coincidence.

94
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,590
How my husband passed away,

95
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,560
and how I was kidnapped and thrown into the well.

96
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,430
However, that was not true.

97
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,150
Both my husband and I were killed for the memorial headstone.

98
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,970
What do you mean by that?

99
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,940
My husband was poisoned to death...

100
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,590
by his stepmother, Madam Yoon.

101
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,330
Stepmother...

102
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,580
By chance...

103
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,370
The current CEO Min is Madam Yoon.

104
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,680
However,

105
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,870
I did not know my parents would end up like that...

106
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,710
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,480
I am just...

108
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,820
sorry for everything.

109
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,360
It isn't our fault.

110
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,530
We are just stuck with a wretched fate.

111
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,350
Who are you?

112
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,250
Is that important?

113
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,090
I'm sure you are curious about something else.

114
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,090
 This is arsenic.

115
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,700
 Who would suspect anything when a child with a heart condition suddenly dies?

116
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,890
 This is the only way for me to get what I want.

117
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,110
Why are you showing me such a vision?

118
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,880
Because it is my past life?

119
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,700
What does that have to do with Yeon Woo and me?

120
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,120
What do you want?

121
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,370
I don't want anything.

122
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,520
But one thing is for sure.

123
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,840
If you stay with Lady, you will end up like your past life—

124
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,940
I will end up dead like in my past life?

125
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,400
Because it is a repeating fate?

126
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,880
If my heart suddenly got worse because of that fate,

127
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,630
that's a relief.

128
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,450
At least I'm getting punished.

129
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,230
So you are saying it's fine if you die?

130
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,410
If that is best for Yeon Woo,

131
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,500
I will do so to protect her.

132
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,050
Nowadays, noodles like this are everywhere.

133
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,580
But I wonder why it was so rare in the past.

134
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,400
That's why we only got to eat this during a celebration.

135
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,730
The broth for this is clean and tasty.

136
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,810
Say what you want to say instead of beating about the bush.

137
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,960
Let's see. When was it again?

138
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,120
The noodles I ate on the day Yoon Hee died and President Min...

139
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,120
The noodles I ate after your father's burial were good, too.

140
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,740
What are you doing right now?

141
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,430
You should leave my house and my company now.

142
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,540
Your childish threats won't work on me, Father.

143
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,190
It will be better for you to leave as soon as possible.

144
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,790
If you understand what I am saying, wrap things up and leave now.

145
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,750
If you want to protect your amazing company, you should get rid of your grandson first.

146
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,580
If Tae Ha becomes CEO and then dies,

147
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,630
it will pass into the hands of a management specialist.

148
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,680
Thanks for your advice.

149
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,010
I asked him to bring me here.

150
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,990
I was worried that Sis was not eating well.

151
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,140
And I didn't want to stay longer in that wretched Kang family's home.

152
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
I guess I am...

153
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,460
sorry for yesterday.

154
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,750
It's okay. Thank you for coming.

155
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,950
Yeon Woo will be happy you're here.

156
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,390
What is Sis doing?

157
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,780
She should be resting in her room.

158
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,800
I should make some food for her to eat.

159
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,170
I brought her because she made such a fuss, but don't worry.

160
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,330
I will make sure to take Sa Wol back.

161
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,100
Thank you.

162
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,340
Oh, and please cancel my entire schedule for today.

163
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,240
I've got a bad feeling.

164
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,910
It feels like the quiet before a storm.

165
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,580
Why? Is a typhoon coming?

166
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,510
I'm talking about the Deputy CEO.

167
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,400
He revealed his heart ailment and

168
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,540
even made a controversial statement about management specialists and whatnot,

169
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,340
but he didn't come in to work today.

170
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,230
I also couldn't get in contact with Yeon Woo.

171
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,170
I need to talk to her about the pop-up store.

172
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,110
Something smells fishy about this.

173
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,890
What will you do now?

174
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,420
I heard that Chairman Kang is adamant

175
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,980
about kicking you out, CEO.

176
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,430
It's fine. I expected this.

177
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,600
Still, it seems a bit more serious than usual this time.

178
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,440
So, you have the next card for this. Right?

179
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,450
Are you serious right now?

180
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,070
You should have prepared a plan!

181
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,060
What do I know? I only do what you tell me to do faithfully, CEO—

182
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,240
Director Hwang Myeong Soo!

183
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm sorry.

184
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,500
Gosh, Kang Tae Ha, that bastard.

185
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,720
He has such a bad heart, yet he doesn't collapse!

186
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,420
But you know the medication that Kang Tae Ha takes?

187
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,360
I heard that medication prevents heart failure, too.

188
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,660
If we can just get rid of his medication, he'd be a dead man walking.

189
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,790
That's enough. You may leave.

190
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,430
Oh, okay. Got it.

191
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,390

192
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,560
It really says Yeon Woo on the memorial headstone of a Loyal Wife.

193
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,550
It's not like it's Romeo and Juliet.

194
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,820
But about the diary.

195
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,630
Isn't it a bit weird?

196
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,280
In the documents I found, Ms.Yeon Woo and her parents all died without any issues.

197
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,970
The history probably changed.

198
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,830
Pardon?

199
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,640
Because Yeon Woo and I...

200
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,870
figured out the hidden truth.

201
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,410
What do we do now, then?

202
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,580
I will find a way to put things back where they belong.

203
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,990
That's why I came here.

204
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,300
I will make sure to drive out CEO Min at this upcoming general meeting.

205
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,040
Of course! Yes, you should.

206
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,420
Let's put everything back where it belongs now.

207
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,380
You and me, together.

208
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,570
After that, I will discuss transitioning to a management specialist system,

209
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,730
and when everything is resolved, I will also resign from the Deputy CEO position.

210
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,400
W-What did you say?

211
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,430
Resign?

212
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,290
I will think only about Yeon Woo and me now.

213
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,180
Y-You said you would end that contract marriage!

214
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,250
No, I will keep her by my side.

215
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,460
No matter what happens.

216
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,880
No. I can't allow you to be with Yeon Woo.

217
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,670
- Grandfather! 
 - You crazy bastard!

218
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,160
You will give up on the company for a measly girl?

219
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,440
Did Yeon Woo tell you to do this?

220
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,100
This has nothing to do with Yeon Woo.

221
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,100
I no longer have any reason to protect SH.

222
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,340
N-No reason to protect SH?

223
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,860
No reason?

224
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,430
Is that something you should say to your grandfather?

225
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,160
Do you know how I raised you after Jung Hoon and Yoon Hee died?

226
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,120
I no longer want anyone to get hurt because of needless greed.

227
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,840
I don't want to get caught up with the past and lose what is precious to me.

228
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,830
I will live the rest of my life feeling apologetic toward you, Grandfather.

229
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,700
Get out! Get out!

230
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,810
Leave this instant!

231
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,100
I'm sorry.

232
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,380
Sis!

233
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,960
I brought some pine nut porridge and salted pollack roe.

234
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,700
This was what you ate when you got sick.

235
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,800
Here. This salted pollack roe is different from what you ate in Joseon,

236
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
so try it.

237
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,070
It's good. Thanks.

238
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,290
From now on, I will always stay by your side, so don't worry—

239
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,930
It's fine. You don't have to do that.

240
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,500
I just need some time to think.

241
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,530
Okay. I understand.

242
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,940
In return, eat the rest of this porridge. Then I'll leave.

243
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,510
Okay. I'll do that.

244
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,640
Hey, April. Why are you back already?

245
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,480
I told you I'd come pick you up.

246
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,860
Lady told me to go home.

247
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
Ms. Yeon Woo said that?

248
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,890
Then, why do you look so sad?

249
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,470
Is something wrong?

250
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,390
I just felt so useless.

251
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,820
Lady is going through such a hard time like that,

252
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,460
and yet I can't do anything for her as her servant.

253
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,560
Who is a servant?

254
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,030
Sa Wol, you are no longer a servant.

255
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,180
You are just Sa Wol.

256
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,320
My lovely April.

257
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,200
Seong Pyo...

258
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Don't forget. There is only one servant now.

259
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,390
It's me.

260
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,370
Hong Seong Pyo.

261
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,050
Na Rae was here?

262
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,550
Na Rae was home...

263
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,480
This is what you call fooling around.

264
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,510
I'm going to work.

265
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,980
Bye.

266
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,990
So tasty.

267
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,340
 I pray today, too...

268
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,180
 that Yeon Woo does not give up.

269
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,420
 To protect herself in the midst of fear and pain.

270
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,340
 That is what I pray and hope for.

271
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,010
Yes, Mother.

272
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,840
I will make sure to do so.

273
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:46,900
I've never thought about what I wanted.

274
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,040
Grandfather's dream...

275
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,660
was always my dream.

276
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,990
It was the first time...

277
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,070
that I've dreamed of a different life.

278
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,550
If you don't like my house, you can run away.

279
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,600
I will chase after you, whatever it takes.

280
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,870
I won't ever...

281
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,010
I won't ever let you go, Yeon Woo.

282
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,370
I keep thinking about it.

283
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,930
Why...

284
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,500
Why did things end up like this?

285
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,860
But I realized that the reason wasn't important, but...

286
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,290
me, living in this current moment.

287
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,150
I won't lose to nor run away from fate.

288
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,820
And I will put everything back in its place.

289
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,710
You should do that with me now.

290
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,840
Goodness, when will you finish if you do it like this?

291
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,740
I'll take care of the sweeping. Go ahead and clean up the rest.

292
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,770
What are you doing? Give it to me. It's my job.

293
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,230
Gosh, I'm just paying for what I ate.

294
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,630
I should at least earn my keep since I live at your place.

295
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,990
Don't hate me too much, Na Rae.

296
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,780
I have no intention of stealing your brother from you.

297
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,130
W-What are you saying? Am I a school kid or something?

298
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,620
Why are you saying such a weird thing?

299
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,110
Honestly, I kind of hate you a little bit.

300
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,530
Since you are the one Seong Pyo cares about the most.

301
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,790
Then we're even, right?

302
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,670
So let's get along. Okay?

303
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,880
Kimchi fried rice.

304
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,380
Sorry?

305
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,390
W-What did you say?

306
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,370
I heard you're a good cook.

307
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,390
I like kimchi fried rice, so earn your keep with that.

308
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,610
What else do you like?

309
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,750
Tteokbokki.

310
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,060
I happen to be really good at making tteokbokki!

311
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,710
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

312
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,810
I like rosé tteokbokki.

313
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,340
Ro—

314
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,620
Whatever! How could you be so cute, Na Rae?

315
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,240
What did Grandfather say?

316
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,480
He was furious.

317
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,410
He may say something to you, too, Yeon Woo.

318
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,190
It's fine.

319
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,530
He only does that because he worries about you, Tae Ha.

320
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:09,190
Not only that but isn't your grandfather the most precious person to you?

321
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,060
Thank you.

322
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,460
Oh, and...

323
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,210
a person named Cheon Myeong appeared to me, too.

324
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,770
Really?

325
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,550
Did Cheon Myeong say anything?

326
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,650
 If you stay with Lady,

327
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,090
 you will end up like your past life—

328
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,420
 I will end up dead like my past life?

329
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,960
 Since it is a repeating fate?

330
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,470
She said to stay by your side, Yeon Woo.

331
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,930
No matter what happens.

332
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,240
Don't worry.

333
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,770
I won't just let things happen this time.

334
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,820
I will make sure to protect you.

335
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,430
Like a bodyguard?

336
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,830
Body...

337
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,790
What is that?

338
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,960
It's something really good for both your body and your heart.

339
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,420
I see.

340
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,980
Is it even better than Choco?

341
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,960
It may be.

342
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,490
T-Then, let's go right now and buy it. That "body," whatever.

343
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,830
Wait, Yeon Woo.

344
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,500
Wait!

345
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,440
Did you sleep well?

346
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,420
Hi, Aunt.

347
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,010
Gosh, it looks delicious.

348
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,700
Didn't you hear from your mother?

349
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,100
Pardon?

350
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,460
About what?

351
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,280
I'll let you and your mother move out.

352
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,250
Father, really?

353
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,480
Your mother will be leaving the company soon.

354
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,930
So, you should take care of your mother.

355
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,820
Go live outside of this house. That way, you'll learn the way of the world.

356
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,650
What is it?

357
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,170
Why?

358
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,320
Don't worry about it. We won't be leaving here.

359
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,730
Did you mess with Kang Tae Ha's heart ailment?

360
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,970
Is that why you told me to prepare to become Director and whatnot?

361
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,370
An owner's health is an important matter linked to a company's profits.

362
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,460
But it's an illness. He is sick!

363
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,540
How could you think to use that?

364
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,580
It was a necessary action for SH's sake.

365
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,580
And this is the result?

366
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,720
Grandfather has completely turned on us.

367
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,970
It's all over now.

368
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,790
We'll see if it's over or not.

369
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,510
There is no backing out now.

370
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,690
CEO Min!

371
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,410
Mom.

372
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,910
Is something wrong?

373
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,410
Why?

374
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,540
Do I look like a guy with a worry?

375
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,020
Is this more attractive?

376
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,230
A joke is only a joke if the person hearing it finds it funny.

377
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,780
You went back to Kang Tae Ha's home. Right?

378
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,950
You don't regret it?

379
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,680
Yes, I don't do stuff like that.

380
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,490
That's so like you, Mourning Clothes.

381
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,920
I always regretted being born into my family.

382
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,540
My brother was always better than me, and

383
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,900
my mom was so scary.

384
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,280
And my grandfather only cared about my brother.

385
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,970
I always wondered if it was okay for me to be in that family.

386
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,580
That's why I'm worried about you.

387
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,830
Afraid that you may get messed up like me.

388
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,530
But you're different.

389
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,470
You were always energetic and smiling.

390
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,850
Well, I guess I just liked that.

391
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,620
I was envious, too.

392
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,980
I guess that's why you kept catching my eye.

393
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,370
Why are you saying these things to me all of a sudden?

394
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,910
Is something really wrong?

395
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,120
I told you. I'm just worried about you.

396
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,580
Next time, if you're struggling or hurting,

397
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,440
just come to me. Okay?

398
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,050
Don't worry.

399
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,520
I will take care of my own business.

400
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,270
So firm in drawing the line.

401
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,100
Shall we get up now?

402
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,500
We should get to work now.

403
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,650
This isn't where you can just come and go as you please.

404
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,130
Grandfather told CEO Min and me to leave.

405
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,010
It doesn't matter to me,

406
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,400
but CEO Min will probably plot something else.

407
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,900
I'm just letting you know.

408
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,770
Why are you telling me?

409
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,130
Take care of Mourning Clothes yourself.

410
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,840
Grandfather and CEO Min would be willing to do anything for SH.

411
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,480
Leave her to me if she's too much of a burden.

412
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,750
Forget it. We'll take care of ourselves.

413
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,410
Gosh, so annoying.

414
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,630
Yes, CEO Lee.

415
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:59,300
About the US Congresswoman you talked about last time...

416
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,420
Get rid of CEO Min at this upcoming general meeting.

417
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,230
What do you mean, get rid of her?

418
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,280
Chairman, things got noisy due to Deputy CEO Kang,

419
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,860
and things have only just subsided.

420
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,290
And if you talk so lightly about firing the CEO...

421
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,890
All right. Got it.

422
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,120
Director Choi, get Director Go's resignation as well.

423
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,470
Chairman.

424
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:24,360
Go Heung Soon, Choi Joo Myeong, Kim Jin Ho, Oh Byeong Cheol.

425
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,780
Whose idea was it to make you guys Director, Managing Director, and Executive Director?

426
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,240
And yet you say what now?

427
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,860
I understand your wishes, Chairman.

428
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,280

429
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,100
Yes.

430
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,220
Tae Ha, where are you right now?

431
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,980
Where are you, Yeon Woo?

432
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,700
I am...

433
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,180
in front of our home.

434
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,410
Did you say home?

435
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,740
That's right.

436
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,010
In any case, work hard since you're still at work.

437
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,490
Is this our home?

438
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,730
Oh, about that...

439
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,510
I was just going to surprise you...

440
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,450
You didn't...

441
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,010
follow me, did you?

442
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,330
I know, right?

443
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:50,760
My feet keep following you around.

444
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,240
I guess I should teach your feet a lesson.

445
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,250
Now my lips are doing it, too. What do we do?

446
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,150
What else?

447
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,400
Teach them a lesson, too.

448
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,970
Secretary Hong, what are you doing here?

449
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,550
Oh, well...

450
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,480
the thing is...

451
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,050
I had something urgent to report, so I was waiting for you,

452
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,360
but you suddenly came in and started saying surprising and teaching a lesson and all—

453
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,620
Your mouth!

454
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,510
Please shut your mouth!

455
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,300
But I didn't see anything.

456
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,580
I don't know if that smooching sound came from the cheek, lips, or feet—

457
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,330
Your mouth!

458
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,460
Are you saying this guy is tailing us?

459
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,370
You were right, Deputy CEO.

460
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,390
CEO Min probably hired someone to tail Yeon Woo and me.

461
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,030
 That's probably how she found out about my heart ailment.

462
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,540
 Park Yeon Woo!

463
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,330
We must catch that guy.

464
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,510
Damn it. I should just beat that guy up!

465
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sa Wol.

466
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,460
At times like this, we should use our heads, not our fists.

467
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,390
- Head? 
 - Yup.

468
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,820
Headbutting?

469
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,880
Then, I should crack open his skull by headbutting him!

470
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,100
Sa Wol, that's not it.

471
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,510
Using my head... that's not it?

472
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,850
Identify this man first.

473
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,600
Don't worry about that.

474
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,490
I have a plan.

475
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:10,900
Seong Pyo, it feels like we're the protagonists of a movie doing something like this.

476
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,280
I'll be right back. So, stay put.

477
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,830
Okay.

478
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,940
He's so cool.

479
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,970
Seong Pyo.

480
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,360
Seong Pyo!

481
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,240
Oh, my! Tae Min oppa!

482
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,150
You're Tae Min oppa. Right?

483
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,380
You've got the wrong person.

484
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,070
No, it's you, immature Tae Min oppa.

485
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,470
Gosh, it's not. Is it innocent Ji Seok Joo oppa?

486
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,380
Gosh, I said you've got the wrong guy.

487
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,580
I'm sure it's you. Tae Min oppa—

488
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,340
Seok Joo oppa. Tae Min oppa?

489
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,770
Seong Pyo?

490
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,220
Seong Pyo?

491
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,250
What was that!

492
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,440
Gosh, you're just so perfect!

493
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,540
That GP...

494
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,190
GP... GP machine. Did you attach it?

495
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,640
I attached the GP machine.

496
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,860
What's wrong? Are you nervous?

497
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,740
Yes.

498
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,450
This is my first customer.

499
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,110
Not only that, but she is a high-ranking official in a big country,

500
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,710
so I'm a bit nervous that I may make a mistake.

501
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,640
Don't worry.

502
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,230
The congresswoman is a really good person.

503
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,670
 Are you Master Ho Jeob?

504
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,470
 Spread it.

505
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,340
 Goodness!

506
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,210
Welcome!

507
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,920
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes, have you been well?

508
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,130
 Your Highness the Princess, you look so pretty.

509
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,410
Park Yeon Woo, we finally meet.

510
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,060
It's nice to meet you.

511
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,010
Yes, hello.

512
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,260
- Please take a seat. 
 - Okay.

513
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:01,100
My daughter kept begging me to get some of your clothes.

514
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,520
I fell in love after seeing them on social media.

515
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,040
The clothes were so pretty.

516
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,580
Thank you.

517
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,350
But have we met before?

518
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,130
You seem familiar.

519
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,980
I feel like we've met somewhere before.

520
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,690
Oh, my. You must have some connection with Yeon Woo.

521
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,840
I guess so.

522
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,800
So, what do we need to do first?

523
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,270
You would have to spread them.

524
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,670
In order to get your measurements.

525
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,950

526
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,790
A US Congresswoman is wearing Yeon Woo's clothes?

527
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,270
This is crazy. I have to hand it to her.

528
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,020
This will be good PR for Yeon Woo before her popup.

529
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,030
Ha Na will prepare for the interview with the congresswoman,

530
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,940
so Seok Joo and Tae Min, focus on the protocol.

531
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,270
I will handle the protocol for the congresswoman's daughter since I've got the looks.

532
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,380
Tae Min, please take care of the congresswoman.

533
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,000
What do you mean you got the looks?

534
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Are we picking the idol group center or something?

535
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,220
Gosh, I'm fine with everything, but am I not the looker of the group?

536
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,800
The idiot virus has spread already.

537
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,820

538
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,550
Hello?

539
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,890
 Where are you? Are you still at Midam?

540
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,950
Where are you, Tae Ha?

541
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,550
 Well, I'm home.

542
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,830
I see... Home?

543
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,700
Did you think I would fall for it twice?

544
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,580
Do you think I'm stupid?

545
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,710
How was it? Did the meeting with the congresswoman go well?

546
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,990
It was so darned good.

547
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,020
That I wanted to run around all over the place!

548
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,010
Really?

549
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,240
Then, could you go somewhere with me?

550
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,430
Where is this place?

551
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,330
You said you wanted to run around.

552
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,780
Run as much as you want.

553
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,590
It's soft!

554
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,020
Be careful!

555
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:40,960
♫  What should I do? My cheeks get hot the moment I see you  ♫

556
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,730
♫  My heart is shaking, can you hear my heart?  ♫

557
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:52,200
​♫  Your way of speaking is still unknown to me, but I still like it  ♫

558
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,230
♫  It feels like the whole world is in your eyes  ♫

559
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,490
It's been so long since I ran. It feels so darned good.

560
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,040
How does it feel to run?

561
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,740
I used to watch people run around here sometimes.

562
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,730
Thinking what sounds your heart would make when you run until you run out of breath.

563
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,920
Would it hurt? Would it feel good?

564
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,360
Thinking about stuff like that.

565
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,960
After you run, it's like this.

566
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,300
Right here goes thump, thump.

567
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,340
I'm not sure I get it.

568
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,690
Tell me again.

569
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:46,460
What if someone sees us?

570
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,710
No one's here.

571
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,890
We can just do this.

572
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,810
♫  The moment I hold your hand  ♫

573
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:03,480
♫  Everything that was heavy in front of me seems to become lighter  ♫

574
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,640
It's nice if this is how it feels to run.

575
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,320
Then,

576
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,210
I'll try running again.

577
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,650
- Okay. 
 - This time...

578
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,970
at full speed.

579
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,100
What? At full speed?

580
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,490
W-Why are you laughing? I barely mustered up the courage to say that.

581
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,500
Are you upset with me?

582
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,990
I still don't get it.

583
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,940
What don't you get?

584
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,400
A US congresswoman?

585
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,490
Tae Ha managed to get such a connection?

586
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,530
Yes. She is a US congresswoman who is ethnically Korean.

587
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,620
It appears CEO Lee Mi Dam connected them.

588
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,910
Everything that Lee Mi Dam does is so annoying.

589
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,630
I think so, too.

590
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,540
In any case, what do we do?

591
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,940
I don't think we should leave Kang Tae Ha like this.

592
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,300
Excuse me, CEO?

593
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,470
We can't leave things like this.

594
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:13,480
I must definitively take care of Tae Ha, so he can't do anything.

595
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,860
No matter what it takes.

596
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,790
You said, no matter what it takes. Right?

597
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,290
Ha Na, you're prepared for the interview with the congresswoman. Right?

598
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,520
Yes, should I print it out and give it to you?

599
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,110
I'm sure you did a great job, Ha Na.

600
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,160
I have to go to a department head meeting right now,

601
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,650
so please deliver it to Yeon Woo for me, Ha Na.

602
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,820
Yeon Woo will be here soon. I'll leave you to it.

603
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,760
This is the interview content we received beforehand.

604
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,340
You'll just need to read it.

605
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,450
Thank you.

606
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,270
But why did you ask to see me here?

607
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,350
The person who did that to your clothes at the first-anniversary event...

608
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,150
was me.

609
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,040
The design leak and the problem with the models. That was all me.

610
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,500
Pardon?

611
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,320
I wanted to be by Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha's side.

612
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,240
I worked hard, and I was confident I could do it.

613
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,610
Until you appeared, Park Yeon Woo.

614
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,700
Did you do that over mere jealousy?

615
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:34,120
It turns out a person's heart can turn into hell just over something like that.

616
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,450
I'm sorry about that.

617
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,410
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

618
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,650
You won't be seeing me like this any longer.

619
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,380
I will be quitting the company soon.

620
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,890
So you will run away like that?

621
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,320
Don't you feel bad for other people?

622
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,790
They had faith in you.

623
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,370
You were all on the same team.

624
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,710
Stay here and pay them back

625
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,360
doing everything you can, Ha Na.

626
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,700
Then, I will consider whether I will forgive you or not.

627
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:32,240
Please tell us what concept you had while designing the attire for the two of them.

628
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,350
The concept of this attire was something that would remind the Korean-American

629
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,910
Congresswoman of the hanbok she wore in her childhood—

630
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:40,100
Drink this first.

631
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,040
Thank you.

632
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,600
So she would be reminded of the hanbok she wore in her childhood—

633
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,330
Stop looking at the sheet and drink some juice.

634
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,290
Okay.

635
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,570
What are you doing?

636
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,050
Finally, you're looking at me.

637
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,240
Stop looking at that sheet and look at me.

638
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,210
I looked at you.

639
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,440
Are you good now?

640
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,790
No, I'm not good.

641
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,890
Why do you keep interrupting?

642
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,910
It would be good for us if I do well.

643
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,340
Grandfather will stop being angry, too.

644
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,950
It's okay. You are perfect as you are.

645
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,570
Your mere existence is just so lovely.

646
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:40,920
Is there a school in new Joseon that teaches you how to talk slick?

647
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,760
I do my work when it's time to work.

648
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,500
Stop bothering me and go over there.

649
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,440
Shoo! Shoo!

650
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,380
Come on, stop working!

651
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,550
Gosh, give it to me.

652
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:51,900
Come on, play with me! I'm bored.

653
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,390
- Go away! 
 - Gosh, play with me!

654
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:58,470
- Happy now? 
 - Too short. Do it longer.

655
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,750
What did you do? Do it longer because that was too short!

656
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,400
- I said go away! 
 - Do it one more time!

657
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,580
Come on, play with me.

658
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,430
Stop it!

659
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,720

660
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,410

661
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,730
Yes.

662
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,410
Team Leader, Deputy CEO will be arriving soon.

663
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,130
Okay.

664
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,130
Oh, Tae Min.

665
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,780
The water and snacks for the interview are ready. Right?

666
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,810
We can bring them in from the supply room later.

667
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,520
Okay.

668
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,410

669
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,440

670
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,210
What are you talking about?

671
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,450
What do you mean Tae Ha is done for?

672
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,830
It is exactly as I said.

673
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,510
As you wanted, I will take care of the Deputy CEO Kang.

674
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,080
So he can't do anything. Most definitively.

675
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,980
Welcome.

676
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,700
I feel like I've become gorgeous since wearing your clothes.

677
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,310
Thank you.

678
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,490
How do you do? I am Kang Tae Ha of SH Seoul.

679
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,240
Oh, I've heard so much about you.

680
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,330
You will be opening a New York branch soon. Right?

681
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,450
Yes. I will send you an invitation for our opening.

682
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,620
Okay.

683
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,520
Let's go.

684
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,560
- Mom. 
 - What?

685
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,580
That guy is so hot.

686
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,970
Totally my type.

687
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,030
Jennie, stop.

688
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,640
Where's your manners?

689
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,580
Shall we go?

690
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,970
- Shall we? 
 - Let's go.

691
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,070
 Hello.

692
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

693
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,510
Are you okay?

694
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,700
Hello. Hello.

695
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,450
You've heard the interview content already. Right?

696
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,930
Just answer comfortably.

697
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,300
We will also be taking pictures, so please relax and be natural.

698
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,380
Okay.

699
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,980
Then, we will start in 10 minutes.

700
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,400
Okay.

701
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,920
 - You looked it over, right? 
 - Yes.

702
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,730
 If there's any uncomfortable part, let me know.

703
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:25,900
 Yes, that's right.

704
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,460
 Are you okay?

705
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,590
 I'm nervous.

706
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,510
 You'll do just fine.

707
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,150
A drug should be given by a pharmacist.

708
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,670
You can't mix it in water.

709
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,920
That bastard!

710
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,450
Take care of? Take care of what?

711
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,780
Director Hwang.

712
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,450
Looks like you're in quite a shock

713
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,480
seeing me walk in perfectly fine.

714
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,270
If it's a drug that Hwang Myeong Soo gave him,

715
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,630
he will try to feed it to you.

716
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,560
Just like they did to my husband.

717
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,860
What do we do now?

718
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,390
We'll have to do as they want.

719
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,780
 Oh, I'm sorry.

720
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,430
What are you saying?

721
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:45,500
I guess we'll find out what I'm saying once the drug left in this syringe is analyzed.

722
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,250
Isn't that right, Director Hwang?

723
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,970
I-I'm really sorry.

724
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:56,290
CEO Min told me to take care of you, no matter what it takes.

725
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,000
What?

726
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,280
I'm really sorry. Forgive me just this once!

727
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,490
Everything you are saying is being recorded.

728
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,710
Will you still admit it?

729
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,890
Oh, yes. I admit it.

730
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:12,490
All I did was do what CEO Min told me to do.

731
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,660
Hwang Myeong Soo, are you crazy?

732
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,590
I don't know anything. I don't know anything about this.

733
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,000
How about you tell them at the police station?

734
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,540
Oh, right. I also filed an injunction against you for a suspension of duty as CEO,

735
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:30,180
so keep that in mind, CEO Min Hye Sook.

736
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,710
Hey, CEO.

737
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:56,020
When did I ever tell you to do that? When did I ever!

738
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,410
You said to do whatever it takes.

739
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,000
I thought that was what you meant.

740
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,300
Who the hell are you?

741
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,450
Crazy bastard.

742
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:21,470
Min Hye Sook is much weaker than expected.

743
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,370

744
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,340
 Oh, no... how could this be...

745
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,270
 I'm sorry. Get up!

746
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,780
 Let's hurry up and go...

747
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,300
 Let's go. Wake up...

748
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,540
 Chairman Kang...

749
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,560
 you're next, for real...

750
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,800
How did it go?

751
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,370
Everything's over now.

752
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,610
CEO Min...

753
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:27,530
will soon be summoned by the police.

754
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,890
That's a relief.

755
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:34,060
Then, everything will return to its rightful place.

756
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,030
Mother's diary, too...

757
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,190
and the past ill-fated connections will be broken.

758
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,950
They will.

759
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,790
What is it?

760
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,600
Should I tell you an interesting story?

761
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,240
Please stop.

762
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,420
If you committed a crime, receive your just due punishment.

763
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,180
Crime?

764
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,680
What did I do that was so wrong?

765
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:16,170
Have you already forgotten what you did 23 years ago at the annex?

766
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,950
Do you really...

767
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:24,730
Do you really think that I killed Seo Yoon Hee?

768
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,070
It's too bad.

769
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,900
That wasn't me.

770
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,660
The person who killed Seo Yoon Hee...

771
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,940
was your grandfather.

772
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,700
How could you say such a ridiculous thing?

773
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,810
The one who locked up your mom in the annex

774
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,710
and the one who made her die there

775
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,150
was all Chairman Kang.

776
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,300
Are you mad, Min Hye Sook?

777
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,200
Chairman Kang made a deal with your father...

778
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,880
to fix Seo Yoon Hee's heart ailment by marrying me.

779
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,030
Because he needed my father's company and me for SH!

780
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,810
In that room where there isn't even that much light,

781
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,520
 Seo Yoon Hee was there all by herself for several months.

782
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:30,080
And that day, you found out that your mother was locked up in the annex.

783
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,330
You were so little...

784
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,250
and you went to see your mom secretly.

785
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,850
That's when something happened.

786
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:49,690

787
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:03,880
 What do you mean? Lock the door?

788
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,530
 Yoon Hee's condition hasn't been good all day.

789
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,940
 What can we do? It's Chairman's order.

790
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,390
 Father...

791
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,310
 I can't do that.

792
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,890
 If we leave her like that, she may die.

793
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:19,430
 - It's Chairman's orders! 
 - Director!

794
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,760
 Don't you understand what that means?

795
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,440
You couldn't open the door from the inside if you locked it from the outside of that room.

796
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:46,350
Nobody could have imagined that you were in that room.

797
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,790
You were so young...

798
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,210
and banged on the door, asking for help.

799
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,820
 Help!

800
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,710
 Is anyone out there?

801
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,180
 Help!

802
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:07,830

803
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,750
 So are you saying she died or what?

804
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,400
 And then, he framed me for it.

805
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,340
 Since you saw my face, Tae Ha.

806
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:27,460
But still, I tried to help you!

807
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:33,200
You know very well how Chairman Kang raised you.

808
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:38,640
In his dead son's place, he had you in the palm of his hand and used you like a puppet.

809
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,740
Isn't that so?

810
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,100
Isn't that so?

811
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,170
No...

812
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:48,840
 Tae Ha, it is just you and me in this world.

813
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,490
 Mom...

814
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,770
 Dad...

815
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,820
 What can you do without me?

816
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:57,230
 Since we are on the same team.

817
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,820
No...

818
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:06,770
No...

819
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,140
It's me.

820
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:17,440
Looks like you need to take care of one more thing.

821
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:28,110
♫  Even if you are left alone in this place  ♫

822
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:36,410
♫  I hope it flows and takes you back to where you left  ♫

823
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:44,510
♫  If I set out on the road following those red flowers  ♫

824
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:51,200
♫  Will I be able to reach you?  ♫

825
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,850

826
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,800
 I want to know the truth.

827
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,900
 To be honest, I'm scared.

828
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,960
 I'm sure you're afraid, but don't run away.

829
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,790
 Because I'll be by your side.

830
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:06,620
 Please tell me. Grandfather!

831
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:09,990
 Do you think I would forgive that girl for making you this way?

832
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,860
 Don't you mess with her. I'll never forgive you if you do.

833
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:19,190
 If you stay here, Kang Tae Ha's heart will stop, Lady.

834
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,650
 To decide whether I'll go back or stay?

835
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:25,230
 CEO Min and Grandfather are both out of their minds. How could you do that?

836
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:29,550
 Now, I understand a little bit why I'm here.

837
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:33,600
 Don't worry. Everything will be okay.
