1
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,750

2
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:54,840

3
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,020

4
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,590
Ms. Ha Na, what time is it?

5
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,270
It is ten minutes to 8.

6
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,290
Gosh, I am so anxious.

7
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,200
My heart is bouncing just from the thought of seeing Kang Dro.

8
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,240
What are you doing, Mr. Lee Seok Joo?

9
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,920
Are you dating your phone?

10
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,900
Who is Kang Dro?

11
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,080
Don't you know?

12
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,280
Kang Dro. It's our Deputy CEO's nickname.

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,160
 The epitome of a cold heart.

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,440
 The king of logic and rationality.

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,590
 Put "Kang Tae Ha" and "android" together.

16
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,370
 Kang Dro!

17
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,870
Put that down very delicately.

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,890
- Right here? 
 - Yes.

19
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,630
- A little more delicatelyâ€” 
 - Team Leader!

20
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,130
Kang Dro.

21
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,690
Deputy CEO.

22
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,340
Welcome, Deputy CEO.

23
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,820
Whose work is this?

24
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,800
These sneakers are in collaboration with rising artist Monomal.

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,430
I do not understand.

26
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,010
On what grounds are you claiming to be "rising"?

27
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,350
The t-shirt collaborated with artist Monomal, sold out in the first five minutes of the sale.

28
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,610
He is the number one new artist selected by those in their 20s and 30s.

29
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,020
Then, why are they here?

30
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,330
The profit of the pop-up store in collaboration with the artist Monomal

31
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,520
increased 64.7 percent.

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,480
Also, considering the majority of the customers here are in their 20s and 30s,

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,090
these...

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
- should go here. 
 - Y-Yes, that is true.

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,750
Think about the customer needing more than brands.

36
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,100
The customers pay our salaries.

37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,400
With respect.

38
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,630
Well.

39
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,100
Let's all organize here.

40
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,180

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,980
What a childish old man.

42
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,700
His love for his grandson is too much.

43
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,520
When President Yoo hands you the drawing, check if it's real.

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,790
It's important.

45
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,730
Understood.

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,490
Thank you.

47
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,230
It wasn't easy finding that painting.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,380
You said the CEO's wife likes that painting.

49
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,120
If your mall opens up in New York,

50
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,040
I'm sure I'll get some crumbs off your table.

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,280
President, do you like that makgeolli that much? 
  (Rice wine)

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm just used to it.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
You can't change an old habit.

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,910
But at the shareholder's meeting, Chairman Kang said your oldest son, Kang Tae Ha,

55
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,330
is up for the position of the CEO of SH Seoul.

56
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,620
Tae Ha is still too young. You know this.

57
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,490
That's why there's a rumor they're trying to marry him off.

58
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,910
To a family with a lot of power and support.

59
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,110
Marriage is not something you do alone.

60
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,920
That will never happen.

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,940

62
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,200
CEO Min is in Busan?

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,370
Oh, yes. On the surface, she went to the SH Busan branch.

64
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,790
She probably went to look for a folk painting.

65
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,060
What is on my next schedule?

66
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,600
Well... that's...

67
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,180
The wedding.

68
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,600
Your wedding, Deputy CEO.

69
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,890
- Look, Mr. Kim. 
 - Yes.

70
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,070
Let me ask you something.

71
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,350
Think hard before you answer.

72
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,970
Yes.

73
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,200
What is... the rope used the most in the winter?

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,820
Goodness, Chairman. You're up for another riddle.

75
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,320
I wonder what. I don't know.

76
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,220
Come on now! It's tta-kkeun, tta-kken. 
  (It means "warm" but the word "kken" means rope)

77
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,300
- Tta-kkeun, tta-kken. 
 - You got it wrong!

78
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,450
- Pay up 1,000 won. 
 - 1,000 won?

79
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,810
You never mentioned such a thing.

80
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,290
Fine then! What persimmons do old bachelors like the most?

81
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,460
Dried persimmons. Is it sweet persimmons?

82
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,500
Saeksigam! A pretty bride! 
  ("Saeksigam" means bride material, "gam" means persimmon)

83
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,420
Pay up 2,000 won. All right, I won 2,000 won.

84
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,490
My goodness.

85
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,180
I've seen a lot of lowlives here and there.

86
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,860
I think Chairman Kang... will give the company over to that grandson, whatever it takes.

87
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,430
Pushing you over, CEO Min.

88
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,700
Hang on a minute.

89
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:08,800
Then... do we get left behind like lonely goose eggs separated from the flock?

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,740
Secretary Choi.

91
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,290
This is makgeolli made by a wine master.

92
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,220
Even old and used items can be replaced at any time.

93
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,780
When you put your mind to it.

94
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,990
Same with the chairman position.

95
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:35,030
Even if Father has chosen a successor, I will become the chairwoman of SH in the end.

96
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,420
Deputy CEO! Something terrible...

97
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,320
has... um... not happened. Right?

98
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,570

99
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,550
Since it is temporarily closed, no one should be here.

100
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,050
So the bride cannot be reached?

101
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,290
The wedding is at 2:30. Does this make sense?

102
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,350
Of course, it doesn't make sense.

103
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,650
But this is the case. I am sorry.

104
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,260
When was the last time you talked to the bride?

105
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,110
Well, I talked to her around 12:00 p.m.

106
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,480
I thought you said no one was here.

107
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,070
That's what they definitely said...

108
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,420
- But why... 
 - What are you doing?

109
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,170
First, go and bring her out.

110
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,740
Yes.

111
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,620
The only thing I didn't learn was to swim.

112
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,950
But I will try my best.

113
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,450
Here I go!

114
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,390
Gosh, my shoes...

115
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,610
W-Wait...

116
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,420
I will go in now.

117
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,760
My watch. My mother gave it to me as a gift.

118
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,990
Deputy CEO, I will go in now! I will!

119
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,000

120
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,230
What shall we do now?

121
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,850
Call an ambulance.

122
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,960
Do you think it will be okay?

123
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,630
The bride can't be reached, and a mishap like this.

124
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,630
Hey, there. Are you okay?

125
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,150
Dear Husband.

126
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,610
Dear Husband!

127
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,150
You were alive.

128
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,160
You were alive, Dear Husband.

129
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,870
Let go of me.

130
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,410
Are you okay?

131
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,920
Why are you looking at me like that?

132
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,980
Husband...

133
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,270
She is either crazy or hurt. One of the two.

134
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,690
Deputy CEO, are you annoyed right now?

135
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,520
Me?

136
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,060
No, I am not.

137
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,980
What is this?

138
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,360
Am I dreaming?

139
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,570
No, I definitely fell into a well...

140
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,230
 I am definitely not dreaming.

141
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,390
 Water? Waters of Forgetfulness?

142
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,980
I crossed the Waters of Forgetfulness?

143
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,590
Then... is this the afterlife?

144
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,960
It can't be!

145
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,210
No... No...

146
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,250
No! It's a lie!

147
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,800
- I think she's crazy and also hurt her head. 
 - Is this the afterlife?

148
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,630
No.

149
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,110
Husband looks odd, too.

150
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,640
The short hair and the clothes I've never seen before.

151
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,440
This is the afterlife?

152
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,160
Why am I?

153
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,560
She is definitely crazy!

154
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,580
- Why am I here? Why! 
 - Look away.

155
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,560
The chairman has arrived.

156
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,010
- Listen. 
 - Yes.

157
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,500
I think their cake is the tastiest. Let's have some before we go.

158
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,350
Shall we?

159
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,640
He's coming up after having dessert.

160
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,120
What do we do?

161
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,550
If the chairman knows, he'll be furious!

162
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,090
What if he faints?

163
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,900
Wait! Where do we even start?

164
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,180
First, the bride. N-N-No. The wedding.

165
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,960
Deputy CEO.

166
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,570
- Dear Husband. 
 - So...

167
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,770
You are saying I am your husband. Right?

168
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,840
Of course you are! How could you...

169
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,700
Do they erase your memory in the afterlife?

170
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,930
Afterlife...

171
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,020
Why do you keep doing this?

172
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,360
It is already difficult to fathom that I crossed the Waters of Forgetfulness at the tender age of 27.

173
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,520
Husband...

174
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,840
Move away from her!

175
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,260
- It's best to stay away from strange people! 
 - No!

176
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,900
I will take her to the hospital.

177
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,830
After the wedding.

178
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,270
Wedding?

179
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,430
You can't.

180
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,360
Not with a crazy woman.

181
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,010
Secretary Hong, did you forget why I'm going through with this marriage?

182
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,210

What?

183
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,350
What?

184
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,170
What did you say? Marry whom?

185
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,480
Vanessa?

186
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,940
Yes, she is an adoptee.

187
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,940
And if it is not with her, I will never get married.

188
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,100
You punk, are you threatening me right now?

189
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,830
What kind of nonsense is this?

190
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,750
Grandfather, you were the one who spoke nonsense first.

191
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,070
You threatened me, saying you'd not receive surgery if I didn't get married.

192
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,550
How much longer will I have to live anyway...

193
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,370
Hey, don't you understand that I want to leave the company to you?

194
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,110
To do so, you need in-laws with a lot of power to supportâ€”

195
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,200
I can do it all on my own without something like that.

196
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,880
So, Grandfather, please go to the US for the surgery as you promised.

197
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,770
All right?

198
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,280
Whatever! Whatever.

199
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,160
Grandfather.

200
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,980
I don't know.

201
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,050
Grandfather will receive surgery, no matter what.

202
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,450
Which is why I need that woman.

203
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,490
I know that, but her condition is a bit...

204
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,870
Then, should I reveal it? The real reason...

205
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,080
I cannot marry anyone.

206
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,620
Look. For me...

207
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,880
I really like cakes like this, where you can't tell what's inside.

208
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,620
Whether it'll be an apple or mango inside when you cut it.

209
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,320
Or if it'll be white cake or chocolate cake.

210
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,530
- When I cut this... 
 - Yes.

211
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,110
I get very excited.

212
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,000
It's fun to cut it, too.

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,870
Wow, look at that.

214
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,940
This is mine. Okay?

215
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,960
G-Gosh, Chairman.

216
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,610
Wow, very tasty.

217
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,260
My husband doesn't even remember me.

218
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,250
I want to go home...

219
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,560
I want to go home...

220
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,860
Do you want to go home?

221
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,680
Then, I will help you.

222
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,540
In return...

223
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,110
Could you... be my bride?

224
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,670
Mister, what kind of head covering is this?

225
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,930
Gosh, it is much too heavy and stuffy.

226
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,600
Do I have to go like this?

227
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,650
I can't see a thing!

228
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,880
No, you can't take it off!

229
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,510
Where do you think you're touching?

230
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,660
Is there no order of law or custom in the afterlife?

231
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,810
No, there is no such thing in this afterlife.

232
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,470
A man and a woman should be separate. How could you...

233
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,580
Let go! Let go!

234
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,700
Move aside.

235
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,930
Is it all prepared?

236
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,780
I brought my most efficient friends who used to work part-time at weddings with me.

237
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,910
Also, it's top secret that she's the Deputy CEO's bride.

238
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,110
Okay.

239
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,980
In return, double the pay.

240
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,650
Hello, Ms. Bride.

241
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,980
Wow, she is gorgeous.

242
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,480
I am Hong Na Rae.

243
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,380
I will be helping you from now on.

244
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,390
Thank you.

245
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,210
This is my first time dying, so I am not sure what to do.

246
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,110
First, you need to take your clothes off.

247
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,700
Excuse me?

248
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,190
W-W-What? My clothes?

249
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,970
- I can take them off. 
 - Please do not!

250
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,470
What are you doing?

251
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,750
Let go! What are you doing?

252
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,170
Please take off your clothes.

253
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,570
- Oh, no! Go away! 
 - Take off your clothes!

254
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,360
â™«  When I look at you for a while  â™«

255
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,580
â™«  All my thoughts disappear and it feels strange  â™«

256
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,730
â™«  I wanted to run away from this unfamiliar feeling  â™«

257
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,640
â™«  I feel like such a fool  â™«

258
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,620
Are you okay?

259
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,080
No. Were these shoes made for torture?

260
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,970
My feet hurt so much.

261
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,470
It is difficult to even stand.

262
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,730
The dress is so beautiful.

263
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,770
Although it is much too tight and embarrassing that I do not have a top jacket.

264
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,180
We should go. It's time.

265
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,110
How can I go wearing those?

266
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,740
But they are waiting outside.

267
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,280
Wait? Who is...

268
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,760
By chance, are you speaking of the Jade Emperor?

269
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,820
Maybe more like the god of the underworld.

270
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
G-God of the...

271
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,470
This can't be.

272
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,780
Why?

273
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,330
What have I done wrong?

274
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,730
What do I do now?

275
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,160
God of the underworld...

276
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,300
I will beat that god of the underworld.

277
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,770
- What? 
 - I will win.

278
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,610
So do not worry about anything.

279
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,920
I will be by your side.

280
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,940
 I will beat even that god of the underworld.

281
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,610
 So please do not worry.

282
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,580
Instead...

283
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,160
whatever the old man who looks like the god of the underworld says out there,

284
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,220
you just smile. I will do the talking.

285
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,080
Also, I know you may be very confused.

286
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,070
But please endure a bit more. It will be over soon.

287
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,270
I am not just "you." I am Yeon Woo.

288
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,350
Park Yeon Woo.

289
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,340
I am Kang Tae Ha.

290
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,100
Yes, I know very well.

291
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,810
Kang Tae Ha.

292
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,390
Shall we, Park Yeon Woo?

293
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,470
 Now, the groom, Kang Tae Ha

294
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:29,630
 and the bride Vanessa's wedding shall begin.

295
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,110
 Now, for the bride and groom's entrance!

296
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,580
Is he the god of the underworld?

297
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,460
 Bride and Groom, enter!

298
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,010
 You shall greet each other with respect.

299
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,990
 The bride and groom, please bow.

300
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,370
From being two people with different paths,

301
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,770

I promise to come together in unison to...

302
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,150
live together forever here and now.

303
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,450
I promise.

304
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,100
And finally,

305
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,400
the bride and groom shall kiss!

306
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,220

307
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,290
Kiss!

308
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,150
Kiss!

309
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,810
Kiss! Kiss!

310
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,270
Kiss! Kiss!

311
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,610
Please send a big round of applause!

312
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,650
Hold your breath.

313
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,450
M-My breath?

314
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,250
M-Ms. Bride!

315
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,820
Ms. Bride!

316
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,420
Are you okay, Ms. Bride?

317
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,320
Gosh...

318
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,810
My goodness, will she be okay?

319
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,690
- Should I call Dr. Oh? 
 - It is not that serious.

320
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,730
She must've been tired coming straight from the airport.

321
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,060
Gosh, I wonder if it's because of the jetlag.

322
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,920
She will be okay if she rests for a bit.

323
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,640
Yes, she should be.

324
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,610
When you first said you weren't inviting other family members,

325
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,100
I was a bit disappointed.

326
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,910
But now that I think about it, that makes sense.

327
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,040
Grandfather, you just prepare for the surgery.

328
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,430
I will take care of the rest.

329
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,210
Gosh, I got it.

330
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,050
Go look after your wife.

331
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,570
As you youngsters say these days, I will "read the room and leave."

332
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,960
I'll get going then.

333
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,090
I will come to the airport tomorrow.

334
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,270
Dr. Oh is coming with me. Don't worry.

335
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,990
Hurry and go tend to your wife. I'm off.

336
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,480
Let's go.

337
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,060
 Someday, you will become like that, like a butterfly.

338
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,020
 No matter where you are and what you become,

339
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,440
 I am sure you will fly to and land where you want.

340
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,920
- Should we wake her? 
 - No.

341
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,010
When she wakes up, take her to the hospital and the police.

342
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,570
Okay.

343
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,390
Dear Husband!

344
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,160
Where am I now, Husband?

345
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,110
She's still saying, "Dear Husband."

346
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,870
Secretary Hong.

347
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,380
Young lady...

348
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,270
here are your clothes and belongings.

349
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,030
Please discuss the details with Secretary Hong.

350
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,330
Dear Husband!

351
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,600
Dear Husband!

352
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,710
- Hey, Miss! 
 - Dear Husband!

353
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,100
Dear Husband!

354
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,050
Where do you keep going?

355
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,810
Please stop with that nonsense.

356
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,340
I am not your "dear husband," nor do I want to be called that.

357
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,830
Nonsense?

358
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,390
It is not.

359
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,040
I have crossed the Waters of Forgetfulness.

360
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,240
I have met you again here in the afterlife.

361
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,850
This is not the afterlife.

362
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,420
This is Seoul, South Korea.

363
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,680
Gosh, if this isn't the afterlife...

364
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,570
Then...

365
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,940
am I alive?

366
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,870
Then this should be Joseon.

367
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,080
It was Joseon. A very long time ago.

368
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,900
Over there is Gyeongbokgung Palace, where the king lived according to your little historical play.

369
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,970
The Gyeongbokgung Palace was destroyed during the Japanese invasion.

370
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,540
To be exact, it was destroyed in 1592 during the Japanese invasions of Korea.

371
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,220
It was rebuilt in 1865, the second year of King Gojong's reign.

372
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,540
It is currently empty.

373
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,900
Since it's been a hundred years since the last king died.

374
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,320
A hundred years?

375
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,730
The last king?

376
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,330
W-Wait! Wait!

377
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,140
Wait.

378
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,580
It is hard to believe, but okay.

379
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,280
This is not Joseon, Heaven, or the afterlife.

380
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,020
But a new Joseon.

381
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,990
However, you are most definitely my husband.

382
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,750
I clearly remember.

383
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:08,110
This face... the eyes... even the name Tae Ha.

384
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,570
Everything is my dear husband. But how could you leave me alone?

385
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,240
Secretary Hong.

386
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,010
Excuse me, please do not be like this. Well...

387
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,050
You said...

388
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,190
You said you would take me home.

389
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,480
I never said that. I said I would help.

390
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,980
Wrap it up.

391
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,150
Yes.

392
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,830
"Wrap it up..."

393
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,760
- Please get up. 
 - Dear Husband!

394
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,110
Goodness...

395
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,550
Open!

396
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,820
Please open!

397
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,090
Why isn't this opening?

398
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,780
Let's go.

399
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,650
 How could this be Joseon, but not Joseon...

400
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,950
There is a patient for you, Dr. Choi.

401
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,600
Yes.

402
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,150
Where did she go?

403
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,720
E-Excuse me, where is Hanyang...

404
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes? Excuse me, do I know you?

405
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,340
Are you okay?

406
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,420
Dear Husband...

407
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,180
Tae Ha did what? Marry?

408
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,920
Only Father attended?

409
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,280
Yes, I am trying to figure out the situation.

410
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,260
Are you reporting it when you haven't figured it out?

411
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,030
I apologize.

412
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,890
I guess he really will make Tae Ha the successor.

413
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,510
Cancel my plans.

414
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,560
Where is Tae Min?

415
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,230
Wow, this is the only one in the country.

416
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,320
Of course...

417
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,840
Damn, I guess the expensive price tag pays for how good it looks.

418
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,520
I'll wear it out. You can have my clothes.

419
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,160
Thank you.

420
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,820
Where should I go to find my way back?

421
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,190
 Marry? Kang Tae Ha did?

422
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,850
 Yes. So, the CEO is calling for you to come home.

423
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,750
Enough about that. Who is it?

424
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,950
Who did he marry?

425
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,190
Shit...

426
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,040
Hey!

427
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,260
Hey!

428
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,660
I am sorry!

429
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,670
I am sorry!

430
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,980
Stop right there!

431
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,310
Don't follow me!

432
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,600
Shit, that crazy bitch.

433
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,820
You're dead if I ever see you again!

434
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,940
 Dear Husband.

435
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,440
 Dear Husband.

436
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,980
 Let go of me.

437
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,470
 I cannot. I cannot let go.

438
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,580
 Dear Husband.

439
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,510
 Dear Husband!

440
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,700
 Dear Husband, where are you going?

441
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,630
 Leaving meâ€”

442
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,120
 Dear Husband.

443
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,740
 I am not just "you." I am Yeon Woo.

444
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,010
 Park Yeon Woo.

445
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,400
She disappeared?

446
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,840
You said she disappeared from the hotel.

447
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,760
You are just now reporting this to me?

448
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,510
Well, it took some time looking for her.

449
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,700
I have gone to the police station

450
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,170
but it wasn't very helpful since all I knew was her name, Park Yeon Woo.

451
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,720
There hasn't been a guest like her at the hotel, either. I'm sorry.

452
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,600
Secure CCTV footage around the hotel and check her movement.

453
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,350
To the best of your abilities.

454
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,250
If you find anything, report it to me right away.

455
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,920
Yes...

456
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,440
I will report right away.

457
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,140
Right away.

458
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,780
W-What is that?

459
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,940
In broad daylight.

460
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,730
 I never said that. I said I would help.

461
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,600
 Wrap it up.

462
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,200
I thought he was my husband, but he was just a trickster.

463
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,850
What do I do?

464
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,230
I know no one, and I have no place to go.

465
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,830
Why have I landed in such a different world?

466
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,930
 Do you believe in fate?

467
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,850
 Fate...

468
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,620
 Maiden, I wonder what fate brought you here.

469
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,500
 Just like your name, Yeon Woo.

470
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,700
 How do you know my name?

471
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,620
 Didn't you say I have a trivial talent?

472
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,260
 You will lose something great soon.

473
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,210
 However, you will travel far and gain something you want.

474
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,120
By "far" did she mean...

475
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,700
I wanted to go to either Qing or America!

476
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,410
Not the new Joseon here!

477
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,310
Here you go. This money is yours, right, Sis?

478
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,330
M-Money?

479
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,160
Money? This is money?

480
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,050
I'm glad. Thank goodness!

481
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,320
Thank goodness!

482
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,540
Hey, kid, can you help me?

483
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,360
There really is nothing that this place doesn't have.

484
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,660
Since it's a convenience store.

485
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,550
I see.

486
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,070
What is this?

487
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,600
 Sweeter than honey.

488
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,100
 It melts like snow the moment it touches my mouth.

489
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,150
What kind of rice cake is this black thing?

490
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,370
This is not rice cake, but a chocolate pie.

491
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,920
Cho... co...

492
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,310

493
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,410
Thank you very much.

494
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,360
Do you live near here?

495
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,490
No, my academy is near here.

496
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,940
Is it like a learning institute?

497
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,920
I see. So, is the academy fun?

498
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,370
Everything is boring.

499
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,770
Which is why I played hooky todayâ€”

500
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,380
It is okay.

501
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,190
I have some experience with playing hooky.

502
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,940
- Really? 
 - Yes.

503
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,530
What is it?

504
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,140
What?

505
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,250
Hello?

506
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,560
 Joon! My Joon.

507
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,620
 Where are you?

508
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,880
Who is it? Who is there?

509
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,180
I am near the academy.

510
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,060
 Really? I am almost there.

511
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,920
 Mom! What's wrong?

512
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,350
Why? What happened?

513
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,220
I must go now! Goodbye!

514
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,160
Kid, take this with you!

515
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,520
Look here. Hello?

516
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,900
My gosh.

517
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,690
My gosh!

518
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,070
What the heck!

519
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,340
As for the moon...

520
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,000
whether it's Joseon... or the new Joseon...

521
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,640
they look the same.

522
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,420
I am fine.

523
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,770
Just think of this as resting at the gazebo.

524
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:21,800
â™«  Goodnight my baby  â™«

525
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:30,830
â™«  The stars and moon are falling asleep  â™«

526
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:39,780
â™«  The dark night is passing  â™«

527
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,550
Open wide.

528
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,960
There, there.

529
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,290
 What?

530
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,120
 Where am I?

531
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,210
 Dear Husband.

532
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,860
 Dear Husband.

533
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,220
 Dear Husband.

534
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,800
 Dear Husband?

535
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,690
 Dear Husband?

536
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,410
 Dear Husband, bullshit!

537
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,460
 Deputy CEO, are you on your way to the airport?

538
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,840
Yes, I am. Why?

539
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,090
Chairman's surgery got canceled!

540
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,810
 What?

541
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,150
What do you mean?

542
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,220
 I have no idea, either.

543
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,320
 What do we do?

544
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,940
You jumped through hoops to even fake a marriage for the chairman's surgery.

545
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,690
 Is he giving himself a beating?

546
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,370
 - Very funny.  
 - Look at that.

547
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,050
- Grandfather. 
 - You're here.

548
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:50,280
Hey, I've really enjoyed watching this show lately.

549
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,810
What happened? Why did the surgery get canceled?

550
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,310
It wasn't canceled.

551
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,560
But a change in schedule. Rescheduling.

552
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,160
Look at that! Look!

553
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,400
It's so funny.

554
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,860
Gosh, there were some setbacks in the US.

555
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,370
Oh, I see...

556
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,580
 Don't worry.

557
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,270
We'll treat him with drugs here.

558
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,270
And then go after rescheduling the surgery date.

559
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,840
 It should take about a month.

560
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,750
 What?

561
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,130
A whole month?

562
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,010
 Anyway, don't let the chairman get stressed out in the meantime.

563
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,500
 Do your best to let him be at ease. Okay?

564
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:47,330
Hey, where is your wife? I wanted to see her while I was here.

565
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,290
She went on a stroll. A stroll...

566
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,310
For now, why don't you go back homeâ€”

567
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,590
I have to watch this show.

568
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,360
Don't disturb me. Go already.

569
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,530
I will bring her here.

570
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,240
Good.

571
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,500
Secretary Hong, we need to find that woman from yesterday right now.

572
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,010
What? Marry?

573
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,350
Kang Tae Ha?

574
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,610
Gosh, there's no way.

575
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,690
From what I know, he hasn't been on a blind date or even dated anyone.

576
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,280
Father even canceled his US plans.

577
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,700
Something isn't right.

578
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,580
The US? Why does the chairman need to go to the US?

579
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,540
Director Hwang, why don't you know anything?

580
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,000
Do you have any information?

581
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,900
I am very sorry.

582
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:49,180
By the way, who did he marry?

583
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,380
Whose daughter is she?

584
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,350
You're curious, right? I'll go find out.

585
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,820
No need. I'm already looking into it.

586
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,360
What deal was made between Father and Tae Ha.

587
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,730
What Tae Ha's intentions are.

588
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,580
Who his wife is.

589
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,560
Everything.

590
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,710
Catch me if you can!

591
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:18,920
- Careful when you go up. 
 - Okay.

592
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,620
Mom, a strange lady is sleeping here!

593
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,450
I went to the police station, but there were no reports.

594
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,000
How about the CCTVs? Have you checked them all?

595
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,620
Well, she was walking around the hotel

596
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,980
and looks like she went to the convenience store.

597
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,990
But nothing afterward.

598
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,200
What should we do?

599
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,930
Should I look around here?

600
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:34,020
In crime novels, the culprit always comes back to the scene. So, maybe Park Yeon Woo might...

601
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,670
How high is the chance of "might"?

602
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,810
But I will keep looking around.

603
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,940

604
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,860
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

605
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,700
What's with that woman? Why is she staring like that?

606
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,050
Gosh, what the heck.

607
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,700
It's so funny. Let's take a picture.

608
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,200
- Take a picture. 
 - Scared me.

609
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,520
Wait! Is she looking at the ramen?

610
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,150
I should send it to our friends.

611
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,300
Look at her...

612
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,750
She scared me. What the heck?

613
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,450
Let's go. I'm out of breath.

614
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,610
I really don't like running.

615
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,030
Let's talk right here.

616
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,510
Who are you?

617
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:08,220
You called me "Dear Husband" yesterday. Right?

618
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,560
No.

619
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,120
You are definitely not my dear husband.

620
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,300
Let go of me.

621
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,830
I'm not.

622
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,710
Even if I'm not, I need you.

623
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,340
Please, I beg you.

624
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,410
Please become my wife.

625
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,080
Wife? Bullshit!

626
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,530
You manure-eating son of a trickster!

627
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,770
Enough. I will not do it.

628
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,490
Are you telling me to be used by a trickster again?

629
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,390
Trickster? I thought I had compensated you.

630
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,340
I definitely put it in. Definitely!

631
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,700
Anyway! I have no business with a trickster anymore!

632
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,420
I'll pay you a premium price.

633
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,590
Are you trying to buy me with money?

634
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,680
Not buy, but a deal.

635
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,560
Under the premise that you will act as my wife.

636
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,990
Just this one day. Just today.

637
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,360
 One day?

638
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,840
 True...

639
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,800
 I guess I can't live like this outside.

640
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,470
Fine.

641
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,770
I will help you with my generous heart.

642
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,780
Then, let's get going.

643
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,200
But...

644
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,530
Did you wash your face?

645
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,540
I did.

646
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,300
Earlier...

647
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,520
- Secretary Hong. 
 - Yes.

648
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,170
Please prepare a costume and hair designer team. As soon as possible.

649
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,260
As soon as possible... Y-Yes.

650
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,230
Before that.

651
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,150
Before that...

652
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,860
there is one thing I hope you do for me.

653
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,800
Get in.

654
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,660
What are you doing?

655
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,270
I have seen this palanquin on the streets.

656
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,010
But I do not know how to get in.

657
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,040
Put on your seatbelt.

658
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,350
What are you doing?

659
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,450
Your seatbelt.

660
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,480
I am helping you, seeing how unfortunate your situation is.

661
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,210
Don't take me as a fool just because of that one kiss!

662
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,180
My archery and sword skills are veryâ€”

663
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,130
A kiss?

664
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,230
We never have.

665
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,010
Are you backing out?

666
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,650
You did it yesterday!

667
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,520
What touched your lips yesterday...

668
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,820
was this.

669
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,990
Let's stop talking about that now.

670
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,380
Why is this going so fast?

671
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,330
Please slow down.

672
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,460
Slow down.

673
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,840
Slow down!

674
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,740
Don't forget. You are Vanessa from Italy.

675
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,340
You went to the hospital after coming out on a walk.

676
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,600
If Grandfather asks anything, just smile.

677
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,540
- I willâ€” 
 - I told you I got it multiple times.

678
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,010
What are you doing?

679
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,780
I feel a little nauseous.

680
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,430
Do it outside.

681
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,240
Gosh.

682
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,160
Wear these.

683
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,840
Gosh, gosh!

684
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,670
Gosh, did I scare you too much? I'm so sorry.

685
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,700
I'm so silly, huh?

686
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,830
No worries.

687
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,600
Huh?

688
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,430
Did you two already?

689
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,790
No, she gets motion sickness.

690
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,370
Right, Yeon Woo?

691
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,700
Y-Yeon Woo?

692
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,600
Not Vanessa?

693
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,820
My name before adoption was Yeon Woo.

694
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,350
I am Yeon Woo of Park lineage.

695
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:53,520
Oh, I see, Yeon Woo. Such a nice name.

696
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,040
Why didn't you tell me stuff like this earlier?

697
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,250
I am sorry. I forgot to tell you.

698
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,750
But what do I do? I need to get going now.

699
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,570
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

700
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:07,960
Chairman Jin of Sunyang called me to meet up.

701
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,800
Well, I am in a rush.

702
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,040
Yeon Woo...

703
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,390
What mountain does a person with many worries climb?

704
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,230
Taesan? 
  ("San" means mountain in Korean, and "Taesan" means "huge amount")

705
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,820
And what kind of fortune does a general want in a war?

706
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,320
Hangbok! 
  ("Bok" means fortune, "Hangbok" means surrender)

707
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,950
Wow, she knows the answers to all my riddles.

708
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,680
You've passed. Very good.

709
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,120
Hold on. Yeon Woo, when do you go back to Italy?

710
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,540
She needs to go back soon for work.

711
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,720
That was the plan, but I think I'll stay a few more days.

712
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,050
Since we just got married.

713
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,450
Yes, yes, yes. You definitely should.

714
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,290
That should be the case. Gosh, what a nice girl.

715
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,060
Good. Very well.

716
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,430
What are you doing?

717
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:08,310
I thought I said just for today earlier.

718
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,600
I need somewhere to stay until I go home.

719
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,200
- Lookâ€” 
 - You used me, too.

720
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,810
It's only for a few more days.

721
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,890
If you really don't like it, I will leave immediately.

722
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:21,110
Regardless of whether Grandfather comes back or not.

723
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:25,000
I don't know why you would lie to a grandfather as nice as him.

724
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,430
That is none of my business.

725
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,190
But what can I do? You don't need me.

726
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,050
Fine then.

727
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,010
About what?

728
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,830
Stay here for today.

729
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:47,640
Let's write a contract and take care of it tomorrow.

730
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,550
Wow...

731
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:06,060
There is a living room, a bath, and a restroom.

732
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,470
There would be no need to come downstairs.

733
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:12,600
You are telling me not to come down and bother you. Right?

734
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,190
I. got. it.

735
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,060
Brother!

736
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,490
This. The bride dropped it yesterday.

737
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,250
This is a norigae, right? 
  (Accessory for Hanbok)

738
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,420
I wonder if her parents gave it to her.

739
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,870
Parents?

740
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,090
Wasn't the bride an adoptee?

741
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,870
Maybe they gave it to her, saying, "Please remember us."

742
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,820
There might be some sad story behind it.

743
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,390
Hey, what adoptee?

744
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,910
O-Oh... y-yeah? T-That could be true.

745
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,500
Pass it along to the bride.

746
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,490
I feel better now.

747
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,870
Geez! What is this?

748
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,670
A vanity that lights up.

749
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,730
 Stay here for today.

750
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,230
 Let's write a contract and take care of it tomorrow.

751
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,700
I'll leave when I find a way back to Joseon.

752
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:46,230
Just wait and see. If there is no way out, I will make a way.

753
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,200
A-A ghost!

754
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,760
Hey! Are you okay?

755
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,640
Look!

756
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,790
What are you doing at this late hour?

757
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,200
I was hungry and was looking for food.

758
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,060
I found this sweet and savory treat.

759
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:51,170
What's with the white Hanbok?

760
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,720
The clothes I was wearing were smelly.

761
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,320
This is comfortable, too.

762
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,440
By the way, any rice or meat dishes

763
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,440
or anything with choco?

764
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,340
I don't have any.

765
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,330
I understand. I am very sorry.

766
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,710
Oh, no...

767
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,640
You're here.

768
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,900
You're still up.

769
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,150
I was about to turn in.

770
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,620
How was the business trip to Busan?

771
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,960
You rushed your set schedule a bit.

772
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,730
Since I received the news suddenly.

773
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:49,920
Father... why didn't you tell me?

774
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,010
Tae Ha's wedding.

775
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:58,840
That rascal is so stubborn. Goodness...

776
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,110
I am sorry about that.

777
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:05,030
No need to be. It's because I'm lacking as a mother.

778
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,630
But his wife seemed very calm and nice.

779
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:11,200
You would like her, too.

780
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:17,420
Oh, by the way, about the VIP invitation exhibition.

781
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,900
The Hwajeopdo exhibition? Why do you ask? 
  (Folk painting)

782
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,550
Leave that to Tae Ha.

783
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,700
I think that would suffice as a wedding gift.

784
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,600
And good work with everything, Hye Sook.

785
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,850
I'm heading to bed.

786
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:51,010
Please wake up.

787
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,900
The CEO asks for you to come home.

788
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,070
Go... shit...

789
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,010
Your card is already frozen.

790
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,290
And your car will be confiscated.

791
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,120
Your phone will also be suspended.

792
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:08,740
Not this one.

793
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,100
With Kang Tae Ha getting married, I guess our CEO Min feels rushed.

794
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,840
Well, I guess I can play along.

795
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,250
What is this?

796
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,590
This is...

797
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,580
 Is this what you call talak? 
 (Milk)

798
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,640
 Yes, this is the talak only the King drinks.

799
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,140
 I took some from what father brought home.

800
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,400
 Let's have a taste.

801
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,800
 Gosh, what a precious thing.

802
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:59,180
 My Lady, I cannot thank you enough in words.

803
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,690
 Talak.

804
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,540
It's the taste of talak.

805
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,180

806
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,360
How was it with Park Yeon Woo yesterday?

807
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,340
What about it?

808
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:31,010
It was the first time you spent a night under the same roof with a woman.

809
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:38,800
Well, since you are a motae-solo, Deputy CEO. 
  (Someone who has never been in a relationship)

810
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,170
What do you mean by what you just said?

811
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:44,870
W-Well, it's... um...

812
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:48,440
Here is the contract with Park Yeon Woo that you spoke of yesterday.

813
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,620
I'll review it and give you feedback.

814
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:00,150

Congrats. I heard you got married.

815
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,680
 I'm really curious to know who you married.

816
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,960
Deputy CEO.

817
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,830
 Dear Husband!

818
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,800
 Dear Husband!

819
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,040
 Let go of me.

820
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,910
 I cannot. I cannot let go.

821
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,770
 I said let go. Why are you doing this?

822
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,520
Joseon?

823
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,770
Why is it here?

824
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:32,160
 You cannot leave without me.

825
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,910
Look here!

826
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:38,130
Look over here? Can you not hear me?

827
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,610
Scholar, how can I go to where you are?

828
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,690
 How about the child and me?

829
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:46,930
Is this the door? Please open it for me.

830
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:50,110
How can I go over there?

831
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,800
Scholar!

832
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,700
- Scholar! 
  - That child is not mine.

833
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,430
 What are you talking about?

834
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:02,740
 I cannot bear a child!

835
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,810
Who are you?

836
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,780
Shit.

837
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,800
Geez, way to greet each other for the first time.

838
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:20,780
 It is a marriage fraud.

839
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,090
Wow, Kang Tae Ha has interesting taste.

840
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,200
I'm asking who you are.

841
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,200
Sister-in-law.

842
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,120
Sister-in-law? Who...

843
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:34,210
Young Master?

844
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,090
According to the family register, yes.

845
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,750
But I am only half related to that bastard Kang Tae Ha.

846
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,800
Hold on! Have we met before?

847
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,830
You look familiar.

848
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:47,900
When would we have met?

849
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:53,060
 Do not follow me!

850
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,410
We've definitely met. Right?

851
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:01,260
Geez, so loud.

852
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,870
What the heck? Where did it go?

853
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,680
- No! 
 - Hey, Sister-in-law.

854
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,910
- Come out. 
 - What's going on?

855
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:10,490
Come out! Come out!

856
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,560
Hey, can't you hear me?

857
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,720
I'm asking what you're doing.

858
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,730
Come back! I need to go back!

859
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,550
I have to go back!

860
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:44,220
- Are you crazy? 
 - Come out! Scholar!

861
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:46,510
What are you doing?

862
01:05:57,350 --> 01:06:00,070
 I cannot do this much when she killed my son?

863
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:03,400
 I asked you what you did to him!

864
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,220
 I wonder how much I can find out.

865
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,540
 We probably met through fate or something like that.

866
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,130
 If you're with My Lady, you will end up like your past life.

867
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,550
 A fate that will repeat itself.

868
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,160
 It cannot be this way.

869
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,380
 I will save her even if that's what it takes.

870
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,590
 So, Tae Ha can't make a single move.

871
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:55,030
 You need to find the answer to that, My Lady.

872
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:38,630
You... must know who I am.

873
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,500
What are you doing in my house?

874
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:05,060

875
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:13,370
â™«  Even if you are left alone in this place  â™«

876
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:21,690
â™«  I hope it flows and takes you back to where you left  â™«

877
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:29,530
â™«  If I set out on the road following those red flowers  â™«

878
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:31,820

879
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:35,740
 Why do I keep meeting familiar faces?

880
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,270
 Did you pray to go back to Joseon again?

881
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:40,880
 Forget it! I found a way back.

882
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,420
 So are you saying that Hwajeopdo is a forgery?

883
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,060
 The one in charge is Tae Ha anyway.

884
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,550
 This is Yoo Nam's drawing.

885
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,650
 Then this drawing is fake.

886
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,970
 Hey, look, Park Yeon Woo.

887
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,990
 The VIPs are here.

888
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:57,420
 I really wanted to be of help to the trickster guy at least once.

889
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:58,940
 What's with you and Kang Tae Ha?

890
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:01,370
 Like a contract marriage or something like that?

891
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,900
 Deputy CEO! Park Yeon Woo is gone.

892
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:07,950
 Goodbye! I'm off to Joseon!
