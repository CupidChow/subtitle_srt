1
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,350

2
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:47,780

3
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,770
 It's pounding again.

4
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,110
 Would it be okay...

5
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,320
 if I try confirming it once?

6
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,870
 Confirming it?

7
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,110
It's not a dream.

8
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,620

Kang Tae Ha, come to the hospital tomorrow!

9
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,250
 Do you really want something terrible to happen to you?

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,630
Yes, Senior. It's me.

11
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,940

12
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,090
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! I'm so excited!

13
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,300
This is the first time we got a reward vacation!

14
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,510
Me, too. Going to Jeju Island using someone else's money?

15
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,660
Amazing! Right?

16
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,850
I guess so.

17
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,080
Welcome.

18
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,830
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

19
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,830
But who is...

20
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,410
Oh, she is one of Yeon Woo's close friends.

21
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,330
I asked her if she could come with us.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Oh, Sa Wol made these snacks.

23
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,700
They are delicious.

24
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,350
It's nothing.

25
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,270
We might miss the plane. Let's hurry up and go.

26
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,610
- Thank you. 
 - Is it decent?

27
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,340
Oh, Sa Wol, you were a close friend of Mourning Clothes, I see.

28
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,170
If you keep your mouth shut, I'll tell you a secret about Mourning Clothes.

29
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,960
Oh, okay! You have to keep your promise. Okay?

30
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,020
Okay, okay.

31
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,970
What is it? What promise?

32
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,750
I didn't say anything.

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,860
There's just something like that.

34
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,670
What is it!

35
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,040
Wow, she's a great cook!

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,990
These would be a hit if she sold them.

37
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,080
What did she put in them?

38
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,830
I thought people lived there when I was young.

39
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,480
But now that I'm looking at it, it is cotton balls blooming in the sky.

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,240
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's whipped cream?

41
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,890
It's that!

42
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,990
The thing that is between the Choco pies...

43
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,100
Merrow? Marrow?

44
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,660
Marshmerrow?

45
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,240
Marshmallow?

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,090
That's right!

47
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,310
You can't eat clouds, right?

48
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,150
I'll buy you lots of things that are tastier than clouds.

49
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,730
 It's the ocean!

50
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,040
 It's the ocean!

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Wait!

52
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,770
Wow, it's so nice! It's so exciting!

53
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,820
Why didn't you tell me

54
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
that the ocean was this beautiful?

55
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,410
I didn't think I would ever see a world like this.

56
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,260
Do you still feel that this island is lonely?

57
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,780
 He said it's a big island

58
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,780
 but it's lonely because it's alone by itself.

59
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,340
 I felt like I was like that island in this new Joseon.

60
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,310
 I think he feels the same way.

61
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,650
I wanted to show you

62
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,410
that it is no longer lonely.

63
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,340
You and me as well.

64
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,730
If that is the case, it was a darned success.

65
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,050
Sis! Hurry up and come!

66
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,040
Okay! I'm coming!

67
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,090
- I'm coming! 
 - Be careful, be careful.

68
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,060
♫  My heart is shaking, can you hear my heart?  ♫

69
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,060
Oh, my gosh!

70
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,430
​♫  ...but I still like it  ♫

71
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:45,600
♫  It feels like the whole world is in your eyes  ♫

72
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,510
Is it possible...

73
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,980
to cover up anything with this?

74
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,350
Yes. It will cover up only as much as necessary.

75
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,440
Honestly...

76
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,470
it's pretty, right?

77
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,760
Forget it.

78
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,590
You can wear it and cover up as much as you want.

79
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,230
Come on!

80
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,290
When will you ever wear such risqué clothing elsewhere?

81
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,620
No! I told you I won't.

82
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,550
Come on, My Lady!

83
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,190
That's it.

84
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,300
Let's play together.

85
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,190
Oh, I can't swim without a tube.

86
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,310
What do you mean you can't swim without a tube?

87
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,740
Wait, wait! I really can't!

88
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,750
- Nice! Nice! 
 - Oh, Deputy CEO! Deputy CEO!

89
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,620
I said, I really can't!

90
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,620
You can do it if you practice.

91
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,410
 That's it.

92
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,870
Deputy CEO, what is Yeon Woo wearing?

93
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,980
I know, right?

94
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,270
She's so cute.

95
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,810
It's great!

96
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,980
Hit it! Hit it!

97
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,380
Deputy CEO!

98
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,050
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

99
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,230
Did you know

100
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:38,110
that my father and I really liked you, Dr. Oh.

101
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,840
Until you switched over to being Chairman Kang's primary care physician.

102
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,050
My father said you were an honest and smart person.

103
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,500
And so I see you've made many investments using borrowed names.

104
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,160

105
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,740
Dr. Oh, you know. Right?

106
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,790
The reason Tae Ha got married.

107
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,020
Be honest.

108
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,740
I'm not asking you because I don't know.

109
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,980
I just want to confirm it.

110
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:21,050
Well, the chairman deceived Tae Ha about having a bad liver,

111
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,090
and said that he would get surgery after Tae Ha got married.

112
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,830
Father lied to Tae Ha?

113
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,820
I thought he got married because of his medication.

114
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,620
M-Medication?

115
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,190
Does Father also know about Tae H's heart problem?

116
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,240
This won't do...

117
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,450
So hopelessly lost...

118
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,440
I'm saying all the juices are being lost.

119
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,810
Right?

120
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,730
If you flip it now, you'll die.

121
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,330
From the amazing flavor. Right now is the timing. Hurry!

122
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,020
R-Right now?

123
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,650
That's good.

124
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,350
Here.

125
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,180
Oh, thank you.

126
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,090
 Cheers!

127
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,160
- Great work! 
 - Great work.

128
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,790
Oh, it's so refreshing!

129
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,010
Ha Na.

130
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,610
Sis.

131
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,090
Here.

132
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,570
Try some of this.

133
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,140
- Ah! 
 - Ah.

134
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,630
It's so colorful and pretty, and it tastes good. Right?

135
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,580
Yum! It's sweet.

136
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,470
Right?

137
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,130
Gosh. It's nice living in new Joseon. Right?

138
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,680
There's lots of tasty food,

139
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,700
and you can earn money.

140
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,630
Well...

141
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,520
can't we just live here?

142
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,400
Honestly, we don't even know how we can go back.

143
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,930
With that said,

144
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,660
how far have you gone with Young Master?

145
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,280
Hands?

146
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,290
Lips?

147
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,830
Watch what you say! What do you mean, lips?

148
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,530
Goodness, you've already reached that point!

149
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,510
Reached where?

150
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,420
When, where, and how?

151
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,980
I mean, that just somehow happened because of the situation...

152
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,880
It's okay. Everyone somehow ends up falling in love,

153
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,020
somehow ends up kissing,

154
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,480
and somehow ends up sleeping together.

155
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,300
Sleep together?

156
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,940
When Young Master gives you the signal, welcome him

157
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,380
and just go for it there and then.

158
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,520
Just go for it? Why should I?

159
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,440
I'll sleep on the floor, so sleep comfortably.

160
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,090
Why?

161
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,210
What do you mean, why? I thought you'd be uncomfortable, Yeon Woo.

162
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,340
Y-You can just sleep on the bed.

163
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,840
No, you should use the bed.

164
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,070
I-I'm saying it's all right.

165
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,300
Why are you doing this?

166
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,410
Gosh, just listen to me!

167
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,720
I've got a good idea.

168
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,090
Signal, my foot.

169
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,940
♫  When I look at you for a while  ♫

170
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,250
♫  All my thoughts disappear and it feels strange  ♫

171
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:18,440
♫  I wanted to run away from this unfamiliar feeling  ♫

172
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,400
♫  I feel like such a fool  ♫

173
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,410
♫  What should I do? My cheeks get hot the moment I see you  ♫

174
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,110
♫  My heart is shaking, can you hear my heart?  ♫

175
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:40,610
​♫  Your way of speaking is still unknown to me, but I still like it  ♫

176
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:51,080
♫  It feels like the whole world is in your eyes  ♫

177
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,490
What are you doing right now!

178
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,660
What did you say you will do?

179
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,680
Dismiss Tae Ha?

180
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,400
Yes.

181
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,070
I thought it was a necessary action to take for SH.

182
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,960
A necessary action?

183
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Unfortunately, the Deputy CEO has a heart problem.

184
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,670
What? A h-heart problem?

185
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,010
W-What are you talking about?

186
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,510
Heart?

187
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,200
Is that true? Chairman?

188
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,410
CEO Min.

189
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,180
If...

190
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,430
the chairman still wanted to make Tae Ha CEO despite knowing his condition,

191
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,390
I refuse to keep it quiet.

192
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,940
SH is not your own personal company.

193
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,890
With that said,

194
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,580
I officially propose Deputy CEO Kang's dismissal.

195
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,470
 Try going to the right a little bit. A little more.

196
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,450
 Gosh, so pretty.

197
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,250
Should we take a photo together?

198
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,180
Gosh, let's take it together.

199
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,560
 - Us, too!  
 - Come into the frame.

200
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,590
Ha Na.

201
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,350
I'll take it. Let's do a V.

202
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,350
One, two, three!

203
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,810
You're here.

204
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,680
Did you enjoy it?

205
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,480
What do you mean?

206
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,520
You seemed to have a crazy time upstairs with all the noise.

207
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,830
I slept well, with nothing happening.

208
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,620
Really?

209
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,550
W-Why?

210
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,980
Why would he leave you alone when you're so pretty?

211
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,110
Let's see. How long has it been since he became your lover?

212
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,760
Has it been a few days now?

213
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,090
Lover?

214
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,420
"You're mine, I'm yours. Today is our first day going out."

215
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,360
When did you guys say stuff like that?

216
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,700
We didn't say anything like that.

217
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,830
I see what's going on.

218
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,390
All right.

219
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,660
It's because you guys didn't...

220
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,500
blatantly say, "You are mine," that Young Master hesitated.

221
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,830
You should just go for it first, My Lady.

222
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,380
You guys like each other, so who cares?

223
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,520
Do you like her that much?

224
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,140
You have honey dripping from your eyes.

225
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,980
You're right.

226
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,070
It makes me happy just to look at Yeon Woo.

227
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,560
Whoa.

228
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,640
That's why I'm worried.

229
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,030
I don't know if I can make her happy.

230
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,550
Why would you worry about something like that?

231
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,300
You can see the answer just by looking at her face.

232
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,370
Yes, Director Choi.

233
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,870
What did you say?

234
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,530
CEO Min says she will have me dismissed?

235
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,650
 The dismissal proposal is a problem,

236
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,580
but the Chairman also heard about your heart problem.

237
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,680
Okay. In any case, come back as soon as you can.

238
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,710
Chairman, what are you going to do now?

239
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,090
What do you mean, what will I do?

240
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,820
I'll have to let things take its natural course.

241
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,810
One thing at a time.

242
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:22,150

243
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,570
Hello?

244
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,680
 What's wrong with your voice? Are you not feeling well?

245
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,600
I was just tired. Why? Is there a problem?

246
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,870
The results from your exam before you left for Jeju Island came back.

247
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,200
Your heart is a mess, so come back immediately.

248
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,370
 Right now. Today!

249
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,010
 Are you listening?

250
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,820
 You're in really bad condition right now!

251
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,050
Okay. I'll call you later.

252
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,470
 Kang Tae Ha. Kang Tae Ha!

253
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,630
One, two!

254
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,990
 Let's go, Park Yeon Woo.

255
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,400
 Ms. Bride! Ms. Bride!

256
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,370
What are you doing!

257
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,820
Do you remember

258
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,650
how I fainted on our wedding day?

259
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,020
How could I forget that day?

260
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,300
I've done lots of weird things after I came here.

261
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,250
Do I seem more like a new Joseon person now?

262
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,420
Back then, I never knew...

263
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,510
that I would end up liking a trickster like you.

264
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,220
Be mine, Kang Tae Ha.

265
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,290
I'll cherish you more than Choco.

266
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,780
Yeon Woo.

267
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,940
Let's end our contract now.

268
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,350
Are you saying we should start all over?

269
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,820
No, let's just end everything.

270
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,870
All of it.

271
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,720
End it?

272
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm not interested in a relationship. I don't have time for it, either.

273
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,850
Our contract period ended, anyway.

274
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,680
I'll look for a place for you to stay, so until then—

275
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,580
What have you been doing all this time, then?

276
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,900
You laughed with me, held hands with me, kissed me,

277
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,010
- and even brought me here— 
 - That was just because...

278
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,760
I got caught up in the moment.

279
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,170
I'm different from other people.

280
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,860
I can't live an ordinary life.

281
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,530
Do you mean that?

282
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,560
Did you even...

283
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,400
like me a little bit?

284
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,500
I never did.

285
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,870
You were a trickster after all.

286
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:13,890
♫  One day I had a dream  ♫

287
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:21,270
♫  I woke up and was in a daze for a long time  ♫

288
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:28,900
♫  I sat there helplessly for a while  ♫

289
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,760
Where did you go?

290
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,490
Everyone was looking all over for you!

291
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,750
We couldn't reach you on the phone, either.

292
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,860
I guess I came back late after taking a walk.

293
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,810
You know that Young Master left first. Right?

294
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,360
But what's going on?

295
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,510
Tae Ha left?

296
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,730
You didn't know?

297
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,590
He said he had some business at the company. I guess he left already.

298
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,680
Yes. I thought he left without telling you or something.

299
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,090
- Let's hurry up and go to eat dinner. 
 - Okay.

300
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,170
So, Mr. Kang,

301
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:08,180
your ejection fraction has dropped to the 40% range or lower.

302
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,180
The pacemaker is not probably working.

303
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,990
This means that it's impossible to avoid heart failure.

304
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,450
When the left ventricle deteriorates,

305
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,340
blood clots can form in the heart,

306
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,870
leading to a stroke or even to a heart attack.

307
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,940
I have never seen things getting worse in such a short time.

308
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,750
What exactly happened here?

309
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:39,670
♫  Come by my side at any time  ♫

310
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,940
So? Am I dying?

311
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,940
Crazy bastard.

312
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,290
Pour me a shot, too.

313
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,790
Are you crazy?

314
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,270
I'm your primary care physician!

315
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,830
You should just drink this.

316
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,880
Just drink this.

317
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,940
I've thought about all sorts of things.

318
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,600
Why did his heart suddenly get so bad?

319
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,190
Is it because of that harmful woman?

320
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,460
Your heart kept beating so fast because you love her?

321
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,710
But that's a bunch of crap.

322
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,650
How does that make sense?

323
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,460
Your heart is also...

324
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,870
totally crappy, medically speaking.

325
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,880
It just doesn't make sense whatsoever.

326
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,890
You're right.

327
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,640
I may die at any moment,

328
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,490
but I keep thinking about that woman only.

329
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,780
This makes no sense. Right?

330
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:09,330
♫  But no matter how much I look at it, I can only think of myself   ♫

331
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,160
 You were a trickster, after all.

332
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,920
I feel bad for making her cry,

333
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,730
I'm afraid that I won't see her again,

334
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,950
and I'm worried that she may hate me.

335
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,310
I guess my heart...

336
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,910
is really broken, after all.

337
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:52,260
♫  When I wake up from this dream  ♫

338
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,860
♫   I wait for you to tell me  ♫

339
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,500
What do you mean by that?

340
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,250
A contract marriage? With Yeon Woo?

341
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,860
I couldn't marry someone, knowing about my heart problem.

342
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,540
But I still wanted to protect you and the company somehow, Grandfather—

343
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,590
And that's all you came up with as the solution?

344
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,050
How long did you think you could fool everyone?

345
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,870
I didn't want to make you worry.

346
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,440
Did you think I wouldn't know?

347
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,720
I'm talking about your heart.

348
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,480
What do you mean by that?

349
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,080
I received the reports on it after the surgery.

350
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,570
That is why I rushed your marriage.

351
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,190
I acted like I didn't know and did all that for your good.

352
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,910
How could you make things end up like this?

353
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,190
You should have talked with me, whether it's marriage or your heart!

354
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,230
What can you do without me?

355
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,180
So, what are you going to do now?

356
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,370
CEO Min is one thing, but what about Yeon Woo?

357
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,220
I've decided to end the contract with Yeon Woo.

358
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,510
You've already wrapped it up?

359
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,090
Yes.

360
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,410
All right. That may be the right process.

361
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,720
Good job.

362
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,350
I'll take care of the executives, so you just worry about the general meeting.

363
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,130
Let's get rid of CEO Min for sure this time.

364
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,230
I understand.

365
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,850
 We've arrived safely in Seoul with Ms. Yeon Woo.

366
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,550
 We will leave for your home soon.

367
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,210
 Thank you for everything.

368
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,240
 I pray that you will have a long and healthy life.

369
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,910
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

370
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,760
Secretary Hong, it's me.

371
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,390
Ms. Yeon Woo?

372
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,390
No. I only gave her a ride home.

373
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,600
Yes, got it.

374
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,540

375
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,860
Gosh, goodness.

376
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,680
Ms. Yeon Woo, shouldn't you still go home and talk with Deputy CEO—

377
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,840
No.

378
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,680
No way.

379
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,510
Why would she go to a bastard who dumped my princess of a lady!

380
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,690
It's not exactly that he dumped me.

381
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,370
What do you mean it's not?

382
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,320
You mustered the courage to even confess your feelings to him, My Lady!

383
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,420
Who does he think he is! So ridiculous!

384
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,430
No, it's not funny.

385
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,620
Well, I'm sure he had a reason for it.

386
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,340
Still, how could you call the Deputy CEO a bastard?

387
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,610
Reason? What reason?

388
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,220
Oh, are you taking his side because you're the servant of your young master?

389
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,380
Servant?

390
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,240
It's not right to leave the house just because she got rejected after confessing!

391
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,300
I mean, I wouldn't call it being rejected—

392
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,420
She did well. She totally did well.

393
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,150
Then, should she stay there after he turned her down? How pitiful!

394
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,370
Did I say she should just stay there?

395
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,400
That's right! I got dumped, rejected,

396
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,460
and turned down pitifully!

397
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,840
Happy? Are you happy now? Are you satisfied?

398
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,880
Are you satisfied?

399
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,870
Brother.

400
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,140
I'm sorry.

401
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,790
No, wait...

402
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,060
this is my house.

403
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,220
You should tell us honestly about your health condition right now.

404
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,190
I'm grateful that the executives are worried about my health—

405
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,800
No, this is not a personal problem but a problem involving all of SH.

406
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,380
Director Go, let's not be too hard on him.

407
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,830
It's not like anything is going to suddenly happen.

408
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,010
If the shareholders hear about this, this will become a major risk.

409
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,500
Give us your statement as soon as possible.

410
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,550
If you don't, we have no choice but to accept the dismissal proposal.

411
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,850
Did you have a good time in Jeju?

412
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,820
Your heart isn't in good condition. Don't travel too far.

413
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,410
What if you collapse like that?

414
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,320
How nice of you to worry about me, CEO.

415
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,410
Thank you.

416
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,110
When you resign from the company,

417
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,740
you should take care of your health first.

418
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,710
Deputy CEO.

419
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,090
Yeon Woo mustn't know about my dismissal proposal

420
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,480
nor my heart problem.

421
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,920
Yes, understood.

422
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,660
You knew that Yeon Woo was at my house?

423
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:22,470
Yeon Woo's husband died of a similar illness before he died.

424
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,950
After that, Yeon Woo also threw herself into a well.

425
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,990
A well?

426
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,180
Are you saying Yeon Woo tried to kill herself?

427
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,550
I think so.

428
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:39,320
I don't want to cause her the same pain.

429
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,650
So, keep this a secret from her.

430
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,910
Okay, I understand.

431
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,280
You want me to try making my own clothes?

432
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,210
When SH New York opens,

433
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,310
you can launch your own brand, Yeonwoo, along with Midam.

434
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,090
Do you think I can do that?

435
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,620
Of course!

436
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:16,190
After our show, so many people asked if you would open a pop-up store at SH.

437
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:20,020
And so, I prepared this!

438
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,530
This is a proposal regarding the pop-up.

439
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,070

440
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,100
I guess you haven't heard from the Deputy CEO yet.

441
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,120
Gosh, the more I think about it, the more mad I get.

442
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,150
Who does he think is to reject My Lady!

443
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,200
My Lady is so much better than him!

444
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,630
I shouldn't be doing this right now.

445
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,370
I should also leave this house quickly—

446
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,220
- You were here? 
 - Yeah.

447
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,380
This is good enough. You can leave.

448
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,380
Why is that...

449
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,010
Wait a minute...

450
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,880
Did I see it wrong?

451
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,540
There's no way the watch is over there.

452
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,090
No. This is not what's important right now.

453
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,710
Where are you going with that?

454
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,740
I could just tell you got caught while sneaking off somewhere.

455
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,060
Why? Were you going to Mourning Clothes?

456
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,870
No! Where would I go at this hour?

457
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,050
I want to go, too. It so happens that I wanted to see her.

458
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,450
W-What do you mean go together? Where would we go?

459
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,550
You're so funny.

460
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,450
You lied about telling me a secret about Mourning Clothes. Right?

461
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,840
Then let's call it even with this.

462
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,690
Okay, we're even!

463
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,420
Even?

464
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,860
I get Ms. Yeon Woo being here,

465
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,430
but why did you come here again?

466
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,190
And...

467
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,530
with this handsome oppa at that...

468
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,890
And what's with this food setup?

469
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,110
You know what they say about a needle going with the thread.

470
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,660
Since I came, I decided to make dinner, too.

471
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,210
I came to meet my coworker.

472
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,240
I'm sorry, Na Rae.

473
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,090
But, Sis, try some of this.

474
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:39,400
I've never seen such large and plump grapes before! They're sweet and crunchy!

475
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,050
- It is good! 
 - Have more.

476
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:49,060
That's what I'm saying! Who are you and why are you here—

477
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,580
I'm Seong Pyo's girlfriend.

478
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,790
Really?

479
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,760
You didn't know?

480
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,180
It was pretty clear they were a thing.

481
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,580
Ms. Yeon Woo.

482
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,560
Sa Wol, I'm here!

483
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,320
Hong Seong Pyo!

484
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,510
Wow, this is an honor.

485
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,250
Mourning Clothes is walking me home.

486
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,970
Keep it a secret at work for me

487
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,750
about how I left home.

488
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,260
Okay.

489
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,710
In return, do me a favor.

490
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,750

491
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,980
 Hey!

492
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,310
 Stop following me!

493
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,170
 - Did you get hurt? 
 - Forget it!

494
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,210
 Just hold still.

495
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,600
I will keep liking you, so just don't push me away.

496
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,940
That is what I'm asking of you.

497
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,310
Take it back. I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

498
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,660
What? I don't hear you!

499
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,480
- Tae Min! 
 - Stop!

500
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,530
If you say anymore, I'll be embarrassed.

501
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,420
I'll be going. Good night!

502
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,390

503
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,900
These are pictures I've taken of Kang Tae Ha.

504
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,450
CEO.

505
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,360
I need evidence of Tae Ha's contract marriage.

506
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,070
Whatever that is, bring it to me, no matter what.

507
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,440
Yes, I understand.

508
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,180
And just like the tabloids last time, spread rumors that

509
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,820
it would be difficult for Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha of SH to run the company because of his heart ailment.

510
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,200
Don't worry about that, either.

511
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,520
Goodbye.

512
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,180
As expected, it appears she will use the heart ailment.

513
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,920
It means she will finally end Kang Tae Ha's lifeline this time.

514
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,520
 Don't be too resentful and pass into Paradise.

515
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,670
I think I've heard that voice before.

516
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,060
Deputy CEO.

517
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,340
I have something to report to you.

518
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,430
What is it? Is something wrong?

519
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,980
I found the culprit who tried to ruin the fashion show.

520
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,820
I've also gathered evidence for leaking the designs.

521
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,830
You should take a look.

522
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,670
What should we do?

523
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,260
Meet with them right now.

524
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,960
I've confirmed that it was Deputy Yoo...

525
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,170
who leaked the designs online and changed the models' schedules.

526
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,530
We have evidence as well.

527
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,710
He said to terminate your position by the end of this month without anyone knowing.

528
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,180
As of today, Team Leader Oh will take over your work, Deputy Yoo.

529
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,950
He is saying...

530
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,740
he won't even see my face now.

531
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,640
Thank you for your past work.

532
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,840

533
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,890
It's me.

534
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,890
I must meet with you.

535
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,510
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,590
Did you look into what I asked for?

537
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,670
If you want your money, do your job properly.

538
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,800
Instead of resenting me later.

539
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,560
 Don't be too resentful and pass into Paradise.

540
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,980
Yeah.

541
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,600
Okay.

542
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,480
Okay.

543
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,300
Why?

544
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,880
Did Secretary Hwang say something to you?

545
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,200
N-No. It's nothing.

546
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,250
He does whatever CEO Min tells him to do,

547
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,000
so try not to get mixed up with him.

548
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,870
I won't.

549
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,350
It's so hard to meet with you face to face.

550
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:34,160
I called you several times before.

551
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,620
What can I do? There are too many people watching.

552
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,520
It's not that you don't need me anymore?

553
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,810
Fix your habit of trying to confirm what you already know.

554
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,280
I will tell the Deputy CEO everything.

555
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,560
How you've used me, Chairman.

556
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,500
The texts and photos we've exchanged, all of it—

557
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,150
What about that?

558
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:57,420
I asked you to keep an eye on my grandson because I was worried about him, so what?

559
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,090
You promised!

560
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,800
You said you would let me be with the Deputy CEO.

561
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,940
Tae Ha says he doesn't like you. What can I do about it?

562
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,220
I won't give up like this.

563
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,350
Okay. Do as you wish.

564
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:17,310
When people feel so wronged, they have trouble sleeping at night.

565
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,700
Also, watch out next time.

566
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,240
Someone else may come instead of me.

567
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,720
Let's see...

568
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,170
It's done.

569
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,930
Hello?

570
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,340
Oh, my, Congresswoman.

571
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,190
What led you to call me at this hour?

572
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,220
 Oh, I wanted to ask you a favor urgently.

573
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,570
A favor?

574
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,560
Who...

575
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,520
Park Yeon Woo?

576
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,010
 Tarak, have you tried it before?

577
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,830
 The taste of tarak.

578
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,850
 Dol Swe!

579
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,750
 Dol Swe!

580
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,640
♫  Why do I talk faster  ♫

581
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,630
♫  repeat myself, and feel out of breath?  ♫

582
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:16,930
♫  I keep wanting to walk with you, and as I walk, I end up smiling  ♫

583
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:25,300
♫  When I laugh along with you, it all feels like a dream  ♫

584
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,680
A US congresswoman wants to meet with Yeon Woo?

585
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,500
She is one of my longtime clients.

586
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,260
I think she fell in love with Yeon Woo after this past fashion show.

587
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,300
That's good.

588
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,840
Did you ask to see me about that?

589
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,680
No. It's not that.

590
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,900
I'm actually thinking of planning for the launch of overseas stores starting next month.

591
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,310
Along with Yeon Woo.

592
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,310
With Yeon Woo?

593
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,170
You guys are still newlyweds, and I felt bad.

594
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,830
So I called you to talk to you about it first.

595
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,470
Oh, I see.

596
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,650
 I keep wanting more of Yeon Woo.

597
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,830
 There's a lot of things I want to show and teach her.

598
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:27,540
 Will it be okay for you to be separated from her for a while?

599
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,790
 I can tell from looking at you since eyes don't lie.

600
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:37,410
 What I am looking at isn't traces of someone else, but you.

601
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,360
 Let's end our contract now.

602
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,190
 Did you even like me?

603
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,350
 I never did.

604
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,090
Well, the back of the sofa in the living room was too uncomfortable, so—

605
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,850
Brother, are you really going out with that girl named Sa Wol?

606
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,200
She's not a girl, but an older sister.

607
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,430
Forget that. I don't like it.

608
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,110
She looks like she has quite a temper!

609
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,270
That's why she is the perfect match for you, my younger sister.

610
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,260
Gosh, I don't want you to! I said I don't like it!

611
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,990
Gosh, stop it!

612
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,650
My head hurts already because the Deputy CEO is about to get kicked out of the company.

613
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,180
Must you add to my stress?

614
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:29,300
Your Deputy CEO is getting kicked out of the company?

615
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,260
What are you talking about?

616
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,750
Ms. Yeon Woo.

617
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,480
Did something happen to the Trickster Guy?

618
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,910
 Everyone found out about the Deputy CEO's heart ailment,

619
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,670
 so the situation at the company isn't great.

620
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,430
Because of you, Ms. Yeon Woo found out about everything!

621
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,810
The Deputy CEO told me to keep it a secret!

622
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:58,970
It's not like I knew Ms. Yeon Woo would be there.

623
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,610
Just act like you don't know anything.

624
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,020
Just don't get caught by the Deputy CEO.

625
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,710
It's not like you'll see him right now.

626
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,220
Secretary Hong!

627
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,590
Deputy CEO?

628
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,510
 Do you like it that much?

629
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,510
 Yeah!

630
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,670
Yeon Woo.

631
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,190
Why are you standing there in the rain?

632
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:17,480
What if you catch a cold?

633
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,090
Did you run over here?

634
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,950
Are you crazy? What if something happens to you?

635
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,570
You said you didn't like me.

636
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,700
It's okay if something happens to me.

637
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,480
As long as you are by my side.

638
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,860
I like you.

639
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:44,490
I like you.

640
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,800
I like you a lot.

641
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,740
I like you.

642
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,000
Will you run away again?

643
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,390
Will you hide your pain and not talk about your struggles like an idiot?

644
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,720
Are you going to do that again?

645
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,950
Because my heart is messed up,

646
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,340
I feel so bad for you, Yeon Woo.

647
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,920
I'll just be a selfish bastard.

648
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,670
So...

649
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,080
could you like me again?

650
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,380
Did you forget already?

651
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,450
I already asked you to be mine.

652
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,640
This is a new Dol Swe.

653
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,200
I did have to clean...

654
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,950
And it was a bit lonely without you, so I just got another friend...

655
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,520
Are you saying you added another family member?

656
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,900
You guys do good work by yourselves, don't you?

657
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,410
All right. You will be New Dol Swe,

658
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,680
and you will be Ma Dang Swe.

659
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,200
With these guys... wait, what was that?

660
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:05,450
This. I want to try doing this. Will that be all right?

661
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,400
If it's that, we can do it somewhere else.

662
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,420
This is all ice?

663
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,670
It's so fascinating how it's cold, and there's ice everywhere,

664
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,600
though it's not Snow Country or winter!

665
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,390
It's still too early to be surprised.

666
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,140

667
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,390
Dol Swe!

668
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,810
Dol Swe!

669
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,730
Nice! Good shot!

670
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,450
- Good shot! 
 - Good shot!

671
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,760
It's the best!

672
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,960
Curl! Curl!

673
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,310
It ended up touching my foot.

674
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,690
- Hey, Tae Ha! 
 - Bang!

675
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,440
Come here.

676
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,890
Hey!

677
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,590
Come here!

678
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,270
It was so much fun.

679
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,880
Can we come again next time?

680
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,660
Of course. As much as you want.

681
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,170
Should we just make a curling team named Team Park Yeon Woo?

682
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,980
- Yeah. 
 - Oh, no, never mind.

683
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,570
Should I just build an ice rink instead?

684
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,340
How much is an ice rink?

685
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,900
If it's not too bad, let's build one!

686
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:51,150
Maybe it'll be the cost of the palace where the king used to live.

687
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,670
It's that expensive?

688
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,750
Oh, ice cream, ice cream!

689
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,140
How could she go back after leaving the house for only a few days?

690
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,090
Come on! How great is it that the two of them reconciled?

691
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:40,010
I got my room back and all. It's a relief.

692
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:43,110
I was really worried that Ms. Yeon Woo might have made up her mind firmly.

693
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,050
Firm? Who is firm?

694
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,570
Do you know how softhearted My Lady is?

695
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,840
Gosh, she was designated a Loyal Wife. I'm sure she's no joke.

696
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,630
Loyal Wife?

697
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,640
Who is a Loyal Wife?

698
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,790
She's not? I heard the Deputy CEO talk about a well and all.

699
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,680
I thought it was strange.

700
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,630
Ms. Yeon Woo and Loyal Wife don't seem to match well.

701
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,970
Loyal Wife, my foot.

702
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,220
Since everyone is here,

703
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:21,180
we will start the voting regarding the dismissal proposal of Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha—

704
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,380
What? Is that true?

705
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,960
Yes.

706
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,150
 Hello, SH Seoul family.

707
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,560
 This is Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha.

708
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,920
 I want to tell you what I wasn't able to tell you before, Executives.

709
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,380
 From a long time ago,

710
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,400
 I've lived with a pacemaker implanted in my heart.

711
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,930
 - As a management officer of SH Seoul,  
 - Really?

712
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,900
 - I bow my head and apologize  
 - Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha?

713
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,110
 for not telling you clearly about

714
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:06,030
 - my current health condition.  
 - What'll happen to the company then?

715
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:13,110
 I know that my health issues may become a burden for our company.

716
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,000
 So that this doesn't happen again,

717
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,850
 I think our company needs a structural change.

718
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:23,260
SH needs to become a company where any proven management specialist

719
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:27,360
can participate in management now, even if they're not part of the owner's family.

720
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,670
I will make a proposal regarding this at the upcoming general meeting.

721
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,920
 Please vote regarding my dismissal then as well.

722
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:03,330
 Gosh, she was designated a Loyal Wife. I'm sure she's no joke.

723
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,450
No way. It's not true.

724
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:10,040
My Lady definitely said she got kidnapped.

725
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,190
 Lady...

726
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,960
But if she got kidnapped, he should have just taken her.

727
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,670
So why did he throw her in a well and put her shoes there?

728
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:28,600
As if to tell everyone that she died there.

729
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:33,160
It's not like he was trying to make her into a Loyal Wife...

730
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,360
If the watch that I saw was really Lady's

731
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,000
then something is definitely up.

732
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:53,580
There is no reason for that to be in the Kang family!

733
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,840
 Sa Wol!

734
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,060
 Are you cleaning right now?

735
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,740
What are you doing?

736
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,580
My Lady, let's go.

737
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,840
Let's get out of this house right now.

738
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,580
I was supposed to meet Tae Ha here.

739
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,140
W-Why is this here?

740
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:12,910
The one who threw you in the well probably picked it up when you dropped it.

741
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:15,640
- What are you saying? 
 - You still don't get it?

742
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,590
This Kang family...

743
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,340
killed you, My Lady.

744
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,370
That was a great move.

745
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,600
The responses are great.

746
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,250
It doesn't matter. I did that for everyone to hear.

747
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,590
Then where are we going now?

748
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,870
My Lady, where are you going?

749
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,110
My Lady!

750
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,810
My Lady—

751
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,840
My Lady.

752
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,820
My Lady!

753
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,180
My Lady!

754
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,370
My Lady!

755
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:50,200

756
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,770
What is that?

757
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:16,250
I asked what that is!

758
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:20,430
It is what you are thinking right now.

759
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,660
Why are you doing this to me?

760
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:26,030
What do you want me to do!

761
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:30,000
I am just trying to show you

762
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,900
what you are curious about, My Lady.

763
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,320
 This is arsenic.

764
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:47,360
 Keep adding this to Tae Ha's food until his wedding day.

765
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,480
 No. No...

766
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,580
 It's Park Yeon Woo's item.

767
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,950
 Don't be too resentful

768
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:16,850
 and pass into Paradise.

769
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:22,990

770
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:37,040
♫  You are trying to come to me again  ♫

771
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:43,820
♫  I pretend not to notice and turn around. Even when I turn my head  ♫

772
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:50,040
♫  The tears blur like cloudy rainwater  ♫

773
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:56,000
♫  I couldn't forget you today, either  ♫

774
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,580

775
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:02,980
 This is the worst of the ill-fated connection! Get out, I said!

776
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,280
 I'm sorry.

777
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,270
 It's not our fault. We're just stuck in terrible fate.

778
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:09,640
 If you're with the Young Lady...

779
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,090
 I will die just like myself in the past life since the fate is repeated.

780
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,730
 I will take care of the Deputy CEO Kang as you wished.

781
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:18,070
 For the love of God, stop!

782
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:20,060
 There is no place for me to withdraw.

783
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,690
 Mom...

784
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,590
 I will resign from the Deputy CEO position.

785
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:26,050
 Because of that woman, you're giving up!

786
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:28,150
 I will only think about myself along with Eun Woo.

787
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,770
 Don't worry.

788
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:34,140
 I will not let my fate defeat me nor would I run away.

789
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,150
 I will keep us together, no matter what.

790
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:41,180
♫  I pretend not to notice and turn around. Even if I turn my head  ♫
