1
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,060

2
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,330
Congratulations.

3
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,340
His Excellency reached the top position of Hanseongbu, did he not?

4
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,670
To think he is the mayor of Hanseong...

5
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,150
I am so jealous.

6
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,000
- He's so amazing. 
 - Congratulations!

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,670
You must be so happy.

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,670
Congratulations.

9
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,700
Gosh, stop it.

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,370
It's not like I got promoted. It is embarrassing to get congratulated like this.

11
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,810
No, is this not all thanks to your assistance, Mayor's wife?

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,920
Please tell us your secret.

13
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,230
Then I guess I should only tell Madam Yoon about it.

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,200
What do you mean by that?

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,450
Your late husband was a jinsa, right? 
  (A scholar who has only passed the first civil examination)

16
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,070
And both of your sons have never taken the state exam.

17
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,870
What is the point of having wealth?

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,770
A noble without a government position is all about flash and no substance.

19
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,670
Goodness, you are right.

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,920
Madam Yoon, you should learn a thing or two.

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:48,850

22
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,040
The state exam is coming up soon. What in the world are you doing?

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,950
You already know, Mother.

24
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,860
I am not interested in taking the state exam.

25
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,150
It is better that Brotherâ€”

26
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,690
You must take over everything in the Kang family.

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,050
The state exam that Tae Ha did not take and bearing an heir!

28
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,080
All of it!

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,940
I am sorry.

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,650
But I cannot live according to your wishes.

31
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,570
I will do whatever it takes...

32
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,440
I will do whatever it takes to make Tae Min pass the state exam,

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,850
so, please...

34
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,600
please do not kick us out.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,380
I will do whatever it takes...

36
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,000
So please just spare our lives...

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,020
Your mouth, your mouth!

38
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,920
Damn your mouth!

39
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,430
How dare a woman cry out loud!

40
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,060
If you had done a good job, Tae Ha and Tae Min would have passed the state exam

41
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,350
and saved our Kang family several times over already.

42
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,030
All you have done is leech off our food after you married into our family.

43
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,850
How dare you talk back to me!

44
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,960
Whether you bribe someone or have someone take the test for them,

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,640
you must make sure they pass the test this time!

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,950
 You know very well

47
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,700
 how Chairman Kang raised you.

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,250
In his dead son's place, he had you in the palm of his hand and used you like a puppet.

49
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,360
Isn't that so?

50
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,460
- Is that not so! 
 - No...

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,350
Stop this!

52
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,660
Neither Tae Ha nor I believe you.

53
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,430
Leave right now.

54
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,480
No...

55
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,180
You should watch out, too.

56
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,040
No...

57
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,930
Tae Ha!

58
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,080
Tae Ha.

59
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,250
No...

60
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,680
No...

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,880

62
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,340
But is everything over now that the bad guy got caught?

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,510
Of course.

64
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,810
CEO Min will be getting investigated soon, too.

65
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,690
But why do I keep smelling something fishy?

66
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,260
Something fishy? This smells amazing, though.

67
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,040
 I'm home.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,750
- Oh, Na Rae! 
 - You're home.

69
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,960
You must be tired from your part-time job.

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,840
Go wash your hands and eat.

71
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,630
It's kimchi fried rice!

72
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,370
I'll wash up quickly and be back.

73
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,240
- Don't eat first. 
 - Okay.

74
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,600
No matter how much I think about it, something's off.

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,410
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,590
That guy seemed to get caught too easily.

77
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,670
He just appeared in front of everyone at the event

78
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,920
as if to say, "I'm here."

79
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,870
Gosh, something feels off about this.

80
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,310
Stop.

81
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,370
You're feeling more like that because you keep thinking that way.

82
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,860
And your fart ends up smelling fishy.

83
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,080
My fart doesn't smell.

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,730
It does.

85
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,780
Let's eat, let's eat.

86
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,930
Hey, Na Rae! Hurry up and come out!

87
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,100
Hurry up and come out!

88
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,670
 In that room where there isn't even that much light,

89
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,960
 Seo Yoon Hee was there all by herself for several months.

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,410
 The person who killed Seo Yoon Hee was your grandfather.

91
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,660

92
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,230

93
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,210
I picked this up at the annex at that time.

94
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,110
I wondered if you knew what it was.

95
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,320
Is it your mother's?

96
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,080
Yes.

97
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,630
I thought I had lost it.

98
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,410
Thank you.

99
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,990
I barely have any items my parents left me.

100
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,900
Yeon Woo, there is something I want to confirm.

101
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,080

102
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,800
The content of the diary is the same.

103
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,490
I thought everything would return to normal after the CEO Min issue was resolved.

104
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,930
I guess there is still something that hasn't been resolved.

105
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,870
Do you think that has to do with Grandfather?

106
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,340
After my parents passed away,

107
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,750
I was in so much agony because it felt like my fault.

108
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,890
But I felt a bit better after thinking it was CEO Min's fault

109
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,290
just like what Grandfather told me.

110
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,570
I think it was since then

111
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,600
that I understood everything in my mind

112
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,810
and ignored my heart and feelings.

113
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,160
What about right now?

114
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,530
Do you want to know the truth?

115
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,370
Honestly...

116
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,670
I'm scared.

117
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,970
Checking the truth with Grandfather

118
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,150
and just moving on...

119
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,860
and turning a blind eye.

120
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,430
Though it may be scary,

121
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,640
I trust your decision regardless of what that may be.

122
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,900
But make sure you don't ever ignore your feelings again.

123
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,040
It's okay if it takes some time to find out

124
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,500
what you want and what you want to do about it.

125
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,280
So don't run away.

126
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,440
Because I will be by your side.

127
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,990
Thank you.

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,810
I don't know what you're thinking,

129
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,050
but it will be best to leave here as soon as possible.

130
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,690
If you want to make sure Tae Min gets his share even a little bit,

131
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,340
be wise and know your place.

132
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,140
Will you provide Tae Min with his share?

133
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,780
Of course.

134
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,900
Since Tae Min is also Jung Hoon's son.

135
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,090
He never saw his father's face and never really received love.

136
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,500
That's all your fault, Father.

137
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,490
My fault?

138
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,580
Did you forget? I definitely told you I don't need a child.

139
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,340
I told you I only need Tae Ha as my grandson.

140
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,890
But you chose to give birth to Tae Min despite that.

141
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,200
Yes. You did say that.

142
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,170
But you must be upset.

143
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,240
The grandson you raised however you wanted because he was so precious

144
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,000
is now acting however he wants.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,130
Don't get so upset already.

146
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,510
You don't know what else might happen.

147
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,170
These are the schedule and details of Park Yeon Woo's brand launch pop-up.

148
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,420
Midam says they will negotiate broadcasting sponsorship before the launch.

149
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,110
Broadcast?

150
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,110
Are you saying it will be on TV?

151
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,330
It is a clothing sponsorship offered to Midam,

152
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,030
and they said they would negotiate for your clothes to be a part of it, too.

153
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,460
Should we check the schedule and proceed with the PR?

154
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,130
Tae Ha.

155
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,860
I'm sorry. What did you say?

156
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,760
Please review this regarding

157
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,120
Park Yeon Woo's pop-up.

158
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,850
Tae Min.

159
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,600
Tae Min, did you see this?

160
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,900
- Wow, this is so... 
 - This is strange.

161
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,250
How many times have I told you that you can't write a proposal like this?

162
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,210
Pardon?

163
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,380
If you don't know how to write it, ask me.

164
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,490
What are we going to do about your inflexibility?

165
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,470
Hey, Tae Min, is something up with the Deputy CEO?

166
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,470
I don't know. I'm not sure. Why?

167
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,210
Something seemed off during our meeting.

168
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,160
Should I say he seemed slightly out of it?

169
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,850
I feel like something is definitely up.

170
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,780
Gosh, you don't even know it, Team Leader.

171
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,180
How would Tae Min know?

172
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,560
The CEO is looking for you.

173
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,850
Really?

174
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,720
Okay.

175
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,720
Why is CEO Min's secretary taking Tae Min?

176
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,690
I guess she has something to say to her son.

177
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,280
Son?

178
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,600
Tae Min was Secretary Choi's son?

179
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,530
Seok Joo, are you doing this on purpose?

180
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,240
You really don't know?

181
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,150
Kang Tae Min is CEO Min's son.

182
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,800
Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha's younger brother.

183
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,110
Oh, that makes sense.

184
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,830
Secretary Choi is too young for that.

185
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,750
What?

186
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,980
Kang Tae Min!

187
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,150
Kang Tae Ha...

188
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,250
What did you say?

189
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,640
Grandfather did what?

190
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,330
To Kang Tae Ha's mom...

191
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,320
It's not true, right? You're lying, right?

192
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,340
What would I gain from telling you such a lie?

193
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,220
You really told Kang Tae Ha that?

194
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,030
After all these years? Why?

195
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,920
You need to use things like this at the appropriate time.

196
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,520
Though it was a bit sooner than I had expected.

197
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,240
Timing?

198
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,100
You're crazy.

199
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,300
Neither you nor Grandfather are in your right mind.

200
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,720
You've gone mad! How could you do that?

201
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,600
You could have told Kang Tae Ha at any time!

202
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,030
I told you I was waiting for the right time to tell him.

203
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,630
Because of this damn company?

204
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,630
- Is this that important? 
 - Of course!

205
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,970
Because I have nothing without SH!

206
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,040
You have nothing?

207
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,680
Forget it.

208
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,830
Never mind.

209
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,860
Things will get noisy for a bit, so stay at the hotel.

210
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,670
I don't want to. Why should I?

211
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,830
Tae Ha and Chairman Kang will meet.

212
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,960
Then, the effects of the conflict will spill over elsewhere.

213
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,580
Don't act like you're worried about me. It doesn't suit you.

214
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,250
I'm really curious. Why did you give birth to me?

215
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,990
So you could use me to steal the company?

216
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,500
Just keep your mouth shut and stay at the hotel.

217
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,850
You'll need to stay safe to receive your shares before the general meeting.

218
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,070
You know what?

219
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,790
You are so terribly cruel, CEO Min.

220
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,460
I'm thinking of kidnapping you, Trickster Guy,

221
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,470
because you are so cool.

222
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,390
Will that be all right?

223
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,130
Kidnap?

224
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,240
So why did you have to be so handsome?

225
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,070
These eyes, nose, and lips.

226
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,850
As if they were each masterfully crafted.

227
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,630
I will kidnap you and take you home right now,

228
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,440
so don't think about anything else and rest up at home today.

229
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,380
You got that?

230
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,340
Shall we, then?

231
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,970
Please get in.

232
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,200
The Team Leader showed me the blueprint for the pop-up store,

233
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,420
and it was so neatly designed.

234
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,480
I heard you worked very hard on it, Deputy Yoo.

235
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,140
Thank you.

236
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,560
It's nothing. It is my job, after all.

237
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,450
Great work.

238
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,480
Excuse me...

239
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,340
I have something to say to you two in private.

240
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,930
After I entered the marketing team,

241
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,810
I was watching you under...

242
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,150
Chairman's orders, Deputy CEO.

243
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,100
What did you say?

244
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,540
All the conversations I've had with Chairman are in here.

245
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,900
Including the photo I sent of Park Yeon Woo.

246
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,330
D-Deputy Yoo, w-what is this...

247
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,270
He also knew about your contract marriage.

248
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,760
Chairman was also responsible for the bride not showing up for the wedding.

249
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,510
Also, it was all a lie that he was getting surgery in the USâ€”

250
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,330
Stop.

251
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,810
Stop it now. That's enough.

252
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,260
I'm... really sorry.

253
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,610
Why are you telling me this now?

254
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,860
I was ashamed...

255
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,870
of deceiving people who had trusted me.

256
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,360
I will take responsibility for what I have done in whatever way possible.

257
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,120
All right.

258
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,390
Deputy Yoo, you can leave.

259
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,470
I must meet with Grandfather.

260
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,110
Right now?

261
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,430
How about you take some time to organize your thoughts firstâ€”

262
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,680
No, I think I'll need to go now if I want to organize my thoughts.

263
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,130
Then I will go with you.

264
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,950
This is something I must resolve.

265
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,560
Yeon Woo, go on home first.

266
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,390
What brings you here? You didn't even call me.

267
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,660
What? Is there a problem?

268
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,270
I heard you took care of the business with the congresswoman as well.

269
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,610
Grandfather, did you know...

270
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,950
from the start that Yeon Woo and I were in a contract marriage?

271
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,370
Let's get some lunch together if you haven't had lunch yet.

272
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,530
Were you also the one...

273
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,460
who let my mom die that day in the annex?

274
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,300
Where are you heading out to?

275
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,560
The Deputy CEO said to take you home.

276
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,460
I must go to Grandfather's house.

277
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,260
Chairman's house?

278
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,460
Why would you go there?

279
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,010
We don't have much time, so let's hurry.

280
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,390
M-Me, too?

281
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,890
Ms. Yeon Woo, wait for me!

282
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,210
Who told you that? Was it CEO Min?

283
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,960
Your mom had a heart ailment.

284
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,010
You know that, too.

285
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,700
That day, someone definitely locked the door from the outside.

286
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,820
Please tell me.

287
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,950
Did you neglect my mother in the annex and lied...

288
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,490
saying CEO Min was behind it all?

289
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,580
Grandfather!

290
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,730
What about it?

291
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,280
I did that for my own child. What's wrong with that?

292
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,250
If it wasn't for Yoon Hee, Jung Hoon would've never ended up like that.

293
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,740
I was going to give him everything.

294
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,130
But then, that useless girl came along and dared to get in the way.

295
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,970
How could you do that?

296
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,920
Because he was my child.

297
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,600
No parent wishes bad things for their children.

298
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,400
Is that why you did that to me, even lying to me in the process?

299
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,330
Of course!

300
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,500
Because you are also one of my own.

301
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,800
Did you forget?

302
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,210
When you lost your parents, I was the one who took care of you and raised you!

303
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,210
- I saved you! 
 - That's not true!

304
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,860
You pushed me into hell.

305
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,500
After I pulled away from my mom, who held onto my hands to the end,

306
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,050
I lived all my life with agonizing guilt.

307
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,730
My heart was a mess; resenting and hating CEO Min!

308
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,590
That is why I am saying I will give you everything!

309
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,540
If you did what I told you for your marriage, there would have been no problems!

310
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,800
But because of that unwarranted girl,

311
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,530
you would give up everything including the company?

312
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,040
Goodness! You are as much of a failure as your father.

313
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,080
Do you think I would forgive that girl for making you this way?

314
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,550
Don't you mess with her.

315
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,230
I am saying don't do anything! Now, I amâ€”

316
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,820
not your grandson anymore.

317
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,180
What did you say?

318
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,120
I also won't forgive you

319
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,830
for letting my mom die like that.

320
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,400
You! Damn you!

321
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,020
You ungrateful bastard!

322
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,700
Fine! Do as you wish!

323
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Let's see if you say that after everything you have is taken from you.

324
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:47,030
In the end, your father, Jung Hoon, also came back begging me to save Yoon Hee.

325
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,080
Don't worry.

326
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,640
That'll never happen.

327
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,930
Should I try going in?

328
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,520
No. I will go in.

329
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,650
Tae Ha!

330
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,010
Tae Ha!

331
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,160
Tae Ha!

332
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,040
Tae Ha, are you all right?

333
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,230
No way.

334
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,070
Chairman...

335
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,530
Where are you going?

336
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,500
I need to go to Lady.

337
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,280
How shocked must she be after Young Master collapsed?

338
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,940
I should go at least and make some porridgeâ€”

339
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,340
Sa Wol, I don't think this is the time for that.

340
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,450
What do you mean it's not?

341
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,230
I am as upset and angry as you are, Sa Wol.

342
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,010
I feel bad when I think about the Deputy CEO.

343
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,500
But there are times when I shouldn't step in.

344
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,160
Let's wait for them until the two of them look for us.

345
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,420
He will continue to sleep because of the medication.

346
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,410
Don't worry too much.

347
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,340
Have him admitted to the hospital?

348
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,270
I never heard anything about that.

349
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,790
As I thought, he never told you.

350
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:21,360
Tae Ha's heart won't last much longer if left like this.

351
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,970
What do you mean it won't last?

352
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,910
Do you mean...

353
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,770
He has to be hospitalized first.

354
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,940
He was okay until recently.

355
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,780
He started getting worse three months ago all of a sudden.

356
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,710
I don't know what happened during that time...

357
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,650
T-Three months ago?

358
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,610
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

359
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,310

360
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,480
Thank you for your gift.

361
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,870
That was pretty good.

362
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,050
Tae Ha should know, too.

363
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,440
He's all grown up now.

364
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,710
You've still got a long way to go.

365
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,200
You only do what you did when you have nothing to lose.

366
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,550
How impudent.

367
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,360
I think you have more to lose than I do, Father.

368
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,950
As long as Yeon Woo is around, Tae Ha will never return to you.

369
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,390
What will you do? Yeon Woo isn't sick like Seo Yoon Hee.

370
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,320
You really have no fear, don't you?

371
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,660
Don't threaten me.

372
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,930
What you and I did is more than enough to be a conglomerate family gossip that people like to hear about.

373
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,070
Will you be okay with that?

374
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,730
The internet these days is so scary.

375
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,570
It appears you've also got a long way to go, Father.

376
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,100
All right, okay.

377
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,720
You need to be at least this level for me to go up against you.

378
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,340
Thanks to you, it's become clear to me what I should do.

379
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,620
All right. Thanks.

380
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,950
 He started getting worse three months ago all of a sudden.

381
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,770
If it was three months ago,

382
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,690
that was ever since I came here.

383
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,060
Gosh, no way.

384
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,230
That can't be.

385
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,940
Do you know why the crepe-myrtle blossom is the crepe-myrtle blossom?

386
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,350
That is because they say it blossoms for a hundred days...

387
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,010
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

388
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,550
When one hundred days have passed since you arrived here,

389
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,600
the last crepe-myrtle blossom will fade.

390
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,780
The last time portal to return to Joseon will open that day.

391
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,770
Are you saying I can return to Joseon?

392
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,070
Of course, you don't have to return.

393
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,810
However...

394
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,250
If you choose to remain here, Lady,

395
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,370
Kang Tae Ha's heart will stop...

396
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,570
just like in your past life.

397
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,570
 I will die?

398
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,270
 I will end up dead like my past life?

399
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,020
 If my heart suddenly gets worse because of that fate...

400
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,980
 Your time, Yeon Woo...

401
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,360
 - In the past, even now... 
 - The Yeon Woo that I know...

402
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,930
 - Don't be too resentful and pass into Paradise. 
 - Save me.

403
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,660
 Please, do something about my heart...

404
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,340
 Please, do something about this!

405
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,940
You're telling me to choose whether I will return or stay?

406
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,430
You always have a choice.

407
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,740
If I stay here, he will die.

408
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,730
Are you saying that is my fate?

409
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,630
If the past doesn't change,

410
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,780
the present can't change.

411
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,610
Why are you doing this to me?

412
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,270
I am merely repaying my debt.

413
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:19,610
To keep the promise I made to someone a long time ago.

414
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,440
 Hey, look at those eyes!

415
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,860
 - She's a monster! 
 - A monster!

416
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,290
 - Go away! 
 - I said, go away!

417
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,960
 - Monster! 
 - Just go away and die!

418
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,510
 Go away! So disgusting! I said, go away!

419
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,500
 Go away! Go away!

420
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,010
 I said, go away!

421
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,390
 Go away!

422
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,030
 - How dare you! 
 - Die!

423
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,630
 Hey, let's run away! Run!

424
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,300
 Are you all right?

425
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,190
 Goodness, you are hurt.

426
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,900
 Let's hurry up and go to the physician.

427
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,540
 This is yours. Right?

428
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,570
 Please take it.

429
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,020
 I'll give it to you.

430
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,640
 To me?

431
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,000
 No, you don't have to do that.

432
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,280
 In return, if you see someone in trouble, you should help them.

433
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,160
 That's all I want.

434
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,180
 That is why I am giving it to you.

435
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,560
 As a token of my promise to do so.

436
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:53,020
So that is why you saved me when I fell in the well?

437
00:31:53,870 --> 00:32:01,120
Since one person's small act of kindness can sometimes save a person.

438
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,860
All I can do is transport you in time, Lady.

439
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:14,580
You should choose for yourself what to do in your time, as you've always done.

440
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,240
â™«  Like the day we first met  â™«

441
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,900
â™«  You were always smiling  â™«

442
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,550
â™«  I just look at it and then blankly drew it again in the night sky.  â™«

443
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,380
â™«  I just look at it and then blankly drew it again in the night sky.  â™«

444
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,660
I can finally understand a bit

445
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,640
as to why my mother's diary hasn't changed...

446
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,700
and why I came here.

447
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:59,590
â™«  I pretend not to notice and turn around. Even when I turn my head  â™«

448
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,180
â™«  The tears blur like cloudy rainwater  â™«

449
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,690
Don't worry.

450
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,700
Everything will work out.

451
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,800
W-What are you doing here?

452
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,430
What do you mean? Don't you remember?

453
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,950
You made such a fuss asking me to stay by your side last night!

454
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,810
"Yeon Woo, I like you so much.

455
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,240
Please don't leave. Stay with me."

456
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,640
You even said those things in your sleep.

457
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,530
I-I did that? I talked in my sleep?

458
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:57,830
You even asked me to kiss you and puckered your lips like this.

459
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,650
You're teasing me right now. Right?

460
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,710
You noticed?

461
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,510
Why? Are you mad that I played a joke on you?

462
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,350
I scared you a lot, right?

463
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,890
I'm sorry.

464
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,890
I won't ever worry you again.

465
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,710
Are you sure you're okay?

466
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,290
How could I not be okay when someone who cares for me so much is with me?

467
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:45,550
Yeon Woo, do you want to go somewhere with me today?

468
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,960
I can't believe how poor I am.

469
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,900
I was going to buy something for My Lady when I go see her.

470
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,940
Should I sell something here?

471
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,720
Sis, I'm going to work.

472
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,150
I have two jobs today, so I'll be a bit late.

473
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,950
Na Rae!

474
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,570
I also want to work part-timeâ€”

475
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,980
I want to work a part-time job, too.

476
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,120
By chance, could you introduce me to one?

477
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,900
Brother would get mad if he found out. Is that all right?

478
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,400
I can just do it in secret!

479
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,150
If you introduce me to one, I'll take care of the rest. Please?

480
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,530
Thank you.

481
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,970
Son, I told you to sleep with the blanket up to your neck even if it's hot.

482
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,150

483
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,590
Drink this.

484
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,020
Isn't it bitter?

485
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,280
Wow, it's tasty!

486
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,330
I will get you some water.

487
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,670
Oh my world!

488
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,870
Hey, work for me starting today!

489
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,410
I am a bit expensive, though.

490
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,180
You will pay me well, right?

491
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,420
Gosh, of course!

492
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,690
Bring me a copy of your checking account, health certificate, and ID.

493
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,400
- Okay? 
 - Wait.

494
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,400
ID...

495
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,960
Oh, right!

496
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,480
My face is my ID.

497
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,030
What?

498
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,210

499
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,990
Damn you. Why does she want me to bring so many things just to work?

500
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,590
Forget it! I won't do it!

501
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,530
But I also live in new Joseon...

502
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,360

503
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,500
I think you take very much after your parents.

504
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,260
What kind of people were they?

505
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:47,380
Mom was a warmhearted and strong person like you, Yeon Woo.

506
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:54,210
And Father... loved my mom a lot for that.

507
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:59,360
If they both got to see you, Yeon Woo, they would have really liked you.

508
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,000

509
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,190
She's the one.

510
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,470
The one who will be by my side forever.

511
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,080
She's pretty, right?

512
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,320
There has been no contact since the claimant is being investigated.

513
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,230
What should I do?

514
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,060
What about Director Hwang? You still can't reach him?

515
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,760
No. He hasn't come to work for the past few days.

516
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,550
Dig through Hwang Myeong Soo's personnel records and call all of them.

517
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,500
Bring him to me, no matter what. You got that?

518
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,100
Yes, I understand.

519
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,220
What's wrong?

520
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,200
I thought I saw someone.

521
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,020
Who?

522
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,400
Never mind. I guess I saw it wrong.

523
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,140

524
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,810

525
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,660
 You said you would perform the surgery!

526
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,250
 You said you would do the surgery and save them!

527
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,740
 So why did you do that?

528
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,530
 Why did you do that? Why?

529
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,810
 Why did you do that to my Ji Eun?

530
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,400
Don't worry.

531
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,560
Everything's almost over.

532
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,120

533
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,640
Will you really cut ties with Grandfather?

534
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:34,500
I'm not so sure... since Grandfather was my only family.

535
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,550
You said before that you lived according to Grandfather's wishes.

536
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,610
That was just your love for Grandfather.

537
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:53,200
It's not something you did wrong nor something to regret about.

538
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:07,020
I just can't forgive Grandfather nor me.

539
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,360
It's okay.

540
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,020
Forgiveness isn't everything.

541
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,180
What's important...

542
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,740
is listening to what this says.

543
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,880
However you may feel.

544
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,750
Should we live at a place like this?

545
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,110
Somewhere quiet where no one knows we're here.

546
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,100
Sounds good.

547
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,990
Gosh, it's bitter.

548
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,980
Hey. Lucky you.

549
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,550
Though you're bitter, you're still useful.

550
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:05,660
I'm nothing here.

551
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,450
Sa Wol, what are you doing here?

552
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,600
I was just here.

553
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,190
It's me, isn't it?

554
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,150
You are struggling because you no longer like me. Right?

555
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,940
Pardon?

556
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,600
I heard from Na Rae that you are looking for part-time jobs.

557
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,280
Are you thinking of leaving our house?

558
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,660
No, that's not itâ€”

559
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,480
Why are you doing this, then?

560
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,760
Why are you drinking canned beer?

561
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,820
It's just that...

562
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,600
I feel like an idiot in new Joseon!

563
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,170
I-Idiot?

564
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,900
All I have is just my tacky name.

565
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,780
I'm not helpful to My Lady or making money working.

566
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,900
All I'm doing is living off your family at your home!

567
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,350
Sa Wol, you're allowed to do that.

568
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,780
You can live off of me.

569
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,290
Just marry me.

570
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,020
What?

571
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,240
I, Hong Seong Pyo,

572
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,010
want to take you as my wife, Sa Wol.

573
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,220
Will you let me?

574
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,120
I will.

575
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,910
I definitely want to.

576
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,550

577
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,660
Grandfather, it's me, Yeon Woo.

578
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,810
I want to meet with you tomorrow.

579
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,190
No, I will come to your home.

580
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,440
Yeah, all right. Okay.

581
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,720
Yes, it's me.

582
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,220
It appears we will have to proceed with what we discussed last time.

583
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,190
Looks like Director Hwang went into hiding.

584
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,580
Is he still absent without authorization?

585
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,260
The police kept calling him for his investigation as a testifier regarding the past incident

586
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,320
but they can't get in contact with him.

587
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,260
Do you think it involves CEO Min?

588
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,500
CEO Min is probably not plotting something new.

589
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,870
She's already shown all the cards in her hand.

590
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:07,180
It couldn't involve Chairman, could it?

591
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,900
I just feel like something is off.

592
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,290
I will tell you one more thing.

593
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,780
If necessary, fight against Chairman as well.

594
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,790
No matter what anyone says, you reached this point based on your ability.

595
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,540
So, don't shy away from him.

596
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,480
Forgive me for speaking out of line.

597
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,060
It's fine.

598
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,400
You've always crossed the line.

599
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,100
P-Pardon? I mean, I was, well...

600
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,950
I'm always on your side, soâ€”

601
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,970
I'm just saying I'm always grateful.

602
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:57,820
I'll apologize on behalf of CEO Min for everything she's done.

603
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,900
I'm sorry.

604
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,930
Why would you be sorry? You don't need to be.

605
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,550
I just thought I should do what I needed to do,

606
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,480
so look into that drug incident from last time again.

607
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,020
What do you mean by that?

608
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,450
I've just got an odd feeling.

609
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,880
You know CEO Min isn't that stupid.

610
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:24,710
And I want to believe she isn't that much of a mess.

611
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,580
What will you do about Grandfather?

612
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,340
I'm still thinking about it.

613
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:37,360
I want to figure out what I really want.

614
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,850
Then, the answer should present itself.

615
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,980
Okay.

616
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,260
I'm sure you will do just fine, whatever that may be.

617
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,790
Don't try too hard, though.

618
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,070
 Are you here?

619
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,800
 Come in here. I have something to show you.

620
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,520
It's very much like you. Right?

621
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:11,180
I instantly fell in love with it when I was young after seeing it in my father's gallery.

622
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,630
It was a painting that I couldn't have.

623
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,380
 Why can't I?

624
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,970
 I can run the gallery way better than Brother!

625
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:27,020
 And did I not find all these things here while following you around?

626
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,730
 I also have a share in this, too!

627
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,370
 All these things here aren't ours.

628
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:36,280
 Have I not told you that we will eventually donate everything to society?

629
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,970
 How does that make sense?

630
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,230
 Why do we have to do that?

631
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:42,410
 This is why I can't entrust this to you.

632
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,070
 Because of your greed! Do you understand?

633
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,480
 - Father! 
 - Stop.

634
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,490
 Let's stop talking about this now.

635
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,270
 No. I will take everything.

636
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:09,980
 I will possess everything I want, no matter what.

637
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,990
But to think this ended up hindering me.

638
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,800
It was because of this painting that I just watched and let you be,

639
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,920
not knowing you were eating away my precious grandson.

640
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,360
Did you say he is precious?

641
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,490
Then you should ask Tae Ha to forgive you.

642
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:43,560
Tell him you were wrong and are sorry for deceiving him all this time.

643
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,850
Yes, it is exactly these eyes

644
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,870
that are so similar to Yoon Hee's that they're so offensive to me.

645
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,540
It never moved before, but it started moving ever since you came.

646
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:08,070
You are even similar to Yoon Hee in how ominous you are.

647
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,780
So how could I just let you be?

648
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,080
Please stop this.

649
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,210
Things won't change by blaming someone else

650
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,390
for your twisted heart and your past wrongdoings, Grandfather.

651
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,200
So, please apologize.

652
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,490
You are human if you ask for forgiveness after doing something wrong.

653
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,880
Ask for forgiveness? Why should I?

654
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,320
Because you were everything to him after he lost the world.

655
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,110
You used his feelings of trust and love for you.

656
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:35,410
All I did was try to give Tae Ha everything.

657
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:41,130
Do you really not understand that your vain ambition caused Tae Ha more pain?

658
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,740
Don't hurt Tae Ha anymore.

659
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,980
If it weren't for you, everything would be fine.

660
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,820
Do you know that?

661
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,030
I beg you.

662
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,960
If you know a little bit of how much he cares for you,

663
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,690
please give Tae Ha an opportunity to forgive you.

664
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:11,620
Please... so he won't hurt anymore.

665
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,880
Just once, please.

666
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,980
Stop. I don't want to hear it anymore.

667
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,580
Don't ever come to me again.

668
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,320

669
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,300
 The customer can't answer the call right now.

670
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,460
 Please try again later.

671
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,710
Who are you? Where is Yeon Woo right nowâ€”

672
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,480

673
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,880
Geocheon-ro 37-1...

674
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,570
Geocheon-ro 37-1...

675
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,910
What are you going to do with me?

676
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,790
Not sure. What should I do with you?

677
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:39,000
From what I heard, I should send you off somewhere on a boat.

678
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,820
But I am a bit conflicted.

679
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,860
Seeing how pretty you are, you'll be worth quite some money.

680
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,420
Don't touch her recklessly.

681
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,190
We need to take good care of her until everything's done. You got that?

682
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,920
Okay.

683
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,970
Who hired you?

684
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:00,960
Is it Grandfather?

685
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,610
Where are you trying to send me?

686
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,910
It will be best not to know anything.

687
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:23,250
My stomach... My stomach hurts so much. Let me use the bathroom.

688
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,440
Didn't you just say you should take good care of me?

689
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,850
- Hey. 
 - Gosh, my stomach...

690
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,080
What are you doing?

691
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,750
What is it?

692
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,700
Hey, over there! Go!

693
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,780
I guess you won't be going with your pretty face.

694
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,610
Yeon Woo.

695
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,720
- Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up and move! 
 - Yes, sir!

696
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,430
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

697
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:19,530
I'm fine.

698
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,420
I'm sorry.

699
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,600
I'm really sorry.

700
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,490
My Lady, are you okay?

701
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,690
You're not hurt anywhere?

702
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,010
Secretary Hong, please take care of Yeon Woo.

703
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,440
Where are you going?

704
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,660
To Grandfather.

705
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,890
It's really over now.

706
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:58,810
Tae Ha!

707
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,720
There's no point in following him.

708
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,800
My Lady, you should just wait here.

709
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,330
Y-You... W-Why are you here?

710
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,240
How does it feel...

711
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,450
to be abandoned by the grandson you cherished?

712
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,480
It took so long for me to get here.

713
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:10,480
Do you finally understand what it feels like to lose someone precious to you?

714
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,480
That's what you did to me...

715
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,960
23 years ago.

716
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,930
Did you forget?

717
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:26,180
Your son... killed my wife.

718
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,010
Don't worry too much.

719
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:36,650
They're still family. I'm sure nothing will happen.

720
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,440
I'm just happy that you're okay, My Lady.

721
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,320
I don't know who it was, but whoever saved you will be blessed for life.

722
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,530
Saved me? Who did?

723
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:50,160
Someone supposedly contacted Young Master to say you got kidnapped, My Lady.

724
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,810
Mr. Hong, what is Sa Wol saying right now?

725
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:58,780
Supposedly, the Deputy CEO got a text message from an unknown number

726
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,830
saying that you were there, Ms. Yeon Woo.

727
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,650
An unknown number?

728
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:06,320
I also have a strange feeling about that.

729
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,290
I mean, who sent such a message?

730
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,930
My Lady, what's wrong?

731
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:17,630
I just find it weird.

732
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:23,840
How everything is happening as if expected.

733
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:29,120
All the people who were connected to me in Joseon

734
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:34,610
all had some impact on me here, whatever it may be.

735
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,590
If that is the case this time, too...

736
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:43,660
 Just like that knot, bring an end to the repeated intertwining connection.

737
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:49,080
 If it's a drug that Hwang Myeong Soo gave him,

738
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,520
 he will try to feed it to you, Tae Ha.

739
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,460
 Just like they did to my husband.

740
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,170
It's him.

741
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,800
You should remember it.

742
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,930
Your son caused the accident that led to my family's death.

743
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,390
No.

744
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:15,440
Kang Sang Mo, you killed them.

745
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,980
 Doctor, please take good care of my Ji Eun.

746
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,350
 Please save her.

747
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:24,880
 It was such a severe accident that I can't guarantee anything.

748
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,000
 Not only that, but she is pregnant, soâ€”

749
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,340
 I'll give up on the baby, so please just save my Ji Eun at least.

750
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:36,130
 Doctor, just a moment.

751
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,340
 Oh, okay.

752
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,220
 Doctor? Where is the doctor going?

753
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,330
 He needs to perform the surgery.

754
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,910
 Sir, please move to the waiting room.

755
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,860
 - Waitâ€” 
 - This way. This way, please.

756
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,650
 W-Wait, wait.

757
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,000
 Doctor!

758
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,070
 Sir! Sir!

759
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,310
 Doctor!

760
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,020
 Sir!

761
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,150
 Sir, let's go.

762
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,660
 - You can't be here. 
 - Wait, wait.

763
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:12,610
 Let go of me! Let go of me!

764
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:14,470
 You said you would do the surgery!

765
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,850
 You said you would perform the surgery!

766
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:21,040
 Let go! You said you would perform the surgery!

767
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,310
T-Then you are...

768
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,860
T-That guy from then...

769
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:29,090
You even switched the surgery so you could save your son, but they all died.

770
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:31,180
All of them!

771
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,620
You killed them all. You!

772
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:37,160
I was just trying to save my son.

773
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,150
What about Ji Eun? Is it okay for my wife to die then?

774
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,510
Does that make any sense!

775
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,570
L-Look...

776
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:48,470
For everyone, whatever they have is precious to them.

777
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:51,040
I-I just did the best I could,

778
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,140
and you were just unlucky.

779
01:02:56,020 --> 01:03:00,090
Luck? I was just unlucky?

780
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,510
A person died! A person!

781
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:07,340
And yet, you can say such things!

782
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,160
That is why I compensated you!

783
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,960
I gave you more than what you wanted.

784
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,520
Even that woman's parents were happy with it, so what's the matter?

785
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,300
Shut your mouth!

786
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,290
Fine! I guess that will work.

787
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:26,870
I can just kill you and pay money. Right?

788
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,570
Then that will be okay, yeah?

789
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,550
Right?

790
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,750
Grandfather!

791
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,120
Grandfather!

792
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,280
Grandfather! Grandfather!

793
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,280
Tae Ha.

794
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,770
It's that guy. It's that guy who was behind everything.

795
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:56,140
Min Hye Sook and Yeon Woo. They all plotted this together and deceived you!

796
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,790
I was just trying to separate you from them!

797
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:03,440
Look carefully! That is the real Kang Sang Mo.

798
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,410
A shameless and hideous old man who always blames others!

799
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,130
You don't believe your grandfather?

800
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:13,670
You can't do this to me! After all I did for you!

801
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:17,540
Are you the one who sent Yeon Woo's picture to me?

802
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:20,920
Did you do all this, hiding behind CEO Min?

803
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,070
As expected, you're smart.

804
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:25,710
You are very much Chairman Kang's grandson.

805
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,340
Tae Ha, w-what are you doing right now?

806
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,830
W-Why would you get on your knees?

807
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:51,310
Die!

808
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:02,180
 If you stay here, he will end up dying, Lady.

809
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:17,170

810
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,210

811
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:26,560
â™«  You are trying to come to me again  â™«

812
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:33,340
â™«  I pretend not to notice and turn around. Even when I turn my head  â™«

813
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:39,440
â™«  The tears blur like cloudy rainwater  â™«

814
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:47,090
â™«  I couldn't forget you today either  â™«

815
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:54,330
 I know I only have a few days left.

816
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:58,230
 Why didn't I know anything about spending an ordinary day all this time?

817
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:00,430
 I want to do everything with you now, Yeon Woo.

818
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:03,140
 My Lady, can we just not go back?

819
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:05,460
 Let's just live here together.

820
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,900
 Save me. Do something about my heart, please...

821
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,970
 This is the only way I can keep him alive.

822
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:15,170
 I plan to go back now to my Joseon.

823
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:18,020
 I don't want you to. You can't.

824
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,040
 I hope I'm remembered for a long time.

825
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,470
 Even just a trace of me having been here briefly.

826
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:27,520
 Hurry back. I'll wait for you here.

827
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,800
 I'm in love with you.

828
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:32,860
 I love you.

829
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,980
â™«  I can't reach it  â™«
