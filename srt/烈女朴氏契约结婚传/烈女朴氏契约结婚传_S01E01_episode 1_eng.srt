1
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,720

2
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:39,800

3
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,390
 Goodness, what are you doing?

4
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,580
 Geez, seriously.

5
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,430
 Passing through!

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,380
 Get in line!

7
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,730
 Wait for me!

8
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,530
 Hey, be careful!

9
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,930
It is so pretty. Look at the color.

10
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,110
- How does it look? 
 - This is perfect for you.

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,720
It looks so good on me. Right?

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,180
Hey, hey! Do not touch it.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,290
So, all of this is Master Ho Jeob's clothes. Right?

14
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,020
These are the best-selling clothes in Hanyang these days. 
  (Seoul's previous name)

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,330
Supposedly, he is reeling in all the money.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,140
You made it.

17
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,650
Let us go.

18
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,790
She is here!

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,560
Here, this way.

20
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,990
Please enter.

21
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,940
Are you Master Ho Jeob?

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,940
Spread it.

23
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,770
S-Spread?

24
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,600
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,380
Goodness!

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,420
Gosh, what are you doing!

27
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,700
Are you not here to make undergarments?

28
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,940
I will need to take measurements.

29
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,880
That is true, but how could a noblewoman just carelessly take off—

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,790
If you do not want my clothes, please leave.

31
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,730
- I happen to be a really busy person. 
 - No!

32
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,940
I will take it off. Of course, I should.

33
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,960
Yes, I should take it off right away.

34
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,470
 Have you heard the stories?

35
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,360
 After wearing one of Ho Jeob's clothes,

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,170
 a courtesan in Hwayeonok became the second Hwang Jin Yi, 
 (A famous courtesan)

37
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,420
 and the Ugly Old Maiden of Dwerong Village got married!

38
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,510
 Master Ho Jeob is a god of making clothes!

39
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,770
 A god!

40
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,510
- Please give me one! 
 - Did you make your selection?

41
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,790
 Move! I got here first!

42
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,220
 Goodness!

43
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,370
 - I came here first!  
 - Hey, get in line!

44
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,530
Here, great work.

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,460
Why is this all?

46
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,730
We sold so many clothes today.

47
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,840
These days, we are not making even half the profit as before.

48
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,680
Master Ho Jeob, maybe you have lost your touch.

49
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,550
Gosh, after paying workers wages and the price for fabric,

50
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,060
I am struggling as well.

51
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,000
I get that, but you dare say I have lost my touch?

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,160
What do you mean!

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
No matter what anyone says, your dressmaking ability is the best, Master Ho Jeob!

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,310
You are the best of Hanyang, no, all of Joseon!

55
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,770
I will be back in a few days.

56
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,710
Okay, okay, I will see you then.

57
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,300
She refuses to give in once, not once.

58
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,410
But why does she always keep her face covered?

59
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,260

60
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,790
Gosh, when will My Lady be back?

61
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,700
The madam will be here soon...

62
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,200
Madam, you are here.

63
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,030
Yes. What is Yeon Woo doing?

64
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,020
She is not sleeping already, is she?

65
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,550
She is reading a book.

66
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,530
A book?

67
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,000
You know about my friend, Jeong Shil, who lives in Okeum Village. Right?

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Jeong Shil said she was really sick, so I went to visit her...

69
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,500
Jeong Shil had her third child last month and should be at her familial home in Cheongju.

70
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,510
I was so worried about Jeong Shil at her familial home in Cheongju,

71
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,260
so I went out to ask her servant about her health—

72
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,900
You spend all day reading romance novels, so why do you refuse to get married?

73
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,690
What are you trying to do?

74
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,960
Mother, goodness.

75
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,070
This is just because of my own personal curiosity and scholarly exploration—

76
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,060
Park Yeon Woo!

77
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,920
I am sorry.

78
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,680
All of your peers got married, had children, and are living well.

79
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,710
So please get married now.

80
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,300
Please get married. Please!

81
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,940
Who would take me when I am well-known as the old maiden of Joseon?

82
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,280
Well-known?

83
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,360
Well-known?

84
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,980
Congratulations on receiving a marriage proposal from a family in Daegu.

85
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,820
No need for congratulations.

86
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,110
You did well.

87
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,260
- Gosh, it is so itchy. 
 - Goodness, what is this all about?

88
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,480
- Gosh, it is so itchy! 
 - Goodness!

89
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,010
Gosh, she must be crazy!

90
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,590
Is she in her right mind?

91
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,080
It is that lady again?

92
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,970
She is quite the incredible old maiden.

93
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,330
Gosh, I know. Right?

94
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,890
Do you know how many matchmakers you have chased out?

95
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,920
Why is it that you do not want to get married? Tell me!

96
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,900
I let you be because of your deceased grandfather's will.

97
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,300
But I can no longer! Brace yourself because this is it!

98
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,810
Mother.

99
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,370
Can you, Father, and I not live happily together?

100
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,920
Please?

101
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,000
No.

102
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,130
You are hungry, right?

103
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,340
What is it?

104
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,060
It is yoolran!

105
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,360

106
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,350
It is so tasty!

107
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,400
As always, you are the best, Sa Wol!

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,900
What are you going to do now?

109
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,410
It looks like Madam has really made up her mind.

110
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,500
All right, you should stop your dressmaking business first.

111
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,540
What if Madam—

112
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,090
What if Madam finds out?

113
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,720
If the precious daughter of a noble family

114
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,200
gets caught making and selling undergarments secretly—

115
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,950
Gosh, she would say it is i-im...

116
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,730
- I-Im— 
 - She would make a fuss about how it is immoral,

117
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,040
breaks the code of nobility, and is improper for my position.

118
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,370
You know so well, and yet you do this.

119
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,310
They are so lucky.

120
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:13,630
They can live however they want in that wide expanse of the sky.

121
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,240
Star...

122
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,340
please give us a husband who will marry My Lady.

123
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,690
Quickly, so she will come to her senses.

124
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,950
Give up, Sa Wol.

125
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,990
Even Heaven will not be able to do that.

126
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,540
 Are you inside?

127
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,710
What brings you here at this hour?

128
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,810
I have brought your marriage candidate offer.

129
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,480
I am not interested in getting married.

130
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,790
How is that for you to decide?

131
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,000
If you are the eldest son, you should consider the family.

132
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,510
Though our family may be fairly wealthy,

133
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,040
your grandfather and father remain merely in the jinsa rank. 
   (Lowest rank for scholars who passed the state exam)

134
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,200
Do you think it is easy to set up a marriage with a family of this rank?

135
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,290
We will set up a wedding date soon,

136
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,610
so know that is how it will be.

137
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,620
Lady, you are going to be late—

138
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,690
My Lady!

139
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,540
My Lady, your shoes, your shoes!

140
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,160
Your shoes!

141
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,420
Father!

142
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,660
Are you going to the palace already?

143
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,620
Why all the commotion in the morning?

144
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,740
So, are you going to class?

145
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,780
You should hurry and go since you are late.

146
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,700
Okay. I will be back.

147
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,110
Father! You should cheer up today, too.

148
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,340
Okay, okay.

149
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,040
Because you keep going easy on her, she is growing more spoiled!

150
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,030
Oh, right.

151
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,660
What are you thinking of doing with the marriage candidate that Uncle mentioned?

152
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,630
Since Yeon Woo's stubbornness is no joke,

153
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,880
I did not even get to bring it up yet.

154
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,480
Let us take it slowly.

155
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,340
Slowly.

156
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,100
Yes, slowly.

157
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,210
What do you mean you will stop working with me?

158
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,160
I have no more business with you, Master Ho Jeob.

159
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,960
It appears you have grown cocky now that you earned some money, thanks to me.

160
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,290
I am Ho Jeob, Ho Jeob!

161
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,150
I am the best dressmaker in Hanyang!

162
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,600
That was in the past!

163
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,420
Do you know how quickly fashion changes?

164
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,340
There are so many... clothes like this out there.

165
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,890
Someone dared to copy my clothes?

166
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,650
Just wait until I catch you. You are dead!

167
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,090
I know.

168
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,770
But this is for the best.

169
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,040
You should stop making clothes now and focus on getting married—

170
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,580
No! I refuse!

171
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,730
I may quit on my own, but not like this!

172
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,540
What will you do then? You lost all your business partners.

173
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,520
Is that not right? No?

174
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,350
Is that not so?

175
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,060
 What took you so long?

176
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,180
Do you know what is the most famous in all eight provinces

177
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,560
of Joseon and particularly in Hanyang?

178
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,620
Yes! It is these strong thighs! What do you think?

179
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,350
You should just use your thighs for your wife back home.

180
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,520
The most famous in Hanyang is

181
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,970
old bachelor Ugly Man of Jinsa Village!

182
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,110
Because this guy is so ugly,

183
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,140
he could not get married even though he is 28 years old.

184
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,940
But even Ugly Man had a perfect match for him.

185
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,790
The old maiden Crazy Girl of the Crepe-Myrtle Tree family.

186
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,480
Goodness, goodness.

187
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,330
Is that Crazy Girl me?

188
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,900
Who do you think is the most famous old maiden of Hanyang?

189
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,150
Ugly Man and Crazy Girl need to get married.

190
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,500
All right!

191
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,260
Hip, hip, hooray!

192
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,800
My Lady, where are you going?

193
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,070
Where do you think? I am going to marry off old bachelor Ugly Man!

194
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,610
Pardon?

195
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,880
Court Lady Jo, look at this skirt.

196
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,260
It is so pretty, right?

197
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,060
I really like the socks, too.

198
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,200
Princess, you look so pretty.

199
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,730
So, I also bought one, too.

200
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,830
What do you think?

201
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,020
It is so pretty.

202
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,740
It is so pretty!

203
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,420
- F-Father... 
 - Your Majesty!

204
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,490
T-This...

205
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,510
Damn it...

206
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,380
T-This!

207
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,440
 Oh, my goodness...

208
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,530
I hear these impure and hideous clothes are tainting our customs and morals in the city.

209
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,290
What have you all been doing?

210
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,440
 We are deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

211
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,220
There are laws concerning one's dress code.

212
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,940
Immediately, arrest the people who made and distributed these unsightly clothes

213
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,110
and punish them severely for their crime!

214
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,380
 Yes, Your Majesty.

215
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,610
You must be tired.

216
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,360
Why did you go into the palace so early in the morning?

217
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,900
The princess was wearing the unsightly clothes that are sold in the city these days

218
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,800
and got caught by His Majesty.

219
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,700
The princess?

220
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,700
It so happens there were many complaints because of those clothes.

221
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,000
Then, what will happen now?

222
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,970
He commanded the Royal Investigation Bureau to arrest the one who made such clothing,

223
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,660
so it should be wrapped up soon.

224
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,830
The Royal Investigation Bureau?

225
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,330
The party must be in that house.

226
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,060
Supposedly, it is the youngest son's birthday.

227
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,570
That is good.

228
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,650
It is the best time to sneak in when there are many people.

229
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,610
I will marry off the old bachelor Ugly Man of that house while he is wearing my clothes.

230
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,230
If the word spreads that my clothes married off the most infamous old bachelor in Hanyang,

231
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,190
my fame will return.

232
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,610
How will you sneak in there, though?

233
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,910
Men and women are to be distinguished, and there is a custom!

234
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,300
Gosh, My Lady!

235
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,050
You really resort to all sorts of things.

236
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,250
The best part about sneaking in is disguise.

237
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,150
But in any case...

238
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,660
I wonder where our Ugly Man is.

239
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,520
The side house or the men's quarters?

240
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,870
Do you want to get caught?

241
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,350
What are you guys doing standing around here?

242
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,450
Go and fry jeon over there! 
  (Korean pancakes)

243
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,040
- Jeon? 
 - Yeah, hurry up and go!

244
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,040
But... who are you?

245
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,800
I do not think I have seen you before.

246
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,060
Gosh, Grandma! Your eyesight must be bad these days.

247
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,860
It is me!

248
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,500
Who? Are you Eon Nyeon?

249
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,360
Yes, I am Eon Nyeon.

250
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,210
Oh, okay, okay.

251
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,880
Old bachelor?

252
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,940
Where did he go?

253
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,350
What are you doing?

254
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,990
I should be asking you, what are you doing here—

255
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,610
How could you open the door without making a sound!

256
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,690
I got so scared.

257
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,890
How dare a servant speak so impolitely to her master?

258
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,460
A servant? Who are you calling a servant...

259
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:45,930
Goodness, Young Master, I spoke nonsense because I got so frightened.

260
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,360
Well, then. I will be taking my leave.

261
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,800
Why were you wandering around?

262
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,950
Just...

263
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,190
Honestly, I was looking for the Ugly Man of this house—

264
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,750
I was looking for the old bachelor.

265
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,240
She's quite skilled.

266
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,700
You can do it, too.

267
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,240
She is so good.

268
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,360
Madam?

269
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,580
Ugly Man? The young master of this house?

270
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,370
Yes, he is the most well-known in the city.

271
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:20,220
But... who are you?

272
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,090
Looking at your face, you do not seem to be the Young Master Ugly Man.

273
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,630
You do not know who I am?

274
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,060
Of course not. I met you for the first time today.

275
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,590
In any case, I will be going my way.

276
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:49,370
I will take you... to that Young Master Ugly Man.

277
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,720
Where are we going?

278
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
There are not many people here.

279
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,160
You will find out if you follow me.

280
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Are you really a friend of Young Master Ugly Man?

281
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,850
You are not lying to me. Right?

282
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,790
Now that I think about it, I did not even ask for your name.

283
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,630
What should I call you?

284
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,530
S-Sa Wol.

285
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,800
Sa Wol.

286
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,150
All right, Sa Wol.

287
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,180
Young Master is not home, so come back another day.

288
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,920
You will avoid people's attention if you leave that way.

289
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,710
What are you saying? You said you would lead me to Young Master!

290
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,850
What a fraud.

291
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,290
Whatever! I am not leaving. I cannot leave!

292
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,700
- If you go this way— 
 - Let go, you fraudster!

293
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,110
That is not it.

294
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,020
It is this way.

295
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,820
Is Yeon Woo—

296
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,940
 I am just curious.

297
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,900
 I am sorry to bother you.

298
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,110
What is the matter?

299
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,610
Please give me a moment.

300
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,280
Is anyone there?

301
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,780
Are you coming back from somewhere?

302
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,940
Why are you here?

303
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,640
I was passing by on a walk.

304
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,860
You should go to your room. We will talk later.

305
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,570
My Lady— Oh Wol.

306
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,280
Oh Wol, what are-what are you doing here?

307
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,510
Oh Wol?

308
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,970
Oh, the thing is...

309
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,080
I will be leaving for today.

310
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,700
Wait for me, Oh Wol!

311
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,220
 What wish did you make?

312
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,970
 I guess you cannot take this away!

313
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,010
 Give it to me!

314
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,180
 Whether it is Qing or America, I will go.

315
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,800
 If they say I cannot because I am a girl, I will go all the more.

316
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,490
 So, you should never let anything put you in a cage.

317
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,710
 You see, it is okay to run around like this.

318
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,100
 Right, what is your name?

319
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,010
 My name is Yeon Woo. Park Yeon Woo.

320
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,030
 Park Yeon Woo?

321
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,040
 My Lady.

322
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,110
 It is Machoon-daek. Give me a moment.

323
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,610
 Lady Yeon Woo.

324
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,130
 L-Look...

325
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,910
She has not changed.

326
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,320
So, are you saying you want to sell your clothes from here now, Master Ho Jeob?

327
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,760
That is right.

328
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,900
I will help you profit quite well, so sell my clothes.

329
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,310
I heard there are many clothes out there that are similar to yours these days.

330
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,150
That is why I have prepared this.

331
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,800
My ambitious new work.

332
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,320
Why does she love making clothes so much?

333
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,670
No matter what anyone says, men and money

334
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,020
are the best. That is what is best.

335
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,600
 Move!

336
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,790
 Move!

337
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,760
 What is going on?

338
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,830
 What the...

339
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,340
If they are headed that way...

340
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,600
My Lady!

341
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,760
We are in big trouble!

342
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,300
 Goodness, what the...

343
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,960
 Why are they throwing all of that out?

344
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,120
 - Wait. 
 - Goodness.

345
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,400
 Goodness.

346
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,410
 Oh, my.

347
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,580
Goodness, what crime have I committed that you are doing this?

348
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,480
You mean you did no wrong when these vulgar clothes are causing trouble and inciting immorality?

349
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,850
Gosh, sir! All I did was sell clothes!

350
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,190
Men, arrest this man immediately and burn up all these hideous clothes!

351
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,510
 Yes, sir.

352
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,720
No, no, my clothes!

353
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,850
No! My clothes! My clothes!

354
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,260
My Lady, no!

355
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,060
Let go! They are my clothes!

356
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,630
You cannot!

357
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,500
Sir, please spare me!

358
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,050
- Please spare me! 
 - Let go of me!

359
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,360
Y-Yes, it was that person!

360
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,330
That person, Ho Jeob, made these clothes!

361
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,970
My Lady, run. Now!

362
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,950
What are you doing! Catch her immediately!

363
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,310
 Yes, sir!

364
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,160
 Stop!

365
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,330
 Stop!

366
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,680
 Stop right there!

367
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,900
Sa Wol, are you okay?

368
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,200
I am okay.

369
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,970
Are you okay?

370
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,400
There she is!

371
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,530
Hurry up and go!

372
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,440
Gosh, I am in pain! It hurts.

373
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,870
 Hurry and catch her!

374
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,440
 There she is!

375
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,790
 Catch her!

376
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,680
 That way!

377
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,910
 Stop right there! Move!

378
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,240
I am sorry!

379
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,590
 Follow her!

380
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,510
 Chase her! Catch her!

381
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,430
 Catch her!

382
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,000
 Stop right there!

383
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,910
Move!

384
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,150
It is this way. Catch her!

385
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,800
Move!

386
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,180
Catch her!

387
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,890
It is a dead end.

388
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,290
Are you okay?

389
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,150
You seem to be out of breath.

390
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,490
I am okay.

391
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,450
Where did My Lady go?

392
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,680
I am so nervous about this.

393
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,550
It hurts.

394
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,670
By chance, did you see the ones who fled this way?

395
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,340
I did not see anyone.

396
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,970
Is that so?

397
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,370
What is that palanquin for?

398
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,830
Do not worry. Nothing will happen.

399
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,250
It is too bad.

400
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,800
I am on my way to the residence of the Chief of the Royal Investigation Bureau.

401
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,640
I am worried I may be late.

402
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,710
Chief of the Royal Investigation Bureau?

403
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,530
I apologize for bothering you. Let us go.

404
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,120
 You should come out now.

405
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,020
If it was not for you, we would have been in big trouble. Thank you.

406
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,400
How can I ever repay you?

407
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,650
I will accept that from you next time.

408
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,070
We will meet again if we are fated.

409
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,460
Then I will be going now.

410
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,540
It appears the officers have all left as well.

411
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,550
Things should be fine now.

412
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,790
Do you... know me?

413
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:40,400
It does not seem like a coincidence back then at your house and today as well.

414
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,040
You knew that I was not a female servant. Right?

415
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,860
Well, the thing is...

416
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,920
My Lady!

417
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,640
Let us hurry and go.

418
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,270
Why? What is the problem?

419
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,400
Right now, Madam is...

420
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,550
In any case, hurry. Hurry!

421
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,710
- Hurry! 
 - Where are we going?

422
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,290
Your marriage candidate has been set.

423
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,890
You should prepare accordingly.

424
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,400
Pardon? W-What do you mean—

425
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,420
You must do this if you are a woman.

426
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,080
Why should I get married so suddenly? I do not want to.

427
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,840
To marry a stranger as if you are unloading me.

428
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,140
I cannot do that.

429
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,260
This is your embroidery.

430
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,210
I taught you how to make and embroider clothes to teach you women's virtue,

431
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,800
not so you can be a merchant.

432
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,070
There are customs a noblewoman must keep!

433
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,170
What good is it to be a nobility when I cannot do anything I want?

434
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,100
Did I ask for anything great?

435
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,550
All I want is to live as myself, doing what I want.

436
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,280
That is not a crime, is it?

437
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,270
No. It is a crime.

438
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,510
The fact that a woman would dream of doing something is!

439
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,110
What good is it to be a nobility?

440
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:39,510
You lived doing what you wanted, thanks to your status.

441
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:44,830
Do you not get that what protected you in today's commotion was your outer shell as nobility?

442
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,740
Maiden...

443
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,150
Do not follow me.

444
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,240
I was not following you. I was also going this way.

445
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,900
All right, then.

446
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,590
W-What are you doing?

447
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,150
I said not to follow me!

448
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,500
I said not to follow me!

449
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,660
Did you lose your senses along the road?

450
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,980
Why do you stop me from going where I want!

451
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,570
I am sorry.

452
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,090
Your clothes were ruined because of me.

453
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,580
Let us call it even for joking around with you last time, Maiden Sa Wol.

454
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,610
Or was it Oh Wol?

455
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,610
Forget it.

456
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,540
Take this.

457
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,210
What is...

458
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,720
Why do you have...

459
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,440
It is a watch. Right?

460
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,550
My grandfather gave me this,

461
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,820
and it has never broken or stopped working once.

462
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,560
It is neat, is it not?

463
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,760
Why are you looking at me that way?

464
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,770
Because you are so beautiful.

465
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,410
Pardon?

466
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,520
I mean, the butterfly decoration.

467
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,250
This?

468
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,220
Do you like butterflies?

469
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,380
I do like them, and I am also envious of them.

470
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:16,630
Since they can go wherever they want with their wings.

471
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,750
Thank you. You even found my watch for me.

472
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,800
No, you do not need to thank me.

473
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,110
By chance, may I ask you for your name?

474
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:38,620
My name is Tae Ha.

475
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,740
Kang Tae Ha.

476
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,250
Tae Ha.

477
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,830
Kang Tae Ha.

478
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,110
I am sorry. I did that instinctively.

479
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:08,000
N-No, you did that while trying to help me.

480
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:14,440
Someday, you will become like that, like a butterfly.

481
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,970
If you remember who you are in your heart,

482
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,330
no matter where you are and what you become,

483
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,630
the fact that you made such beautiful clothes will not change, Maiden.

484
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,880
I am sure you will fly to and land where you want.

485
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,270
So, just for today, no—

486
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,840
Just be hurting only for now.

487
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,610
By chance... are you married?

488
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,260
M-Married?

489
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,830
O-Oh, never mind.

490
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,950
I-I did not eat dinner yet.

491
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,580
I will go buy some things to eat.

492
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,440
It is okay—

493
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,700
What is with you...

494
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,940
Move! Move!

495
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,610
Your wedding date has been set for the first day of next month.

496
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:42,390
Father, please.

497
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,000
If you truly thought of me as your father and cared about our family, even for a bit,

498
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,700
you would not have done such a thing.

499
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,570
Thus, perform all your duties now.

500
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,560
This is the last act of generosity I can do for you as your father.

501
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:23,520
 We brought this crepe-myrtle tree here on the year you were born.

502
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,620
 While hoping you will be healthy.

503
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,010
 But that year, a major disease spread throughout the land,

504
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,470
 and you got very sick as well.

505
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:37,900
 But for some reason, this crepe-myrtle tree also started to wither.

506
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,340
 Really?

507
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,740
 I prayed every day for your and this crepe-myrtle tree's health.

508
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:50,000
 After hoping and wishing like that, your sickness subsided

509
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,130
 and this crepe-myrtle tree regained its health.

510
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,330
 Yeon Woo, you are like that.

511
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:00,450
 You are so precious to your grandfather and your parents.

512
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:03,720
 Someone we have given all of our hearts to.

513
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,350
Tavern Owner, I enjoyed the meal.

514
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,670
Have a safe trip.

515
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,260
 You suffered a lot because of me.

516
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,120
 This is for the sake of our history. Please use it for your store.

517
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,210
Master Ho Jeob.

518
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,640
Master Ho Jeob...

519
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,800
Why did you give him all that money?

520
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,330
To Qing or America, you said you would go. It took so much to save that money.

521
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:48,900
Since I got to dream for a bit, that is enough for me.

522
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,150
You should have given it to me.

523
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,870
Can I get repaid today for the last time?

524
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:07,820
You want me to become your friend for conversations as repayment?

525
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:13,420
Yes. Not a lot has been happening these days, and I am lonesome.

526
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,110
I guess you find my eyes intriguing.

527
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,550
I did not mean to offend you.

528
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,420
It is just that I am meeting a colored-eyed person for the first time.

529
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,750

530
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,140
I heard you will be getting married soon.

531
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,950
How do you know that?

532
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,090
Thus, I want to give you a small gift.

533
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:42,090
It is not much, but I have a certain talent.

534
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:46,240
You do not know how you ended up where you are, either. Right, Lady?

535
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,200
Just like your name, Yeon Woo.

536
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,000
How do you know my name?

537
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,700
Are you not curious about your fate, Lady?

538
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:01,460
Do you believe in fate?

539
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,340
 Move it over there.

540
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,300
 Moving through here.

541
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,010
 Set that in position.

542
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:15,320
 Is everything ready?

543
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,970
His Excellency is too much.

544
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:26,270
How could he marry off our pretty lady to the old bachelor Ugly Man?

545
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,960
I am fine.

546
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,550
No matter where I am and what I become,

547
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,550
I will be Park Yeon Woo.

548
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,460
Just stay seated.

549
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,960
You look very pretty.

550
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,340
You must hate your mother.

551
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,770
Is that true?

552
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,850
Yes.

553
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:08,260
I hate you. I hate you.

554
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,090
And I hate you.

555
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:12,760
Now, that is more like my Yeon Woo.

556
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,090
I, too...

557
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,340
and your father as well,

558
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,940
felt like it was a shame...

559
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,220
to give you away.

560
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,380
I am sorry...

561
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,690
for being so mean to you.

562
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,820
Please forgive us.

563
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,020
Thank you.

564
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,260
Because of you...

565
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,450
I was so happy.

566
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:56,820
Thank you... for raising me.

567
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,470
Gosh, how ugly is he?

568
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,070
I guess even an Ugly Man has his match.

569
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,300
Yeah, I guess so.

570
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,820
The bride will wash her hands to signify the cleansing of her body and heart.

571
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:22,120
The bride will wash her hands to signify the cleansing of her body and heart.

572
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,830
The groom will bow and greet the bride.

573
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,140
What is taking him so long?

574
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,410
My neck hurts, and I am hungry.

575
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,030
How ugly is he?

576
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,680
Should I drink some alcohol first?

577
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,190
So I will not be sober?

578
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,480
Young Master?

579
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,720
W-What is this situation?

580
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,170
Are you the Ugly Man of the Kang jinsa family?

581
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,120
That is right.

582
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,750
I never imagined anything like this.

583
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,090
W-Wait!

584
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,590
Cutting off and exchanging each other's ribbon between a married couple

585
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,980
signifies that they should separate.

586
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,280
Separate?

587
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,950
Pardon?

588
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,160
I am so curious!

589
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,800
Gosh, move aside.

590
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,520
Let us make a small hole.

591
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,000
Hurry up and poke a hole!

592
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:07,420
Go!

593
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,820
Shall I pour oil in your ears or something?

594
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,730
All right, I will leave. Goodness!

595
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,400
Shall I do it right now? Right now?

596
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,140
- What? What? 
 - What? What did I do?

597
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,320
Just leave!

598
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,470
Why is she doing that to me?

599
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,980
Where do they think this is?

600
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:33,020
In any case, I cannot believe the groom is that young master.

601
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,690
This is... definitely... fate?

602
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,900
So crazy! So crazy!

603
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,190
Just a little bit...

604
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,110
Just a little bit!

605
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,800
Fate, my foot.

606
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,200
Do you want to die today?

607
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,910
Come here right now!

608
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,640
It hurts!

609
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,670
Come here.

610
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:05,880
My family and I have deceived you and your family.

611
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,400
What do you mean, you have deceived us?

612
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,050
I... could die at any given moment.

613
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:19,050
I had a severe heart ailment from a young age. So, I did not consider marriage at all. However...

614
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:22,790
I could not go against my ill grandfather's wishes,

615
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,810
so I did something I should not have done to you, Maiden.

616
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:31,990
How could you suddenly say you can die at any moment?

617
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,400
I am sorry.

618
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,600
Then why did you suddenly change your mind?

619
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,100
- You wanted to marry even by deception! 
 - That is...

620
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,790
because I thought I should make things right while I could.

621
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,870
Since you are too good for me...

622
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,670
who is foolish and lacking.

623
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,340
I will ask you one thing.

624
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:09,000
Do you feel like you will die right now because of your heart ailment?

625
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,600
- No, however— 
 - Then that is enough for me.

626
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,690
What are you doing?

627
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,090
Maiden!

628
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,240
No, you should call me Wife.

629
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,920
I am now your wife, Young Master— I mean, Husband.

630
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,470
I do not want to be deserted.

631
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,430
I would rather grow old and die as a young widow.

632
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,110
Do you know what it took for me to decide on this marriage?

633
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:36,070
So, I must at least have my first night.

634
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,600
M-Move away.

635
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,030
- Stop right there! 
 - I told you not to come to me!

636
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:43,290
Come here!

637
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:12,750
Your heart seems to be beating fast. Are you all right?

638
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,020
Yeon, which means to connect.

639
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,100
Woo, which means to meet.

640
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,680
Yeon Woo.

641
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,840
That is my name.

642
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:42,900
How could the connections formed by people meeting be taken lightly?

643
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,070
Not only that, our connection is that of a married couple.

644
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,720
Do not take it lightly.

645
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,020
I am doing this, so I do not take it lightly.

646
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,320
Since I do not know when I will meet the god of the underworld.

647
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,130
I will beat even that god of the underworld.

648
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,710
So, do not worry.

649
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,650
I am sorry.

650
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:16,710
You cannot leave.

651
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,430
I am also quite stubborn, so you should give up first.

652
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,720
Yeon Woo.

653
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,210
Husband.

654
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,320
Dear Husband!

655
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,730
Husband! Husband!

656
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:02,650
Look!  Is anyone out there?

657
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,150
Mother! Sa Wol!

658
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:10,880
Husband, are you awake?

659
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,260
I am sorry.

660
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:20,760
Just breathe slowly. Please!

661
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,930
Yeon Woo...

662
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:25,060
Yeon Woo.

663
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,340
Do not speak.

664
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:34,920
Do not... Do not cry and...

665
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,590
just like back then...

666
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,510
Husband...

667
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:47,110
Husband!

668
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:49,220
Husband!

669
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:52,510
Husband!

670
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,780
Husband!

671
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,330
Husband...

672
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,590
Husband!

673
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:54,050
What have you done to him that my son, who was perfectly fine, suddenly died so horribly!

674
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,800
Why would my precious son die!

675
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,760
Tell me.

676
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,450
Tell me!

677
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,720
Have you become mute?

678
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,760
I asked you what you did to him!

679
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,710
In-law!

680
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,450
What are you doing right now!

681
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:25,220
I cannot do this much when she killed my son?

682
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:29,400
How did you raise your daughter that this would happen as soon as they got married?

683
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,580
You should stop.

684
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:36,410
- Do not mistreat my mother like that. 
 - What did you say?

685
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:40,260
I already know that my husband suffered from a long-standing illness.

686
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,400
Is that true?

687
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,500
What illness?

688
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,670
My husband tried to divorce me last night

689
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:48,850
by cutting off our ribbons, afraid something like this might happen.

690
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,030
How dare you say such lies?

691
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:56,030
However, I will perform all my duties, no matter how much you try to stop me.

692
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,630
I will perform the three-year mourning for my husband,

693
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:01,900
so do not mistreat me and my family like this!

694
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,190
My Lady...

695
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,990
Are you all right?

696
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,360
What do you do now?

697
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,860
You will have to enter your in-law's house.

698
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:35,400
Your mother-in-law is actually a stepmother.

699
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:43,450
I am fine, so you should go and take care of Mother.

700
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:46,280
Yes.

701
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,370
I never even got to give him these clothes.

702
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,580
 Lady,

703
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,290
I prepared some thin rice gruel for you.

704
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:04,450
I do not want any, so take it back.

705
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:09,400
 I will leave it in front of your door, so eat at least a bit.

706
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:23,000
My poor lady...

707
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:28,520
This was too mean of Heaven—

708
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:37,450
Why is the color like that? It looks so ominous.

709
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:40,000
No.

710
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,540
Why did my husband have this...

711
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,640
Is it you, Sa Wol?

712
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,160
 It is so merry here, it cannot get better than this!

713
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,210
 It is so much better because you are here, sir.

714
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,090
 All right, all right.

715
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:50,360
 Do you believe in fate?

716
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:32,870

717
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:42,300
♫  Even if you are left alone in this place  ♫

718
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:50,610
♫  I hope it flows and takes you back to where you left  ♫

719
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:57,960
♫  If I set out on the road following those red flowers  ♫

720
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,570

721
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:02,640
 Husband...

722
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,160
 You were alive...

723
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,670
 Please let go of me!

724
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:09,240
 Do they erase your memories in the afterlife?

725
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,520
 This is not the afterlife, but Seoul, South Korea.

726
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,360
 Then I am alive?

727
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,470
 Tae Ha is doing what? Getting married?

728
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:20,320
 The wedding is at 2:00 p.m., but you can't reach the bride?

729
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,290
 If the chairman finds out, he will be furious! What should we do?

730
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:25,560
 My husband does not even remember me.

731
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,980
 I want to go home.

732
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,330
 Then I will help you.

733
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:31,920
 In return, could you become my bride?

734
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:37,330
♫  So don't worry about anything  ♫
