1
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,950

2
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:42,770

3
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,930
Young Master! Young Master!

4
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,230
Young Master, did you not take the medicine?

5
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,500
No!

6
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,160
No, Young Master!

7
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,330
Someone! Is anyone out there? Look here!

8
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,580
Do not worry...

9
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,070
Everything will be all right, so do not worry and...

10
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,630
Please stay alert...

11
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,310
Mother!

12
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,390
Father!

13
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,880
Is anyone out there?

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,590
Anyone, please! Anyone...

15
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,290
Young Master, no...

16
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,130
You must not die like this...

17
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,960
Wake up, please...

18
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,970
Young Master...

19
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,800
How did this happen again?

20
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,950

21
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,600
I think the operation plan will go like this.

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,430
Yeon Woo will walk wearing this outfit.

23
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,560
Oh, that's not bad.

24
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,870
- Hello! 
 - Great work, everyone!

25
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,750
Sa Wol! What brings you here?

26
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,530
I heard you were working late, so I made some cookies for you!

27
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,120
This is our treat so you can prepare for Ms. Yeon Woo's pop-up well.

28
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,590
Both of you are so considerate.

29
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,380
Sa Wol, what's the recipe for this?

30
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,590
Wow, I think you can set up shop for this.

31
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,090
Eat as much as you want. I'll make it often for you.

32
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,570
In any case, did Yeon Woo arrive in Milan okay?

33
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,500
It's been about a week since she left. Right?

34
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,770
Is she doing well?

35
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,100
She is probably doing well.

36
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,430
Since she's my sister...

37
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,250

38
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,220

39
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,730
You shouldn't touch the exhibit clothes.

40
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,370
Hey, CEO Kang Tae Ha.

41
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,060
Why are you acting so pitifully? It really doesn't look good.

42
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,420
How about you, Kang Tae Min? Why are you here?

43
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,360
I came to do my job and check the outfits.

44
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,810
If you miss Sister-in-law, just call her!

45
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,440
Why do you always look like you won't ever see her again?

46
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,350
You're working quite hard until such a late hour.

47
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,940
I am not as smart as you are, Brother.

48
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,670
So, I should make up for it by moving my body.

49
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,770
I told you I would get promoted and take over SH.

50
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,520
All right. I'll be looking forward to it, so good luck.

51
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,260
What? You laugh?

52
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,090
You just looked down on me. Right?

53
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,870
Gosh, you're so cocky now because I let you off easy these days.

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,260
That hurts. That hurts, that hurts!

55
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,850
 You know the weather is still not good. Right?

56
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,440
 What do you mean it's not good?

57
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,380
 All right, all right, all right.

58
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,910
You wench!

59
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,580
What are you doing right now!

60
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,730
Let go of my hand!

61
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,010
How dare you!

62
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,680
We are in the middle of mourning. Maintain your dignity.

63
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,890
What did you say? Dignity?

64
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,810
In-law!

65
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,670
Please stop.

66
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,960
How did you raise your daughter?

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Not only did she cause her husband to die,

68
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,920
she is so rude to her mother-in-law!

69
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,220
What do you mean, rude? Your words are a bit excessive.

70
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,230
I cannot do this much when my precious son died?

71
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,870
All right. I will perform all my duties for your precious son, Mother-in-law,

72
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,340
so you should stop.

73
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,250
Fine. We shall see how well you do!

74
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,520
Yeon Woo.

75
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,900
I am fine.

76
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,600
Mother, I have something to ask of you.

77
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,370
Stop right there!

78
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,020
T-That guy! That guy!

79
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,200
You bastard! Let her down this instant!

80
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,540
Grab him immediately!

81
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,620
- Stay back! 
 - Yeon Woo!

82
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,870
Stay back.

83
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,110
- Yeon Woo! 
  - Catch him!

84
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,450
 Catch him!

85
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,530
 Catch him!

86
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,340
Are you all right? You were not hurt?

87
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,830
Yes. I am fine.

88
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,250
Your Excellency, he escaped on a horse.

89
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,060
What?

90
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,900
Yeon Woo.

91
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,250
Yeon Woo! Where are you going?

92
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,020
If you take one more step, this arrow will pierce your heart.

93
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,090
- There he is! 
  - Catch him!

94
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,830
 Catch him!

95
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,810
Hold still!

96
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,030
I said, hold still!

97
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,310
Let go of me!

98
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,820
What did I do wrong that you are doing this?

99
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,950
I said let go of me!

100
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,910
Mother!

101
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,490
Move! Mother!

102
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,410
Save me, Father!

103
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,690

104
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,570
Let go! Let go!

105
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,340
 Let go of me!

106
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,310
 Let go!

107
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,890
You must know the crimes you committed!

108
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,830
No. What do you mean I killed my own son?

109
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:23,440
I am sure she is trying to frame me after killing her own husband.

110
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,380
Then, are you saying you do not know that guy, Deok Gu?

111
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,780
He is your family's male servant.

112
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,700
That is true, but this has nothing to do with me.

113
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,380
What mother in this world would kill her own son?

114
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,560
There is no reason for it!

115
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,110
It is to receive a memorial headstone for a Loyal Wife.

116
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,970
- Memorial headstone for a Loyal Wife? 
 - Yes.

117
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,210
After killing my husband through poison, she ordered this man to throw me in the well

118
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,650
to make me into a Loyal Wife in order to receive a government post.

119
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,660
You wench! How dare you run your mouth!

120
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,340
What evidence do you have that I poisoned him?

121
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,770
If you have one, then show us!

122
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,930
That corroborative evidence is here.

123
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,260
Brother...

124
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,800
Since I am the one who drank that herbal decoction.

125
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Husband...

126
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,000
Are you the eldest son of the Kang family?

127
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,120
Then you were not dead.

128
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,900
Yes. I only pretended to be dead in order to...

129
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,510
expose Mother's crime.

130
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,870
This is the antidote.

131
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,620
How much of it must I eat in order to neutralize just enough poison to survive?

132
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,220
Pardon? You will keep some of the poison in you?

133
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,970
You must not do that! If things go wrong, you will die!

134
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,580
That is for me to handle, so just tell me.

135
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,650
You took just enough antidote not to die? Intentionally?

136
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:36,980
That way, the whole story behind all this will be exposed.

137
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,410
No, no, no, no.

138
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,010
No, no!

139
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,730
No.

140
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,600
I am unfairly framed!

141
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,490
I really do not know anything!

142
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,350
You bastard!

143
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,750
Say something!

144
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,310
Tell them that it was not me!

145
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,200
It is true that Madam ordered me to do it, sir.

146
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,140
What are you doing? Quickly tie up the criminals and throw them in prison!

147
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,050
Yes, sir!

148
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,430
What grudge do you have against me that you are doing this?

149
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,480
You ungrateful bastard!

150
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,170
I am your mother who raised you!

151
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,040
Let go, let go, let go!

152
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,160
I am being framed! I am being framed!

153
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,170
 If you will arrest anyone, arrest that bastard and that wench!

154
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,770
 Let go! Let go!

155
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,070
It is all over now.

156
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,820
- Yeon Woo! 
 - Yeon Woo!

157
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,180
Wife!

158
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,810
- Yeon Woo! 
 - Wife!

159
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,500
Yeon Woo!

160
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,870
Yeon Woo...

161
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,710
Yeon Woo!

162
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,810
 CEO Kang, Yeon Woo's mother's diary returned to normal.

163
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,480
It disappeared.

164
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,890
The memorial headstone disappeared!

165
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,130
It really disappeared!

166
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,620
I guess the injustice Yeon Woo faced was resolved.

167
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,420
My Lady, you did well.

168
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,340
You did really well.

169
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,840
Don't cry.

170
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,170
You're making me sad, too.

171
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,390
Secretary Hong, will you bring what we prepared?

172
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,370
What's with the flowers?

173
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,120
You know how Yeon Woo liked butterflies?

174
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,730
I guess he is saying she should fly over to him whenever.

175
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,840
Tae Ha.

176
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,510
Are you finally awake?

177
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,730
It was you, Young Master.

178
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,020
But... why am I here?

179
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,940
You passed out at the government office, so I moved you here.

180
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,580
Two days have passed already.

181
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,580
Have you been here all that time?

182
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,630
Of course.

183
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,300
Where would I go when you are here, Wife?

184
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,440
Do you feel uncomfortable...

185
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,390
because I called you Wife?

186
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,280
What happened to Madam Yoon?

187
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,390
Criminal Hwang Deok Gu, listen up!

188
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,890
Though you committed this crime under the orders of your mistress,

189
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,220
I cannot take lightly that you tried to kill a noblewoman.

190
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,630
Thus, I sentence you to be beheaded.

191
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,320
Wait, beheading?

192
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,490
All I did was do what I was told, sir!

193
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,790
Spare me! This is unfair to me!

194
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,390
This is unfair!

195
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,950
All I did was do what I was told! Sir!

196
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,700
Criminal Yoon tried to kill her son out of her wicked greed,

197
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,500
yet she keeps insisting she did nothing wrong instead of repenting.

198
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,010
Her wickedness is beyond words.

199
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,340
Thus, I sentence you to 50 beatings

200
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,100
and exile to Gyo-dong.

201
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,480
Why are you here?

202
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,620
What?

203
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,630
Did you come to gloat?

204
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,890
Yes. I came to see you and gloat.

205
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,900
- You wench! 
 - You are so cowardly.

206
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,210
You tried to kill your son for a mere government position.

207
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,340
How could you try to run from your own crime?

208
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,120
Someone almost died because of your misplaced greed!

209
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,380
Apologize sincerely to me, my parents, and my husband.

210
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,140
That will make you somewhat human.

211
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,700
What did I do that was so wrong?

212
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,590
I—

213
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,890
I merely...

214
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,070
lived for the Kang family, as I was told.

215
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,450
 Your mouth! Your mouth!

216
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,230
 If you had done a good job, Tae Ha and Tae Min would have passed the state exam

217
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,410
 and saved our Kang family several times over already.

218
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,840
He says that my husband being sick and my children not being successful

219
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,810
were all because of my lack of virtue. So what can I do?

220
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,750
I had to do whatever it took to elevate my family.

221
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,830
Do you really think that was your fault?

222
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,530
All of that?

223
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,460
That was what I was taught, and I believed that to be true.

224
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,560
So that must be true.

225
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,710
Is that why you tried to kill the son you raised?

226
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,400
No.

227
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,460
You could have chosen to call out what was wrong.

228
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,660
When Mother is sent into exile,

229
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,130
I am thinking of leaving my home as well.

230
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,570
Pardon?

231
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,130
What do you mean by that?

232
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,300
I cannot forgive what Grandfather has done.

233
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,330
And...

234
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:07,430
I want to stay by your side without feeling ashamed.

235
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,360
I know you suffered because of my family.

236
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,460
But if you will allow me,

237
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,090
I want to continue our relationship as a married couple.

238
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,630
I...

239
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,310
cannot do that.

240
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,530
Yeon Woo.

241
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,960
It appears you have really forgotten me.

242
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,550
I have never forgotten you for a moment.

243
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,460
Ever since...

244
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,240
that day when I saw you in the forest.

245
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,430
 Give it to me!

246
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,770
 Never let anything put you in a cage.

247
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,300
 You see, it is okay to run around like this.

248
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,210
By chance...

249
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,930
that young master was...

250
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,400
Every time I struggled because of my heart ailment,

251
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,120
 My Lady!

252
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,730
 I said, I will not study!

253
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,940
I was able to endure it, thinking of you

254
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,940
You were cheerful and brilliantly shining...

255
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,110
You were always dreaming...

256
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,130
and made me envious, and I thought you were lovely.

257
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,960
When I found out you were to become my wife, I hesitated.

258
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,400
Because of my heart ailment.

259
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,900
However, I could not give you up.

260
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,030
Even if it is just for a moment,

261
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,020
I wanted to be with you.

262
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,480
So, please be with me—

263
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,260
I am sorry. I should get going now.

264
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,370
Maiden Yeon Woo.

265
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,590
Yeon Woo.

266
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,950
Mother.

267
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,160
Are you worried about something?

268
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,180
You look downcast.

269
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,570
No, it is nothing.

270
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,920
I heard you met Madam Yoon.

271
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,610
Why would you go there?

272
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,930
What excuse did you want to hear from her?

273
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,850
The one who wanted to kill me

274
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,880
was not Madam Yoon but His Excellency Kang.

275
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,460
What?

276
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,150
But someone else ended up paying for his crime.

277
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,350
For her family and her husband...

278
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,270
I suppose that is a Joseon woman's life.

279
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,040
I understand how you feel, but what can you do?

280
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,160
That is...

281
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,300
fate.

282
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,270
I will not live like that.

283
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,840
Especially if it is fate.

284
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,060

285
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,180
Are you an alien?

286
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,810
No, a zombie?

287
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,680
No, no, no. W-Who are you?

288
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,450
What's wrong with you now?

289
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,240
It became perfectly normal. No, it's even better than normal.

290
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,270
Your heart that was close to death just a few days ago has no issues anymore.

291
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,490
That's a relief, then.

292
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,810
A relief? That's an understatement!

293
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,520
This is absolutely amazing!

294
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,800
Let me do some research on you. I must write a dissertation on you.

295
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,640
I mean, what did you do?

296
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,700
I didn't do anything special. Just...

297
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,100
Just... be in love?

298
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,340
Your heart ailment has moved to your brain.

299
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,580
Are you okay? Look at me for a moment.

300
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,250
Stop it, Senior!

301
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,290
No, something's wrong with you. I-I should call the nurse!

302
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,200
Please be quiet! Hurry up and sit down.

303
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,370

304
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,560
 So many people came!

305
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,730
 This is a v-neck style.

306
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,590
 Gosh, look at this design.

307
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,620
This is so amazing from the very first day.

308
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,570
I know. It's so great.

309
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,870
Seok Joo, the upset vibe doesn't suit you.

310
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,080
Stop it now.

311
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,280
I can do that well, too.

312
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,310
Brother, I really like this one. What do you think?

313
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,880
Oh, it's pretty!

314
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,530
Seong Pyo.

315
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,130
How do I look?

316
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,260
I thought you were a fairy.

317
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,070
Gosh, what fairy!

318
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,260
- You should buy them for us. Right? 
 - You definitely should.

319
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,440
Gosh, I'll buy it for you.

320
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,410
Brother, buy this for me, too.

321
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,160
Yeah, okay.

322
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,330
Yeon Woo would have been so happy if she had seen this.

323
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,090
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring her up.

324
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,260
She probably would have been so darn happy.

325
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,250
She should be doing well. Right?

326
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,660
Of course.

327
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,380
I'm sure she's doing well, as Yeon Woo always does.

328
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,720
Shoo, move aside!

329
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,660
His Majesty is passing through!

330
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,800
Shoo, move aside!

331
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,670
His Majesty is passing through!

332
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:41,290
Your Majesty, please stop for a moment and listen to our plea for justice.

333
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,130
Lower the carriage.

334
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:56,240
The women of Joseon, your people, are dying innocently, Your Majesty.

335
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,520
Stop.

336
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,390
How dare you speak rashly in front of His Majesty!

337
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,160
If you do not move aside now, I will strike you down.

338
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,570
If I am to die anyway, I will die right here.

339
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,910
Chief Royal Bodyguard, put your sword away immediately.

340
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,660
King, I want to hear what that child has to say.

341
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,450
Is that all right with you?

342
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,880
All right.

343
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,730
Tell me.

344
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,210
What do you have to say that is worth risking your life?

345
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,550
I am Park Yeon Woo, the daughter of Park Jae Won, the Minister of General Affairs.

346
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:56,890
I was almost killed and framed as a Loyal Wife recently.

347
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,740
Park Yeon Woo. You were that child?

348
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,850
I heard all the criminals in that case received their punishment.

349
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,950
So, how is it unjust?

350
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:11,680
Because there are some who have not been punished yet.

351
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,310
Some who have not been punished yet?

352
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,960
Who would they be?

353
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,640
They are those who want to create fake Loyal Wives

354
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,830
for their family, money, and government posts.

355
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,640
I know... the virtues that Joseon women are to keep.

356
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,350
However, that is valuable to those who try to keep them voluntarily.

357
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,710
But for those who do not, they become shackles.

358
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,870
Shackles?

359
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,900
A Loyal Wife is like that.

360
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,050
As long as rewards are bestowed for that deed,

361
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,600
your good people will get killed when they want to live,

362
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,920
and more people will abuse it, Your Majesty.

363
00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:00,310
Please help us and fix this situation,

364
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,600
so there are no more innocent deaths.

365
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,130
- Please help us! 
 - Please help us!

366
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,100
 Please help us!

367
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,070
 Please help us!

368
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,000
 Please help us!

369
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,900
 Please help us!

370
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,830
 Please help us!

371
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,190
What she said is quite valuable.

372
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,180
That is right.

373
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,120
Women are also your precious people, King.

374
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:45,990
I, your mother, feel that what that child said is right.

375
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,310
What do you think?

376
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,060
Though it is beautiful for a Loyal Wife to maintain her faithfulness toward her dead husband,

377
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,520
but more people are recently trying to abuse this for their own personal gain.

378
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,250
Therefore, from now on, we will distinguish Loyal Wives strictly by law

379
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,780
and determine their validity.

380
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,700
So make sure there are no more innocent deaths.

381
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,980
 Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,920
Why do you keep acting however you want?

383
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,360
Are you all right?

384
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,320
What is that wound on your neck?

385
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,680
Please stay by my side now.

386
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,610
I want to keep you in my sight at all times.

387
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,840
 So stay by my side, so I can always keep you in my sight.

388
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,030
Maiden...

389
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,320
What is wrong?

390
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,850
It is not because of you, so do not worry.

391
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,300
Is it because of that man?

392
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,660
The one who has the same name as mine?

393
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,490
I already knew... that your eyes were on someone else.

394
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,420
Still, that is fine with me.

395
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,350
Because... I love you.

396
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,970
I cannot do that.

397
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,990
I already gave my heart to him.

398
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,920
- Maiden— 
 - Please... let me go.

399
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,210
What are you talking about?

400
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,300
You will leave Hanyang?

401
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,570
I want to get some rest.

402
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,590
Things are hectic around here, and I don't feel comfortable.

403
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,320
No, you cannot.

404
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,540
How could I send you far away after you went through such a major ordeal!

405
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,910
I refuse.

406
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,910
If that is really how you feel, stay for a bit at your uncle's place.

407
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,540
Your Excellency, what are you saying!

408
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,420
The weather will be getting cold soon, too!

409
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,360
Do not worry, Wife.

410
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,240
She even spoke up in front of His Majesty.

411
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,200
Nothing will happen to her.

412
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,460
Come back whenever you feel like coming back.

413
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,140
Thank you, Father.

414
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,560

415
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,700

416
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,630
Why? Are you sad?

417
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:45,040
I always thought this was everything to me, but something feels weird.

418
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,580
In return, you gained access to more places.

419
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,210
Isn't that a good thing?

420
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,930
Is that so?

421
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,530
What kind of person is the new CEO?

422
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,980
And thank you for introducing me.

423
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,890
We've got lots of things to do with Midam in the future. Of course, I should.

424
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,830
- You made it, CEO Park. 
 - Yes.

425
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,080
It's nice to see you again, CEO Kang.

426
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,670
She is the CEO of Midam I had mentioned.

427
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,720
I've heard a lot about you.

428
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,540
My name is Park Jae Won.

429
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,770
I am Lee Mi Dam.

430
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,980
It's a building I own.

431
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,410
After I leave the company, you should be able to run a small shop there.

432
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,640
It is my wedding gift to you two.

433
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,440
Gosh, no, no.

434
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,080
There is no need for that!

435
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,240
Thank you!

436
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,890
This is... let's see.

437
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,990
It's expensive, right? Right?

438
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,560
You really didn't have to.

439
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,280
Thanks for everything you've done, Brother Seong Pyo.

440
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,050
- Brother? 
 - Brother.

441
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,690
W-What did you say? What is he saying?

442
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,650
He is so touched that you finally called him brother, and he is so happy.

443
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,350
He called me brother...

444
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,590
Finally!

445
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,000
You little rascal! I even supported you while you studied abroad!

446
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,400
I love you, Young Master!

447
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,610
Gosh, my little brother...

448
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,630
Secretary Hong, I can't breathe, I can't breathe.

449
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,360
My heart, my heart, my heart.

450
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,860

451
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,180
If we cannot be a married couple,

452
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,140
how about being friends?

453
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,180
Will you not go on a walk with me?

454
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,760
I need a friend as well.

455
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,180
The moon is quite bright.

456
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:15,400
Shall we make a wish to the moon rabbit?

457
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,580
There is no use in that.

458
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,130
There is no moon rabbit living on that moon.

459
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,480
Pardon?

460
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,530
No way. How could you say such a futile thing?

461
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,660
On that moon, there is no grass to eat,

462
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,360
and only rocks are there. So, no rabbits live there.

463
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,290
Supposedly, in about 200 years,

464
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,690
we will be able to go to the moon, too.

465
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,680
In some flying carriage called a rocket.

466
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,180
- Like this. 
 - Maiden.

467
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,770
It seems you are not feeling well. Let us go to the physician.

468
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,460
Hurry! I wonder if the physician will be in, though.

469
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,470
What are you so shocked about?

470
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,930
In 200 years, everyone's hair will be this short,

471
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:07,110
and people will wear skirts that are this short.

472
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,880
Maiden!

473
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,100
I heard a man sometimes wears a skirt as well.

474
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,180
A-A man?

475
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,750
A man wearing a skirt?

476
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,270
Gosh!

477
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,250
How could a man wear a skirt?

478
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,170
Have some.

479
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,270
Thank you.

480
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,610
Sorry, just a moment.

481
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,130
- What? 
 - Forget it, forget it.

482
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,640
- Go, go. 
 - What's with you?

483
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,760
Let's take a photo together!

484
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,680
- Geez... 
 - One, two, three! V!

485
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,740
A fish is on the line!

486
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,440
There definitely was a fish on...

487
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,200
Did you play a prank on me?

488
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,280
It is cold!

489
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,300
Some mushrooms are poisonous,

490
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,600
so be careful to pick the right ones.

491
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,120
Yes, I know.

492
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,390
I found it.

493
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,590
Did you find it?

494
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,990
Take it.

495
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,520
Though you cannot eat it, it is pretty to look at.

496
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,050
It is yarrows.

497
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,440
Yarrows?

498
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,980
It is a plant that is useful for treating a wound.

499
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,660
Blood!

500
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,050
Are you all right?

501
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,180
I-I am all right.

502
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,070
I am sorry. It was instinctual...

503
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,200
O-Oh, it is all right.

504
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,790
We should get going now.

505
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,490
Wait for me!

506
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,020
Tae Ha, you are going to buy this hotel?

507
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,550
I thought that would be better than it being sold to someone else.

508
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,260
I believe the crepe-myrtle tree is still blossoming...

509
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,840
because of Yeon Woo.

510
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,870
She promised that she would come back.

511
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,790
Okay, you did well.

512
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,290
She will return...

513
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,220
since she promised.

514
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,700

515
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,690
Young Master! What is wrong?

516
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,940
Is anyone out there? Over here!

517
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,810
Young Master!

518
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,870
It looks unlikely that he will last much longer.

519
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,690
You should prepare yourself for the worst.

520
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,390
 I cannot do that.

521
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:10,000
 I already gave my heart to him.

522
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,260

523
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,170
Yes?

524
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,920
Yes, yes.

525
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,720
Yes, got it.

526
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,560
Okay.

527
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,030
Gojuchang dried shredded squid, roasted galbi, tri-colored vegetables,

528
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,730
marinated tofu, japchae, stir-fried spicy pork, and sikhye.

529
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,860
Okay.

530
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,930
Thank you. Let's see...

531
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,310
We're so busy as is. What's with him?

532
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:35,040
Should I reunite Park Yeon Ah, who returned to Joseon

533
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,870
and Kang Tae Ho, who remained in new Joseon?

534
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,630
I don't know.

535
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,890
And how am I supposed to have them meet again anyway!

536
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,560
Have them meet again, no matter what.

537
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,760
What was that called again? You know, a happy ending.

538
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,540
Right? The best ending is always a happy ending. Right?

539
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,650
If you want it to be wistful, go for a sad ending.

540
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,830
If you want it to be global and make money, go for a sad ending.

541
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,060
Is that so?

542
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,670
If I want to go global and make some money, should I go for an unexpected sad ending?

543
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,460
Sad, sad.

544
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,220
You have come out?

545
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,490
How do you feel?

546
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,180
I feel much better after a good night's sleep.

547
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,640
Shall we go on a picnic today?

548
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,690
A picnic?

549
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,750
The wind is quite chilly. Will you be all right?

550
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:39,280
I want to go before it gets any colder.

551
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,630
And I also want to wear the clothes you made for me, Maiden.

552
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,400
What are you looking at so intently?

553
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,330
It is just...

554
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,010
that everything seems so beautiful.

555
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,190
Those mountains and the wind...

556
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,580
and you, too.

557
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,960
It is getting late.

558
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,340
We should go now.

559
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:49,180
Can I borrow... your shoulder just for today?

560
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:00,930
Do you know... that I like your name?

561
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,100
Yeon, which means to connect. And Woo, which means to meet.

562
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,900
It is such a heartwarming name.

563
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,350
Is that so?

564
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,790
I had a dream last night.

565
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,170
It was a place that I had never been to before,

566
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:26,410
and I was... in the body of a man who looks like me.

567
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,780
Every day, I stood in front of the crepe-myrtle tree

568
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,640
waiting for someone.

569
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,480
But no matter how much I waited, she never came. So I cried for a long time

570
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,640
because I missed her so much.

571
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,790
You also...

572
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,850
greatly missed that man who looks like me. Right?

573
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,920
I am sorry for making you suffer.

574
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,400
You must have been reminded of him every time you saw me.

575
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,810
I knew about it, but I could not let you go...

576
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,100
because I love you.

577
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,370
We should go now.

578
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,890
If there is a next life,

579
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:29,170
I will make sure to be reborn as him.

580
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,230
So will you come to meet me again?

581
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,530
Then, on that day,

582
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,820
you will be able to see me as well.

583
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,860
You must not forget and come to meet me.

584
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,030
After meeting you,

585
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:57,300
I was in pain, sad, and felt a longing,

586
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,270
but I am glad.

587
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,970
I was glad that...

588
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,730
I could dwell with you even for a moment...

589
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,990
I was happy that...

590
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,770
I was able to be with you.

591
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,330
Have you been well?

592
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,820
I dropped by to say goodbye before I went to take the state exam.

593
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,350
You are taking the state exam?

594
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,570
Since I need to take care of my household now.

595
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:22,170
Brother left something behind, so I brought it with me.

596
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,220
I had someone put it in your room.

597
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,590
Yes, thank you.

598
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,540
Then I will go on my way now.

599
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,730
Be well.

600
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,380
What kind of person was your brother to you, Young Master?

601
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,000
He was such a good brother to me.

602
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,310
I am glad to hear that.

603
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,090
 How dare a girl talk back to me! So arrogant!

604
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:43,000
 If you pushed someone, you should apologize! Hurry up and apologize!

605
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,170
 You little—

606
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:59,060
 You do not know how happy I was to be able to protect you.

607
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,250
 Every time I wanted to see you, Yeon Woo,

608
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,290
 I would paint you over and over again.

609
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,120
 My name is Yeon Woo. Park Yeon Woo.

610
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,020
 It was because of this painting

611
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,280
 that I just watched and let you be.

612
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,150
I see that it was all you, Young Master.

613
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,470
The one who always protected me...

614
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,400
and saved me through this painting.

615
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,850

616
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,980
This painting...

617
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,350
Doesn't it remind you of Yeon Woo the more you look at it?

618
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:22,050
I was also very shocked when I first saw it.

619
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,540
It was like seeing a portrait of Yeon Woo when she was young.

620
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,660
But when is Yeon Woo coming back?

621
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,350
It's already been over a year.

622
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,800
I just don't understand this.

623
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,990
I'm sorry, Deputy Kang.

624
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,850
What don't you understand?

625
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,520
I told you, Han Seong Hee,

626
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,420
that the MZ generation's share of the art market has increased by about 41.7%.

627
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,850
Especially for an exhibit with a strong story concept like this one,

628
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,790
that demand will grow by 70%.

629
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:54,790
So, how does it make sense not to have any QR code or app to check the exhibit guide?

630
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:57,210
I told you to prepare it!

631
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,370
That's what you meant.

632
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,460
I will make sure to check it again.

633
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,210
We don't have a lot of time. Please hurry.

634
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,640
I will do it right now.

635
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,200
Gosh, amazing.

636
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,940
I thought Kang Dro had just reincarnated.

637
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,130
I know. He's exactly like him.

638
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,490
As if they weren't brothers.

639
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:18,450
He's pretty much Kang Borg. Kang Cyborg.

640
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,320
I think I could draw much better than this.

641
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,710
Why? Are you thinking of studying it again?

642
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,960
Gosh, no thanks.

643
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,910
Working at the company is the most entertaining these days.

644
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,580
I even have a nickname.

645
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,700
Kang Cyborg.

646
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,840
That's a bit too much.

647
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,950
That seems so much like Tae Ha. It's not like you are an imitation copy.

648
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,310
But that's why I like it.

649
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,920
Gosh, I'm hungry. You said you were going to buy me lunch.

650
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,450
All right, let's eat then. What do you want to eat?

651
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,450
What should I eat?

652
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,720
Yeon Woo.

653
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,700
Mother!

654
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:47,240
Deok Goo ran away?

655
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,270
Right before he was to be beheaded, he assaulted the government official and ran away.

656
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,680
With that said, you should come back home now.

657
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,860
Your father is quite worried about you, too.

658
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,380
I am sorry, Mother.

659
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,140
Why are you acting like this?

660
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:11,730
Why are you struggling like that all by yourself?

661
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:26,240
W-What is that?

662
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,780
It may be a long story.

663
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,400
Will you listen to it?

664
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,330
I believe your story of how you went

665
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,850
to the new Joseon, Yeon Woo.

666
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:49,520
However, you should forget about it.

667
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,460
You should live your life now.

668
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:22,170
I want to go to you, but I do not know what to do.

669
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:28,140
Must I... really forget everything like this?

670
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:37,580
All right. I should at least hear your last words.

671
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,480
You bastard! What are you doing!

672
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,340
There is no point in struggling.

673
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:49,150
All you would be doing is speeding up your death.

674
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,790
What are you doing!

675
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,300
Are you not afraid of divine punishment?

676
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,230
Divine punishment...

677
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:59,320
I will receive it then... after I kill you.

678
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,810
All I did was do what I was told,

679
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:06,870
while His Excellency Kang that bastard is living perfectly fine and well.

680
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:12,180
Thus, I will take your life

681
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:15,070
for ruining my life.

682
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:04,800
Do not be resentful and pass into Paradise.

683
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:11,230
You are the one who ruined your own life.

684
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:24,510
You wench! Stop right there!

685
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:53,260
There is no point in you running away.

686
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,870
Come here.

687
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,700
I said, come here!

688
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,760
Hurry up.

689
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:26,680
Hurry up!

690
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:44,390
 So, hurry up and come back.

691
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:46,720
 I'll be waiting for you here.

692
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,910
Yeon Woo...

693
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:15,670
No...

694
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,070
No.

695
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,360
No!

696
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,830
Yeon Woo...

697
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,740

698
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:10,490
♫  One day I had a dream  ♫

699
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:14,600
Trickster Guy!

700
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:23,590
♫  I sat there helplessly for a while  ♫

701
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:29,370
​♫  and thought of your face  ♫

702
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,570
 Trickster Guy.

703
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:31,830
 Hey, Trickster Guy.

704
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:35,180
 Because you are so cool, Trickster Guy.

705
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:45,990
♫  Our days are scattered and thrown away  ♫

706
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:54,360
♫  I thought I was lucky it was just a dream  ♫

707
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:01,750
​♫  Why is that day now in front of me?  ♫

708
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:09,270

709
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,980
Did you... really come back?

710
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,200
I came back.

711
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,200
Was I too late in coming?

712
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,320
It's all right.

713
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,920
I told you I would wait for you.

714
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:55,580
I heard your longing as you've prayed for a long time for me.

715
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,680
And that longing...

716
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:02,600
finally became my fate.

717
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:16,590
It is now our fate, Yeon Woo.

728

I vow here in this place that the two of us

729
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:50,080
who lived looking at different things...

730
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:53,760
will be together forever with one heart.

731
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,460
By chance, you aren't trying to trick me again. Right?

732
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:03,440
Depends on how you act, my princess lady.

733
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,390
Forget that!

734
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,950
Since I put my seal on you, you are mine now.

735
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:27,310
♫  By coincidence, I am here now  ♫

736
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:35,040
♫  Like fate, I look at you again  ♫

737
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:44,270
♫  You bloom like a dream inside of me  ♫
