00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,018
Edmar!

4
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,650
Edmar!

5
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,869
Son of…

6
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:58,138
Edmar!

7
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:01,444
Edmar!

8
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:03,869
Get up, now!

9
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:07,439
We're already out of water,
and you didn't bother to fetch some!

10
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:11,765
[bed creaking]

11
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,353
Hey! Answer me!

12
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:15,239
Wait a second

13
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:16,719
Hurry up!

14
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:20,694
Fetch some water already!
I still need to go to the market!

15
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:25,747
[fly buzzing]

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,872
[fly buzzing]

17
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,758
Mom, it is still early!

18
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:52,868
You are such a peculiar kid!

19
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:57,290
Fetch some water already, please!
I just need two buckets of water.

20
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,333
- Go now! Make it fast!
- On it!

21
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:01,746
You are so stubborn!

22
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:23,782
Edmar!

23
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,586
What are you doing?
I told you to hurry up, right?

24
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:35,301
What now, Edmar?

25
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:44,458
What is that?

26
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,553
A rubber.

27
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:48,723
I know, but what are you
planning to do with that?

28
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,968
- I will use it to tie...
- What are you going to tie?

29
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:53,741
Our hose.

30
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,355
Why are you going to tie the hose?

31
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,812
Water is not coming out of the hose,
because there might be a leak.

32
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:05,843
Why didn't you tell me
that there is no water flowing?

33
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,236
Did you even ask?

34
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,263
You annoying kid!

35
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:12,808
Do you want me to use this
and tie it around your neck?

36
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,596
So annoying.

37
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,262
Start fetching some water please.

38
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,317
I will.

39
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:28,323
Fill up the drum and pail
with water, and then fix the hose.

40
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:30,448
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

41
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,379
You're just saying that!

42
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:37,917
I told you many times,

43
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:41,862
that once there is no water left,
you must fetch some, remember?

44
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:45,682
You must fill up the drum
and pail, remember?

45
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:48,596
Mom, it was raining last night.

46
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:53,526
You are such a smart-ass!

47
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:54,963
Go now!

48
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,338
Alright!

49
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,573
[sighs]

50
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,754
We'll be kicked out of this place?

51
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:35,567
Apparently.

52
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,855
Because Ofelia is not giving
our rental fees to Mrs. Gonzalo.

53
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:42,905
What?

54
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,616
Yeah.

55
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:48,645
All our payments since last year
were not delivered.

56
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,755
Our debt to Mrs. Gonzalo
is already around three million.

57
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,448
Hey, it's 2.8 million.

58
00:07:56,473 --> 00:08:00,583
If we do not do something about it,
all of our families will starve.

59
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,073
Jesus Christ!

60
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,076
She already disappeared!
We got swindled.

61
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:11,834
They said Ofelia Goja
isn't her true name.

62
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:13,836
We are so stupid!

63
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:20,678
I told you from the start that
I don't trust that woman.

64
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:23,702
Look what happened to us?
We were all fooled by her.

65
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:26,280
Now what? We are doomed.

66
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:28,134
Let's file a case.

67
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,111
She's missing but we will
still file a class suit.

68
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:38,756
I will talk to Atty. Glenda right away

69
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:40,679
You should sign already.
We will sign too.

70
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:43,745
Sign it now then I will
make others do the same.

71
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,375
I will be the OIC for the meantime.

72
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,688
Do it now!

73
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:51,669
I will sign it as well.
You should sign too.

74
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:53,494
We need everyone’s support.

75
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:03,333
[chattering]

76
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:04,983
Should I sign here?

77
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:07,475
Your turn.

78
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,991
Don’t be late in Barangay, okay?

79
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,943
I will come back.
My regular is already here.

80
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,833
Hey, I'm sorry about the wait.

81
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:26,708
[chattering]

82
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:36,619
It's been a year since you last
used the tricycle.

83
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:38,813
Does it have any damage?

84
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:46,126
Edmar.

85
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,061
You need to start working.

86
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:52,994
Sort yourself out!

87
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,791
Okay?

88
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,322
You are a good looking guy,
you should not waste that.

89
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:02,807
You are not getting any younger.

90
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:08,345
You need to earn some money
even just for your own sustainability.

91
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:14,001
Save money so you could study.

92
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,674
Life is hard nowadays,

93
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:20,564
you need to finish a degree.

94
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:30,363
A two year course would be
enough to find a decent job.

95
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:35,607
That is one thing
I regret the most.

96
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,166
When...

97
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:42,130
I didn't prioritize my studies
when I was in college.

98
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,724
I was focused on my boyfriend

99
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,337
because it feels good.

100
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:50,391
I liked having one.

101
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:58,924
But in the end, it was just nothing.

102
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,072
That is why I want you to find a job.

103
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:14,124
Because…

104
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,007
With my limited earnings
working in the market,

105
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:23,736
we cannot sustain
all of our daily expenses.

106
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:33,039
We have to pay for electricity,
water and food.

107
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:37,330
Prices keep going up,
and I'm having a hard time.

108
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:39,798
Also...

109
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:43,575
we have a problem in the market.

110
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:52,877
Hey!

111
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:56,142
Hey!

112
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,199
Yes, Mom?

113
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:59,267
Do you understand what I am saying?

114
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:02,948
Did you hear all the things I said?

115
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,423
What was that?

116
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:07,376
Sorry I didn’t hear it.

117
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,664
Dumbass! Your mind is floating again!

118
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:17,657
That's because you're always jerking off!

119
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,267
Annoying kid!

120
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,290
Unbelievable.

121
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,830
I don’t know where
you get that stupidity.

122
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:31,314
You are old enough already,
so find a job!

123
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:36,822
Where can I find one?

124
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,408
Where?

125
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,920
- You are so cute!
- It hurts, Mom!

126
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:58,243
Stop messing around,
you're pissing me off!

127
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:00,523
Oh my, Demetrio!

128
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:05,673
You are such a cute kid! Just eat!

129
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,182
[sighs]

130
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:50,028

131
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:03,065
[running water]

132
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:48,693
Karisma!

133
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,990
Karisma!

134
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,999
I want to pee.

135
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,967
[groaning]

136
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:42,764
[groaning]

137

[exhales]

138
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,912
Can you get that?

139
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,334
[groaning]

140
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:07,678
[groaning]

141
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:13,311
I will go to the market.

142
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,623
So, are you going to the market?

143
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,725
What should we eat later?

144
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,630
Okay, let's have beef stew.

145
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:32,326
Then buy some dessert,
alpahor with mixed coconut milk.

146
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:36,154
Also, buy efficascent oil and baby oil.

147
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,329
What else?

148
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:43,389
Lastly, my favorite, Alfonso!

149
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,670
[laughing]

150
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:46,529
I thought you said
you'll stop drinking?

151
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:52,803
Did you know that if I die,
you will have everything that I have?

152
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,333
This is too much.

153
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,233
That's yours.

154
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:01,553
I have a lot of money and I don’t know
how I am going to spend it all.

155
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,943
[sighs]

156
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:07,116
I already did a lot of things in my life.

157
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:11,490
I traveled to different countries.

158
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:13,524
Of course,

159
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,185
I achieved all of my dreams now.

160
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,343
But you know what my ultimate dream is?
None other than you!

161
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:24,258
[chuckling]

162
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:25,982
Come here!

163
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:29,068
I don't want anything else.

164
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:31,627
You are here.

165
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,935
Don’t you want to be healed?

166
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:37,761
Why?

167
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:43,959
Don’t you believe that
my dick can still do it?

168
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:47,503
I have 11 inches, remember?

169
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:49,529
We will get there.

170
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:55,037
Back then, I was bedridden,
but now I can stand.

171
00:19:55,068 --> 00:20:00,107
You will never know,
I might walk again and fuck you.

172
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,178
[laughing]

173
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:12,939
For me, you are precious.
Your palms, it heals me.

174
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:18,400
Your lips, your body.

175
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:21,719
Of course.

176
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:26,400
Tell me what I should say next.

177
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,791
Ask how it is.

178
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:29,628
- What?
- Ask how it is.

179
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:30,532
Come on.

180
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:33,705
Check my dick.

181
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,126
It is still functioning.

182
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:37,562
Are you sure?

183
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,478
Last night, it did function.

184
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:41,838

191
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,333
You are such a bad girl

Bad girl! Bad girl!

195
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:27,540
Hurry up.

196
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:31,790
Don’t forget the money

197
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:52,767
The reason why I gathered you here
is because I have good news and bad news,

198
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,439
but I will announce first the good news.

199
00:21:56,553 --> 00:22:02,688
Now, we can already file
an Estafa case against Ofelia Gojar.

200
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:06,848
[cheering]

201
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:11,291
The real name of Ofelia
is Luzviminda Gawaran.

202
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:14,638
We already went to the NBI
to investigate her

203
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,766
and I promise that she will be punished.

204
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,861
We will bring it to the court to ensure
that she will be caught.

205
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:27,403
Thank you, we're so grateful
for you, Attorney!

206
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,820
May we now know the bad news?

207
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:30,899
Right…

208
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:39,275
If we don't settle the payment
to Mrs. Gonzalo in one month,

209
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:42,443
we can still be kicked out in the market.

210
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:45,348
You know that we are paying, Attorney.

211
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:46,711
We're paying!

212
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:49,523
Yet, we can still be kicked out?
Our income is low!

213
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:53,338
- Yeah!
- We are paying our monthly dues!

214
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:56,063
But we got swindled, right?

215
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:59,043
Ofelia is shameless.
I hope she rots in prison!

216
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:00,580
Yeah!

217
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:05,643
She's been like that.
She's a certified scammer.

218
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:07,955
I understand where
you are all coming from.

219
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,713
That is why we will expedite
the creation of a demand letter.

220
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:16,978
We will submit a petition
against Luzviminda Gawaran.

221
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:20,166
Until when should we wait, Attorney?

222
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:20,948
Here.

223
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:23,369
All the people in the
market already signed.

224
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:27,830
Read it carefully.

226
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:33,869
Edmar!

227
00:23:34,024 --> 00:23:35,523
Come here.

228
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:42,158
Can you massage my head,
shoulders, and neck?

229
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:43,642
Okay mom.

230
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:56,470
Just put pressure here, and there.

231
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,095
- And put less oil.
- Yes mom.

232
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,166
Mom.

233
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,361
How old are you?

234
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,235
I'm 44, why?

235
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:19,597
If dad was alive,
how old would he be?

236
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:25,218
Your dad was fifteen years older than me.

237
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:27,563
- Fifteen?
- Yes!

238
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:30,259
Why did you fall
for someone older than you?

239
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:34,603
Just shut up and focus
on what you’re doing.

240
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,889
You’re making my head hurt.

241
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:41,705
You know,

242
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,104
when it comes to women.

243
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:53,509
When their partner is younger,
or of the same age.

244
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:55,199
They’re just a headache.

245
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:58,648
Because they’re immature and childish.

246
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:01,038
They’re just another problem.

247
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:05,201
But when men are older,

248
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:08,276
they know how to make you happy.

249
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,533
Because they’ll take care of you,

250
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:15,876
and they understand you.

251
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:17,946
Because...

252
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:20,908
They're open-minded.

253
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:24,275
They have lots of experience.

254
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,588
You know, your father loved me very much.

255
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:42,705
We never fought.

256
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:47,955
He understands me and
was very patient with me.

257
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,611
That’s why we were
happy with each other.

258
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,358
How old was I again
when my father died?

259
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:59,007
You were almost two years old back then.

260
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:01,448
You were still naive.

261
00:26:04,058 --> 00:26:05,791
How did he die?

262
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:11,558
Heart attack.

263
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:15,588
Why did he have a heart attack?

264
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,827
It happened while we were making love.

265
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:25,289
Can you stop asking too much?

266
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,095
You’re giving me a headache.

267
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:37,242
Mom?

268
00:26:38,302 --> 00:26:39,939
What now?

269
00:26:41,062 --> 00:26:45,132
Do you know the meaning of charisma?

270
00:26:45,393 --> 00:26:48,287
I told you not to ask me questions anymore.

271
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:51,705
I can’t understand
what I’m watching.

272
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:08,095
Isn’t it when you become attracted to
someone because of her charm, right?

273
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,908
For crying out loud!
You talk too much!

274
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:18,742
Why can’t you just massage me?
Never mind! Just go to your room.

275
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,829
- I’ll stop now.
- What is up with you?

276
00:27:20,854 --> 00:27:22,767
I rarely ask you to do something for me.

277
00:27:22,994 --> 00:27:24,572
Yes, yes.

278
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,409
Right there, on the shoulders.

279
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:28,434
Okay.

280
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:32,673
Can you let me relax for once?

281
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:34,488
You keep on asking questions.

I just slipped, sorry.

You bastard!

291
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:12,388
Why?

292
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,383
You’re going to leave it like that?

293
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,776
Fix that!

294
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,526
I know you’re peeping at me

295
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:42,791
What?

296
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:44,284
Of course not!

297
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:47,112
I’m just looking for my goat.

298
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:54,628
Then why is your cock hard until now?

299
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:00,404
That’s how it is.

300
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:03,094
Is that bewitched?

301
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:10,578
Show it to me.

302
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,230
- What?
- Take it out.

303
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:19,619
What?

304
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:22,234
That.

305
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:29,323

or I’ll go out?

You’re changing.

You’re becoming more handsome.

What changed?

319
00:33:57,622 --> 00:34:00,692
Of course, you told me to fix myself.

00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:05,474
You know what?

00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:09,275
I remember your father.

How come?

Because, he’s also stylish.

He’s fashionable, clean,
always smells good.

- No, I’m not courting anyone, just eat.

Don’t ruin yourself because of girls.

There’s plenty of girls out there,

333
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:50,373
you can still choose
because you’re still young.

334
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:53,255
You said I’m not a kid anymore.

335

Don’t interrupt me,
I’m still giving you advice.

Listen to me.

I am Attorney Glenda Uy,

00:35:55,414 --> 00:36:01,256
I am just reminding everyone that
we’ll be having a meeting at twelve noon.

349
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:08,186
It’s about the demand letter
against Luzviminda Gawaran.

350
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,479
What if your mom came back?

351
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:14,668
No, she won’t, she’s still at a meeting.

Am I the only one?

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,420
Of course not,

355
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:27,255
I have a boyfriend at home, in the
streets, and you, here at the market.

356
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:32,271
It’s unfair, you rarely go here.

357
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:36,393
If you don’t want that kind of
arrangement, find someone new.

359
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:44,453
No, it’s fine, I love fucking you.

360
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:47,811
So that’s how it is then.

361
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:51,475
Are you enjoying this?

362
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,545
It’s okay.

363
00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:57,558
It’s hard to move in this place.

364
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:01,670
At least we have somewhere to fuck,
you complain too much.

365
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:07,404
Anyone there?
Can I buy something?

366
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:11,404
Betbet?

367
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:13,568
Just a moment!

368
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
Hey, Karisma.

369
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:19,255
Can I get a bottle of brandy?

370
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,037
Your uncle still hasn’t stopped drinking?

371
00:37:43,407 --> 00:37:48,139
Yes, he doesn’t want to quit.
He said it makes him happy.

372
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:53,818
Elders are really stubborn.
So, how is he?

373
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:59,224
He can now walk a little bit,
but I still support him.

374
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:01,543
I’m amazed by your perseverance.

375
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:04,418
You should make him stop drinking,
so you won’t have a hard time.

376
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,893
Why are you here?
Where’s your mom?

377
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,868
She’s in a meeting.

378
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:11,627
Yeah, I saw her earlier.

379
00:38:11,978 --> 00:38:14,388
They said they’ll kick out
all the vendors here.

380
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:15,463
What?

381
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:20,153
Because of the debt the cooperative owes
to the owner of this market.

382
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:21,448
Three million!

383
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:23,493
What? Three million?

384
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,904
The president collects
their rent every month.

385
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:30,467
But apparently, she didn’t
give it to the owner.

386
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:33,662
She took all the money,
and is now hiding.

387
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:36,452
Mom is really worried.

388
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:40,623
Because if they’re unable
to pay the three million debt.

389
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,451
They’ll be gone here for good.

390
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,161
Three million?

391
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:47,255
Where will they find a place
to relocate to?

392
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,904
This is the only marketplace here.

393
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:52,478
Three million?

394
00:38:53,379 --> 00:38:56,396
Do you have that kind of money?
Maybe you can lend them some?

395
00:38:57,646 --> 00:39:00,889
[sighs] Well, I’ll go now.

396
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:02,357
Okay.

397
00:39:07,584 --> 00:39:10,467
What happened to your cock?

398
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:13,236
Just suck it again.

399
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:16,361
Come on, suck it.

400
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:23,508
[moaning] More.

401
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:45,186
[dog barking]

402
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,607
Here’s your change, thank you!

403
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:37,508
Karisma!

404
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:50,068
What are you doing here?

405
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:51,216
Let me in.

406
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:53,262
He’s still asleep.

407
00:40:53,678 --> 00:41:00,388
[sensual music playing]

408
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:05,706
He might wake up.

409
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:07,597
No, he won’t.

410
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:14,613
Not here.

411
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:26,943
You’ve got a toilet here,

412
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:28,873
why do you take a bath outside?

413
00:41:28,898 --> 00:41:30,535
The water here is dirty.

414
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,636
I don’t want to fetch water.

415
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:32,769
Let’s do this quickly.

416
00:41:47,448 --> 00:42:16,343
[moaning]

417
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,458
Karisma!

418
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:38,483
[moaning]

419
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:47,397
[moaning]

420
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,488
Karisma!

421
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:53,553
[panting]

422
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:56,959
Why?

423
00:42:58,354 --> 00:42:59,803
I was just in the bathroom.

424
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,138
Because my stomach hurts.

425
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:09,592
Why? What did you eat?

426
00:43:09,974 --> 00:43:12,076
Okay, make me a cup of coffee.

427
00:43:15,263 --> 00:43:16,469
What now?

428
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:20,618
[sighs]

429
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:22,753
I’ll boil some water first.

430
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:24,155
I'll give it to you in a second.

431
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,670
Get right to it then.

432
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:31,371
And while you’re doing that, come here.

433
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:37,264
I missed you, you know that?

434
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:42,736
You’re so beautiful.

435
00:43:46,463 --> 00:43:47,453
Wait.

436
00:43:47,478 --> 00:43:48,959
I’ll do the dishes first.

437
00:44:18,393 --> 00:44:23,483
[kettle boiling]

438
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:24,368
Hey!

439
00:44:24,393 --> 00:44:29,912
[kettle boiling]

440
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:43,795
Sit right there.

[metal clanking]

443
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,912
What was that?

444
00:45:04,428 --> 00:45:05,518
It’s nothing.

445
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:14,449

00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:28,438
[moaning]

447
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:30,543
Time out! I can’t catch my breath.

448
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,442
I can't breathe.

449
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:10,255
Edmar?

450
00:46:11,331 --> 00:46:12,366
Edmar?

451
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:15,870
Mom’s not here.

452
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:18,144
What?

453
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:20,291
I saw her at the market.

454
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,475
She said she’s going to get her nails done.

455
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,378
We have no money,

456
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:26,488
yet she’s going to get her nails done?

457
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:29,592
You’re too negative.

458
00:46:30,342 --> 00:46:32,786
This makes her happy.

459
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,653
You really look like a player now.

460
00:46:43,827 --> 00:46:45,717
Are you a good fucker?

461
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:47,943
Just wait for her here.

462
00:46:48,065 --> 00:46:50,560
Stay here for a while.

463
00:46:51,383 --> 00:46:53,403
Why are you so grumpy?

464
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,989
Come here and let’s talk first.

465
00:47:00,014 --> 00:47:03,185
Since your mom’s not here yet.

466
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,935
Right?

467
00:47:05,938 --> 00:47:08,317
Stop frowning already.

468
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,280
What can I do to make you happy?

469
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:16,224
It's up to you.
What do you want?

470
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:17,786
Are you down?

471
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:20,286
What if I say, that's what I want.

472
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:27,060
This?

473
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,833
Go ahead.

474
00:47:33,044 --> 00:47:34,884
Eat it.

00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:21,587

478
00:48:56,573 --> 00:48:58,463
Divine! Did I keep you waiting?

479
00:48:58,488 --> 00:49:02,408
I told you to call
before going to my house.

480
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:06,430
I just arrived here.
Actually, I'm about to call you.

481
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:09,290
Wait a second. I need
to go to the bathroom.

482
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:13,317
Wait! Edmar's inside.

483
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,712
Edmar! Hurry up! I need to pee!

484
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:27,403
Come here.

00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:40,303
What kept you so long?
I really need to pee!

487
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:42,852
Divine, I'll just go to the bathroom.

488
00:49:42,877 --> 00:49:46,274
Sure, go ahead. I will wait here.

489
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:47,508
Okay.

Beautiful!

494
00:51:45,278 --> 00:51:49,428
You're such a bad girl! [laughing]

495
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:54,504
Bad girl!

00:53:40,237 --> 00:53:41,593
Stay here.

00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:27,256
Karisma.

500
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:31,881
Why are you here again?

501
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:35,741
He's sleeping already.
You can let me in.

502
00:55:19,508 --> 00:55:21,478
Don't make any noise.

503
00:55:21,503 --> 00:55:23,467
You dance so well.

504
00:55:24,284 --> 00:55:26,006
I was watching you a while ago.

00:56:21,518 --> 00:56:22,863
Where did you go?

510
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:26,570
Nowhere.

511
00:56:27,496 --> 00:56:29,586
What do you mean nowhere?
I'm asking you where did you go?

512
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:32,721
Up on the hill.

513
00:56:32,746 --> 00:56:35,567
I just checked the water hose.

514
00:56:36,183 --> 00:56:38,632
Stop joking around, Edmar!
I'm telling you!

515
00:56:43,478 --> 00:56:44,715
[sighs]

516
00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:14,059
Attorney, can you do this...

517
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:15,856
last will and testament that I made.

518
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:19,840
I did this before I had a stroke.

519
00:57:20,656 --> 00:57:21,676
Check it out.

520
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:22,754
Sure.

521
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,606
So, based on what is written here...

522
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:33,453
You will give all your
inheritance and bank savings.

523
00:57:33,478 --> 00:57:35,846
That is worth 20 million.

524
00:57:35,871 --> 00:57:36,957
Yes.

525
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:41,262
And all of this will be inherited by
your adopted daughter,

526
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,691
Maria Karisma Oliveria.

527
00:57:43,716 --> 00:57:45,598
- Is that right?
- Yes, all of it.

528
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:46,902
Yes.

529
00:57:48,629 --> 00:57:51,498
- Is she here?
- Who? Karisma?

530
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,488
Karisma! Come!

531
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:55,221
Come over here!

532
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:05,745
I will introduce you
to my daughter, Karisma.

533
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:08,523
He is Attorney Jimmy.

534
00:58:08,548 --> 00:58:10,523
Jimmy Acosta.

535
00:58:10,548 --> 00:58:15,676
He will arrange my last will and testament
that I will give to you.

536
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,508
So…

537
00:58:20,518 --> 00:58:21,613
How old are you?

538
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:23,483
I’m 22.

539
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:24,777
Oh, you're 22.

540
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,059
Do you have a…

541
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:32,121
Husband? Child?

542
00:58:32,146 --> 00:58:34,840
- Boyfriend?
- No. She doesn't have one.

543
00:58:35,104 --> 00:58:38,164
I don’t allow it because
she's still in school.

544
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:39,801
She will finish her studies.

545
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,205
- Studying?
- Yes.

546
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:46,745
What course are you taking?

547
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:47,913
Nursing.

548
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,130
Wow, nursing.

549
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:53,098
Yes, but she stopped studying
because I got sick.

550
00:58:53,123 --> 00:58:56,395
That's why I told her
to take care of me first.

551
00:58:56,844 --> 00:59:00,043
But this upcoming school year,
she will continue to study.

552
00:59:03,227 --> 00:59:05,793
Just a second.
What do you want to drink, Attorney?

553
00:59:06,002 --> 00:59:08,017
Coffee? Juice?

554
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:11,295
Juice.

555
00:59:12,098 --> 00:59:14,208
Alright. Get him a juice.

556
00:59:23,082 --> 00:59:25,450
How'd she become
your adopted daughter?

557
00:59:25,989 --> 00:59:31,099
I was close to Karisma's family.

558
00:59:33,413 --> 00:59:35,270
Her father

559
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,453
was working for
me as a draftsman.

560
00:59:38,478 --> 00:59:40,682
- I was an architect.
- I see.

561
00:59:40,707 --> 00:59:45,215
I had a business,
because I'm a building contractor.

562
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,848
In other words.

563
00:59:47,213 --> 00:59:49,558
The reason why me and
her family became close

564
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:56,125
is because of a common friend's wedding.

565
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,101
After that,

566
00:59:58,358 --> 01:00:01,778
I always visit their house.

567
01:00:01,803 --> 01:00:05,003
She started calling me uncle.

568
01:00:05,859 --> 01:00:08,665
Yes, until...

569
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:17,023
I caught her attention,
because of the treats I gave her.

570
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:18,406
[chuckling]

571
01:00:21,749 --> 01:00:23,688
When she was 12 years old…

572
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:25,639
12 years old?

573
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,836
Yes, when she was 12 years old,

574
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:31,563
she experienced a big tragedy in her life.

575
01:00:31,736 --> 01:00:34,686
Her parents...

576
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:42,513
They had a car crash.

577
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:49,070
Her mother was dead on arrival
at the hospital.

578
01:00:49,115 --> 01:00:54,703
Her father was in a grave condition,
he was in shock.

579
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,234
He lived,
but only for a short moment.

580
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:04,750
But when he died,
he asked me to take care of Karisma.

581
01:01:06,983 --> 01:01:08,963
So…

582
01:01:11,476 --> 01:01:12,664
I see…

583
01:01:13,501 --> 01:01:17,471
Do you have any relatives left?

584
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,151
No one.

585
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:22,171
My marriage didn’t work out.

586
01:01:22,475 --> 01:01:24,370
Because of my business,

587
01:01:24,395 --> 01:01:28,280
I had to go to different places
and had to leave my wife.

588
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:31,772
Sad to say, she found someone else.

589
01:01:33,468 --> 01:01:35,080
So, you mean,

590
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:37,707
from 12 years old to 22 years old,

591
01:01:37,835 --> 01:01:40,989
she has been living with you
for ten years now.

592
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:43,303
That’s right. What should we do?

593
01:01:43,757 --> 01:01:46,466
I think we should make an affidavit,

594
01:01:46,491 --> 01:01:50,882
so that the support documents
would be stronger.

595
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:56,780
Okay, that's good.
so that it would be approved by the court.

596
01:01:57,969 --> 01:01:59,059
Yes.

597
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:01,146
Is it possible...

598
01:02:01,647 --> 01:02:03,842
Attorney, can you...

599
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:06,264
Can you do that today?

600
01:02:06,527 --> 01:02:09,527
Of course. It's easy.

601
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,603
May I know your real name?

602
01:02:15,413 --> 01:02:19,905
- Vicencio De Leon.
- Vicencio De Leon...

603
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,048
Paras!

604
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:30,541
(moaning)

605
01:02:31,478 --> 01:02:33,378
Demetrio?

606
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:44,858
Who is that?

607
01:02:48,194 --> 01:02:49,044
What?

608
01:02:49,068 --> 01:02:50,259
Get dressed.

609
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:55,298
Shit, we never got to finish!

610
01:02:58,076 --> 01:03:02,469
What’s the matter with you, Edmar?
You always leave me hanging.

611
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:06,673
Damn it!

612
01:03:08,193 --> 01:03:10,273
When can we meet again?

613
01:03:21,272 --> 01:03:22,462
Why did you come here?

614
01:03:22,947 --> 01:03:25,736
- I’ll just leave then.
- Don't.

615
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,423
I think you’re busy.

616
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:29,179
It’s nothing.

617
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:33,849
Let's go there.

618
01:03:40,702 --> 01:03:42,672
Who’s with you at home?

619
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:44,427
Just my mother.

620
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:47,205
But she’s at her stall
in the market right now.

621
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:49,720
She comes home late.

622
01:03:49,977 --> 01:03:51,001
Have a seat.

623
01:03:54,825 --> 01:03:59,742
Then who’s the girl with you?

624
01:03:59,767 --> 01:04:00,827
Girl?

625
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:02,418
No one.

626
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:04,017
I heard it.

627
01:04:05,518 --> 01:04:06,752
I said, it's nothing.

628
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:10,222
- Is he asleep?
- Yes.

629
01:04:10,528 --> 01:04:11,578
But...

630
01:04:12,185 --> 01:04:13,696
I can’t stay long.

631
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:05,117
What is your relationship with him?

632
01:06:06,108 --> 01:06:07,158
Is he your husband?

633
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,210
Are you married to him?

634
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:10,930
No.

635
01:06:11,324 --> 01:06:13,000
He adopted me.

636
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,096
Huh?

637
01:06:14,899 --> 01:06:15,829
What?

638
01:06:18,448 --> 01:06:20,408
I was a child when he adopted me.

639
01:06:21,661 --> 01:06:23,631
My mother and father died.

640
01:06:24,426 --> 01:06:25,898
He’s my father’s friend.

641
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,164
He was close to us.

642
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,984
I call him uncle.

643
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:33,820
That’s why he adopted me.

644
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:36,623
Don’t you have a relative?

645
01:06:36,648 --> 01:06:37,777
I have.

646
01:06:38,175 --> 01:06:40,175
But all of them are in the province.

647
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:41,625
I don’t know them.

648
01:06:42,175 --> 01:06:43,969
They also don’t know me.

649
01:06:44,015 --> 01:06:45,975
What’s his name again?

650
01:06:46,227 --> 01:06:47,327
Vicencio.

651
01:06:48,198 --> 01:06:49,961
He is good to me.

652
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:57,199
I became close to him.

653
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:03,016
But of course, I’m still a child back then.
I have no malice yet.

654
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:05,562
We were living in Manila.

655
01:07:10,483 --> 01:07:12,508
But he’s molesting you.

656
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,120
At first,

657
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:16,611
he just touches my hair,

658
01:07:17,257 --> 01:07:18,711
the back of my neck,

659
01:07:19,433 --> 01:07:21,343
and then, my legs.

660
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,543
He told me...

661
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,558
He loves me very much,

662
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,458
and he will never leave me.

663
01:07:40,488 --> 01:07:41,988
You believe that?

664
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:45,154
It’s true he didn’t leave me.

665
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:46,717
But he’s molesting you.

666
01:07:46,742 --> 01:07:49,156
At first, I was scared.

667
01:07:49,453 --> 01:07:52,719
But it became normal to me.

668
01:07:52,966 --> 01:07:57,403
After all, we’re not blood related.

669
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:01,695
How old were you
when he got your virginity?

670
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:05,261
We keep on moving
from house to house.

671
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:13,922
If someone suspects, we'll leave that town.
Because I’m just a minor.

672
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:18,820
You know, if I’ll adopt you.
I will do the same.

673
01:08:19,315 --> 01:08:21,414
Because you really like doing it.

674
01:08:23,212 --> 01:08:26,324
It's been about a year
since we've lived here.

675
01:08:26,417 --> 01:08:29,125
He already bought the house and lot.

676
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,539
We really looked into a secluded town.

677
01:08:31,981 --> 01:08:33,570
He got a stroke here.

678
01:08:34,673 --> 01:08:36,211
What’s your plan?

679
01:08:36,473 --> 01:08:40,533
Nothing. I’ll just play around
with you without him knowing.

680
01:08:40,718 --> 01:08:42,303
What if we got caught?

681
01:08:42,478 --> 01:08:44,633
That’s why, don’t ever
come to my house.

682
01:08:44,964 --> 01:08:46,608
You are just allowed in the bathroom.

683
01:08:46,633 --> 01:08:48,367
Just the bathroom? That’s it?

684
01:08:48,478 --> 01:08:50,187
Even, tricycle.

685
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,359
I can be anywhere.

686
01:11:04,358 --> 01:11:14,358
[moaning]

687
01:11:15,858 --> 01:11:17,858
You assholes!

688
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:20,358
[gunshot]

689
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:35,358
[panting]

690
01:12:12,358 --> 01:12:33,358
[crying]

691
01:13:51,358 --> 01:14:12,358
[rustling]

692
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:42,998
[crying]

693
01:14:43,397 --> 01:14:48,256
If you want to go, that is fine.

694
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:50,373
You are free.

695
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:53,748
I understand where you’re coming from.

696
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:56,358
[crying]

697
01:14:56,623 --> 01:14:59,162
I will give you money.

698
01:15:00,076 --> 01:15:02,076
Finish school.

699
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,506
Everything you need…

700
01:15:07,342 --> 01:15:09,842
The condominium in Manila,

701
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:12,459
I want you to live there.

702
01:15:13,037 --> 01:15:14,780
Do not mind me.

703
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:21,178
I know, I’ll be dead soon enough.

704
01:15:23,826 --> 01:15:25,928
There’s just one thing I want you to know,

705
01:15:26,926 --> 01:15:29,928
whatever it is that I did wrong,

706
01:15:31,881 --> 01:15:34,741
please forgive me.

707
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,949
I don’t want you to die.

708
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:44,498
I don’t want leave you.

709
01:15:46,998 --> 01:15:49,333
You did nothing wrong.

710
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:51,491
Nothing.

711
01:15:52,358 --> 01:15:53,958
I love you.

712
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:56,387
So much.

713
01:15:56,412 --> 01:15:58,811
I just can’t figure out how to say it.

714
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:01,287
I love you.

715
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:18,029
Wow.

716
01:17:18,054 --> 01:17:20,754
You keep on sharpening your machete.

717
01:17:25,536 --> 01:17:27,643
I’ll cut someone’s throat.

718
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,678
Whose throat?

719
01:17:30,154 --> 01:17:32,811
Do it to me.

720
01:17:33,443 --> 01:17:35,743
If you want, you can cut
through my pussy.

721
01:17:43,177 --> 01:17:45,818
You want it?

722
01:17:47,358 --> 01:17:48,522
Do it!

723
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:50,373
What?

724
01:17:51,341 --> 01:17:52,951
Go on.

725
01:18:03,864 --> 01:18:04,803
Ugh!

726
01:18:04,828 --> 01:18:07,028
Don’t waste your anger there.

727
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:10,881
It won’t fight back.

728
01:18:20,131 --> 01:18:21,431
I’ll slash you!

729
01:18:22,178 --> 01:18:25,278
You’re not in the mood?

730
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,756
Get out! Leave!

731
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,592
Stop it! Don’t push me!

732
01:18:31,842 --> 01:18:34,858
Crazy! Stupid! Idiot!

733
01:20:30,758 --> 01:20:31,458
Ugh!

734
01:20:35,358 --> 01:20:36,694
Ah!

735
01:20:41,358 --> 01:20:42,858

[screaming, crying]

743
01:21:54,756 --> 01:22:00,295
Monster! You monster!

744
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,639
Vicencio!

Please stay here. Stay here.

[chattering]

758
01:25:54,156 --> 01:25:56,217
Did you see him
while killing your uncle?

759
01:25:56,943 --> 01:26:02,014
Yes. He really wants
to kill my uncle.

760
01:26:03,553 --> 01:26:05,553
That’s why I shot him.

761
01:26:06,014 --> 01:26:07,514
Do you know him?

762
01:26:13,427 --> 01:26:15,373
Miss, are you okay?

763
01:26:27,459 --> 01:26:28,951
Edmar…

764
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:57,004
[crying]

765
01:27:14,358 --> 01:27:15,561
Edmar…

766
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:20,623
What have you done?

767
01:27:20,648 --> 01:27:22,648
Why did you do it?

768
01:27:24,966 --> 01:27:26,998
Why?

769
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,983
You’ll go to jail!

770
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,537
You’ll get arrested!

[crying]

774
01:28:03,178 --> 01:28:04,178
Attorney.

775
01:28:07,522 --> 01:28:09,022
Three million pesos?

776
01:28:10,092 --> 01:28:11,092
Three million pesos!

777
01:28:11,117 --> 01:28:14,209
Attorney, is this a joke?

778
01:28:15,615 --> 01:28:18,694
That is my client’s donation
for your cooperative.

779
01:28:19,107 --> 01:28:20,233
Out of good will.

780
01:28:20,896 --> 01:28:24,162
So, you can pay all your debt
to the market’s owner.

781
01:28:25,232 --> 01:28:26,732
Sign here, Attorney.

782
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:29,928
That means, that person knows us.

783
01:28:29,953 --> 01:28:32,333
Attorney, is it okay to know
who your client is?

784
01:28:32,358 --> 01:28:35,358
Sorry, they don't want
to reveal their identity.

785
01:28:35,882 --> 01:28:38,333
[chattering]

786
01:28:38,358 --> 01:28:40,194
How can we thank her, Attorney?

787
01:28:40,219 --> 01:28:43,333
I’m really sorry,
but it's confidential.

788
01:28:43,358 --> 01:28:44,858
I really can’t.

789
01:28:44,883 --> 01:28:46,139
Okay, this is it.

790
01:28:46,164 --> 01:28:47,444
Oh, I'm shaking!

791
01:28:47,469 --> 01:28:49,139
Three million!

792
01:28:49,164 --> 01:28:51,803
This is it! We got it!

793
01:28:51,828 --> 01:28:56,217
This is a gift from the heavens! A miracle!

794
01:28:56,242 --> 01:28:59,264
I wish God would bless her!

795
01:28:59,289 --> 01:29:00,850
Overflowing blessing, Loleng.

796
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:03,795
I can now pay for my son’s tuition!

797
01:29:04,818 --> 01:29:08,076
Overflowing! Overflowing blessings
from heaven!

798
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:09,905
Thank you, Lord!

799
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:11,333
Thank you so much!

800
01:29:11,358 --> 01:29:13,358
Thank you so much.

801
01:29:13,383 --> 01:29:14,951
Thank you, Attorney.

802
01:29:25,358 --> 01:29:26,358
They already got it.

803
01:29:27,358 --> 01:29:29,639
Thank you, Attorney.

804
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,200
Just tell me what you want,
and I’ll give it to you.

805
01:29:33,662 --> 01:29:35,576
As long as I can manage.

806
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:39,591
You don’t have to thank me.

807
01:29:39,616 --> 01:29:42,333
Your uncle Vicencio entrusted me
to take care of you.

808
01:29:42,358 --> 01:29:45,717
One of our agreements is that
I would personally take care of you.

809
01:29:46,052 --> 01:29:49,076
Unless, you want to fire me.

810
01:29:49,451 --> 01:29:50,768
I won’t fire you.

811
01:29:50,793 --> 01:29:53,069
- Why would I do that?
- Alright.

812
01:29:53,094 --> 01:29:56,131
If that’s the case, I’ll escort you
to your condo in Manila.

813
01:29:56,905 --> 01:29:58,905
You can start a new life there.

814
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:04,053
Alright. Just tell me, okay?

01:30:26,476 --> 01:30:29,764
