But why…

42
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,870
Why isn't it Din, then?

43
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,270
Why?

00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,390
Dear.

46
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,430
What's up with you?

47
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,910
I've seen you pacing around and mumbling.

48
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,230
What's the matter?

00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,510
I…

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,510
Mom, Dad!

What's going on?

52
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,070
Hey,

53
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,350
your old man is sitting right here.

54
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,790
I'm all good, no worries.

55
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,750
I thought…

56
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,350
I'd never see you again.

57
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,589
It's been so scary.

58
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,350
I'm so scared.

59
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,510
Don't be afraid, Mom.

60
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,110
We're in good hands now.

61
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,190
Right now, the police are on the case.

62
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,430

63
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,990

64
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,300
By the way, where is Sai?

65
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,630
I saw her heading to the hospital earlier this morning.

66
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,070
But she said we would go together, right?

67
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,190
What about those who attacked you?

68
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,310
Was it Nok's men...

69
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,030
Hold on!

70
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,790
Don't jump to conclusions yet.

71
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,909
We don't have all the facts right now.

72
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,270
Let's wait for the police to finish the investigation.

73
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,030
You didn't let anyone stay in your room, did you?

74
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,310
I finally saw what the villa owner's room looks like.

75
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,670
Thanks a lot, Sai.

76
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,870
Your old wounds haven't even healed yet.

77
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,550
You got lucky that the injuries aren't too bad.

78
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,430
You're lucky, this time the wounds aren't too serious.

79
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,670
Shouldn't you stop?

80
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,350
So right now,

81
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,950
Ingpha thinks that everything that happened

82
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,310
was all Lue's doing,

83
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,230
not Din's.

84
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,750
Now that he's seen my face.

85
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,590
I can also expose

86
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,870
their wrongdoings.

87
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,430
You have to be more careful

88
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,030
because you know best

89
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,310
what Ingpha's like.

90
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,030
The same goes for you.

91
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,670
I'm of no use to them.

92
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,910
When will all this end?

93
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,070
Soon.

94
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,740
But Ken doesn't know it was you, right?

95
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,990
Oh, man.

96
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,150
Ken...

97
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,110
You're such a bully.

98
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,030
Ugh!

99
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,430
What should I do now?

100
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,790
Ugh!

101
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,270
Oh, got it!

102
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,070
I'll eat first.

103
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,030
Hey!

104
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,630
There seems to be a lot of good food in this area.

105
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,350
But I'm not sure if

106
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,110
what I got is to your liking, though.

107
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,590
Yeah.

108
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,510
Who are you?

109
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,870
Are you working for Ingpha, aren't you?

110
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,750
No, I'm not!

111
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,670
Answer me!

112
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,550
Answer me!

113
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,350
Answer me!

114
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,310
I'm just into you!

115
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,150
Get out of my way!

116
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,710
Din is dead!

117
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,190
He's gone from this world.

118
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,740
Stop lying to yourself.

119
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,070
He's not coming back to you.

120
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,590
Lue!

121
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,910
Why?

122
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,750
Why did you lie to me?

123
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,230
Why did you have to fool me?

124
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,630
Hello, Payu.

125
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,990
I'm outside the clinic.

126
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,910
[Have you seen Dr. Chayeol yet?]

127
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,590
I've been waiting for an hour now,

128
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,310
and I still haven't seen him.

129
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,910
[Did you ask the staff when the doctor's going to be here?]

130
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,830
Yeah, I did.

131
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,070
They said he's going to be a bit late.

132
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,950
If anything comes up, let me know.

133
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,070
All right.

134
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,070
Sure.

135
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,110
Okay.

136
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,270
What now?

137
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,310
I'm pretty sure the doctor's been clued in on it.

138
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,710
Boon,

139
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,750
regarding the news you told me yesterday,

140
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,190
I'm afraid Hin will be shocked upon knowing it.

141
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,550
Let's see how it goes.

142
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,590
Yeah, we'll just have to see what happens next.

143
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,150
Hello, Sai.

144
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,190
I just got here.

145
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,190
[So, two years ago,]

146
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,150
having located Ken,

147
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,270
the authorities claimed

148
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,630
that Din left for Korea

149
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,070
for some medical treatment.

150
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:06,870
Huh?

151
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,030
All the way to Korea?

152
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,390
And the one who sent him there

153
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,550
was Dr. Chayeol.

154
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,830
And Sai went to Korea too

155
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,300
to get the paperwork sorted out

156
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,950
that Din had died there.

157
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,990
The hospital then

158
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,230
issued the death certificate.

159
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,070
Hold on.

160
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,870
Sai never told me about this.

161
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,510
I see.

162
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,270
After that, Sai lived in Korea for almost a year.

163
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,470
Well...

164
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,550
Where did Din receive his treatment?

165
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,070
PSB Hospital.

166
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,380
What?!

167
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,230
PSB Hospital?

168
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,510
That's where Dr. Chayeol worked.

169
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,270
I can't believe no one told me about this.

170
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,910
Hin.

171
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,550
Hey.

172
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,070
Are you having a seminar here?

173
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,550
Yes.

174
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,430
Anyway, what's it?

175
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,070
Oh!

176
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,510
It's about what happened to Dad and Mom, right?

177
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,390
The police is already taking care of it, no?

178
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,950
It's not about that.

179
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,310
I spoke to the staff and they said

180
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,710
that there's no seminar today.

181
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,710
There is one,

182
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,790
and I took a break just now.

183
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,830
Really?

184
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,350
Can I go and grab some snacks there?

185
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,230
Hin!

186
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,660
There are a lot of people inside.

187
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,700
If you are hungry, you can grab some snacks at the lobby.

188
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,750
The ones at the lobby taste much better.

189
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,910
Are you hiding something from me?

190
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,710
No.

191
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,990
Two years ago…

192
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,790
Why did you take Din to Korea?

193
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,870
Hmm?

194
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,470
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

195
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,550
Um,

196
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,550
if anyone wants to make an appointment, tell them I'll be away for the next 2–3 days.

197
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,150
Sure.

198
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,790
Where are you off to, Doctor?

199
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,870
I need to go to the airport.

200
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,830
Sorry about that.

201
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,110
Oh, Doctor.

202
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,990
You are…

203
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,030
I'm Knot, Ken's friend.

204
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,110
You're not hurt, are you?

205
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,790
Doctor.

206
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,790
Hey, Knot.

207
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,510
Payu.

208
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,670
Both of you are…

209
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,390
Din.

210
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,940
Sai.

211
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,110
You.

212
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,750
Is there something you need?

213
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,550
What's going on, Knot?

214
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,630
I've just had a vision.

215
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,710
What did you see?

216
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,350
Um...

217
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,750
Excuse me, I should get going.

218
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,150
What did you see?

219
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,350
I really can't reach him.

220
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,190
He's not answering my calls.

221
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,110
I've been calling him non-stop

222
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,900
and now my phone feels like it's on fire.

223
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,230
See it if you don't believe me.

224
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,110
No!

225
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,710
I told you to follow him like a shadow.

226
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,470
And you still lost him. Come on.

227
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,430
Hey, Vice… I mean Payu.

228
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,870
Let me tell you what Ken did.

229
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,470
Enough already.

230
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,870
I don't want to listen to what you have to say.

231
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,710
Hey.

232
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,510
Ken's phone is on now.

233
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,990
Why didn't you tell me you've had a tracker on his phone?

234
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,030
Too many secrets here.

235
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,750
You just drive, okay?

236
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,870
Roger that.

237
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,430
Can you drive faster?

238
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,430
He's just ahead of us.

239
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,470
Chill, man.

240
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,470
There he is!

241
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,590
I'm going to tail him.

242
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,430
You!

243
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,870
Stop messing with me

244
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,830
and get out of my life!

245
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,870
I don't need you!

246
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,550
Just go!

247
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,230
Din is my only love.

248
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,110
[Hin]

249
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,950
Hello?

250
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,150
How long has it been since we got drunk together, huh?

251
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,750
[Dad]

252
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,230
Hello?

253
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,190
What are you up to, Dad?

254
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,150
I've just closed the restaurant,

255
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,070
and I'm working on the book.

256
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,670
Is there anything?

257
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,670
I'm just missing you.

258
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,630
Wait!

259
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,510
Why is the signal gone?

260
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,670
What?

261
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,910
Ken's signal is lost.

262
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,590
Huh?

263
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,590
He was right here just now.

264
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,030
What should we do now?

265
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,390
Darn it!

266
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,510
How come it just vanished like this?

267
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,910
[Hin]

268
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,990
Hello?

269
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,540
How long has it been since we got drunk together, huh?

270
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,110
Mr...

271
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,670
Think before you act.

272
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,900
Are you going to call me "Brother"

273
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,190
or what?

274
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,710
Huh?

275
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,030
My little brother.

276
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,950
What are you talking about?

277
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,710
I don't get it.

278
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,190
What don't you get?

279
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,710
It's me, your big brother.

280
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,390
[Din]

281
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,390
Don't do anything stupid.

282
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,630
I beg of you.

283
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,110
But I have to put an end to all this.

284
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,390
Don't move!

285
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,670
Ken!

286
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,430
I don't want you to speak right now!

287
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,750
Was it because of you?

288
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,470
Din didn't meet me at the wooden bridge.

289
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,590
I asked if it was because of you?

290
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,230
Ken!

291
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,230
You stay out of this!

292
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,710
Ken.

293
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,590
If the person you're going to meet

294
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,750
has put his life at stake to protect you and your family,

295
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,310
and he's had countless surgeries

296
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,670
so that he can come back and see you,

297
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,870
are you still angry with him?

298
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,350
What on earth are you talking about?

299
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,670
What if Lue

300
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,790
is the one you've been waiting for?

301
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:47,830
Humph!

302
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,750
Ridiculous!

303
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,070
Stop talking nonsense, Yu.

304
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,550
I'm telling you the truth.

305
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,950
Do you think I'm naive?

306
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,470
Calm down, Ken!

307
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,270
You back off!

308
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,230
Has he ever asked how I feel?

309
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,910
What am I supposed to do?

310
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,030
Is it fair to leave me alone in despair like this?

311
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,630
Have you guys ever asked how I feel?

312
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,830
What do I really need?

313
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,070
Have you ever thought about how I feel?

314
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,630
Huh?

315
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,390
See!

316
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,670
You guys don't give a darn!

317
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,710
You really want to replace Din, right?

318
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,750
You want to be Din, right?

319
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,710
So tonight,

320
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,350
you have to make me forget Din.

321
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,070
And I'll spare your life.

322
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,870
You have to leave, Din.

323
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,070
I can't.

324
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,590
Sai, you have to trust me.

325
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,950
Just take Ken and go.

326
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,950
No way, it's not okay.

327
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,590
Doctor!

328
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,390
Let's go.

329
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,390
Doctor.

330
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,590
Please help me.

331
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,070
Listen to me.

332
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,310
I can't live here anymore.

333
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,430
How are you doing?

334
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,710
Okay.

335
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,830
So we're doing the surgery tomorrow morning, okay?

336
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,940
Can't you do it now?

337
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,870
I'm getting antsy here.

338
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,230
Hey!

339
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,270
I'd better send you to Thailand tonight.

340
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,790
Sounds good, huh?

341
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,270
I feel like giving him a little smack.

342
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,750
Don't hit him that way.

343
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,350
I feel pity for him.

344
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,470
Doctor,

345
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,390
the patient, Peter Lue is experiencing a shock.

346
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,510
A shock?

347
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,510
Yes, a shock.

348
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,350
Just go.

349
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:29,710
Okay.

350
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,990
Ready!

351
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,150
Clear!

352
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,670
How are you today, Din?

353
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,390
Are you feeling better?

354
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,110
Yeah.

355
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,030
Definitely better.

356
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,870
I'm all good.

357
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,510
-Hello.
-Hello.

358
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,350
How was it?

359
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,990
The patient is a foreigner

360
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,310
and no one knows how to contact his family.

361
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,790
I can declare him deceased now.

362
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,230
If we send his body back, we could face some consequences.

363
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:54,070
Also, the media here is harsh.

364
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,990
But it wasn't your fault, right?

365
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,310
You're right.

366
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,430
But the hospital and doctors will be under media scrutiny.

367
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,390
Wait a second.

368
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,190
What if I die here like that guy?

369
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,110
So Sai can certify my death, right?

370
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,630
Din!

371
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,950
[Are you saying that…]

372
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,430
[Doctor,]

373
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,150
[can you perform surgeries to make me look like him?]

374
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,230
[Can you do it?]

375
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,710
[You'll need to do skin grafting]

376
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,710
[to transplant his fingerprints onto your hands.]

377
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,390
[Your vocal cords will also need to be operated on.]

378
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,270
[You'll have to go through a number of surgeries.]

379
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,590
[That means you're putting your life on the line.]

380
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:20,070
[If doing so means I can protect Ken and our family,]

381
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,030
[I'm willing to take the risk.]

382
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,230
[I'm not going back there as Din Torranee.]

383
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,070
[Now I am Peter Lue.]

384
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,790
[If I could turn back in time,]

385
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,110
[I'd rather stay with my loved one as long as I can.]

386
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,510
[I would listen more carefully to his wishes.]

387
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,190
[I love him.]

388
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,670
[And my love will last forever.]

389
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:32,150
[Thank you for such a special moment.]

390
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,190
[I will come back.]

391
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:22,350
Hello.

392
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,430
Hello, welcome.

393
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,550
Hello, Mr. Lue!

394
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,630
Welcome to my home!

395
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,300
Hey, stop!

396
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:04,910
Get down!

397
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,430
Get down!

398
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,310
[Where are you, Ae?]

399
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,430
You can't go back to your condominium.

400
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,150
The police have seized all your warehouses, wooden sheds, casinos, and condos.

401
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,270
[The police have seized my condo.]

402
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,190
[What do we do now?]

403
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,030
[I've already figured out a plan.]

404
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,150
You're the reason why my family is ruined.

405
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,110
It's all because of you.
