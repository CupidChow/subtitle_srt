Yes.

18
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,920
But, it was a long time ago.

19
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,360
The monk is here.

20
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,720
Greetings.

21
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,579
I'm Ken.

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,060
You?

23
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,770
Yes.

24
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,000
Is Din with you?

25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,120
He didn't come with me.

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
I'm here with my friend.

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,540
Hello, Mr. Lue.

28
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,780
What are they doing here?

29
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,640
It's quite a distance.

30
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,130
My brother never knows how to restrain himself.

31
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,570
Hey!

32
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,500
What the...

33
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,360
Lue and Ingpha? What about Ken?

34
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,760
I think...

35
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,530
Oh no!

36
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,130
Payu!

37
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,210
Payu!

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,720
Let go of me.

39
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,620
Calm down.

40
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,500
Payu?

41
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,770
Brother!

42
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,620
Ken.

43
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,720
Greetings, sir.

44
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,210
Are these the friends you mentioned?

45
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,310
Yes.

46
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,230
Brother, come here.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,270
We have serious matters to discuss.

48
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,310
Ken?

49
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,360
Take Ken to the car.

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,970
Let's go, Ken.

51
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,530
Stop staring into his eyes.

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,540
We are taking Ken back.

53
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,220
Get in the car.

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
Hurry, get in the car.

55
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,470
Ken, what does Lue want anyway?

56
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,490
Why did he take you here?

57
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,550
Which side is he on?

58
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,600
Did you know

59
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,640
he shook hands with Ingpha at the temple entrance?

60
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,460
Huh?

61
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,660
Yes!

62
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,700
Thankfully, we got there in time.

63
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,090
Lue is cunning. He can't be trusted.

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,650
I told you so.

65
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,500
But he just saved my life.

66
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,590
Is this about the black truck

67
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,300
and the matter with Fin that I told you?

68
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,430
Don't forget, only Fin saw it.

69
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,710
Am I right?

70
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,740
Are you saying

71
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,280
the black truck never existed at all?

72
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,830
I have no idea.

73
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:42,740
Hey.

74
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,240
Maybe they've been working together all along.

75
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,380
So,

76
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,190
you must stop seeing Lue, Ken.

77
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,930
I'll look up his background.

78
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,690
And remember,

79
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,050
take this.

80
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,300
You must carry this at all times. Take it.

81
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,490
Thanks.

82
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,620
Hey, are you serious?

83
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,020
You are not alone abroad anymore.

84
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:25,980
Take this.

85
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,440
Thanks.

86
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,010
And more importantly,

87
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,780
do not tell anyone else about this, especially not the parents.

88
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,820
Is that clear?

89
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,610
Fine. Let's go.

90
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,480
We're finally here.

91
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,659
I'm heading back.

92
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,230
Bye. Stay safe on the road.

93
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,310
Safe trip.

94
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,450
Let's go.

95
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,870
Go inside.

96
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,420
Ken, let's go.

97
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,770
Well...

98
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,850
You two go ahead.

99
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,800
I have a phone now. I want to call my father.

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,830
Ah.

101
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,630
Okay.

102
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,100
Let's go.

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,590
Great.

104
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,580
Hurry up.

105
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,380
Hello, Dad.

106
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,610
Hello.

107
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,350
So...

108
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,690
This is my phone number.

109
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,420
Good. You finally have a phone.

110
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,080
I'll call this number when I miss you.

111
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,490
Okay.

112
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
That's all for now. I'll call you again.

113
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,980
Okay.

114
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,430
Here it comes, fried meat in fish sauce.

115
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,280
Whose favorite is this?

116
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,160
I could smell it from miles away!

117
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,370
What's the special occasion? This is a hearty meal.

118
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,780
You talk too much.

119
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,710
Are you eating or not?

120
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,010
Sure.

121
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,909
Dad shouldn't have messed with Mom.

122
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,289
You're right.

123
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,550
Do you remember the last time your mom prepared a meal like this?

124
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,260
When was it? Who were there?

125
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,600
Who were there the last time?

126
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,610
There were Sai, Hin, Payu, Ken, and Din.

127
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
I'm starving. Can we eat now?

128
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,380
Yes, dig in.

129
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,260
Try this out.

130
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,010
-What are you doing?
-Feed me.

131
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,320
Stop fighting.

132
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,500
Can you eat with your own hands?

133
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,700
Mom, let him feed me for once.

134
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,810
Hey!

135
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,250
Finished.

136
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,430
-Ken.
-Come on.

137
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:20,890
I want that!

138
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,880
Dig in.

139
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,780
Yes.

140
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,880
This is your favorite.

141
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:28,950
Yeah.

142
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:29,900
I'll get some for you.

143
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,990
It's Din's favorite too.

144
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,830
Well, I bet

145
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,940
Din has already been reincarnated.

146
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,450
Maybe he's old enough to run around and have fun.

147
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,420
Yeah.

148
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,370
He moved on before anyone of us.

149
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,410
But, we're still alive. We should move on.

150
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,170
Hey...

151
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,600
I heard a foreigner is wooing you.

152
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,080
What? Is that true?

153
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,480
-What's going on now?
-Is he cute?

154
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,290
No, Mom and Dad. It's not true.

155
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,880
I bet he's not as handsome as Din.

156
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,010
Ouch! That's for sure.

157
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,120
You shouldn't have said it out loud.

158
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,880
You know who Din took after.

159
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,590
His mom, of course.

160
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,630
He got the good look from me! Come on.

161
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,500
Get over yourself.

162
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,470
Sorry.

163
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,180
I should go.

164
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,950
Don't you want to try my cooking?

165
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm not that hungry. Thank you.

166
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,020
But this is your favorite.

167
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,500
Dad, this is your fault.

168
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,510
Why did you bring that up?

169
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,250
He didn't eat anything.

170
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,660
Yeah.

171
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,130
You talked too much.

172
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,000
By the way, everyone in our family looks good.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,490
We all look great.

174
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,810
You should have read the room.

175
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,310
It's alright. Ken left.

176
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,380
Let's finish the meal. Come on.

177
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:55,930
Make sure you finish the food.

178
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,830
There is more in the kitchen.

179
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,490
Can you quiet down when you eat?

180
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,000
Who do you think he takes after?

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,580
You take after our mom.

182
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,110
Do you want more?

183
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,670
I'll get more.

184
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,420
Ken.

185
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,290
Listen to me.

186
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,350
You have a long way ahead of you.

187
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,950
Do not dwell on this sadness.

188
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,440
I think

189
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,800
you should move on and start a new happy life.

190
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,900
When the right person comes into your life,

191
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,140
do not shut yourself away.

192
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,730
Try your best to open up.

193
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,880
Ken, look.

194
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,620
On the day of Din's funeral,

195
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,840
I found this in the room.

196
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,740
I don't know how it got here.

197
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,410
Strange, isn't it?

198
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,900
Indeed.

199
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
It's so scary.

200
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,570
Hey.

201
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,750
Ken is in danger.

202
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,940
What should we do?

203
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,730
Should we move him somewhere?

204
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,820
But where?

205
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,670
He didn't get away when he was abroad.

206
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,170
Mayor Ingpha?

207
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
I don't believe it.

208
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,020
He's been so nice to our family.

209
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,200
Right?

210
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,240
Nice?

211
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,180
Ingpha is the chief of Gray Area.

212
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,090
The business is totally illegal. He even exports opium.

213
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,740
He sent Lue to pick up Ken.

214
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,980
He's been collecting poppy leaves.

215
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,690
What for?

216
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,740
Why?

217
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,580
It doesn't make sense. Don't you get it?

218
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:11,740
But...

219
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,990
But it's probably alright.

220
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,300
What's alright?

221
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,370
I don't think

222
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,400
Lue is that kind of person.

223
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,370
Have you met him?

224
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,690
I met him at the shop.

225
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,920
He looked and acted like a nice person.

226
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,950
No way!

227
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,430
Yes.

228
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,030
No!

229
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:26,810
Yes.

230
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,380
Enough.

231
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,160
Enough.

232
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,700
I told you. He is a good guy.

233
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,590
-Enough!
-I told you, he's not a good guy! You're a doctor, but you don't know everything.

234
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,910
He is a good guy. I met him.

235
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,090
-Only for a while! How can you be sure?
-You've never met him, how can you doubt someone who has?
-Enough!

236
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,240
I told you! He's not a good guy! Trust me!

237
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,330
He is a good guy!

238
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:49,570
No!

239
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,280
He is.

240
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,640
Where are you going?

241
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,160
He is!

242
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,300
We're not done here! He is not a good guy! Trust me!

243
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,440
Excuse me.

244
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,060
Yes?

245
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,380
Could you look up my friend's room number?

246
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,220
I'm not sure which room he's in.

247
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,780
His name is Peter Lue, Taiwanese.

248
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,130
Alright. In a moment.

249
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,110
Peter Lue, right?

250
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:23,900
Yes.

251
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,720
He's not here.

252
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,150
No?

253
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,530
He's not here.

254
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,550
Have you seen a foreigner

255
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,320
who's as tall as me

256
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,250
and has fair skin? Have you seen him?

257
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,340
No.

258
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,840
Could you look again?

259
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,330
Is he here?

260
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,390
No.

261
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,660
He told me he was staying here.

262
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,730
But he's not here.

263
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,560
Thank you.

264
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,380
You're welcome.

265
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,250
The wall iris.

266
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,850
It symbolizes my unwavering and undying love.

267
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,840
Do you know

268
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,760
why I bring you to this bridge?

269
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,180
Whatever reason we have

270
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,710
to be separated,

271
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,430
we will meet again on this bridge

272
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,100
on the seventh day of the seventh month.

273
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,110
What are you talking about?

274
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,440
It's a promise.

275
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,830
Deal?

276
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,480
Come on, pinky swear.

277
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,880
-The view here is nice.
-Indeed.

278
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,830
Don't change the topic. Pinky swear.

279
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,800
Pinky swear.

280
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,570
What?

281
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,490
Wow! The water is so clean. You can even see the fish.

282
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,530
Do you see this pinky?

283
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,880
Where is it? I lost sight of it.

284
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,720
Raise your hand.

285
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,580
Are you ordering me?

286
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,160
It's not an order, but you have the do it.

287
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,000
What?

288
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,760
How is it different from an order?

289
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,260
Hurry up. Pinky swear.

290
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,970
No.

291
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,800
I'm looking at the fish. The water is so clear.

292
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,040
Aren't you a stubborn one? I told you to go back!

293
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,390
Mind your own business!

294
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,570
What do you want?

295
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,240
I want you to go back!

296
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,750
You have three days.

297
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,130
Don't let me see you again!

298
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,040
Ken?

299
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,080
Ken?

300
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,140
What's wrong?

301
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,200
Ken?

302
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,080
Ken?

303
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,580
Ken?

304
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,290
Who are you?

305
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,500
Come clean!

306
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,390
What do you mean, Ken?

307
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,030
Tell me! Who are you?

308
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,800
I'm here to help you.

309
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,070
Liar!

310
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,130
The receptionist said you weren't at the hotel!

311
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,090
I was there! I was in room 707.

312
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,480
Stop lying!

313
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,260
Tell me.

314
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,040
Who are you? Are you working for Ingpha?

315
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,010
No.

316
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,640
Come clean! Tell me the truth!

317
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,530
Tell me!

318
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,190
I like you! That has nothing to do with Ingpha!

319
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,650
I like you, Ken.

320
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,120
I've been in love with you since the day I saved you.

321
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,830
I don't want you to get lost in the woods.

322
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,980
I really want to help.

323
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,240
I love you.

324
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,270
I'm telling the truth.

325
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,760
Hey.

326
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,000
Hey!

327
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,040
Didn't you see me?

328
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,030
When did you get here?

329
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,520
What's wrong with you?

330
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,810
You've been spacing out since this morning.

331
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,570
It's nothing.

332
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,420
Where were you last night?

333
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,000
Fess up.

334
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,510
Nowhere.

335
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,590
Ken.

336
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,910
If this is about Lue, please,

337
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,370
stop seeing him.

338
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,600
I've heard a lot of things about him. He's not a good guy.

339
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,950
Are you going out?

340
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,470
Are you going out with Lue?

341
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,980
No.

342
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,320
Where is your phone?

343
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,310
Where is your phone?

344
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,800
Ken!

345
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,840
You did it again!

346
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,540
[Ceng Dalu]

347
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,530
[Hello, Mr. Lue.]

348
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,980
Are you here to pray?

349
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,040
I'm the owner of Ingtira Banana Processing near your timber mill.

350
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,320
This is Mayor Ingpha. He's my older brother.

351
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,980
You look young. Are you Taiwanese?

352
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,530
Yes.

353
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,640
Nice to meet you.

354
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,260
I am the mayor here.

355
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,770
Feel free to let me know if you need anything.

356
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,980
How is your timber mill? You export the wood to the international market.

357
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,580
What's wrong?

358
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,900
Sorry.

359
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,450
I spaced out.

360
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,630
I forgot that Thai people

361
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,390
don't grip so hard when shaking hands.

362
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,020
Yes.

363
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,270
Oh.

364
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,400
The wood here is great. Do you know that?

365
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,230
There are plenty of rare wood

366
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,720
in this place.

367
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,700
If you need or want anything,

368
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,220
you could talk to me or tell Ae.

369
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,440
Everyone here knows me.

370
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,430
Take this.

371
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,820
It's a pleasure to meet you.

372
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,360
I'll certainly need some help from you

373
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,980
and Miss Ae.

374
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,010
Thank you.

375
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,930
Honey?

376
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,560
Honey.

377
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,770
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

378
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,710
You should eat up.

379
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,170
You should eat up.

380
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,780
You're so skinny. You should put up some weight.

381
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,440
I won't take your food.

382
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,420
You won't need to.

383
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,680
Sweetheart.

384
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,620
Sweetheart.

385
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,370
Sweetheart.

386
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,840
Hey, Ken.

387
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,030
Oh.

388
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,110
-Dr. Chayon.
-Ken.

389
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,300
Well?

390
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Are you feeling okay?

391
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,480
Yeah.

392
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,990
How are you?

393
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,540
We haven't met in two years.

394
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,430
I was worried about you.

395
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,570
Take a seat.

396
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,230
Come on.

397
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,590
Sit here.

398
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,420
He really wanted to give you a surprise.

399
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,560
He came all the way here from Seoul.

400
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,320
Yeah.

401
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,530
That's nice.

402
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,670
The two doctors can keep an eye on him.

403
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,090
He's been a bit blur lately.

404
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,630
He keeps spacing out.

405
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,440
Do you still have your phone?

406
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,640
It's right here.

407
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,290
Yeah.

408
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,520
By the way,

409
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,210
do you

410
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,640
have good news for us today?

411
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,200
-No.
-No.

412
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,780
It's not what you think.

413
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,820
I want to graduate first.

414
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,760
He's been busy with the clinic in Bangkok.

415
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,020
-Right?
-Okay.

416
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,710
How do we get there?

417
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,890
Whose car are we taking?

418
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,440
My friend's car.

419
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,830
Oh, it's Mr. Lue.

420
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,080
He's the guy who saved you and sent you home?

421
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,260
So, Lue must be Ken's friend, right?

422
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,490
They must have met abroad.

423
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,520
Of course.

424
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,800
Not, doctor.

425
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,280
What do you think about my friend? Ken doesn't usually

426
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,570
make friends with anyone.

427
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,670
Yeah.

428
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,570
That's enough, doctor.

429
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,650
What's enough?

430
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,760
What is it, Mr. Lue?

431
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,340
Fine, I'll ask Ken.

432
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,970
What do you think?

433
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,010
How did you meet and become so close?

434
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,050
I don't know what to say.

435
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,930
Come on, Ken. Wouldn't you let me in on this?

436
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,200
Please?

437
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,120
How did you meet? I'm so curious.

438
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,130
Tell her.

439
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,140
Yeah.

440
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,130
That's all.

441
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,390
Enough, doctor.

442
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,530
Mr. Lue.

443
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,130
Grab my arm.

444
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,070
Wow.

445
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,470
This shop is beautiful.

446
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,280
Yeah.

447
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,690
I feel hungry now.

448
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,500
Are you?

449
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,470
Yeah. What should we order?

450
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,010
How about "pat thai?"

451
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,300
Phat thai.

452
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,440
Not "pat thai."

453
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,990
-Hello.
-Hello.

454
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,550
Welcome in.

455
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,640
Okay.

456
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,810
Wow...

457
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,450
Everything on the menu looks delicious.

458
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,640
Yeah.

459
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,250
It looks delicious.

460
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,850
Eat up.

461
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,040
By the way, where is the menu for dessert?

462
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,630
Be patient, Sai. Finish your meal first.

463
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,080
The dessert is not the main course. So, it's okay to finish either one of them first.

464
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,980
Don't worry. I'll let you order the dessert, okay?

465
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,020
Okay. Good.

466
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,290
I want pork jerky

467
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,270
and traditional crispy noodles.

468
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,870
Let me repeat your order.

469
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,130
Pork jerky and traditional crispy noodles, right?

470
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:57,810
Yes.

471
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,990
That's 160 phat.

472
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,410
I need to use the restroom.

473
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,370
Sure.

474
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,510
This looks delicious too. It's beef.

475
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,610
-It's a signature dish here.

476
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,640
It's prawn, right?

477
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,270
Hahaha!

478
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,620
Nok!

479
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,670
It's me!

480
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,390
So long!

481
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,310
Come and get me!

482
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,330
Don't stop! I like the music!

483
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,660
What now?

484
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,010
Get out of my sight!

485
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,680
Hey!

486
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,310
He wants to see you.

487
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,150
Is something the matter?

488
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,140
Din told me he liked visiting you.

489
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,180
But every time he came here,

490
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,490
he never brought me here.

491
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,960
He said the trip was long and dangerous.

492
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,100
I was telling the truth.

493
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,230
What truth?

494
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,780
I don't see anything bad here.

495
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,260
There are only mountains and trees.

496
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:44,780
It's quiet here.

497
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,390
It's refreshing.

498
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,100
Where are you going next?

499
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,500
Are you going sightseeing?

500
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,310
Well...

501
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,630
He took me here to have some fun.

502
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,710
Take this with you.

503
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,720
You...

504
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,180
I sent my guy to capture him for you.

505
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,540
Let Ken come back to Bangkok.

506
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,490
Mr. Lue owns a timber mill.

507
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,820
He's Ken's friend. I mentioned him.

508
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,860
This is Officer Don.

509
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,460
Nice to meet you, Officer Don.

510
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,460
Nice to meet you too.

511
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:05,220
Mr. Lue.

512
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,790
I'll give you one last chance.

513
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,270
Is that clear?

514
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,770
Hahaha!

515
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,960
Your order has been carried out and completed.

516
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,270
[I pity Ken.]

517
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,210
[His lover died. Now, he's being hunted.]

518
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,160
[If Din were alive, he might be able to protect him.]

519
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,800
Din is not dead yet! What you say is impossible!

520
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:29,730
Is that clear?

521
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,600
[Cheer him up.]

522
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:35,490
[How?]
