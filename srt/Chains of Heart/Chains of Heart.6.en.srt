You!

16
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,680
Kulmibhak University

17
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,760
Five outstanding thesis art pieces...

18
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
from art students...

19
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,520
have been summited to the competition.

20
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,200
3 of them are from the Department of Visual Arts,

21
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,040
and the other...

22
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,480
The other 2 from the Department of Art Education.

23
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,080
So we may ask the university...

24
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,880
Sorry.

25
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,760
Thus, we may request the university to provide a van

26
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,080
to transport all the students' artwork to the competition.

27
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,720
And another project is about children,

28
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,600
about...

29
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,159
um...

30
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,240
About the national youth...

31
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,680
Hold on,

32
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,640
Mr. Hin.

33
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,080
Group chat messages on LINE are popping up.

34
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,440
Where is Mr. Hin

35
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,400
You are an executive,

36
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
and vice-president,

37
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
but you’re still doing this.

38
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,640
If you are not ashamed of yourself, think about how it looks to me!

39
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey!

40
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,640
What?

41
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,160
Hey VP, are you even listening to me?

42
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,960
Let's go, or we'll be late for the event!

43
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Is that OK?

44
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,760
Um...

45
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,280
You aren’t listening to me.

46
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,960
Uh...

47
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,120
right?

48
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,240
Let’s go!

49
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,240
You even have a LINE group for the faculty members,

50
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,560
but I'm not included.

51
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,760
Why’s that?

52
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,800
Hum?

53
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,760
Because...

54
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,760
I use it to chat,

55
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,320
and to chase after you.

56
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,600
Since you're always ignoring my LINE messages.

57
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Uh...

58
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:00,800
Oh, Vice!

59
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,960
You sly fox!

60
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,320
you are dictator!

61
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,840
You big shot!

62
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,640
Always messing with people's feelings without their consent, huh?

63
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,440
You!

64
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
you don't like the dictator, do you?

65
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,520
Hum?

66
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,640
Hum?

67
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,880
I'll be it for you.

68
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,520
Where will you take me?

69
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,160
Sorry.

70
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,760
It’s fine.

71
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,800
Come here!

72
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,760
Where will you take me?

73
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,360
I don’t want to go!

74
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,120
Come on!

75
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,200
I don’t want to go!

76
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,080
OK, fine!

77
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,720
I don’t want to go!

78
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,320
Geez, it’s so hard to drag you.

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,880
You are not that light.

80
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,480
Help me!

81
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,040
Hey, bro.

82
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,240
I’ve seen you chatting for a while now,

83
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
Have you been talking with your lover or something?

84
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,600
My friend is asking for the address.

85
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,320
Let’s go!

86
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,120
Let’s go!

87
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,520
We are the first branch in Thailand...

88
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,600
Thank you for joining the event.

89
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,760
Here comes the doctor.

90
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,080
Thank you so much.

91
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,840
Hello, Sai!

92
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,800
Hello

93
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,640
There are many people joining your event.

94
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,120
Hello

95
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you

96
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,840
Is it beautiful?

97
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,760
Yes!

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,520
I’ve been trying hard to get this.

99
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,159
Thank you.

100
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,080
There he is...

101
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,320
the doctor...

102
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,360
has just arrived.

103
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,400
Hello,

104
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,000
Congratulations, doctor!

105
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,039
Thank you.

106
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,080
Let me help you.

107
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,679
OK.

108
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,680
Payu and Hin are here too.

109
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,480
Hey, Payu.

110
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,240
Didn’t you say you wanted to take Hin to get a new face in Korea?

111
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,400
Hey Hin, look...

112
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,760
if you want to break the nodule or chisel the jaw,

113
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
just speak up.

114
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,760
The doctor is here.

115
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,320
That’s right.

116
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,800
Wait!

117
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,960
I think,

118
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,040
you have to completely change your face...

119
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
and let the doctor do a full facial makeover, you know?

120
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,000
Hum...

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,720
Wow

122
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,120
so can you make my face look like an A-list celeb?

123
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,920
Are you sure?

124
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,400
I'm not sure the results would be all that fab.

125
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
Oh please, Sai and Dr.

126
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,360
That’s true.

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,920
So,

128
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,640
can you change my face from this

129
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
to this?

130
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,880
Now Korea has a technology called AI 3D...

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,480
to copy facial features just like that.

132
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,640
Don't lie to him.

133
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,640
It's a human face, though. How could it possibly do that?

134
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,880
It’s the truth. Ask the doctor then...

135
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Um,

136
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,480
There is no.

137
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,880
We cannot do that.

138
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,840
Oh no, there goes my dream.

139
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,520
So sad.

140
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,640
You are already handsome!

141
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
You are already handsome!

142
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,040
Is it already day 1 of month 7?

143
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,480
Do you know...

144
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,800
why I’m bringing you to this bridge.

145
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,680
If we both have to be separate,

146
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,280
whatever matter is it,

147
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,080
we'll meet again at this bridge

148
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,160
on the 7th day of the 7th month.

149
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,160
What are you talking about?

150
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,280
I told you just in case.

151
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,760
Are you OK?

152
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,120
Are you OK?

153
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,960
Let's do a pinky swear.

154
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,360
Wow, that view is stunning.

155
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,920
Yes really...

156
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,200
No!

157
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,240
Let's take a pinky swear first.

158
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,480
Pinky swear?

159
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,040
What?

160
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,840
Look at the fish! The water is so clear here.

161
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
Can you see my pinkie?

162
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,280
I don’t see anything.

163
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,920
Here,

164
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,840
Quickly!

165
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,840
Look at the little clouds out of my mouth!

166
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
Do it.

167
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
Hello, Sai.

168
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,160
How are you?

169
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,360
Have you eaten anything yet?

170
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,560
I haven't eaten anything yet.

171
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,200
I just woke up.

172
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,600
I will order some food for you.

173
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,080
OK.

174
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,000
How is your wound?

175
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Is it getting better?

176
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,520
Is it getting better?

177
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,760
Once I'm done, the doctor and I will come by to check on your wound.

178
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,480
OK, Sai. I’ll catch you later.

179
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,080
Yeah, you can get more sleep now.

180
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,000
Take care!

181
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,480
Help!

182
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,480
Take this and keep it with you

183
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,960
Raging Bull, what’s your 20?

184
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,080
You!

185
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,040
Who is it?

186
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,400
You have a mail.

187
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,120
Surprise, Ken!

188
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,320
DeeDee

189
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,800
Here are some imported flowers for you,

190
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,120
but they're a bit wilted, sorry.

191
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,440
Take it!

192
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,320
I still don’t believe it was Din.

193
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,160
But right now, Ken is preoccupied with the guy in black.

194
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,160
I’m really sure it was him,

195
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
because I can remember that necklace.

196
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,000
But the necklace that the monk gave doesn't have only one, right?

197
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,040
Right!

198
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,280
If it was really Din,

199
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,320
he should have told Ken

200
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,920
Why did he have to disguise himself,

201
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,280
covering his face?

202
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,000
So that no one would recognise him?

203
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,080
What was it for?

204
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,360
For hiding someone.

205
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,360
Even his own boyfriend?

206
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,600
If the person was not Din,

207
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,680
why was he still helping Ken?

208
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,080
Meaning that the guy in black.

209
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,320
might be aware that Ken is still in danger

210
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,360
and that Nok's chasing him to finish him off.

211
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
Yeah, it can be.

212
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,400
Or perhaps,

213
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,680
Din must conceal his identity to protect Ken and his own family.

214
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,480
Or,

215
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
the guy in black could be someone else…

216
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,120
that had been sent,

217
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,720
to deceive us.

218
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,480
Why he had to deceive us?

219
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
To make us believe that Din is still alive.

220
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,400
Right, Payu?

221
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,360
I don't know, I'm not involved in this.

222
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,760
It has nothing to do with me.

223
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,840
You can leave me here.

224
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,480
You are still injured.

225
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Thank you, DeeDee.

226
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,320
You guys!

227
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,880
This is DeeDee, my friend.

228
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,680
You again?

229
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,120
What are you doing here?

230
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,040
I’m visiting Ken.

231
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,880
This is my close friend. Why did you come to visit him?

232
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,760
I can take care of my friend!

233
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,240
He is in pain.

234
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,680
It's none of your concern.

235
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,360
Shut up!

236
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,360
So annoying.

237
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,000
For two years,

238
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,720
Nok had been absent,

239
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,040
but now that Ken has returned, Nok has reappeared.

240
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,560
He is very brutal,

241
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,440
shooting other people in the restaurant.

242
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,280
shooting other people in the restaurant.

243
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,640
That’s right.

244
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,080
He is very scary.

245
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,440
Why did he have to kill?

246
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,800
What did Din and Ken do to him?

247
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,320
You have to help us, Chief.

248
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,160
You two calm down first.

249
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm still here, so you don't have to worry.

250
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,520
I let my people help Inspector Don hunt him down.

251
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,240
It is better for Ken to stay in Bangkok.

252
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,520
I definitely have to finish him off.

253
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,720
Nok.

254
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,720
Hello, Mr. Lue

255
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,600
Sorry, have you been waiting so long?

256
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,200
It’s OK

257
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,520
I have just arrived.

258
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,160
I'd better take you to look inside the warehouse.

259
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,000
Excuse me,

260
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,960
can I take photos of this?

261
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,200
Sure, Mr. Lue

262
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,480
All wooden pieces here are legal.

263
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,360
This way, please...

264
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,080
What kind of amulet do you have?

265
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,960
You were shot but managed to survive.

266
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,760
I'm fortunate, you know.

267
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,080
I didn't get shot in a vital area.

268
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,160
So I didn’t get lot of injured.

269
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,280
Are you into amulets as well, by any chance?

270
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,200
You’re really something huh, Mr Lue.

271
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,960
You are indeed lucky;

272
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,000
it seems like you've escaped misfortune.

273
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,120
Let me take you to see that way.

274
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,520
But, you know, I feel really sorry for Ken.

275
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,600
His loved one has died,

276
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
and now he's targeted by someone to take his life.

277
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,160
If Din were still alive, he would probably protect Ken's life.

278
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,840
Really?

279
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,200
Yes.

280
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,840
but Din is already dead.

281
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
Yes.

282
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,440
I’m feel sorry for Ken,

283
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
that he has to face these problems.

284
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Yes.

285
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,040
Shall we talk about something else?

286
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,200
I still have more wood to show you...

287
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,080
right there.

288
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,200
I will take you there.

289
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,680
There are so many trees around here, Ms. Ae

290
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,760
It's not that many, actually.

291
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Here all trees are regulated by law.

292
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,160
Really?

293
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,560
Over there, there are only large trees.

294
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,600
I’ll go and take a look.

295
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,600
That’s not the case.

296
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,440
They're all pretty much the same size.

297
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,160
They're all planted as economic trees.

298
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,720
Hi, Ms. Ae.

299
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,920
Here comes the Inspector.

300
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,640
This is Mr. Lue

301
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,280
the owner of the timber mill

302
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,160
and Ken's friend.

303
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,720
The one I told you about before.

304
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,760
This is Inspector Don.

305
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,560
Hello!

306
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
Hello!

307
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,720
Nice to meet you,

308
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,200
Inspector Don.

309
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,280
Likewise,

310
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,440
Mr. Lue

311
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,160
He is just a single easy target,

312
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,600
and you still messed up.

313
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,120
What the hell else can you do for me?

314
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:31,840
Hum?

315
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,120
My plan has fallen apart,

316
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,120
and the target has escaped to Bangkok,

317
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
and it's all because of you.

318
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,720
Hey!

319
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,520
OK!

320
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,400
Can I go and finish the job properly this time?

321
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,360
I will give you a last chance. Get it?

322
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,720
Go and get the guy in black who went to help Ken.

323
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,760
Bring him to me right away.

324
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,480
I hope it's who I'm thinking of.

325
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,080
I will kill you!

326
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,800
Hello, dad.

327
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,840
Ken,

328
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,720
What are you up to?

329
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,880
I’m at the hotel.

330
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,600
I will go jogging.

331
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,520
Hey,

332
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,040
There are so many people at the restaurant. Sales are really good.

333
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,640
hum...

334
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,840
Are you tired?

335
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,080
Have you ever seen me tired?

336
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,280
Um,

337
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,440
I have never seen you tired.

338
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,200
I’m just asking.

339
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,360
How about you?

340
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,840
Are you tired?

341
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Not really.

342
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,280
Why should I be tired?

343
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,760
I haven't exercised yet.

344
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,920
I forget that you haven't exercised yet.

345
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,880
If you run a lot and get tired,

346
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,360
just try to hang in there a little longer,

347
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,840
then run over here.

348
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,960
I guarantee you will feel better.

349
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,160
OK.

350
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,840
Thank you, dad.

351
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,640
Ken.

352
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,120
Mr. Lue

353
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,760
Are you jogging?

354
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,000
Don't you feel any pain in your wound?

355
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,440
I’m just walking.

356
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,360
My muscles will be a bit tense when I get home.

357
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,360
That’s good.

358
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,160
At least it's better than just lying around in the room.

359
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,320
Yes.

360
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,440
You’re right, Mr. Lue

361
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh

362
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,920
I still haven't thanked you...

363
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,480
for helping me again.

364
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,600
It’s fine.

365
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,840
I just want to...

366
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
protect you.

367
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,800
I really feel like that.

368
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,280
I’m not...

369
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,679
it’s OK.

370
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,639
I understand that

371
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,360
you've always had him.

372
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,800
You may need some time,

373
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,760
but I just want to ask for a chance

374
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,199
to take care of you...

375
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,120
to protect you,

376
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,480
or do something that he did for you.

377
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,800
Just that.

378
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,040
It's not like that.

379
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,719
So, what's it like then?

380
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,400
It's just not possible.

381
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,760
Why?

382
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,360
You still have him in your heart, don't you?

383
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,000
It’s OK.

384
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,360
I’ll be waiting.

385
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,440
Answer me,

386
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,280
I want to know.

387
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,440
Because he is still alive.

388
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,280
Ken,

389
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,040
how can this be?

390
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,880
Din is not dead yet.

391
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,840
What you said it could not be,

392
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,360
understand?

393
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,440
Hello.

394
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,120
Hello, Ken.

395
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,040
How are you?

396
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,920
What are you doing?

397
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,440
I just went for a little stroll,

398
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,360
and I just got back.

399
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,920
Have you had dinner yet?

400
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,760
Do you want me to order some food?

401
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,040
No need to.

402
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,280
I’ve already had some.

403
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,400
Sure?

404
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,880
I am worried about you.

405
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,680
Sure?

406
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,440
DeeDee,

407
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,800
That’s enough.

408
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,320
We talk later, OK?

409
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,320
Why do you bring me here?

410
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,160
Hum...

411
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,320
Payu?

412
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,160
Why don't you take me home?

413
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,040
Isn’t you mad at me?

414
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,640
I want to make up with you.

415
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,280
Have what?

416
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,160
What you order me to do is completed.

417
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,360
Thank you, Inspector Don.

418
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,200
About what I told you earlier,

419
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,280
can you find out who that guy is?

420
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,600
I’m still working on it.

421
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,960
Hey, stop!

422
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,120
Follow him!

423
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,320
Follow him!

424
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,160
I will him him!

425
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,080
Go!

426
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,840
Follow him!

427
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,000
Damn!

428
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,400
I will kill you!

429
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,160
Where is Din?

430
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,040
I don’t know.

431
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,120
Answer me, where is Din?

432
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,200
You guys don’t really know about this?

433
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,440
You don’t have to be afraid, Din!

434
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,040
Whatever are you doing?

435
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,760
Wherever you are?

436
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,280
I will always be with you.

437
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I have something important to tell you...

438
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,120
about Din.

439
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,160
Din?

440
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,640
That’s really good.

441
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,880
Really!

442
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,600
Last night you got drunk,

443
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,360
undressed on your own, and then ended up here.

444
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,080
Didn't you feel anything at all?

445
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,280
If I were aware,

446
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,240
I would have already cuddled up with you.
