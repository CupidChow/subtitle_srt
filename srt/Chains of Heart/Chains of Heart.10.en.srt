promise to never let go of my loved one’s hand again.

20

Good morning!

21
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,680
Hello,

22
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,520
welcome!

23
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,200
Um...

24
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,080
May I ask…

25
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,240
if there is anything to eat here?

26
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,840
Sure.

27
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,200
Please wait for a moment.

28
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,120
Hang on, Ma'am.

29
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,040
Yes?

30
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
Is it too much for you?

31
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,640
Not at all.

32
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,520
If I’m making things too hard for you,

33
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,040
I’m so sorry.

34
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,120
No worries.

35
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,320
Just a moment.

36
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,600
Mom!

37
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,520
[Frightened]

38
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,800
You scared me!

39
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,920
Are you back?

40
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,840
Yes, I’m back.

41
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,440
What are you cooking?

42
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,640
I could smell that deliciousness all the way outside.

43
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,680
I’m cooking your favorite meal.

44
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,920
Got some soup going,

45
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,400
crispy noodles,

46
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,000
fried pork,

47
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and some side dishes.

48
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,400
Um...

49
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,920
You’re cooking a lot,

50
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,080
are you getting tired?

51
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,720
No, I’m not tired.

52
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,600
I’m so fine.

53
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,840
You can wait for me right there.

54
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,840
I’ll serve you up after I’m done.

55
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,480
Sure

56
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,320
I can't wait to taste what you’ve made.

57
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,720
Let’s go.

58
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,840
Roger that.

59
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,200
Great.

60
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,520
You need a hand with anything?

61
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,840
No, all good here.

62
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,800
Um,

63
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Could you wait over there for a bit?

64
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,520
I’ll serve it to you shortly.

65
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Ingpha’s gang has now made its move.

66
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,840
Let’s meet up at the meeting point.

67
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,600
Sorry,

68
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,000
something urgent just came up,

69
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,680
so I couldn’t eat what you’ve made.

70
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
If I still have a chance,

71
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
I will come back and eat your food…

72
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,920
again...

73
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,800
[Sorry, something urgent came up, so I couldn't eat what you have prepared. If I still get a chance, I'll come back and eat your food again.]

74
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
[What are you cooking?]

75
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,360
[I could smell that deliciousness all the way outside.]

76
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,880
Hum,

77
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,440
You are cooking a lot.

78
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,640
Are you getting tired?

79
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,640
Hang on, Ma'am.

80
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,360
Yes?

81
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,720
Is it too much for you?

82
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,480
If I’m making things too hard for you,

83
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,000
I’m so sorry.

84
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,240
Go go go!

85
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,360
Clear!

86
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,280
Let’s split. Cops here!

87
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
[Put the wood down!]

88
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,640
[Put the wood down!]

89
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,000
[Lay down!]

90
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
[Lay down!]

91
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,800
Hello, Inspector!

92
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,280
Where are you at, Mrs. Ae?

93
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
I’m coming back to my condo.

94
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,280
Forget about going back to your condo.

95
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,000
The police have seized all your warehouses, wooden sheds, casinos, and condos.

96
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,120
Say what?

97
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,800
Seriously?

98
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,960
Either way, please hurry to meet the Chief.

99
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,600
I’ll give my brother a heads-up then.

100
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,600
Sure.

101
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,040
About our conversation today,

102
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Let’s keep it just between us, okay, doc?

103
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Yes,

104
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,920
sure!

105
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,640
All our cash is already in this room.

106
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,280
You can start the surgery now.

107
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,680
We’re going to sell those organs tonight.

108
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,760
Oh,

109
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,720
Sure.

110
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,720
Chief,

111
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,520
You got a call.

112
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,320
It’s Mrs. Ae on the line.

113
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,880
What's up, Ae?

114
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Hello Ingpha,

115
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
The police have confiscated all my wooden sheds and condo.

116
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,360
What’s the plan now?

117
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,880
Where are you now?

118
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,040
How did you dodge the cops?

119
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,920
Inspector Don just gave me the heads-up.

120
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,160
What’s next?

121
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,680
I’ve already figured out a plan.

122
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,400
Let's meet at the safe house near the border.

123
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,320
OK.

124
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:31,880
Hey!

125
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,600
Come out!

126
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,280
Come out!

127
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,560
Come out!

128
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,320
Come out!

129
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,120
[Don’t hurt us!]

130
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,480
Hey!

131
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:17,960
Hey!

132
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,520
Stay still!

133
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,800
You!

134
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,200
Hi sweetie!

135
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,760
Get your filthy hands out of my way.

136
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,960
Can you be polite?

137
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,880
That’s what friends are for.

138
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,760
My family is in ruins because of you.

139
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,680
You’re devious.

140
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,840
You dirty rat!

141
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,960
You deal drugs and illegal wood.

142
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,920
You’re a lawbreaker.

143
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,720
You…

144
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,120
lowlife scum!

145
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,200
How dare you traffic innocent children?!

146
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,160
What does your future look like?

147
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,240
Burning in hell like the devil.

148
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,040
What’s wrong?

149
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,480
Can’t you face the truth about yourself?

150
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,640
You’ve got a wild tongue, huh!

151
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,600
I’ll stop playing nice with you now.

152
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,360
Who the hell was the mastermind behind Din’s fake death?

153
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,520
Is that Din's boyfriend, Ken?

154
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,320
Hum?

155
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,000
Darn it!

156
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,800
Take her away!

157
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:21,760
Go!

158
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,359
Get up!

159
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,400
Get up!

160
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,880
Go!

161
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,240
Go!

162
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,960
[The number you’ve dialed cannot be reached at the moment]

163
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,240
Din!

164
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,280
Din!

165
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,400
Din!

166
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,200
Din!

167
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,080
What?

168
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,800
Ken!

169
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,240
What?

170
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,320
Ken!

171
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,320
Open the door, Ken!

172
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,280
Quickly!

173
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,920
Ken!

174
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,280
Ken quickly!

175
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,800
Open the door!

176
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,360
Quickly!

177
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,160
Where is Mr. Lue?

178
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,720
I don’t know. I’m here with you, doc!

179
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,680
Unlock the door first, Ken!

180
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,240
Hurry up!

181
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,520
Open it!

182
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,000
What happened to Mr. Lue?

183
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,560
Stop calling him Lue.

184
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,560
Where is Din?

185
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,200
Where is Din, Ken?

186
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,680
Din!

187
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,840
Din!

188
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,040
Are you here? Din.

189
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,080
Where’s Din, Ken?

190
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,040
Hey!

191
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,640
What?

192
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,080
Stop!

193
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,600
Put the gun down!

194
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,160
Clear!

195
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,000
Let’s move!

196
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,640
[Help me!]

197
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,400
Where is Ingpha?

198
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,480
Hello, my bro!

199
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,520
Hello,

200
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,160
Where are you?

201
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,880
Are you almost there?

202
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,720
It’s picking up speed because…

203
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
I’ve just taken over the driving.

204
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,520
Man, the doc drives like a snail.

205
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,440
Alright.

206
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,480
How about Ken?

207
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,360
Is he OK?

208
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,680
He seems alright from the outside,

209
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,680
but I think something’s off inside.

210
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,480
Got it!

211
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,600
See you.

212
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Drive safe.

213
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,280
OK!

214
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,120
Hey, DeeDee!

215
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,880
Can you look at the map?

216
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,840
What’s our location now?

217
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,320
Hey!

218
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,280
You’re useless.

219
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,520
You slept through the whole thing!

220
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I wasn’t sleeping.

221
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,160
Just a long blink, that’s all.

222
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,280
You messed up your task.

223
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,400
I’d already told you to tail him like a shadow.

224
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,040
You know what the damn shadow is, right?

225
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,520
I’m doing it now.

226
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,640
Look, we’re almost there.

227
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,520
Almost there, my foot!

228
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,920
We’re almost at the border,

229
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,680
but goddamn Din hasn’t…

230
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,400
Ugh, Din or Lue—what the hell should I call him?

231
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,320
I’m all confused.

232
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,480
How much further, Ken?

233
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,160
Not that far, doc.

234
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,240
The signal’s starting to drop, though.

235
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,720
The signal’s starting to drop, though.

236
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,520
Hin!

237
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,440
We need to speed up now.

238
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Roger!

239
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,680
Hey!

240
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,480
Hey!

241
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,320
Give me the gun!

242
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,760
Look out! Bomb!

243
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,200
Hey!

244
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,120
Come out!

245
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:26,840
Hey!

246
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
Come out!

247
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,120
Hey!

248
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,320
Show yourself!

249
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,640
Hello!

250
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,440
Mr. Lue!

251
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,000
Welcome to my home!

252
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,280
Stop there!

253
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:57,800
What?

254
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
Stop!

255
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,120
Bro!

256
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,920
Wait for me, Ken!

257
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,480
Ken!

258
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,840
Doctor!

259
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,200
Hey!

260
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Quickly!

261
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Get down, hurry up!

262
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,400
Hin!

263
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,240
Where’s Ken at?

264
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,360
He’s already inside.

265
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,920
DeeDee, call Inspector Boon!

266
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,520
Where has he gone now?

267
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,120
Over here!

268
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,080
Mind your step!

269
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,760
It’s slippery.

270
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,040
Have a seat first.

271
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,240
I’ll cut to the chase, alright?

272
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,720
We've always been cool with each other.

273
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,720
Why the hell are you doing this to me?

274
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,920
Who the hell are you?

275
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,800
Police?

276
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,680
Or their friend?

277
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,280
Look at me closely!

278
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,720
Can’t you see who I am?

279
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,840
This is Din.

280
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,520
My right-hand guy, as I mentioned,

281
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,200
but he’s a bit of a rebel

282
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,040
when it comes to protecting nature.

283
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,680
I’m straight up and plenty of dough…

284
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,480
to pay you for each job.

285
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:17,920
Hey!

286
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Din!

287
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,640
You idiot!

288
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,320
You’re not living up to your duties and causing harm to the country.

289
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,120
You can’t back up their illicit actions.

290
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
You have to arrest them!

291
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,160
Who the hell are you?

292
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,680
Hum?

293
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,120
How dare you tell me what to do?

294
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,960
I was here way before you, man!

295
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,800
The Chief was generous enough to pay you.

296
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,600
Just take it and go.

297
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,880
Go!

298
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,680
Keep going!

299
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,160
Go! Din

300
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,960
Go! Din!

301
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,160
Go!

302
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,960
Keep going!

303
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,680
Why?

304
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,840
Where is my stuff?

305
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,520
Hum?

306
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,400
Where the hell is my stuff?

307
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,200
It’s been two years.

308
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,680
For two years, you’ve torn apart my family…

309
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,440
and my loved one.

310
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,360
You exploit people…

311
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,680
and nature…

312
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,600
for your own selfish reasons.

313
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,760
How the hell could you do this?

314
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,920
You know what?

315
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,240
I…

316
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,280
have never forgotten your face.

317
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,840
You better stare at my damn face and remember it…

318
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,160
because  it’s going to be…

319
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,680
the last thing you’ll see.

320
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,400
Din!

321
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,280
Stop!

322
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,120
Doctor!

323
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,920
Can you get me out of here?

324
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,280
I think you should turn yourself in.

325
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,920
All the evidence links the Chief and you.

326
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,560
Excuse me. I just need to use the bathroom.

327
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,480
Yes, please!

328
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,800
Doctor!

329
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,960
Please keep the evidence for me.

330
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,640
I appreciate you dealing with this.

331
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,200
Mrs. Ae

332
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,400
You’re arrested.

333
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,640
If you’ve been running a lot and feeling exhausted,

334
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,920
try pushing yourself a little further…

335
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,120
and come to me.

336
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,280
I promise…

337
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,000
you’ll feel a lot better.

338
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,120
After the death of Inpha

339
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,160
Ae,

340
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,280
as a co-conspirator,

341
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,880
was involved in criminal activities

342
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,880
with Ingpha, including…

343
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,880
illicit timber harvesting,

344
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,880
smuggling

345
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,400
child kidnapping,

346
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,000
and forced prostitution,

347
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,680
as well as, unlawful possession of firearms.

348
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,760
The court handed down a sentence close to life imprisonment for her crimes.

349
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,880
As for Lue,

350
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,760
the police issued an arrest warrant for him…

351
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,600
on charges of murder.

352
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,280
Since that day,

353
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,080
no one has ever seen him again.

354
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,240
Hello

355
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,720
Hello, Ken.

356
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:22,880
This is Sai.

357
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,240
Yes.

358
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,240
How are you?

359
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,960
I’m doing well.

360
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,120
How about you?

361
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,720
Same here.

362
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,160
I just want to tell you that,

363
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,440
I will get married.

364
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,560
Don’t miss my wedding, OK?

365
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:41,840
Sure.

366
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,120
Congratulations!

367
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,640
And,

368
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,840
When’s the big day?

369
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,040
On the 7th day of the 7th month.

370
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,560
Alright.

371
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,480
OK, Sai.

372
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,360
Catch you later!

373
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,560
A film by Rungradit Rungamonwanit

374
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,000
It's so great to have you right by my side.

375
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,600
You and me, together every day.

376
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,840
Together we wander, both near and far,

377
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,720
No need for more, just us two will do,

378
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,640
Even if the weather doesn't be as we planned,

379
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,320
Through the fiercest wind and the rain,

380
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,080
As long as you're with me, there's nothing to lose.

381
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,760
Wherever you are,

382
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,320
How dangerous is it?

383
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,720
Just hold our hands so tightly entwined,

384
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,600
so tightly entwined,

385
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,720
No matter the challenges, they won't tear us apart,

386
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,600
Only I have you by my side,

387
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,960
and the future may hold struggles, but we’ll carry on.

388
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,920
As long as you're near me,

389
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,520
my heart is filled with light.

390
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,200
We’ll conquer them all.
