20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,920
Where is my staff?

21
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,000
What!

22
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,040
Please don’t do anything

23
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
I’m begging you

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,360
Where is my staff?

25
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Where?

26
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,920
Two years later

27
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,800
It’s me, DeeDee

28
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,280

29
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,080
It’s me

30
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
I’m sorry

31
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
I didn’t mean for it

32
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
When we first met

33
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
If you don’t said that you are a chef at JoChia restaurant

34
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,960
The 3 starw Michelin restaurant

35
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,960
I thought you are a member of 14-K gang

36
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,240
Karun Mafia gang is definitely a legendary mafia gang

37
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,440
You called Ken

38
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,520
Start with K

39
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,560
Why do you need to practice for fighting?

40
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,640
Where are you going to fight?

41
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,280
I’m just joking

42
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,280
You don’t have to be that angry

43
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,600
Clam down

44
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,840
The world is not as beautiful as you think

45
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,080
The world is not beautiful...

46
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,919
Someone getting hurt

47
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,600
Do not mess up with them

48
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,480
Why?

49
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,240
We have to help him

50
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
they got guns, don’t you see that?

51
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,679
No I don’t see it

52
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,400
GO go!

53
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,520
DeeDee

54
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,120
Ken, be careful

55
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,040
Hey, What are you guys doing?

56
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,280
Dad

57
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,120
Did you got hurt?

58
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,720
No

59
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,160
I’m fine

60
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,080
DeeDee got stabbing

61
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,440
Yes, I got stabbing

62
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,480
Are you Thai?

63
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,080
Yes

64
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,560
Pan Gun

65
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,320
Bring him in

66
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,520
Who are you looking for?

67
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,200
Someone came to help me

68
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,000
I don’t see anyone

69
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,480
Let’s get in

70
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,400
Make it softly

71
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,120
How are you?

72
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,600
Do you want to see a doctor?

73
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,360
I’m still fine

74
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,040
I will see the doctor tomorrow

75
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,360
There's a lot of gangsters

76
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,800
If there’s anythings just call the police

77
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,080
Do not mess up with them

78
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,120
It's good that Ken help me

79
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,080
I'm only got stabbed

80
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,280
Otherwise, I will get more worst

81
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,160
If it was a bullet you already died

82
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
If in real life you make mistakes then you all fail

83
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,400
Think about your family and people that love you

84
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,680
What happens to him?

85
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Why you have to leave me?

86
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,120
Can’t you stay with me?

87
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,480
Come in

88
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,320
If Din see you like this

89
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,680
He would be sad

90
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,200
He might be hiding somewhere in this world...

91
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,080
Like you like now

92
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,360
Otherwise, someone would find his body

93
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,760
If it be like that he should contact...

94
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,640
Hin

95
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,040
Contact Tan or Ken

96
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,280
or contact uncle and aunt

97
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,360
It has been already 2 years

98
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,040
then, how long that you will stay in the darkest side?

99
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,720
Until the one who did to Din will deserve it

100
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
Do not think anythings stupid

101
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,360
Here is water

102
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,200
Thank you

103
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,520
Next time you have to be more careful

104
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,680
You come alone to take photo like this...

105
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,160
it is dangerous

106
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,440
By the way, you name is...

107
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,840
You can call me Ken

108
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,160
Ken

109
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,240
I don’t want to go back yet

110
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,720
The weather is really good

111
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,280
I want to stay for a while

112
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,880
Din

113
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,400
Have you ever heard a Chinese tale

114
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,800
A young cowherd and a weaving girl

115
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,480
These two love each other very much

116
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,480
But mother of weaving girl...

117
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,360
She don’t want they staying together

118
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
So she use barrette to...

119
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,120
Draw a line to make it as a river

120
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,440
making the two of them no longer have the right to be together forever

121
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,280
But her father feel pity

122
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,200
He want them back and to stay together

123
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,440
So he lets crow...

124
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,520
Fly in a line to build up a bridge to cross the river

125
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,560
Only once a year

126
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,400
on the 7th of July in every year

127
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,720
Do you also know about this?

128
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,240
Yes

129
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,880
be careful you won't get sick

130
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,760
Thank you

131
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,800
You are the one who help me

132
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,440
I’m sorry

133
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
It’s ok

134
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,800
I must be the one to say sorry

135
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,800
Do I make you scare?

136
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,680
It’s fine

137
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,160
You are Thai people?

138
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
I’m live here

139
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
I have a business in Thailand

140
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,840
So I can speak Thai little bit

141
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I’m Peter Lue

142
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Nice to meet you

143
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
You can call me Ken

144
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Do you like stargazing?

145
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,640
What?

146
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,800
But you have to go on top of the mountain

147
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,880
The sky in this city like this...

148
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,000
They don’t have any star for you

149
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,720
Have you ever seen the stars in Thailand?

150
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,560
Yes, I do

151
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,480
Also me

152
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,960
It’s beautiful

153
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,800
What are you doing at this time?

154
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,640
I couldn’t sleep, so I come out to take a walk

155
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,520
It’s look strange

156
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,200
Couldn’t sleep it weird?

157
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,760
I couldn’t sleep too

158
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,600
I saw them in the evening, the gangster attacked defenseless person

159
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,320
So I help them

160
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,720
Next time you have to be more careful

161
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,600
Thank you

162
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,200
Who body is it?

163
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,920
They said it’s Din

164
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Is it Din shirt?

165
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,080
Forest police said

166
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,280
He gone for almost 2 years

167
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,560
They found the body being like this?

168
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,040
His clothes

169
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,760
Is that girl a doctor?

170
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes, She is the doctor right?

171
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,240
I think it is Din

172
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,120
The doctor is coming

173
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,360
Maybe we could ask her

174
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,000
Doctor, Is that body Din?

175
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,040
Doctor

176
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,480
Doctor, Is it Din?

177
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,280
Maybe it’s Din

178
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,840
If I can get closer...

179
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,720
I will recognize

180
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,160
