Ken, where are you going?

16
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,500
Ken.

17
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,860
Where did Ken go?

18
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,780
Has anyone seen him?

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,860
We should let Ken stay with us tonight.

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,580
Where should he stay? We do not have any rooms for him.

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,100
What about Din's room?

22
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,220
That is not viable.

23
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,260
We have to do a lot of cleaning first.

24
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,220
If so,

25
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,300
why don't we wait for him to come back first?

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,300
Hey, inspector.

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,740
Have you found Ken?

28
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,860
Is it Mr. Tee, the biker?

29
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,420
Are you sure about that, Ken?

30
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,100
What is the matter?

31
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,890
He spent a lot of effort just to follow you to Thailand.

32
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,900
Why do you think he did so?

33
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,940
Have you talked with him?

34
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,260
He threatened me.

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,460
He told me to go back.

36
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,500
This is so annoying.

37
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,100
We do not know which gang he belongs to.

38
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,980
And, we do not know if he means well or not.

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,580
I think

40
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,180
we should stay still and observe the situation.

41
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,900
Do not tell anyone about this,

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,700
especially

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,940
Uncle, Aunt,

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,340
and the people in the temple.

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,260
You have never done anything like this

46
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,220
in your own room before.

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,980
Have you found anything?

48
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,420
I hope I will not.

49
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,220
Do you want to stay at my husband's mansion?

50
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,940
Let's go, Ken.

51
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,260
No.

52
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,220
I want to stay here.

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,580
I was here last night, and nothing happened.

54
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,420
I think

55
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,340
you two should go back.

56
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,180
I do not understand.

57
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,579
Why do you want to stay here so badly?

58
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,659
I will walk you to the door.

59
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,860
I am sleepy.

60
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,500
Ken.

61
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,460
Hey, Ken.

62
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,180
I am fine. I am just sleepy.

63
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,620
I am worried about you. Come with us.

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,780
I will be fine alone.

65
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,820
It is too dangerous for you.

66
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,500
Just trust me.

67
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,740
See you guys then.

68
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,420
Ken.

69
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,940
Come with us.

70
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,820
I will be fine.

71
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,140
-Take care, okay?
-But...

72
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,500
Hey, Boon!

73
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,500
Yeah, what is the matter?

74
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,860
Are you okay?

75
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,730
All is well here. Nothing had happened.

76
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,580
Please look after Ken for me.

77
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,860
Okay.

78
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,820
Do not worry.

79
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,260
My men will take care of him.

80
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,780
Do not worry.

81
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,820
Just leave him to me.

82
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,220
Okay.

83
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,740
I am just worried that he will become depressed.

84
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:31,820
Anyway,

85
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,900
please keep an eye on him.

86
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,659
Go and rest now.

87
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,659
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,740
I will leave it to you then.

89
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,980
Thank you.

90
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,300
We are lucky to have Boon.

91
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,060
You are so lazy. You have not fulfilled your cow-raising duty yet.

92
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,700
I could say the same for you. You kept staring at me until you forgot your duties,

93
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,500
Hashihime. (Demoness that appears near a bridge)

94
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,140
Hello?

95
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Hello, are you awake yet?

96
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,220
How was last night?

97
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,170
You slept alone after all.

98
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,820
Why?

99
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,340
Did anyone visit you?

100
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,580
Hey, Hin.

101
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,220
You are doing this again.

102
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,740
That is not it.

103
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,500
I was not referring to that lunatic, Tee.

104
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,300
I meant Din.

105
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,220
He was not willing to appear in the dreams of his family members.

106
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,780
I thought he might appear in your dream, sir.

107
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,860
Am I right?

108
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,860
Can you give me a lucky number?

109
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,620
Are you guys taking me to the temple or somewhere else?

110
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,140
We are going to the police station.

111
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,300
That is right.

112
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,380
Mom told us to look for the police.

113
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,380
Ken.

114
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,620
Do not do anything rash.

115
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,660
You were only asked to identify the culprit.

116
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,540
Do you still remember their faces?

117
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,580
Do you think I am going to forget how they look?

118
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,420
Hey!

119
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,380
Watch out!

120
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,460
Darn it!

121
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,580
Hey!

122
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,620
Watch where you are going!

123
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,660
Come out!

124
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,860
Did they die?

125
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,060
Hey!

126
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,540
Do you need help?

127
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,660
Ken?

128
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,100
Ken?

129
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,180
Ken.

130
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,340
Ken?

131
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,980
Ken, are you okay?

132
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:03,740
Ken!

133
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,740
Mr. Lue?

134
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,620
I am fine.

135
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,660
Can you help my friends?

136
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,860
Mister!

137
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,060
Mister!

138
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,340
Mister!

139
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,380
Mister?

140
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,340
Mister!

141
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,700
Mister!

142
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:30,860
Mister!

143
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,300
Are you okay?

144
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,540
Mister!

145
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,180
Mister!

146
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,300
He took the wrong lane and came toward us.

147
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,820
Then the crash happened.

148
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,180
Are you hurt anywhere?

149
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,660
Do you need to see a plastic surgeon?

150
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,260
Sir, I am fine.

151
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,300
Are any of your body parts damaged?

152
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,460
Can you guys keep it down?

153
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,500
Please be considerate of Mr. Lue.

154
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,460
You guys can be mushy at home.

155
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,500
Sorry.

156
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,860
However,

157
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,060
thank you so much, Mr. Lue.

158
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,260
We were very lucky that you passed by.

159
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,620
Earlier,

160
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,620
the car that crashed into yours,

161
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,100
was it a black pickup truck?

162
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,980
Yes.

163
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,100
It was a black pickup truck.

164
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,660
Mr. Lue,

165
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
how did you know?

166
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,660
When I found you guys,

167
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,500
I saw a black pickup truck beside the road.

168
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,900
Did you see the number plate then?

169
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,540
I will call the cops.

170
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,460
Hey!

171
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,140
We can check out the dash-cam footage in our car later.

172
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,540
You are right.

173
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,220
Mr. Lue, you speak Thai so eloquently.

174
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,900
You even sound like a local.

175
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,820
Oh.

176
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,420
I have been doing business here for a long time.

177
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,140
Oh.

178
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,860
We have arrived.

179
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,180
We have arrived.

180
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,180
Oh, that hurts.

181
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:15,819
That hurts.

182
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,980
Have we arrived?

183
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,020
You drive pretty fast, Mr. Lue.

184
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:25,940
Um...

185
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,500
So,

186
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,580
can I drop you guys here?

187
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Let's go.

188
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,900
You guys...

189
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,700
You guys should get off now.

190
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,420
Stop troubling Mr. Lue.

191
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,580
Do you guys feel better now?

192
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,500
Yeah.

193
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,580
But I am very sleepy.

194
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
Ken, Hin, Payu.

195
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,140
How are you guys feeling?

196
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,180
We are fine.

197
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,300
We just sustained some minor injuries.

198
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,220
Who brought you guys back?

199
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,620
It was Ken's friend.

200
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,500
He brought us back since he passed by and saw us.

201
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,500
Your friend?

202
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,860
Do I know him?

203
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,060
Why didn't you invite him here?

204
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Mom, you do not know him.

205
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,700
He went back because he had something to do.

206
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,780
I met him once when I visited Ken abroad.

207
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,820
But

208
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,020
I do not know why he is here.

209
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,210
Yes.

210
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,140
And,

211
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,460
he is very handsome.

212
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,140
However,

213
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
he has a fierce look.

214
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,140
Shut up.

215
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,660
What?

216
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,380
Come here.

217
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,410
What are you doing?

218
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,380
What are you doing?

219
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,340
Handsome.

220
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,460
Good-looking.

221
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,740
Yes.

222
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,900
It is true.

223
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Look at your son!

224
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,020
He stared at him throughout the entire journey.

225
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,900
It is true.

226
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,540
He is very handsome.

227
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,740
How did you know I was staring at him?

228
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,740
Because I saw it!

229
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,170
How?

230
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,300
You were sleeping.

231
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,380
I saw it.

232
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,020
Enough!

233
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,020
I was just in a daze.

234
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,300
I was staring at the road outside.

235
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,020
What is wrong with that?

236
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,100
I saw you staring at him.

237
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,900
I was staring at the road.

238
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,500
I saw it.

239
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,660
What do you want?

240
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,420
Hey!

241
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,500
That is enough!

242
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,580
You are Ken, right?

243
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,780
Ken.

244
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,180
This way.

245
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,580
Where are you going?

246
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,340
Din.

247
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,060
Yes, Madam?

248
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,780
Quiet.

249
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,460
Hurry.

250
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,460
Where are we going?

251
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,700
Just follow me.

252
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,620
Don't say a word.

253
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,810
Just follow me.

254
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,020
Din.

255
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,140
Is that you?

256
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,260
Yes.

257
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,500
Lower your volume!

258
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,980
Calm down and keep quiet.

259
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,820
Din, what is wrong?

260
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,420
Are you hiding something?

261
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,860
It is nothing.

262
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:52,860
Huh?

263
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,220
If so, why are you hiding from your mother?

264
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,380
Because it is fun.

265
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,460
Fun?

266
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,980
How is it fun?

267
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,100
Because I have never done this before.

268
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,650
Since you are already here,

269
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,340
I want to try something thrilling.

270
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,660
You...

271
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,980
What are you up to?

272
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,100
Welcome to my world.

273
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,780
That painting is very beautiful.

274
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,980
I like it.

275
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,700
But it seems sorrowful.

276
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,140
They must have overcome many obstacles

277
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,540
before getting together.

278
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,140
Will we experience the same thing as them?

279
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,780
What if we do?

280
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,220
Hey.

281
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,300
Go away.

282
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,300
Go away.

283
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,500
Oh.

284
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,970
I know what to do now.

285
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,820
[We will be together again on the 7th of July, Din]

286
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,020
Come here and sign your name, Ken.

287
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,860
Come on.

288
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,250
Hurry up.

289
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,540
Write down your name.

290
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:29,100
[We will be together again on the 7th of July, Din & Ken]

291
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,420
Are you appeased now?

292
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,540
Hmm?

293
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,140
Smile for me.

294
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,740
Smile.

295
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,260
Smile.

296
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:14,020
[We will be together again on the 7th of July, Din & Ken]

297
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,860
Ken.

298
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,540
Sai.

299
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,780
Where are all of Din's belongings?

300
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,540
Hmm...

301
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,620
Yes.

302
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,500
I was also wondering the same.

303
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,300
I was about to ask

304
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,420
where all his stuff went.

305
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:16,860
Um...

306
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,500
Where are the clothes,

307
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,340
items,

308
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,300
and documents in this room?

309
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,770
Oh.

310
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,220
The clothes were already worn-out

311
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,460
and dusty.

312
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:24,820
So,

313
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,620
I donated all of them.

314
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,220
All of his documents are with me

315
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,820
as I had to use them to register his death

316
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,540
and make a death insurance claim.

317
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,260
Ken, you can sleep in Din's room.

318
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,540
You do not need to book a hotel room.

319
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,500
It is okay.

320
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,620
I will stay at the hotel.

321
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,340
Oh.

322
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,580
I know you treasure your privacy,

323
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,860
but it is not safe there.

324
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,300
You do not need to worry about me.

325
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,650
If they do come for me,

326
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,900
I will be glad to meet them too.

327
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,060
You are so cool.

328
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,980
Was the car crash this morning truly an accident?

329
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,940
[I still cannot identify the culprit.]

330
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,900
Really?

331
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,700
If so, what should we do now?

332
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,940
Were they injured?

333
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,340
I suggest

334
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,460
they visit the police station

335
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,660
or make a police report right now.

336
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,140
Okay.

337
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,070
[Passion Heaven]

338
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,460
How do you feel, my sweetheart?

339
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,500
Does it hurt?

340
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,860
It is just like what you see.

341
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,420
If so,

342
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,900
is there anything I can do to help?

343
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,620
No.

344
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:48,780
But,

345
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,420
I need you to do me a favor.

346
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,580
I kept some ice cream in the refrigerator.

347
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,500
I want you to feed me.

348
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,460
Sure.

349
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,300
I will feed you later.

350
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,020
Hello, sir.

351
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,540
What would you like to have?

352
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,380
What is on the menu, my dear?

353
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,660
What would you like to order?

354
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,780
Goodbye.

355
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,700
Hello.

356
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,940
This is my wife.

357
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,580
She is beautiful, right?

358
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,100
That is cool.

359
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,420
Cool, right?

360
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,580
What is the matter?

361
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,180
You guys can wait there.

362
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,900
I'm on my way.

363
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,060
See you.

364
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,620
Someone is coming.

365
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,740
Is that Nok?

366
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,420
Hey!

367
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,740
Hey!

368
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,340
Clay, Dew!

369
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,140
Nok!

370
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,220
Inspector Don said he found the bodies this morning.

371
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,340
I think they should have been dead for almost eight hours.

372
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,060
Was it an accident?

373
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,100
The inspector said they were hit by a truck.

374
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,220
This must be karma.

375
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,260
If so, what will they do with the case?

376
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,540
Now that those two are dead, is the case over?

377
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,180
No, Meaw.

378
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,420
Those who died were only Nok's underlings.

379
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,020
You are right.

380
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,650
Nok is the key person here, and he is still alive.

381
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:45,980
Oh.

382
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,860
What if Nok dies?

383
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,940
Yeah, Chief.

384
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,660
The case will be over then.

385
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,100
Excuse me.

386
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,780
Can I join you?

387
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,260
Sure, have a seat.

388
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,659
Thank you.

389
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,060
What are you doing here?

390
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,940
I am staying here.

391
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,500
Normally, when I come to this province,

392
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,060
I always stay here.

393
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,460
Are you okay?

394
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,860
Sorry? What did you just say?

395
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,060
Oh.

396
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,900
I just...

397
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,340
I was just trying to say

398
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,340
that I am doing business here.

399
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,300
What are you doing here then?

400
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,980
Don't tell me

401
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,450
that you are also doing business here?

402
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,100
What is the matter? Did you wake up too early today?

403
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,700
You should buy a mobile phone for Ken.

404
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,540
You would have seen him with one

405
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,940
if he wanted to use a mobile phone.

406
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,500
You do have a point.

407
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,660
I do not know why Ken is not willing to use a mobile phone.

408
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,460
Hey.

409
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,930
What are you doing here?

410
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:49,970
Where is Ken?

411
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,740
Didn't he go out with you guys?

412
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:52,380
Huh?

413
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,540
My subordinate said

414
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,940
Ken left in a luxury car this morning.

415
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,020
What?

416
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,660
Where did he go?

417
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,300
Did you know where he went?

418
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,020
Oh man, how can I find him now?

419
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,580
Even if I want to contact him, he does not have a mobile phone.

420
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,420
How far away is it?

421
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,020
You said you were heading in the same direction as me.

422
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,100
Where did you intend to go?

423
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,420
Actually, I came here to see you.

424
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,020
Huh?

425
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,780
Anyway, I still have to thank you

426
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,500
for giving me a lift.

427
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,820
You are welcome.

428
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,340
I am the one who has to thank you instead.

429
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,060
I do not usually enjoy forest drives like these.

430
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,700
Oh.

431
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,900
Do you remember my underling?

432
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,260
The one who is working at Jo Chia Restaurant.

433
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,700
I am going to look for him.

434
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,820
I cannot remember.

435
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,380
I do not care about other people.

436
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,340
The only person I care about is you, Ken.

437
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,340
This place is so remote.

438
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,980
Excuse me.

439
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,460
Does Kan live around here?

440
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,980
Kan? Who is that?

441
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,900
Kan used to work overseas.

442
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,580
I have never heard of a person like that around here.

443
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,300
He said he lives in House No. 15 of District 4.

444
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,300
House No. 15 of District 4?

445
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,540
Do I have to go further?

446
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,780
Yeah, maybe it is inside. You can try searching for it.

447
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,780
You can ask the people around there. Maybe someone knows him.

448
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,380
Hello.

449
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,620
Is anyone home?

450
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,540
Kan, are you here?

451
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,340
Hello.

452
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,780
I am here to look for Kan.

453
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,540
Is Kan here?

454
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,740
Who?

455
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,980
Kan.

456
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,460
There is no Kan here.

457
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,060
Is this House No. 15 of District 4?

458
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,740
Yes, No. 15 of District 4.

459
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,860
But the person you are looking for is not here.

460
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,300
How could that be?

461
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,980
Kan told me

462
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,060
that he lives in House No. 15 of District 4.

463
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,100
He gave this to me.

464
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,500
This is the place. But the person you are looking for is not here.

465
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,180
He is not here?

466
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,260
No.

467
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,220
Thank you.

468
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,740
This means

469
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,140
that your underling has another name other than Kan.

470
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,740
That is why no one here knows who he is.

471
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,300
Hmm...

472
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,940
I just found out

473
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,980
that he has another name called Fin.

474
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,660
We have already traveled quite a distance.

475
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,380
But there are no houses here.

476
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,100
You are right.

477
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,620
Wait, is that a house?

478
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,940
But why is there a wooden barrier here?

479
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,300
I will go and check it out first.

480
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,500
Mr. Lue.

481
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,700
Yes?

482
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,450
I think I should go inside.

483
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,980
Do you want me to follow you?

484
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,380
It's okay.

485
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,340
Kan was my underling.

486
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,340
There is nothing to worry about.

487
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,060
Kan?

488
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,500
Kan, are you here?

489
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,460
Kan?

490
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,420
Kan?

491
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,180
Fin?

492
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,780
This is Ken.

493
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,180
I am here to see you.

494
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,860
Let me go inside, okay?

495
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,580
Kan?

496
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,580
Fin?

497
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,660
I am coming in now.

498
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,580
Kan?

499
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,820
Kan?

500
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,140
How many of them are they?

501
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,100
Who is that?

502
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,780
Ken!

503
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,260
Ken!

504
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,620
Din!

505
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:19,980
Mr. Lue.

506
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,940
Are you okay?

507
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,740
Let me feed you, okay?

508
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,660
Okay.

509
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:44,900
It's hot.
