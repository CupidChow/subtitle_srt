I'm here to see Doctor Chayeol.

Have you made an appointment?

41

No, I haven't.

to see the doctor sooner?

45

Nope.

65
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,710
I saw their phone numbers on your contact list.

66
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,510
Maybe you can look them up.

67
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,990

74
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,350
Mr. Peter Lue, the one who was treated by the doctor in Seoul.

75

92

155
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,070
But this is too dangerous, Ken!

Ken!

159
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,350
Lue is Doctor Chayeol's patient, right?

160
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,950
Yes.

161
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,030
Isn't this normal?

162
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,550
But why did the staff say Lue

163
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,670
is Dr. Chayeol's relative.

164
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,030
Are you serious?

165
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,310
Did you hear it right?

166
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,950
Did your informant confirm

167
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,830
whether or not Lue has a sibling?

168
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,070
Um,

169
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,470
no.

170
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,150
That's right.

171
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,710
You believed the gossiping staff

172
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,990
and let what they said mess with your head.

173
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:16,950
Gosh.

174
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,790
Wait,

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,350
why isn't my sister picking up my calls?

Where are they now?

177
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,830
Hey guys!

178
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,430
What's wrong?

179
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,030
The immigration department tipped me off

180
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,150
and told me that Lue got into an accident in Korea.

181
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,350
What happened?

182
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,710
So, two years ago,

183
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,870
having located Ken,

184
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,150
the authorities claimed that Din left for Korea

185
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,670
for some medical treatment.

186
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,630
Huh?

187
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,630
All the way to Korea?

188
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,670
And the one who sent him there

189
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,310
was Dr. Chayeol.

190
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,710
And Sai went to Korea too

191
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,630
to get the paperwork sorted out that Din had died there.

192
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,790
The hospital then issued the death certificate.

193
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,430
Hold on.

194
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,390
Sai never told me about this.

195
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,230
I see.

196
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,190
After that, Sai lived in Korea for almost a year.

197
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,180
Well...

198
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,260
Where did Din receive his treatment?

199
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,470
PSB Hospital.

200
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,910
What?!

201
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,510
PSB Hospital?

202
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,350
That's where Dr. Chayeol worked.

203
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,310
I can't believe no one told me about this.

204
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,630
Dad!

205
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,630
Dad,

206
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,910
what happened?

207
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,750
Dad!

208
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,950
Dad!

209
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,950
What's going on?

210
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,710
Sai...

211
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,950
They took your mom.

212
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,350
Don't tell anyone...

213
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,470
Who took Mom?

214
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,790
or they'll kill her.

215
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,550
They told us

216
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,270
to give them back their stuff

217
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,150
before sunset today.

218
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,750
What stuff, Dad?

219
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,990
They said Din took it.

220
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,510
What did he take?

221
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,230
I don't know, Dad.

222
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,350
[Hey. Come to this location now!]

223
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,310
Please let me go!

224
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,550
Why are you doing this to me?

225
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,430
I don't know anything!

226
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,030
My son is dead!

227
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,150
Din is gone!

228
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,430
Please let me go!

229
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,190
Hey, old lady!

230
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:53,950
Zip it!

231
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,070
Please let me go!

232
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,430
I don't know anything!

233
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm scared.

234
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,790
I'm scared!

235
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,990
Please let me go!

236
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,150
Please let me go!

237
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,590
Quiet!

238
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,310
Don't!

239
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,750
You're asking for it, huh?

240
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,270
No!

241
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,990
I don't know anything!

242
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,110
Please let me go!

243
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,750
Just let me go.

244
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,310
Why did you take me?

245
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,590
Please let me go!

246
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,390
Ugh!

247
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,270
I'm begging you!

248
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,910
I'm begging you!

249
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,310
Please let me go!

250
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,910
I'm scared!

251
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,990
Please don't hurt me!

252
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,510
If she dies here, she'll never see her son again, right?

253
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,670
Let's see if he's got the guts to come here.

254
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,270
Chief?

255
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,630
Is that you?

256
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,250
Chief.

257
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,790
Chief.

258
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,910
Chief Ingpha.

259
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,270
Chief.

260
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,589
Chief, help me. Please!

261
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,750
I don't want to be here!

262
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,550
I'm scared!

263
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,109
Have you lost your mind?

264
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,030
You're scared and losing it, huh?

265
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,109
Darn it!

266
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,270
Hey.

267
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,829
I'm scared!

268
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,990
Please just let me go.

269
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,710
I don't know anything.

270
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,750
Please don't hurt me.

271
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,430
I really don't know anything.

272
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,910
Ugh!

273
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,270
Help me. Please.

274
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,190
Hey, old lady.

275
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,430
I'm going to say this one last time.

276
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,910
If you don't shut your mouth,

277
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,630
you'll never see your kids again.

278
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,710
Understood?

279
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,790
Yes, that's what I want!

280
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,110
Mature Siamese Rosewood is hard to come by these days.

281
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,910
But, for your order,

282
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,750
I’ve got you covered.

283
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,190
You need not worry.

284
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,830
I’m sending out an order today,

285
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,230
and I would like you to check it out.

286
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,830
That way, you'll feel relieved.

287
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,030
Mr. Lue.

288
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,270
Mr. Lue?

289
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,710
Yes?

290
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,350
That’d be great.

291
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,710
I want to see it, too.

292
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,150
However,

293
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,350
how far is it?

294
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,540
I don't have much time.

295
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,710
Um...

296
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,430
We're almost there.

297
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,670
Are you in a rush?

298
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,990
Yes.

299
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,030
Is it about Ken?

300
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,910
I'm worried about him, too.

301
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,110
I don't know why he had to go back there.

302
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,430
Even the cops can't catch Nok.

303
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,510
Mr. Lue, you heard about it, right?

304
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,030
That Din is still alive.

305
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,670
We're here, Mr. Lue.

306
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,630
Here?

307
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,550
Yes, that's right.

308
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,550
Please wait for a minute.

309
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,950
Hi there,

310
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,710
Mr. Lue!

311
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,030
How are you?

312
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,150
Whoo...

313
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,830
Hello.

314
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,510
Fret not.

315
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,870
I'm not Din.

316
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,510
I know Din is your enemy,

317
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,190
but this is my territory.

318
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,430
He's too chicken to come here.

319
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,470
Welcome!

320
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,710
Welcome.

321
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,910
Please.

322
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,230
Please, Mr. Lue

323
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,950
If we're going to do business together,

324
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,750
we have to get to know each other

325
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,070
and be open-minded.

326
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,790
Whoa, hold on.

327
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,390
It's the flu season, man.

328
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,350
Alright.

329
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,630
Everything within the forest in the Lower North

330
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,630
is all mine.

331
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,750
Be it the trees,

332
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,590
the woods,

333
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,510
and rare items,

334
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,350
almost everyone gets them from me.

335
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,870
But I don't give them away easily.

336
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,190
If it’s about money,

337
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,030
it's no big deal.

338
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,070
I'm willing to pay you the full amount upfront.

339
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,350
But, at least

340
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,310
let me take a look at the goods first.

341
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,550
Sure thing! My pleasure!

342
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,710
Now we can have a nice talk

343
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,630
and relax.

344
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,110
Well,

345
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,950
I'll show you around the whole area today.

346
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,070
Welcome!

347
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,550
Thank you.

348
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,870
Here, Ken.

349
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,110
Have some coffee to freshen up first.

350
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,590
Listen up, Ken.

351
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,790
I'm dead serious

352
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,270
about Lue.

353
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,550
If he ever messes with you again,

354
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,470
I'm going to deck him.

355
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,230
He's always messing with you.

356
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,790
Hmm.

357
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,910
Don't worry about him.

358
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,030
Hey, Ken.

359
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,390
We always bump...

360
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:43,990
Ken,

361
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,950
I really can't stand Lue.

362
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,470
Don't you get fed up with him?

363
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,270
We always bump into him.

364
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,190
I truly can't stand him.

365
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,630
I don’t even know if we can trust him.

366
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,990
DeeDee!

367
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,790
I'll drive.

368
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,950
It's okay.

369
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,750
You can have the passenger seat.

370
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:01,950
It's okay.

371
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,430
Get in and sit.

372
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,310
You can have some rest.

373
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,550
It's okay.

374
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,630
Get in and sit.

375
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,670
You can enjoy your coffee.

376
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,350
It's okay.

377
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:08,630
Let's go.

378
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,990
I'm sorry, DeeDee.

379
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,750
They told us

380
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,470
to give them back their stuff

381
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,350
before sunset today.

382
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,950
What stuff, Dad?

383
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,190
They said Din took it.

384
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,710
What did Din take?

385
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,430
I don't know, Dad.

386
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,150
Ken, you've got to turn back.

387
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,190
Get out of my way!

388
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,990
No!

389
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,550
I said get out of my way!

390
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,110
Why are you going there?

391
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,550
It’s too dangerous.

392
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,670
You’ve got to head back!

393
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,550
I said get out of my way!

394
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,670
Why do you want to go to that wooden bridge?

395
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,910
It’s a waste of time.

396
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,630
Trust me.

397
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,310
Stop messing with me!

398
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,990
I said clear off!

399
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,710
Din is gone!

400
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,750
He's gone forever.

401
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,350
Stop fooling yourself.

402
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,630
He's not coming back,

403
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,110
whether it's here or somewhere else.

404
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,310
You don't know him.

405
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,870
Din is still alive,

406
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,310
and he is coming back for me.

407
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,190
Stop dwelling on Din already.

408
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:00,990
You!

409
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,990
Stop messing with me and get out of my life!

410
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,510
I don’t need you!

411
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,350
Just go!

412
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,630
Din is my only love.

413
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,870
Mark my words.

414
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,390
[Go inside the church.]

415
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,110
[Where are you?]

416
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,710
[Where is my mom?]

417
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,550
Where is my mom?

418
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,070
Where is my stuff?

419
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,310
I'm asking you.

420
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,390
Where is my stuff?

421
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,630
Where is my mom?

422
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,830
Where on earth is my stuff?

423
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,390
Where is my mum?

424
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,750
I have to see her first.

425
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,710
Give it to me!

426
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,270
I have to see her first.

427
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,470
Can I see my mum first?

428
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,150
[Sai.]

429
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,630
[Is that you?]

430
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,430
[Where are you?]

431
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,110
Mom!

432
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,150
Mom!

433
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,390
[Don’t hurt my daughter.]

434
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,990
Mom!

435
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,950
Mom!

436
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,910
Sai.

437
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,950
Hey!

438
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,910
I beg you, don’t hurt my daughter!

439
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,150
Give it to me!

440
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,150
Listen up!

441
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,190
If you don’t hand it to me,

442
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,350
you shall see your mom's dead body.

443
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,310
Do you want to see that?

444
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,270
Let me go!

445
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,670
That’s it.

446
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,070
Are you scared?

447
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,870
Do I look like an idiot to you?

448
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,230
Huh?

449
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,990
You wench!

450
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,670
If you walk out of here, your mom is dead!

451
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,790
Get back here!

452
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,950
Do you hear me?

453
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,230
If you leave, your mom is dead.

454
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,390
I'm begging you!

455
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,950
Please let me and my mom go.

456
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,950
Please!

457
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,070
I'm asking this one last time.

458
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,510
Where is my stuff?

459
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,310
Where is my stuff?

460
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,990
Your staff is here!

461
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,070
Darn it!

462
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,910
You again?

463
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,230
You always get in my way!

464
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,070
You jerk!

465
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,070
Where is my stuff?

466
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:10,989
Right here.

467
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,230
Deal!

468
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,150
Listen here, wench.

469
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,310
You're useless now.

470
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,870
Get out of here.

471
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,830
You!

472
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,190
Sai!

473
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,070
Go!

474
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,590
Sai!

475
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:39,870
Sai!

476
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,510
Go!

477
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,030
Sai!

478
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,190
Get up!

479
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,110
Darn it!

480
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,750
Let go!

481
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,070
Who are you?

482
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,990
Din.

483
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,270
You are Din, right?

484
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,270
We will meet each other here before sunset,

485
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,230
on the seventh day of the 7th month.

486
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,990
I've found the location, Mr. Lue.

487
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,150
Ken!

488
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,430
Sai!

489
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,230
What are you doing here?

490
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,550
Are you alright?

491
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,190
Please help my mom!

492
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,430
What's happened, Sai?

493
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,870
Please help my mom!

494
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,270
What's the matter with your mom?

495
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,270
Mom…

496
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,230
You have to help my mom. Please.

497
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,150
Calm down.

498
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,870
Calm down, Sai.

499
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,670
Chief, have a look at this.

500
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,710
Nok?

501
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,270
Have you seen him?

502
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,470
No, I haven't.

503
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,110
Have you?

504
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,790
No, Chief.

505
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,310
Your son is here.

506
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,750
Why is there a fire here?

507
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,110
We have to find him, now!

508
00:41:59,230 --> 00:41:59,900
Go!

509
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,190
Hey!

510
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,230
Come out and take a look!

511
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,790
Look who I am taking with me.

512
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,750
I said come out.

513
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,150
Put your gun down!

514
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,230
Put it down!

515
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,990
Where is my stuff?

516
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,670
Where is my stuff?

517
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,750
Get up!

518
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,470
Stop being a crybaby.

519
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,510
Get up!

520
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,470
Where is my stuff?

521
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,670
I'm asking you, where on earth is my stuff?

522
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,670
Where is my stuff?

523
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,470
Take off your mask

524
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,470
and tell me who you are.

525
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,350
I said take it off. Now!

526
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,030
Lue!

527
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,510
It’s me.

528
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:10,910
Let's go, Chief!

529
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:12,830
Let’s go!

530
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,510
Quick!

531
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,510
Who are you?

532
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,350
Ken!

533
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:53,990
I’m Peter Lue.

534
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,870
I’m Kenjun.

535
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,230
Nice to meet you.

536
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,620
I thought I’d never see again.

537
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,510
It was so terrifying!

538
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:04,990
I'm still so scared.

539
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,230
It’s okay, Mom.

540
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,470
Do you think I’m naive?

541
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,950
[Has he ever asked me how I feel?]

542
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,230
Clear!
