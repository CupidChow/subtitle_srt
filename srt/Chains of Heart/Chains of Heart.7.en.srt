Mr. Rungradit Rungamonwanit

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,440
Why did he have to kill?

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,039
I feel really sorry for Ken.

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,479
If Din were still alive, he would probably protect Ken's life.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,080
Because he is still alive.

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,360
how can this be?

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
Din is not dead yet.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,560
He is just a single easy target,

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,000
and you still messed up.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
What the hell else can you do for me?

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
Hey, stop!

24
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,079
Hey, bro!

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,160
Hey!

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,720
What?

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,320
What the hell are you doing?

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,120
It’s driving me nuts.

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,720
Why?

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,120
It’s so annoying.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,240
I want to read the news.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,280
It’s bugging me.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,760
Just pretend I’m not here.

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,440
Hey, bro!

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,160
Has Mr. Lue ever had a car accident in Seoul?

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Um...

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,800
He could be there for a reason.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,760
Why?

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,680
He ended up in a coma and nearly died.

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,320
Do you know when?

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,640
Maybe almost two years?

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,520
Almost two years?

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,720
Yes.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,000
Why?

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,240
Nothing.

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,440
Why is it such a coincidence?

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,440
Here,

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,160
Who,

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Who is this?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,760
Where?

51
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,840
Let me see.

52
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,320
It’s too close.

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,320
OK!

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,320
Oh…

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,840
Mr. Lue's son.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,880
I see,

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,320
he's actually a widower with children.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,560
Does Ken know about this?

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,680
Hum?

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,920
This is not the issue, Hin.

61
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
the point is…

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,240
Excuse me!

63
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,200
Inspector Boon is here to see you.

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,079
Yes.

65
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,800
Guys!

66
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,760
I’ve got some urgent news.

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,880
What happens?

68
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
What’s that, Inspector?

69
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
What’s wrong with you?

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Here is it!

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,920
Is it not clear enough?

72
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,720
That guy in black keeps following me,

73
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
and he even wears the amulet of the monk.

74
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,320
I mean…

75
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,240
who would dare confront Chief Ingpha alone?

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,400
And did you hear what Inspector Boon said?

77
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,280
Who else could it be?

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,640
It's definitely Din.

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,160
Guys..

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,240
Din is still not dead.

81
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,200
Din is not yet dead; he’s still alive.

82
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,080
Can you believe me now?

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,240
But I don't believe you.

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,400
Sai.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,680
The big shot in the shady business world…

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,640
as Chief Ingpha…

87
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,320
would have a lot of enemies. Who knows?

88
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
But I'm certain that person isn't Din.

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,360
How can you be sure, Ken?

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
Who told you that, Inspector Boon?

91
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Can you tell me?

92
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,280
Even you’re not so sure.

93
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,560
I'll be the one…

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,760
who doesn't believe that the guy in black is Din.

95
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,680
Din was burned to ashes already…

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,440
everyone knows that.

97
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,320
Then it's up to you, Sai.

98
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,080
Up to you.

99
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
What happened to you, Sai?

100
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,480
What's gotten into you, Sai?

101
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,240
Just let Ken speak.

102
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
I don't believe it.

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,200
I don't want anyone to make up new stories about Din,

104
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
especially Ken.

105
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,159
I just...

106
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,800
want him to stop dwelling on…

107
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,520
the things that couldn’t be.

108
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,159
But with everything going on,

109
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,320
it’s no wonder he's thinking that way.

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,159
That’s right.

111
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,680
I wouldn’t believe it either.

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,480
But now…

113
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,880
you’re not sure anymore, right?

114
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,600
Hey, you guys!

115
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,080
Should we help him move on from this?

116
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,840
Let's stop spinning new tales about Din.

117
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,680
Din is still alive.

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
And someone here must know all about Din.

119
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,560
I will find out the truth.

120
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,520
Ken.

121
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,920
Hello, DeeDee.

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,800
Where are you?

123
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,000
Ken

124
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
I've got a restaurant booked already.

125
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,520
Let’s have dinner.

126
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,240
Let’s go.

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,520
Let’s go.

128
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,640
Ken.

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,520
Mr. Lue

130
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,960
Hey!

131
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,840
You again?

132
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,360
How did you get here?

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,800
Where are you going?

134
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,080
Have you recovered yet?

135
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,200
He isn’t getting well yet.

136
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,680
Can’t you see?

137
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,720
What are you doing here?

138
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,760
I’m...

139
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,280
Hello, Doctor.

140
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
Let’s get in the car, Ken.

141
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,120
Hello.

142
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,440
Yes.

143
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,560
OK.

144
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,640
We're leaving now.

145
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,480
See ya never!

146
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,840
I can’t believe it was Din.

147
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,280
If it really was him…

148
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,559
we need to stop him…

149
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,159
before he does something even worse.

150
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,160
Ken didn't freakin' pick up his phone.

151
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,440
That’s Lue.

152
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,920
Excuse me for a few minutes.

153
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,280
Sure, Doctor.

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
What will you do next?

155
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,160
I’ll finish him off.

156
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,320
Are you sure it was...

157
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,800
If it's not him, then who else could it be?

158
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,560
He is not dead yet.

159
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
Damn!

160
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
How dare you confront me like this.

161
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,080
You don’t know me well enough.

162
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,120
Ken.

163
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,680
I haven't seen you smile…

164
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,840
since we got in the car.

165
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,040
Don't you like hanging out with me?

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,080
Hey, Ken.

167
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,680
Don't you enjoy coming with me?

168
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,120
I haven't seen you smile.

169
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,640
Have you ever seen me smile?

170
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,520
Never.

171
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,720
Oh,

172
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
Or maybe it's because of Mr Always-Looking-Good Lue?

173
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,560
Lue doesn’t match you.

174
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,320
If I see him again,

175
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
I will knock him out.

176
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,400
OK.

177
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,240
No joking… Are you feeling better yet?

178
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh, Ken.

179
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,480
Wow!

180
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,840
Ken's got a phone, but it's like he's not even bothered…

181
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,640
'cause he never answers the calls.

182
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,840
I really don't feel good to see him like this…

183
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,680
I know that everyone has hope.

184
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,280
If I were Ken,

185
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,920
I would take risks and do everything to find out…

186
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,760
whether the guy in black is Din or not.

187
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,720
Yes.

188
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,560
Knot, you predicted Ken's future once, didn't you?

189
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Yeah.

190
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,320
You told me when Ken was in the hospital.

191
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,840
I told you that…

192
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,320
I couldn't actually see into Ken's future.

193
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,080
What?

194
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,760
You couldn’t see Ken's future.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,560
It’s not what you think.

196
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,440
I just couldn't see Ken's future with Din.

197
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,120
What?

198
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Did you say it seriously?

199
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,480
Um...

200
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,160
So If it's not Din,

201
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,400
who will be the guy in black?

202
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Does anyone know?

203
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
Oh gosh, what are they barking at?

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,680
Hey Max, Charlie, Cooper…

205
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,520
What are you barking at?

206
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,120
It is annoying.

207
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
There is no one here.

208
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,880
Why you gotta bark like that?

209
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,040
Quiet!

210
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,200
You are a good driver.

211
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,640
If you’re not coming to my home, I won’t be your chauffeur, babe!

212
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,480
[Next time, please drive for me again.]

213
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,120
Welcome to my home.

214
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,760
OK.

215
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,720
My home.

216
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,280
Let’s go!

217
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,800
Do you know that you're getting lazy?

218
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,800
Really?

219
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,240
Yes!

220
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,120
Let’s go.

221
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,200
Dad, mom, I’m home.

222
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,640
Hello.

223
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,160
Come.

224
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,440
Come on, cheers!

225
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
Actually,

226
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,240
I didn't mean that I hadn't seen anyone in Ken's future.

227
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,840
What I saw was…

228
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
What did you see, Knot?

229
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,760
Nothing.

230
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,520
Hey, you guys.

231
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,280
[I shouldn't be here.]

232
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,320
Bottoms up!

233
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,560
[Is the food enough, Ken?]

234
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,040
[I think these two dishes are fine]

235
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,720
[Really?]

236
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,440
[Yes.]

237
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,160
DeeDee

238
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,040
Yes?

239
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,200
What time is it?

240
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,320
8 P.M.

241
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,080
Hungry again?

242
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,400
Yes.

243
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,560
[The food has now been ready.]

244
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,840
Is there anything to eat?

245
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,600
Hey Sai, Doctor…

246
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Come on.

247
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,520
what took you guys so long?

248
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
The doctor was driving so slowly, so I had to take the wheel.

249
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,520
Oh.

250
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,280
Come quick.

251
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,440
I know,

252
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,320
I’m so hungry.

253
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,240
I know that you might be hungry.

254
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,840
Come

255
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,280
I give you this food.

256
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,320
Let's have a big hug. I've missed you so much.

257
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,040
I’m missing you.

258
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,600
Let’s eat.

259
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,680
Hello.

260
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,200
That's weird,

261
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,200
the dogs stopped barking after you guys got here.

262
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,240
They are all silent now.

263
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,960
Dad!

264
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,120
What?

265
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,960
Before you guys got here,

266
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,560
the dogs were going crazy.

267
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,960
So I went to yell at them to stop barking.

268
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,880
How were they barking, Dad?

269
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,640
Like, Whoo… (howling sound)

270
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,040
That’s howling, you crazy.

271
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,040
Really?

272
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,680
Dad,

273
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,840
Or is there something else in our house?

274
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,040
Huh?

275
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,880
Ghost?

276
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
We got ghosts up in here?

277
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,200
You're overreacting, Dad.

278
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,640
Really?

279
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,640
You deserve an award for that reaction.

280
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,160
Try this,

281
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,680
I cooked this.

282
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,840
Your phone's ringing, by the way.

283
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,520
Got it.

284
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,080
Hello.

285
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,040
Hello, Hin.

286
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,120
It's the four of us here:

287
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,920
Dad, me, Sai, and Chayeol just got here.

288
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,880
Alright, Mom.

289
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,880
I just wanted to hear how everything's going.

290
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,359
Make sure Dad locks all the doors, OK?

291
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,319
OK.

292
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,599
Miss you already.

293
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,440
Later!

294
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,400
[So yummy.]

295
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,920
[Yummy.]

296
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,079
How was it?

297
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,000
Is everything OK?

298
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,079
All good.

299
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,520
Sai and the doctor just got there.

300
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:25,960
That’s good.

301
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,480
Nowadays, It’s not really safe…

302
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,160
to leave the old people at home.

303
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,840
We have to be careful.

304
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,120
Bro, look over there!

305
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,920
What?

306
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
What the hell?

307
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,000
Such a nuisance!

308
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,720
That is Mr. Lue.

309
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,040
Hey!

310
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,760
Hey!

311
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,240
Damn!

312
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,000
[Why you get on our nerves?]

313
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,000
Hit him hard.

314
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,320
Don’t mess with us.

315
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,320
Police!

316
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,200
Police here!

317
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,400
Police!

318
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,800
What the hell?

319
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,400
Hey, bro.

320
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,560
Can you handle that?

321
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,840
Is Inspector Boon still around?

322
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,080
Hey!

323
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,800
Are you OK?

324
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,640
We’re OK.

325
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,080
Go!

326
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,880
[I’m OK]

327
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,360
Let’s go.

328
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,040
Mr. Lue

329
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,760
Go!

330
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,040
Mr. Lue

331
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,400
Mr. Lue

332
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,520
You guys are ganging up on me; just bring it on!

333
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,200
Ken,

334
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,400
bring him back.

335
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,240
Thank you so much.

336
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
Alright, Doctor.

337
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,560
Thank you so much.

338
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,200
Hmm, the reek of alcohol is really strong.

339
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,360
The doctor said we gotta put an ice pack on him for 48 hours.

340
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,080
Once he’s up,

341
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,360
we have to give him some herbal juice…

342
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,240
to help with the bruises.

343
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,680
But I still got something more important to say...

344
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,680
Mr. Lue rented the doctor’s room here.

345
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,400
For real?

346
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,440
Which room?

347
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,160
Room number 2707.

348
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,080
Wait a minute,

349
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,440
2707?

350
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,600
It’s the one next to Ken’s room.

351
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,960
Ugh.

352
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,120
How come he lives here?

353
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,000
We always bump into him.

354
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,120
OK.

355
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,840
I think,

356
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
you guys go take some rest first.

357
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,520
I will take care of everything here.

358
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,400
OK.

359
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,480
Ugh!

360
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
This is so heavy.

361
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,400
What a burden!

362
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,520
What did you eat…

363
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
to get so heavy, huh?

364
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,280
DeeDee

365
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,560
Oh, bro…

366
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,480
For real though!

367
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,720
No idea what to do with him.

368
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,920
Hey!

369
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,880
Get a grip!

370
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,240
Right here

371
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,520
You shouldn’t bring him here.

372
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,720
Such a frickin’ burden.

373
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,920
Mr. Lue

374
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,960
DeeDee

375
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,000
You can head back now.

376
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
It’s already late, don’t waste your time.

377
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,320
Thank you for today, tho.

378
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,320
No problem, bro.

379
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,960
So as I’m already here,

380
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,760
let me take him to the room first.

381
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,560
I don’t trust drunk people,

382
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,400
especially, Lue.

383
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,640
DeeDee

384
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,680
It’s true.

385
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,080
Sorry for waiting,

386
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,520
Here’s the key. I got it from the manager.

387
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,760
Can’t you open it?

388
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,120
Mind if I take a look?

389
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,320
It’s the manager’s card. It’s supposed to open every room, right?

390
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,560
Yes.

391
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,800
Yes, normally it can open every room.

392
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,200
So, what should we do now?

393
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,680
Can you try again?

394
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,640
Come on in.

395
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
Ugh.

396
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,800
So heavy.

397
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,920
Ugh.

398
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,400
Why so wasted.

399
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,000
What the hell did you drink?

400
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,840
Thank you.

401
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,680
Look!

402
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,320
This key card can open my room, but not my friend’s.

403
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,520
I will definitely report this to the manager.

404
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,920
Thank you.

405
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,160
[It’s so burden].

406
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,880
[No idea what I did].

407
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,600
DeeDee

408
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,040
Thanks for today.

409
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,880
Hum?

410
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,960
Wait!

411
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
Will you let Lue stay here tonight?

412
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,760
You can go and get some rest.

413
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,960
He just couldn’t enter the room.

414
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,960
Will you let him sleep out there?

415
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Tomorrow morning, I will let him go back to his room.

416
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,880
He’s out cold right now.

417
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
Don’t forget to lock your bedroom.

418
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,600
I don’t trust Lue.

419
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,280
OK.

420
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,480
[Bro,

421
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,640
you just let some random guy in your room].

422
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,880
See!

423
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,600
Ken.

424
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,880
You always end up like this when you're drunk, Din.

425
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,120
Stay still.

426
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,280
I will take care of you.

427
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,080
Are you OK?

428
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,320
Hum?

429
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,280
Ken.

430
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,800
Stay put.

431
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,120
Last one.

432
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,880
Calm down.

433
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,520
Good boy!

434
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,440
Let me clean up your face for you.

435
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,520
I told you not to drink so much.

436
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,960
Ken.

437
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,680
How did you get into my room?

438
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,080
What?

439
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
This is my room.

440
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,280
I’m the one who have to ask you,

441
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,560
how did you end up on my bed?

442
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,400
Last night you got so drunk,

443
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
and got into a fight with a gangster.

444
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,240
My friends and I helped you.

445
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
But you end up in my room because…

446
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,240
I couldn’t find your key card.

447
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,400
But last night,

448
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,560
You was on the sofa right there.

449
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,240
I might have sleepwalked.

450
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,160
Why?

451
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,960
Why did I get naked?

452
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,440
Because,

453
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,680
last night you got so drunk,

454
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
You got undressed on your own and then ended up here.

455
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,400
Don’t you remember anything?

456
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,400
If I were conscious,

457
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,320
I wouldn’t just lay on your bed like this.

458
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,840
I would have cuddled you all night.

459
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,520
Mr. Lue

460
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,400
My friends are here!

461
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,960
What?

462
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,480
What is he doing?

463
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,120
Why is he so slow?

464
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,880
Mr. Lue,

465
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,160
Let’s do this.

466
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,120
I’ll tell my friend everything,

467
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,240
except for the fact that we slept together last night.

468
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,680
Is that OK with you?

469
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,880
Hey guys!

470
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,640
Just a second.

471
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,760
Din.

472
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,480
Hello, Chief Ingpha.

473
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,560
Are Mrs. Maew and Mr. Ithi here?

474
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,360
Yes, they’re here. I’ll call them for you.

475
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,720
My wood is legal.

476
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
I have all the necessary documents.

477
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,600
And the most important thing. I promise my wood is beautiful…

478
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,760
and way better than anywhere else.

479
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,360
But what I really want…

480
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,600
is not on the list you gave me.

481
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,720
Can I ask for your help?

482
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,640
I’ve got a very urgent order…

483
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,640
from abroad.

484
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,160
I need this…

485
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,360
Siamese Rosewood.

486
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,040
Yes.

487
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,600
It's one million baht per cubic metre.

488
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,040
Thank you so much, Ms. Ae.

489
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,920
You’re welcome, Mr. Lue.

490
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,920
I hope everything goes well.

491
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,360
Absolutely.

492
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,040
Hello, where are you now?

493
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,200
I’m here.

494
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,000
OK.

495
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,440
[No, I don’t think so. I’m actually getting chubby.]

496
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,080
[I don’t think so].

497
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,360
[I’m getting chubby lately.]

498
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,120
[But still look great.]

499
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,400
[Have you eaten anything yet?]

500
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:20,920
[Not yet]

501
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,400
[Let’s find something to eat.]

502
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,120
[OK, let’s go.]

503
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,040
Let’s go.

504
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,160
[Let’s grab a bite.]

505
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,440
Hello, Chief!

506
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,640
Hello, Chief.

507
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,800
I have something to tell you about Din.

508
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,000
Din?

509
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,560
Din?

510
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,920
What it’s about?

511
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,160
Inspector Don told me that…

512
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,840
Din is still alive.

513
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,960
What!?

514
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,160
What?

515
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,000
How is that possible?

516
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,040
You two don’t really know about this?

517
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,480
Hey, darling!

518
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,320
Did you know about this?

519
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,520
I wasn't certain…

520
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,440
so I chose not to tell you yet.

521
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,000
What?

522
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,960
Why don’t you tell me?

523
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,120
We're supposed to have each other's backs.

524
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,440
The chief has just warned us to be more careful, though.

525
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,760
Maybe,

526
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,200
things might not be that way, Dad.

527
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,480
So…

528
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,080
for the sounds and footsteps you found in Din's room,

529
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,040
could it have been a thief?

530
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,000
not Din?

531
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,560
Oh man,

532
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,440
who would’ve known?

533
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,840
Anyway, I gotta head off to work now.

534
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,400
You guys take care of yourselves, OK?

535
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah.

536
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,840
You two should stop arguing.

537
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,680
and make up your mind about moving to Bangkok.

538
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,200
I gotta go now.

539
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,680
Dad, don’t forget to lock the door, OK?

540
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,520
OK.

541
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,560
Lock the door up tight, OK?

542
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,720
Drive safe.

543
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Will do.

544
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Let me lock the door first.

545
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,880
Look at my daughter…

546
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,400
I told her to drive safely.

547
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,400
Look!

548
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,560
She’s speeding like crazy.

549
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,520
What should we do then?

550
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,920
Darling, would you like to go to Bangkok?

551
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:14,960
Hey,

552
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,760
Why are you sitting there?

553
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,440
Mom.

554
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,920
Hey, I'm talking to you; can't you hear?

555
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:24,920
Hey, Mom.

556
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:25,920
Oh, no… what’s going on?

557
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,080
Who did this to you?

558
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,840
Huh?

559
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,560
Hey!

560
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,120
Where the hell is your son?

561
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,240
Din.

562
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,480
Hum?

563
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,360
I don’t know.

564
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,880
Din is already dead.

565
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,400
He is still alive.

566
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,480
Where is he then?

567
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,080
I don’t know.

568
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,360
You don’t know?

569
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,920
Don’t know?

570
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,160
Whats up, old lady?

571
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,240
[I don’t know.]

572
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,320
Don’t hurt my wife!

573
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,520
Quiet!

574
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,880
Tell me…

575
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,040
Answer me already. Where the hell is Din?

576
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,120
[I don’t know.]

577
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,640
Sorry,

578
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,280
I tied up your mouth; you can’t speak.

579
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,240
I really don’t know.

580
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,960
Don’t do anything to us.

581
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,960
I’m begging you.

582
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,000
Damn!

583
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,880
Is it damn hard to answer?

584
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,240
I don’t know.

585
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,200
All your damn answer is, "I don't know."

586
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,600
Bloody hell!

587
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,240
Din filmed a video of us two years ago; where is he? I need him now!

588
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,840
Where is he?

589
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,400
I need him now!

590
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,480
Where?

591
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,960
I don’t know.

592
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,760
I already told you, he's dead.

593
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,800
No, he isn’t!

594
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,400
I don't know; I've never seen him.

595
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,520
I don’t know.

596
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:02,920
I don’t know.

597
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,600
Ugh!

598
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,320
I don’t know.

599
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,040
You don’t know?

600
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,840
Now you know where he is, huh?

601
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,840
I don’t know.

602
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,480
Don’t do anything to us, please!

603
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,800
I don’t know.

604
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,720
Please, I’m scared!

605
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:13,960
Where?

606
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,240
Please!

607
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,280
Leave my wife alone, please.

608
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,280
Hey, old lady…

609
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,400
I’ll give you until the count of three…

610
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,160
[Please don’t…]

611
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,440
if you don’t tell me the truth.

612
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,520
[Don’t do anything to us.]

613
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,400
[I really don’t know.]

614
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,320
I’m start counting.

615
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,120
One…

616
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,360
Please don't hurt us; I'm so scared.

617
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,720
Two…

618
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,200
I really don’t know.

619
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,960
Please let us go.

620
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,560
Three!

621
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:58,760
Hey, Ken.

622
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
So, after graduation,

623
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,720
are you gonna work in Bangkok?

624
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,800
Of course, man!

625
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,520
My dream is,

626
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,640
to become a chef like my dad.

627
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,960
Don’t worry, bro…

628
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,520
no matter what you do or where you are,

629
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,280
I will always be with you.

630
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,320
If you don’t keep quiet,

631
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,680
you'll never see your son again.

632
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,080
You!

633
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,080
You should stop messing with my life,

634
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,400
and get out of my life.

635
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,640
I don’t need you.

636
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,440
Go away!
