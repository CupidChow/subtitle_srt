Hey!

75
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,780
What is this about?

76
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,980
Hey!

77
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,820
You are rude when you speak to me,

78
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,540
my dear brother Fin!

79
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,540
Nok?

80
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,630
Come here and help me out!

81
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,660
Get over here!

82

I'm coming!

83
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,100
Why did you kick me?

84
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,660
Because you were rude to me, Brother!

85
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,659
I'm here!

86
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,220
Come here, brat!

87
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,220

Stop resisting!

91
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,780
Hey!

92
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,180
Hey!

93
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,340
Did you die that easily?

94
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,500
Hey!

95
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,980
Go away.

96
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,380
Hey!

97
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,620
Who is that?

98
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,860
Who are you?

99
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,340
It's none of your business.

100
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,820
Stay out of this!

101
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,740
Why did you have to kill Fin?

102
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,740
He botched the job.

103
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,500
Stay out of this!

104
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,580
Understood?

105
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,020
I got to go, Brother.

106
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,700
Hey!

107
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,860
Don't move!

108
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,700
Don't move!

109
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,780
I'm at the edge of the forest.

110
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,460
Yes, Mr. Lue.

111
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,420
I'll take care of it.

112
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,220
He wants to see you.

113
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,460
What is this about?

114
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,820
He told me he used to visit you very often.

115
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,940
But, he never brought me here

116
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,380
when he was in the area.

117
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,900
He said it was far and dangerous.

118
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,130
It's true.

119
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,020
What's true?

120
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,700
Nothing here is dangerous.

121
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,180
There is nothing but the forest.

122
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,780
Everything is calm...

123
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,140
and refreshing.

124
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,260
Where are you guys going next?

125
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,540
Are you going to sightsee around the area?

126
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,820
Um...

127
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,500
Din asked me to go on a trip.

128
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,100
Take this and keep it with you.

129
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:59,100
Raging Bull, what's your 20?

130
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,620
Standing by.

131
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,700
Ken.

132
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
I will drop you off later.

133
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,540
No, I want to go with you

134
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,940
No!

135
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,780
The forest is dangerous, Ken.

136
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,500
Wait here.

137
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,660
If nothing happens, I'll be back before sunrise.

138
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,500
Why do you have to leave me for this stupid job?

139
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,620
I'll be back soon.

140
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,980
Who on earth is this?

141
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,100
The Chinese guy who bought Seng's timber factory last year.

142
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,300
What does he want from us?

143
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,660
I don't know.

144
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,900
How could you let him see your face?

145
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,580
Does he remember you?

146
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,100
Don't worry.

147
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,780
He doesn't remember my face.

148
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,130
How you can be sure?

149
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,500
You need to hurry up and find out

150
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,940
why he is messing with Ken.

151
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
And don't let anyone else see your face!

152
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:25,810
Fool!

153
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,180
[Two years ago]

154
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,100
Din?

155
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
How many of them are there?

156
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,140
Are there any of us?

157
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,780
Hum?

158
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,980
Answer me, Brother!

159
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,500
Hey.

160
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,900
How are you, boss?

161
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,060
Hello, Chief.

162
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,940
Thank you.

163
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,100
Without you, I'd be in trouble.

164
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,340
My customers abroad place many orders.

165
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,820
They have already paid,

166
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,100
I can't cancel the orders.

167
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,020
This is Din.

168
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,020
He is the right-hand man I mentioned.

169
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,740
Oh.

170
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,580
He has a strong opinion of his own.

171
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,460
He likes to defend the nature.

172
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,420
Good.

173
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,860
Me too.

174
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,260
Kid.

175
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,140
Have we met before?

176
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,100
Boss.

177
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,500
He is the son of the massage parlour owner.

178
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,260
Oh?

179
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,820
Meaw's son?

180
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,940
Oh.

181
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,180
We're not strangers. We can talk this out.

182
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,460
Hey! Let him go.

183
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,740
I must apologize for my staff.

184
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,820
I know your parents very well.

185
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,780
We've loved and helped each other for ages.

186
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,140
I'll be sure to pay you.

187
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,740
Let's help each other.

188
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,700
Let your boss know.

189
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,860
Here.

190
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,780
Hey.

191
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,540
If it is not enough, you can tell me.

192
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,620
I am just and I have enough money

193
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,820
to pay you for the work.

194
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,860
Here.

195
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,860
Hey!

196
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,500
Din!

197
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,380
Idiot!

198
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,660
But he neglected his duty and caused damage to the nation!

199
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,460
You cannot support their illicit activities.

200
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,380
You have to arrest them!

201
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,500
Who the hell are you?

202
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,020
Huh?

203
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,460
How dare you lecture me?

204
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,300
I was here before you even got here!

205
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,020
The Chief was kind enough to pay you.

206
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,820
How hard is it to accept the money?

207
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,780
Camera?

208
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,700
Din!

209
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,020
Don't shoot!

210
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,460
Hey!

211
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,820
Why?

212
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,900
Why?

213
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,860
[That drawing is beautiful.]

214
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Before they could be together,

215
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,060
they had to overcome many obstacles.

216
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,620
[Welcome to Din's world.]

217
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,980
Din!

218
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,460
Din!

219
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,260
Hey!

220
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,980
Din!

221
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,500
Where are you?

222
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,060
Din!

223
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,660
Over here!

224
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:07,970
Hey!

225
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,060
Where are you going?

226
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,380
The forest is that way.

227
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,380
Why are you going that way?

228
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Go this way!

229
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,260
Go!

230
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,260
Cursed Din!

231
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,580
Quick!

232
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,180
Cursed Din!

233
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,140
Ken!

234
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,020
Ken!

235
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,900
Din?

236
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,100
Din?

237
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,900
Din!

238
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,060
Din?

239
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,740
-Din! -Cursed Din!

240
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,140
Din!

241
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,060
Din!

242
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,900
Hey!

243
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,820
Who are you?

244
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,020
Din's friend.

245
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,900
Din's friend?

246
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,660
Who?

247
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,140
Din's friend is here!

248
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,140
I will take you to Din.

249
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,020
Who are you?

250
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
I will take you to Din.

251
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,300
Nok!

252
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,860
Go!

253
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,180
How could I miss?

254
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,940
Quick!

255
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,980
Din!

256
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,660
Go! Keep going!

257
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,900
Go, Din! Go!

258
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,900
Go! Keep going!

259
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,500
Why did you stop?

260
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,100
Where is my stuff?

261
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,540
Talk!

262
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,380
Where is my stuff?

263
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,020
What are you doing?

264
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,620
Stop!

265
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,780
Stop!

266
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,420
Please!

267
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,500
Please!

268
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,020
Where is my stuff? Tell me!

269
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,290
Din!

270
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,340
Mr. Lue.

271
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,540
Are you okay?

272
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,500
Din...

273
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,620
Calm down.

274
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,500
It's me.

275
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,860
That was it.

276
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,580
By the time I got you out of Fin's house,

277
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,260
it was already dark.

278
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,100
You were unconscious.

279
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,420
If I took you back to the hotel, it could take a few hours...

280
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,380
I thought

281
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,340
it'd be best to first get some rest at a place nearby.

282
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,780
You helped me again, Mr. Lue.

283
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,420
Don't mention it.

284
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,900
Can you explain everything to me?

285
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,380
Why?

286
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,620
Why were you attacked?

287
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,620
Why did Fin attack you?

288
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,140
And...

289
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,940
You are the one who told me that

290
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,860
the person who killed Fin

291
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,780
was the same person who hit us with a car.

292
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,260
Yes.

293
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,060
I remember him.

294
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,980
So who was it?

295
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,940
Why did he have to kill Fin?

296
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,180
Perhaps...

297
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,660
he wanted to keep his mouth shut

298
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,700
to cover something up?

299
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,020
The truth is,

300
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,740
your past is tied to this place.

301
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,740
I feel sorry

302
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,700
for your former lover.

303
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,460
Yes.

304
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,740
Din must be very happy

305
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,780
that you came to bid him farewell.

306
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,460
But I think,

307
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,980
he might also be sad.

308
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,540
He is more worried about you

309
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,460
because your is at risk.

310
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,260
It doesn't matter what I do or where I am.

311
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,500
Some people are trying to hurt me

312
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,260
and Fin from Jo Chua restaurant.

313
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,380
Some wanted Fin dead.

314
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,820
Who are they?

315
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,820
Do you know?

316
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,820
Or...

317
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,380
Do you suspect anyone?

318
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,860
I don't understand.

319
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,420
Why are they hunting you down?

320
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,020
Mr. Lue, you know how dangerous this is.

321
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,020
You don't need to know more than you do now.

322
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,500
Stay away from me.

323
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,300
Thanks for everything you've done for me.

324
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,140
Good morning, Mr. Lue.

325
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,820
You're awake.

326
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,820
Do you like painting?

327
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,740
Yes.

328
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,460
Do you like painting?

329
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,860
Do you want to try?

330
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,620
I don't know how.

331
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
This is your breakfast.

332
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,780
I bought it.

333
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,980
The food here looks delicious.

334
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,980
But I'm not sure

335
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,100
whether you can eat it or not.

336
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,700
Yes, I can.

337
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,180
I like all of them.

338
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,820
Really?

339
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,100
That's great.

340
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,260
So...

341
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,380
Shall we eat?

342
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,860
Take a seat.

343
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,300
Mr. Lue.

344
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,180
Yes.

345
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,300
It's me.

346
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,460
Where is your ride?

347
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,300
This is it.

348
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,340
This is my ride.

349
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,780
Where are you going, Ken?

350
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,580
It's still early morning.

351
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,740
I was taking a walk.

352
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,580
Great.

353
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,020
Let's take a ride together.

354
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,100
But first, put on the helmet.

355
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,620
Erm...

356
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,300
Is it too tight?

357
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,739
A little bit.

358
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,100
Better?

359
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,060
Yes.

360
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,900
Let's go.

361
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:48,980
Let's go.

362
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,179
I'll open the door for you.

363
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,980
Shall we go now?

364
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,660
Let's accept the monk's blessing.

365
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,140
Amitābha.

366
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,140
Have you given alms before?

367
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,500
Never.

368
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,420
Wait.

369
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Be careful, it's hot.

370
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,660
Wow.

371
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,500
This shop is beautiful, Ken!

372
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,180
Let have a look inside.

373
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,660
I did some research.

374
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,620
It turns out that this restaurant is the most famous in the area.

375
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,940
It has beautiful views

376
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,740
and delicious food.

377
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,060
Yes.

378
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,260
Wow, it's here.

379
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,020
Wow.

380
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,820
This smells delicious.

381
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,420
Do you like kanom jeen saunam?

382
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,700
Yes.

383
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,820
I have tried it before.

384
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,210
Why?

385
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,300
Is it weird?

386
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,300
Not at all.

387
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,300
Maybe

388
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,700
it was your beloved's favorite dish?

389
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,900
I envy him.

390
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,500
Why?

391
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,260
Well...

392
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,540
For having someone like you as his lover.

393
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,980
You are loyal to him.

394
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,740
You don't fall for anyone else.

395
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,660
Thank you, Mr. Lue.

396
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,580
Despite everything,

397
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,820
he's the only one I have.

398
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,540
Oh.

399
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,460
Your friend is probably worried about you.

400
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,740
They might be searching for you.

401
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,580
Mr. Lue.

402
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,220
Yes?

403
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,340
Can I borrow your phone?

404
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,900
Sure.

405
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,380
Thank you.

406
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,100
Hello.

407
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,100
Hello

408
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,780
That's not very nice of you!

409
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,140
You spent the night with another guy!

410
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,460
That was too much!

411
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,060
Hey!

412
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:37,780
Ken.

413
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,780
What are you doing?

414
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,060
It's a long story. I'll fill you in later.

415
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,900
I'm calling to you

416
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,220
so you don't have to be worried.

417
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,900
But where are you now?

418
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,660
We'll go and fetch you.

419
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,740
It's okay, I will be back soon.

420
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,260
Mr. Lue will give me a lift.

421
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,500
Mr. Lue?

422
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,020
This is not cool at all.

423
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,180
You could get yourself in trouble!

424
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,780
Huh?

425
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,380
It's too much!

426
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,140
Hold on.

427
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,220
Ken.

428
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,540
Nok's underling that got caught

429
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,500
is now dead.

430
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,180
What?

431
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,860
Yes.

432
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,180
I think you are in danger.

433
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,900
Are you okay?

434
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,020
It's nothing.

435
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,140
My friends are worried about me.

436
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,580
Excuse me.

437
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,420
Have you been here before?

438
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,220
Yes,

439
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,140
but it was a long time ago.

440
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,700
The monk is here.

441
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,010
Greetings.

442
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,580
I'm Ken.

443
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,580
You?

444
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,210
Yes.

445
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,620
Is Din with you?

446
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,580
He didn't come.

447
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,140
I'm here with my friend.

448
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,860
Hello, Mr. Lue.

449
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,820
Stop!

450
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,180
Whatever reason we have

451
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,860
to be separated from each other,

452
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,580
we will meet again on this bridge

453
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,700
on the seventh day of the seventh month.

454
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,820
Din has probably been reincarnated.

455
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,860
Maybe he's having fun somewhere.

456
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,460
That's right.

457
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,300
He could be move on without us.

458
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,540
We're still alive. We should move on.

459
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,820
I heard that a foreign boy is wooing you.

460
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,860
Well?

461
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,140
Is it true?

462
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,220
Is he cute?

463
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,300
I will take Ken back.

464
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:45,820
Thank you.

465
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,540
Here,

466
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,420
the wall iris.

467
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,420
It represents your strong and unwavering love.

468
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:00,860
Okay?
