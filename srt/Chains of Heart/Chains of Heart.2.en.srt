00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,680
This is a Cantonese restaurant

144
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,920
Dad is the main chef

145
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,440

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,240
But...

148
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,200
At this moment, the young lady said I can order thai food

149
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,720
We do have

150
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800

154
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,400
Then I would like to ask for Thai’s menus

155
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,000

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360

Am I at Chiangmai?

169
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
Normally customers don’t order Northern’s menu

170
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,200

I think...

391
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,120
Ken is very pitiful

392
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,840
you think that?

393
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,200
Hey

394
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,400
Is someone see Ken?

395
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:40,960
I don’t see

396
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,800
I don’t see

397
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,120
Did you see him?

398
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,560
I don’t see

399
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,040
Didn’t he stay with you?

400
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,080
I last seen he is with you

401
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,840
You will get sick

402
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,880
Yes

403
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,480
I have to go first

404
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,240
Ken

405
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,360
Come on

406
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,320
I can walk, I’m ok

407
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,880
Don't be stubborn

408
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,640
Hang your camera and get on my back

409
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,120
Please disturb you

410
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,440
Yes

411
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,400
Are you good?

412
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,880
Do you know...

413
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,360
After 7th July

414
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,160
The cowherd will carry the weaving girl go across the Milky way

415
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,680
After the sun down

416
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,360
And he will carry back

417
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,480
Before the sun rises

418
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,720
Before the sun rises

419
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,160
Stop messing with all this

420
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,360
If you don’t want to die

421
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,800
What do you want?

422
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,680
Who the hell are you?

423
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,240
Is that Mr. Tee that riding motorcycle?

424
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,880
Are you sure?

425
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
You guys wait there

426
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,880

427
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,000
Those two are died and the case over?

428
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,240
Still have Nok that is intermediary

429
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,880
What if he die?

430
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
The case is over

431
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,040
Game!

432
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,560
A car that hit you...

433
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,080
Is it a black pickup truck?

434
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,960
How did you know?

435
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,720
I don’t understand...

436
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,840
Why you want to sleep here?

437
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,600
How about Ken?

438
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,160
Didn’t he went with you?

439
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,960
Ken
