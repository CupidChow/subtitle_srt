It's okay. I'll hold it for you.

171
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,060
Go.

172
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,700
Dr. Han, is he really okay?

173
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,180
He's fine. Don't worry.

174
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,860
It's him, right?

175
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,340
Qi Shuo.

176
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,220
What?

177
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,010
The person you like.

178
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,010
Thank you, Dr. Han.

179
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,900
I must have been a heroine

180
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,260
who saved the world in my previous life.

181
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,300
Come on.

182
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,420
Let me pass this good luck to you.

183
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,900
No, no.

184
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,700
No, no, no.

185
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,780
I have a baby. I have a baby.

186
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,020
I can't move vigorously.

187
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,500
I know you're happy.

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,890
But you should know that

189
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,780
I'm happier than you.

190
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,100
That means

191
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,020
we can meet again soon.

192
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,820
It's like after you're pregnant, you'll be muddled for the next three years.

193
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,300
Isn't he right in front of you?

194
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,500
Yes.

195
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,460
All the important people are by my side.

196
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,820
You know

197
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,850
this is what I look forward to the most.

198
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,860
I know.

199
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,780
But with your current condition,

200
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,140
we should go home and rest.

201
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,060
Don't make a fuss.

202
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,020
The baby kicked me.

203
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,300
Let me listen.

204
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Come on. Listen.

205
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,700
Oh.

206
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,340
It's so small. I'm just kidding.

207
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,540
Are you here to take photos again?

208
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,420
Why aren't you coming in?

209
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,620
No, sir.

210
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,100
I have a favor to ask you.

211
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,730
Go ahead.

212
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,780
Can you sell this photo to me?

213
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,060
So this is how it feels to be pregnant.

214
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,700
What feeling?

215
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,540
Do you feel unwell?

216
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,460
Stop eating this.

217
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,260
I feel refreshed all over my body.

218
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Where's Qi Shuo?

219
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Have you found that

220
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,820
he has been

221
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,340
mysterious lately?

222
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,980
Isn't he always mysterious?

223
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,940
Is he worried that

224
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,820
after my son is born,

225
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,380
I'll stop liking him?

226
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,700
Maybe.

227
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,780
There's no need to worry about it.

228
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,020
Be pregnant for ten months.

229
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,940
The baby cries piteously for food.

230
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,940
Endure all kinds of hardships to raise the baby.

231
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,180
Giving systematic guidance.

232
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
I've used up all the idioms I know.

233
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,540
Anyway,

234
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,340
I'm the one who endures the most hardships, okay?

235
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,820
Yes, you have to endure the most hardships.

236
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,100
So, take good care of yourself,

237
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,260
and that's the way to take good care of Qi Shuo.

238
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,660
Don't eat the rubbish food.

239
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,300
Drink milk.

240
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,460
The day I dreamed of

241
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,530
is finally coming.

242
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,140
Qi Yue.

243
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,340
You look very good

244
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,770
in a wedding dress.

245
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,380
I hope you can always be so happy.

246
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,180
Young man.

247
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,580
It's the red light. Why are you so impatient?

248
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,980
Follow the traffic rules.

Children's room.

250

Blue.

[October 16, 2026: Blue is Qi Shuo's favorite color. He listens to crosstalk before sleep every day.]

253

Before the result of the testing comes out,

254
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,620
if you dare to scream again,

255
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,300
I'll make you...

256
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,420
To be frank,

257
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,060
you don't trust me at all.

258
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,580
But now I'm not afraid anymore.

259
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,420
I have a son. What am I afraid of?

260

[September 19, 2021: I'm sure this person was sent by a monkey to save me, and sent by the heaven to torture me.]

261
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,060
Members of a family should trust each other.

262
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,740
Today is the New Year's Eve.

263
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,300
Of course I have to come back for the New Year.

264
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,580
Happy New Year.

265
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,740
You came back through time travel,

266
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,180
and created us.

267
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,060
Then we created you.

268
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,740
Don't you kowtow to me?

269
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,260
If some people are destined to be together,

270
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,540
then in our previous life,

271

the life before the previous life,

272
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,820
and the life before the previous two lives,

273
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,369
we must have been destined to be a family.

Come here.

276

This way.

277
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,540
Their photo is still in the school.

278
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,580
That's right.

279
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,980
This wine is good.

280
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,220
It's like this.

281
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,740
You're blocking the photo.

282
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,860
The view is good over there.

283
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,650
What?

284
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,100
You want to get drunk

at someone else's wedding?

286
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,980
Then you should drink some.

287

I'm just here to attend my college classmate's wedding.

Though it's a pity,

a man of noble character should help others fulfill their wishes.

292

I just want to be a woman of noble character.

I'll remind you again.

You should keep the red packets from our friends well.

No problem.

Don't worry.

you should stand in the center.

and is always missing.

338
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,020
Bad news!

339
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,980
Bad news! Bad news!

340
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,860
What's wrong?

341
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,090
These two old men...

342
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,140
These two old men are drunk.

343
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,380
They're drunk?

344
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,900
Both of them are drunk?

345
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,900
Forget it. I'm not surprised.

346
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,940
Fortunately, I prepared Plan B.

347
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,220
Plan B?

348
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,860
What is the Plan B?

349
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,140
Follow me.

350
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,860
Me?

351
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,300
How do you feel to accompany your mother to walk down the aisle

352
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,380
for the first time?

353
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,380
Since I came here,

354
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,060
there have been to many first times.

355
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,250
Son,

356
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,580
thank you for coming to me.

357
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,220
You're welcome.

358
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,220
Because you are the one who is worth

359
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,660
my coming by crossing mountains and seas.

360
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,270
All the family members are together.

361
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,740
Thank you, Lu Xiao.

362
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,190
All the family members are together.

363
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:15,930
Go.

364
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,700
Dear friends and guests,

365
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,780
the holy and solemn moment we all look forward to

366
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,770
is coming.

367
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,060
Dear friends, let's applaud to welcome the newly married couple

368
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,420
to come on stage.

369
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,620
Please read the vows.

370
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,340
We willingly become husband and wife.

371
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,100
From now on,

372
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,220
we will shoulder

373
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,140
the responsibility and obligation conferred by marriage.

374
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,740
We'll treat our parents well and educate our children well.

375
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,260
We'll resepect, love, believe and encourage each other.

376
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,900
We'll understand, help and have a tolerant attitude towards each other.

377
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,140
We'll love each other forever.

378
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,980
Qi Yue. Lu Xiao.

379
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,740
Happy wedding.

380
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,620
Now, it's time for the newly married couple

381
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,820
to exchange rings.

382
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,220
Kiss!

383
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,180
Kiss! Kiss!

384
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,090
Kiss! Kiss!

385
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,900
Kiss! Kiss!

386
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,060
Mom.

387
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,340
I can finally change your fate.

388
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,270
Have you seen Qi Shuo?

389
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,200
No.

390
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,650
Me, neither.

391
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,460
Where did he go?

392
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,310
The number you dialed is not in the service area.

393
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,010
Please try again later.

394
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,450
How come it isn't in the service area?

395
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,020
That was quite delicious.

396
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,660
Qi Yue.

397
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,120
Is getting married very tiring?

398
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,630
Have you seen Qi Shuo?

399
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,510
No.

400
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,010
I didn't see him in the lobby.

401
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,460
He's not around the lawn, either.

402
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,260
Qi Shuo!

403
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,820
Qi Shuo!

404
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:59,720
♫The past is like an impassable gully♫

405
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,580
Qi Shuo, where are you?

406
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,570
Qi Shuo!

407
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,780
♫I'll never have a chance to feel your tenderness again♫

408
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,900
Where are you?

409
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,540
Qi Shuo!

410
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:12,580
♫I remember the day when you turned around and kept going♫

411
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,140
Qi Shuo!

412
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,840
♫You didn't stop or look back♫

413
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,260
Where are you, Qi Shuo?

414
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,220
The number you dialled is not in the service area.

415
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,880
♫But then I tried to travel♫

416
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,540
Please try again later.

417
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,120
♫All over the world. But you never passed by♫

418
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,580
The number you dialed is not in the service area.

419
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,900
Please try again later.

420
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,570
♫Maybe we are like ships that pass in the night♫

421
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,550
♫This love has a bad ending♫

422
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:39,840
♫We missed each other naturally♫

423
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,640
I can't find him.

424
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,110
I can't find Qi Shuo.

425
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,670
Did he tell you something?

426
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,040
He asked me to give you this.

427
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,970
His diary.

428
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,530
[Mom, let's be mother and son again in the next life.]

429
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,420
[September 17, 2021]

430
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,160
[September 27, 2022]

431
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,590
[September 20, 2021]

432
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:15,910
[Mom, let's be mother and son again in the next life.]

433
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,570
[I Belonged To Your World]

434
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,550
[You will never know what decisions your mother has made for you.]

435
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,220
If I get pregnant in January, I'll give birth to the baby in November.

436
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,710
If I get pregnant in February, I'll give birth to the baby in December.

437
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,360
If I get pregnant in March, I'll give birth to the baby in January next year.

438
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,120
What are you doing?

439
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,730
I'm calculating when is the best time for Qi Shuo to be born.

440
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,260
The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring.

441
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,310
How about the winter?

442
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,700
Why are you so obsessed?

443
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,170
Put away the things and I'll take you out for dinner.

444
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,720
In your opinion,

445
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,070
Is Libra or Capricorn better?

446
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,520
Anyway, I can't give birth to him on February 29th.

447
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,620
Otherwise, he will have to celebrate his birthday once every four years.

448
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,290
Qi Yue.

449
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,420
Actually,

450
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,430
not everything

451
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,820
can be decided by you.

452
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,660
If I can't decide it,

453
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,350
then it should be decided by you.

454
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,230
Me?

455
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,550
Virgo then.

456
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,140
No.

457
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,070
Absolutely not.

458
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,310
Capricorn.

459
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,970
Libra. It is kind of fair.

460
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,180
No.

461
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,400
A Libra tends to be unfaithful in love.

462
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,710
Aries?
