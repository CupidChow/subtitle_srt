Yes.

told me in his way

that he's safe now.

How about

11
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,050
I take you home first?

12
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,330
Then you take me home.

What is it?

Judging by my experience,

20
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,540
this kind of thing is either marketing

21
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,540
or a way of lying.

Do you want to play the game?

28
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,900
I know you do.

29

I don't like playing games.

Two objects interact.

Are you treating me like your research participant?

40

There is a way.

41
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,260
You can distract your attention.

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,420
You'll catch me later, right?

43

So this is not a game of trust.

57
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,540
It should be a game of tacit agreement.

No wonder you two are cousins.

You're good at catching and hiding.

68

But I'm an innocent person.

No.

Okay.

It's okay.

Tuantuan, where are you?

Tuantuan, come out.

Tuantuan.

Tuantuan, you are here.

Where are you going, Tuantuan?

95
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,220
You threw the ball.

96
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,140
Did you throw the ball?

97
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,340
Am I right, Tuantuan?

98
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,460
You stink.

99
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,220
You're a cute little stinky dog.

100
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,620
You stink.

101
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,460
What did you do? You stink.

102
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,460
Little Tuantuan.

103
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,860
There's a new mask.

104
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,420
I'll use it.

105
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,170
You...

106
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,220
Why are you holding my mask?

107
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,300
I'm going to apply it.

108
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,060
Leave now.

109
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,930
I need to go to work.

110
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,420
Didn't you say you were busy?

111
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,700
Why did you come back in a hurry

112
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,409
and drive me away?

113
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,020
Are you hiding a man at home?

114
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,780
How is that possible?

115
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,300
We only have one male.

116
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,180
It's Tuantuan.

117
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,659
Really?

118
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,300
Tuantuan.

119
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,420
-I'll apply a mask before I go. -Tuantuan.

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,100
Aren't you looking for Qi Shuo?

121
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,820
Are you going to stop?

122
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,500
Go now.

123
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,130
I stopped looking for him.

124
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,260
Let him be.

125
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,380
You stopped?

126
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,580
Why?

127
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,850
Think about it. If Qi Shuo disappears,

128
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,780
that means

129
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,820
I don't have to chase Lu Xiao anymore.

130
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
Isn't this a blessing?

131
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,780
No.

132
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,500
You and Lu Xiao are destined to be together.

133
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,780
You must be with him.

134
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,540
Whoever believes Qi Shuo

135
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,220
must be stupid.

136
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh, by the way,

137
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,580
let me tell you.

138
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,020
I feel like

139
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,980
I've been followed lately.

140
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,540
Could it be Qi Shuo?

141
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,420
That's impossible.

142
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,780
That might be your hallucination.

143
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
Really?

144
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,420
Forget it.

145
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,020
Bye.

146
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,659
Bye.

147
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,659
-You're acting weird. -Bye.

148
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,700
Take care.

149
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,970
Where did you hide?

150
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,460
Why are you embarrassed?

151
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,660
What did she say?

152
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,540
She said someone was following her.

153
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,260
What?

154
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,340
Was that you

155
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,100
who followed her?

156
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,340
Could it be Xu Zhaoyang?

157
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,860
Where are my shoes?

158
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,740
My shoes are here.

159
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,250
Shoes.

160
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,260
Shoes.

161
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,580
Be careful.

162
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,090
Will it kill him?

163
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,020
Xu Zhaoyang,

164
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,170
I'll leave some leeway.

165
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,460
What a coincidence!

166
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,540
It's not easy for you

167
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,460
to keep calm.

168
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,340
I still want

169
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,180
to battle with you.

170
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,940
Director Qi, what should we do now?

171
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,860
Lure a snake out of its hole.

172
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,380
Since we have defeated the snake,

173
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,780
then

174
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,460
let's call it a wrap.

175
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,700
It's a wrap?

176
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,890
What does she mean?

177
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,580
Don't ask me.

178
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
I'm just an extra.

179
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,710
The smell is familiar.

180
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,570
Wait.

181
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,620
It's a dinner for apology.

182
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,940
Shouldn't we say something first?

183
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,420
Yes.

184
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,960
Let me say something.

185
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,440
The first swallow

186
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,510
is for your sincere apology to me.

187
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,560
Because you shouldn't have suspected me

188
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,270
and got mad at me.

189
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,040
Because I have already

190
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,420
refused Xu Zhaoyang seriously.

191
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,650
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,350
Take a second swallow.

193
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,370
Because you shouldn't have said harsh words

194
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,840
and run away from home.

195
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,980
No.

196
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,660
We have to count it as two.

197
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,010
One is for your harsh words.

198
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,100
Another is for your running away from home.

199
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,290
Okay, I'll listen to you today.

200
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,360
Okay.

201
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,890
Take a third swallow.

202
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,750
Because you shouldn't have taken pleasure

203
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,640
in my pain.

204
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,110
I don't admit it.

205
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,290
Why?

206
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,630
Because chasing Lu Xiao

207
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,310
is the common goal

208
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,860
we set before, right?

209
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,170
We just changed the method.

210
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,090
Besides,

211
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,350
aren't you happy now?

212
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,790
Right.

213
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,910
It's not over.

214
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,090
Take another swallow.

215
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,320
Because you shouldn't have lied to me with my friend.

216
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,250
I don't admit it.

217
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,100
Why do you always have opposition?

218
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,620
Did Deng Shuling tell you

219
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,410
I was at her home?

220
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,650
No.

221
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,450
So drink it.

222
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,700
Let's drink together.

223
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,350
But

224
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,790
you took me as a pawn

225
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,810
and fooled me.

226
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,650
Wait.

227
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,300
I was just doing live stream in the resort.

228
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,940
I didn't ask you to come to the resort,

229
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,570
right?

230
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,160
So...

231
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,560
Here, mom.

232
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,740
Here's another toast to you.

233
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,920
Good boy.

234
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,590
It's what I should do.

235
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,190
Drink some warm water before you sleep.

236
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,460
Let me tell you a secret.

237
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,770
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

238
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,420
I had that nightmare again.

239
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,920
What nightmare?

240
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,240
I dreamed of a man

241
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:33,640
walking towards the sea step by step.

242
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,450
I shouted.

243
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,910
He looked back.

244
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,360
Guess who he is.

245
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,580
Who?

246
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,890
He's Qi Shuo.

247
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,320
During the time he disappeared,

248
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,090
I was afraid every day.

249
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,050
What if he's in danger?

250
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,330
What if he really disappears?

251
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,140
Mom.

252
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,410
Don't think too much.

253
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,630
Dreams are the opposite of reality.

254
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,420
But I'm not afraid anymore.

255
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,280
I have a son. Why should I be afraid?

256
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,310
From now on, my slogan is

257
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,870
"have a son."

258
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,280
Mom,

259
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,730
if in the future...

260
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,810
I mean if in the future...

261
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,500
What if he really disappears?

262
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,280
[Don't...]

263
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,380
[Don't leave Qi Yue?]

264
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,350
The home is suddenly quiet.

265
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,990
I'm not used to it.

266
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,850
One bag per meal.

267
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,940
You'll gain weight if you eat too much.

268
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,370
This is true for humans and dogs.

269
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,750
You want to eat it secretly again?

270
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,800
Are you disappointed?

271
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,000
Books are used for reading,

272
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,339
not for acting as place mats.

273
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,680
Look under the book.

274
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,510
[Qi Shuo]

275
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,510
If you only eat noodles, you'll become ugly.

276
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,820
I'll bring you vegetables and fruits tomorrow.

277
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,240
Something happened?

278
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,460
Let me guess.

279
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,940
You got closer to Lu Xiao?

280
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,720
Qi Shuo went back home?

281
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,220
Are you going to tell me

282
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,730
your test scores have improved?

283
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,910
That's impossible.

284
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,010
She's in no mood to study.

285
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,110
Yes.

286
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,260
The combination of your answers

287
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,150
is the correct answer.

288
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,750
Both of them

289
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,100
have been defeated

290
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,110
under my jeans.

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,170
Not bad.

292
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,260
Let me touch your jeans.

293
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,790
Actually, Qi Shuo already knew

294
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,140
Lu Xiao and I were looking for him.

295
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,680
And then

296
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,500
he arranged a sweet show.

297
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,810
Lu Xiao and I also went on vacation together.

298
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,870
I knew it.

299
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,010
After a storm comes a calm.

300
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,980
Oh my god!

301
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,410
You have so many sanitary pads.

302
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,790
Do you want to be a seller in the Yiwu Market?

303
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,650
It's common sense in the south.

304
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,290
Tie sanitary pads to stairs.

305
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,220
You won't feel cold when you step on them in winter in this way.

306
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,680
Stupid.

307
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,080
What common sense is this? You're stingy.

308
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,350
I'm in a good mood today.

309
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,530
I'll buy equipment which can help you feel warm

310
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,260
in the dormitory.

311
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,430
Really?

312
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,140
What news did I miss?

313
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,200
You're late.

314
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,800
Forget it.

315
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,310
I wanted to say

316
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,990
I have big news.

317
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,420
Who cares?

318
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,590
Ay!

319
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,810
Right.

320
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,490
Lu Xiao applied to join the drama club.

321
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,670
The news is quite boring.

322
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,350
[Drama Life. You're Invited to Join the Drama Club.]

323
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:37,940
Lu Xiao.

324
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,700
He's from the Department of Physics.

325
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,420
Why did he apply to join the drama club?

326
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,060
Who cares?

327
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,270
For this performance,

328
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,120
I specially found a director.

329
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,670
[Drama Life. You're Invited to Join the Drama Club.]

330
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,550
He'll guide you through the rehearsal.

331
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,200
I'll record everyone's audition

332
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
today

333
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,090
so as to help him assign roles in the future.

334
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,000
Okay.

335
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,100
Lu Xiao.

336

Judging by your resume,

your glorious experiences

338
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,630
have nothing to do with acting.

339
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:08,970
Yes, sir.

340
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,790
Then why do you want to join the drama club?

341
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,600
If a girl hadn't taught me how to act,

342
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,780
I might not understand acting.

343
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,590
