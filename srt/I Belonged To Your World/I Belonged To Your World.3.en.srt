Are you Qi Yue's cousin?

453
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,900
Other parents are very active.

454
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,420
But your family

455
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,500
doesn't seem to care about

456
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,620
Qi Yue's grades.

457
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:20,580
Right.

458
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,100
Sometimes, for a student,

459
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,030
happiness is more important than grades.

460
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,440
You are really a family.

461

I've heard you are going to send her abroad.

In that case,

No, Ma'am.

466
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,900
I think you misunderstood the meaning.

467
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
Her family will arrange to send her abroad.

468
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,900
The purpose is to widen her horizon.

469
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,300
As for the happiness I mentioned,

470
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,100
it is not to let her muddle through

471
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,940
according to what you mean.

472
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,090
I didn't say that.

473
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,980
And I believe with Qi Yue's efforts,

474
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,500
she will be admitted by the university she wants to attend.

475
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,140
Sir,

476
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,330
have you seen her school report?

477
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,060
Of course.

478
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,500
She ranks the last. I know that.

479
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,060
Ask Qi Yue

480
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,180
to do this paper.

481
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,380
Okay. Thank you.

482
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,180
You're so amazing.

483
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,940
Who did you learn it from?

484
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,940
From you.

485
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,380
From me?

486
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,540
Sir, look.

487
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,340
He beat my son.

488
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,460
But my son is injured, too.

489
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,900
It must be your son who started it.

490
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,820
What evidence do you have?

491
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,620
When two kids fight,

492
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,130
if only one of them does it, it won't be a fight.

493
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,180
Besides,

494
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,650
I always tell Qi Shuo

495
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,300
not to fight with others unless he's offended.

496
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,820
Son,

497
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,940
did you start it?

498
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,660
No.

499
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,620
He hit me first, and then I fought with him.

500
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,100
How can you believe what a kid said?

501
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,060
If I don't trust my son,

502
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,420
should I trust someone else's son?

503
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,580
Mom, I really didn't start it.

504
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,700
Of course I trust you.

505
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,810
They all said you were unreasonable.

506
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,490
That's why I did it.

You did the right thing.

not for reasonable arguments.

Here you are. Milk tea. It's hot.

511
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,140
Do you really believe that I can go to college?

512

Of course.

513

As long as you work hard,

514
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,940
there's nothing you can't do in the future.

Where did you get that

516

blind confidence?

517
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
One day in the future,

518
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,820
you will tell me that

519

home is not a place for reasonable arguments,

520
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,100
and home is a place for unconditional love and trust.

Now, I'll say

What a coincidence, Lu Xiao.

532
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,620
I have a question for you.

Give them back to me if you don't want them.

574
