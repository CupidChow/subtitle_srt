So we watched the stall for you.

He knows nothing about this place.

He's an alien.

It's all my fault.

75
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,700

Those snacks were my treasures.

Okay, please bear with me.

343
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,220
Excuse me, sir.

344
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,300
One of our guests

345
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,140
has booked the available rooms.

346
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,180
So rich.

347
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,099
Now only room 520 is left.

348
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,220
Excuse me, please wait a moment.

349
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,859
Okay.

350
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,339
Sir, please confirm your name again.

351
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,260
An Bandeng.

352
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,900
An Bandeng.

353
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,420
Why does it feel so familiar?

354
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,100
How do you spell A B A N?

355
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,740
Abandon.

356
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,140
Read it 100 times from now on.

357
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,140
You unfilial son.

358
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,980
Louder.

359
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,540
Abandon.

360
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,260
Abandon.

361
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,060
Abandon.

362
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,810
Abandon.

363
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,820
Abandon.

364
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,060
An Bandeng.

365
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,220
I'll sleep in the car.

366
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,460
Qi Yue, you stay in this room.

367
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,530
Are you kidding me?

368
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,700
We want this room.

369
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,380
Okay.

370
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,420
You unfilial son, are you playing a homophonic joke with me?

371
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,380
Today,

372
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,420
I'm going to lure the snake out of its hole.

373
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Do you want to take a shower before sleeping?

374
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,540
You...

375
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,220
I...

376
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,860
I mean...

377
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,530
It's been a long day.

378
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,820
You'll be comfortable after taking a shower.

379
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,180
You go ahead.

380
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,300
I suddenly want to lie down.

381
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,460
Okay.

382
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,580
He wants to trap me.

383
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,980
He must be hiding somewhere.

384
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,530
Qi Yue.

385
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,900
What are you looking for?

386
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,900
The third eye.

387
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,820
I can't let him watch the show tonight.

388
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,340
Tonight?

389
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,940
What show?

390
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,260
I'll get the door.

391
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,780
Are you hungry?

392
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,740
I just ordered food delivery.

393
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,340
Wish you two a romantic night.

394
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,740
You call this food delivery?

395
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,100
Maybe the hotel has an event today.

396
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,700
And flowers.

397
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,580
What did you order for me?

398
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,620
You'll like it.

399
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,460
You dog.

400
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,580
Looks like

401
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,740
they should have received my secret gift.

402
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,420
Is it really okay to play with them like this?

403
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,820
How can you call it "play"?

404
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,380
Please be more precise.

405
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,900
This is called

406
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,690
”may all lovers be together."

407
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,620
People in love have their own way to be happy.

408
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,980
People without lovers

409
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,180
can only be satisfied with noodles.

410
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,700
What are you doing?

411
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,340
Eatting.

412
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,140
Thank you.

413
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,900
I want to eat this.

414
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,100
Didn't you eat it

415
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,620
an hour ago?

416
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,220
I had too much exercise today.

417
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,900
An extra meal is allowed.

418
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,970
You'll gain weight if you eat too much.

419
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,740
You'll become fat.

420
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,340
No.

421
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,740
I...

422
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,010
I'm full.

423
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,140
What's wrong?

424
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,460
What's wrong?

425
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,540
Nothing.

426
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,780
Did you sleep well, Qi Yue?

427
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,100
I'm fine, but you don't look well.

428
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,740
Not bad.

429
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,660
Just look at the world from another angle.

430
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,560
Sit tight.

431
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,370
What are you doing?

432
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,960
Relaxing massage. Blind Massage.

433
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,060
One-stop service.

434
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,110
You know how to do this?

435
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,710
Not really.

436
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,020
But I learned how to knead dough before.

437
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,860
I think they're similar.

438
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,240
Qi Shuo's live stream hasn't been updated.

439
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,380
Should we look for other clues?

440
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,850
No, let him be.

441
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,780
Are you okay?

442
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,270
Okay.

443
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,350
I've decided.

444
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,450
We don't need to find him anymore.

445
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,680
Since we are two pawns,

446
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,360
why don't we...

447
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,210
What?

448
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,410
Why not face the sea with spring blossoms?
