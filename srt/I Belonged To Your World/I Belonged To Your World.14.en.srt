[I Belonged To Your World]

3
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,780
Not bad.

4
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,780
Now,

5
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,540
you look like a scholar.

6
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,380
Me?

7
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,580
Let me tell you.

8
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,620
When I was young,

9
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,620
I was like you.

10
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,020
When I saw the word "physics",

11
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,570
I also giggled.

12
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,420
But let me tell you.

13
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,420
Doing research

14
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,380
is like sitting on a cold bench.

15
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,100
Whenever it is,

16
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,460
don't let anything distract you.

17
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,820

18
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,700
Yes, Dad.

Qi Yue. Qi Yue.

22
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,940
Why are you here at this hour of the night?

23
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,900
Did something happen?

24
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,820
Lu Xiao, I have something to tell you.

25
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,380
Go ahead.

26
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,940
When

27
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,740
will we

28
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,700
have a son?

29
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,780
Miss.

30
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,420
What did you say? I can't hear you.

31
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,220
Hello, sir.

32
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,140
I said...

33
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,540
I said you have a great son.

34
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,730
Bye. Good night.

35
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,540
Have an early night.

38

About giving birth to a son,

39
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,060
I have to tell you

40
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,820
the principle of gene mapping

41
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,250
in physics.

42
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,500
It's a long story.

43
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,780
Let's talk inside.

44
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:46,980
Hello.

45
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,860
Why are you walking so fast?

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,060
I'm trying to increase

47
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,300
the ground reaction force.

48
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,820
In fact, dating

49
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,860

50
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,380
together.

51
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,820
Let me join you.

52
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,260
Let me join you.

53
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,740
What are you doing?

54
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,660
Qi Yue.

55
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,220
What did you mean

56
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,660
last night?

57
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,290
Qi Shuo asked me

58
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,140
to tell you what I want to do

59
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,700
and important things

60
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,579
so that you can understand me.

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,500
Have you made up your mind?

62
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,140
About what?

63
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,540
We should have a son as soon as possible.

64

But

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,020
we haven't graduated from university.

66
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,420
I don't care.

67
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,380

69

70

Don't you want to know

71
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,940
what our future son looks like?

72
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,580
I'm thinking about...

73
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,460
I know you want to.

74
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,900
Let's go.

75
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140

Spring is full of life and romance.

It's the season for animals to mate.

83

Don't underestimate hydras.

86
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,780
The Tfap2 gene in them

87
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,700
can continuously transform stem cells

88

into reproductive cells.

91
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,420
You can construe it as a strong gene.

The healthier you are,

Why doesn't he look like you?

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,860
You believe in this?

111
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,700
It's not true.

112
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,020
Besides, I'm already 26 years old.

113
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,340
Girls' appearance has also been changing since childhood.

114

You're right.

115
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,060
Do you have any photos of you when you were a kid?

116

Let me see.

117
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,810
No, I don't.

118
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,060
Why would I have that kind of thing?

119
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,460
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,460
It's my fault.

121
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,980
I missed your childhood.

122
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,460
But it's okay.

123
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,010
From now on,

124
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,659
we'll make up for it.

How will you

126
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,860
make up for it?

127

This hot spring pool is so comfortable.

This is...

131

Did you lose your memory?

132

My cousin, Qi Shuo.

133
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,780
I know.

134
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,020
But

135
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,860
isn't this our date?

136
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,620
We're already here. We just have one more person.

137
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,130
And didn't we agree

138
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,900
to get used to having a son in advance?

139
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,059
When did we agree?

140
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,940
Just now. I said that.

141
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,900
You see him as our son?

142
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,020
Bro, I was forced.

143
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,540
Stop talking. Come in.

144
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,300
It's cold. Come in.

145
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,220
The water will get cold.

146
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,290
Your swimming trunks have a nice color.

147
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,780
How about

148
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,540
we tell

149
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,730
ghost stories before we sleep.

150
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,660
What ghost stories?

151
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,500
Well,

152
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,460
let me tell you the rules of the game.

153
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,580
Now the three of us

154
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,100
continuously pass this candle.

155
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,300
If the candle

156
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,180
suddenly goes out,

157
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,900
it means the ghost is here.

158
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,180
Who starts first?

159
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,020
I'll start first. I won't start.

160
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,780
Cowards step back.

161
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,180
Fine.

162
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,100
I'll set an example first.

163
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,380
Once upon a time,

164
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,300
there was a girl.

165
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,660
She just graduated,

166
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,060
so she didn't have much money.

167
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,850
She could only rent a haunted house.

168
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,020
But strange things

169
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,500
often happened

170
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,660
in that room.

171
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,060
For example,

172
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,420
the sofa suddenly sagged

173
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,620
and became how it was again.

174
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:51,140
Or the door of the fridge suddenly opened

What is it?

Are you really Qi Yue's cousin?

League?

346
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,900
Shareholders?

347
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,620
What do you mean?

348
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,580
Will you charge us fees?

349
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,100
Stop thinking about money.

350
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,420
The patient's recovery

351
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,460
is not bad.

352
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,580
But when you go back,

353
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,180
you still have to be careful of the food he can't eat.

354
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,490
Okay.

355
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,700
Don't eat spicy food.

356
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,300
Okay.

357
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,340
Stop it.

358
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,940
You may

359
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,100
be allergic to a mineral or disinfectant

360
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,820
in spring water.

361
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Disinfectant?

362
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,980
But half a month has passed.

363
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,220
Some people are like this.

364
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,740
It can last for a long period of time.

365
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,780
I've made a note on

366
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,540
how to take your medicine.

367
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,940
Thank you, Shuling.

368
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,220
It's lucky to have you here.

369
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,220
Do you have time for lunch?

370
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,500
Let's have lunch together.

371
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,300
Tomorrow?

372
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,220
Today.

373
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,020
This noon?

374
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,100
No.

375
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,860
Today is the first day of school.

376
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,380
I have to go back to the lab this afternoon.

377
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,890
Although we can't have lunch together,

378
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,540
we can spill the tea.

379
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
Tea?

380
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,180
What tea?

381
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,410
I heard you like someone.

382
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,020
Who is he? Did you tell him?

383
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,700
No.

384
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,220
Won't it be too sudden?

385
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,300
No.

386
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:10,940
Trust me.

387
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,580
What do men like the most?

388
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
They like

389
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,050
sudden romance the most.

390
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,170
It's time to remove the needle.

391
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,940
Be gentle.

392
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,500
We don't have many classes this semester.

393
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,060
You

394
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,620
are studying psychology.

395
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,260
You have theoretical foundation.

396
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,570
You

397
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,900
are studying biology. It's related.

398
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,700
As for me,

399
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,420
I'm

400
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,300
a genius of love.

401
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,100
So,

402
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,450
I plan to set up a love class

403
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,180
with you.

404
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,860
I agree.

405
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,660
I agree.

406
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,700
What?

407
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,020
What can I do?

408
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,380
You'll be in charge of the logistics.

409
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,660
Qi Shuo.

410
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,060
What?

411
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,020
You recognized me?

412
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,300
Your new look of the new semester?

413
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,700
Don't mention it.

414
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,020
We went to the hot spring together last time.

415
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,660
I'm allergic.

416
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,100
My allergies are acting up.

417
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,340
That was a date between two people.

418
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,290
The third wheel has to pay the price.

419
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,700
Why are you

420
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,380
talking like Qi Yue?

421
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,770
[Jin Pi Kang Wang]

422
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,100
Whose notebook is this?

423
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,250
[Qi Shuo]

424
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,380
Why is my name on it?

425
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,300
Maybe she was practicing calligraphy.

426
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,660
Or she likes you.

427
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,900
You're not like you now.

428
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,740
Why did you suddenly become a master of love?

429
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,810
I only found two explanations.

430
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,830
[Qi Shuo]

431
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,340
First, I'm not a master.

432
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,940
It's because you didn't notice

433
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,020
your illness and her feelings before.

434
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,490
Second,

435
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,460
although writing names is childish,

436
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,020
I did it before.

437
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,730
You did it too?

438
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,610
[Deng Shuling]

439
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,580
Are you free tonight?

440
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,730
I have something to tell you.

441
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,050
[Deng Shuling]

442
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,300
Men like sudden romance the most.

443
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,180
No.

444
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,220
She's my mother's best friend.

445
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,060
She's my aunt.

446
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,820
I need to stop her.

447
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,060
I know, Qi Yue.

448
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,340
Your slow reaction is hereditary.

449
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,140
Anyway,

450
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,090
this is

451
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,980
the whole process of how Lu Xiao and I

452
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,860
started to be in a relationship.

453
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,140
Is it appealing

454
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,460
and complicated?

455
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,490
When I have time,

456
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,610
I'll register intellectual property

457
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,860
and create a romantic drama.

458
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,900
The audience will be like you,

459
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,460
sitting here and crying.

460
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,700
What's wrong?

461
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,020
I...

462
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,380
I'm talking about romantic dramas,

463
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,100
not double acts.

464
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,260
You don't have to cooperate with me like this.

465
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,180
Qi Yue.

466
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,500
I... I broke up.

467
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,020
When did that happen?

468
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,700
Why didn't I know?

469
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,420
I was refused

470
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,460
before I told him I like him.

471
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,580
It's hot. Oh no.

472
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,940
You're love-struck.

473
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,820
I wanted to send him a message

474
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,540
and tell him I like him face to face.

475
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,340
The afternoon passed

476
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,060
and he still didn't reply.

477
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,420
Three seconds.

478
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,020
I want all of his information.

479
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,740
What do you want to do?

480
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,420
I'm going to question

481
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,180
and threaten him.

482
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,060
If it doesn't work, I'll curse him.

483
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,740
No.

484
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,970
Then I can't give you the information.

485
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,980
Why?

486
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,580
I don't want to ruin your relationship.

487
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,940
What do you mean? Do I know him?

488
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,380
My goodness.

489
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,180
Are you...

490
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,900
Deng Shuling.

491
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,660
First come, first served.

492
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,140
How could you and Lu Xiao...

493
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,140
I...

494
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,420
He's not Lu Xiao.

495
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,460
Between us, who is love-struck?

496
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,300
That's good.

497
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,460
He's Qi Shuo.

498
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,900
What?

499
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,100
That's impossible.

500
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
Why?

501
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,180
Bloody hell!

502
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,940
This is not a romantic drama.

503
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,780
This is a modern version of Thunderstorm.

504
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,980
Let me ask you.

505
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,940
Did you give a hint

506
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,020
to Deng Shuling?

507
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,930
Are you crazy?

508
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,700
She's your best friend

509
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,860
and my future godmother.

510
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,660
How could I give her any hints?

511
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,540
Right.

512
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,620
Is it because I care about her

513
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,980
and take care of her?

514
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,700
I see.

515
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,340
The philosophy teacher said

516
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,770
people's misfortune in their childhood

517
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,090
will be made up for and reflected in their future love.

518
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,980
What do you mean?

519
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,820
Think about it.

520
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,980
These days

521
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,300
you care about her and take after her.

522
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,140
It made up for the love she didn't have when she was a child.

523
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,420
So she naturally

524
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,060
fell in love with you.

525
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,340
What should I do now?

526
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,740
You can't refuse her directly.

527
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,460
You need to stimulate her self-consciousness.

528
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,020
How?

529
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,340
Just do the opposite

530
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,090
of what made she like you.

531
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,300
Get rid of

532
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,580
her affection for you.

533
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,660
It's strange.

534
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,490
How could you say that?

535
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,900
Did we change the scriptwriter this episode?

536
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,460
Don't underestimate me.

537
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,980
Why did she bite her lip?

538

[Love Class]

539
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,940
Love class?

540
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,940
People tend to lose themselves in love.

541
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,580
As the saying goes, lookers-on see most of the game.

542
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,620
That's why

543
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,490
I want to set up this love class.

544
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,220
Today, I'll mainly about

545
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,220
being neither humble nor arrogant in love.

546
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,570
No one can change your fate.

547
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,460
But love

548
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,940
can help you become a better version of yourself.

549
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,820
Qi Yue, come out!

550
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,660
What's wrong?

551
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,060
Are you here to mess around after losing to me?

552
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,580
You misunderstood.

553
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,900
It was not me.

554
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,060
Qi Yue, thank you.

555
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,500
After having your love class,

556
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,020
I successfully dated the boy I love.

557
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,460
This means the love class

558
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,500
is quite effective.

559
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,090
Yes.

560
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,540
It's indeed effective.

561
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,540
My money was swindled on the first day.

562
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,420
What?

563
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,740
You asked me

564
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,490
to open up.

565
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,340
Tell me, what should I do now?

566
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,100
I asked you to open up.

567
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,940
I didn't ask you to open your wallet.

568
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,420
Tell me.

569
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Who is that bastard?

570
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,780
It doesn't matter.

571
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,820
Just tell me how you will compensate me.

572
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,100
Who is he?

573
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,180
Tell us. Don't be afraid.

574
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,940
We will support you.

575
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,820
Yes.

576
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,090
He's Xu...

577
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,300
Is he Xu Zhaoyang?

578
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,340
What? Xu Zhaoyang?

[I Belonged To Your World]

[Judging by our appearance, we must be a family.]

581
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,780
That's vulgar.
