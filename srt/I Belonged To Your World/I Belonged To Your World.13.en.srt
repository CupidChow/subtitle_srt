Why are you all not interested in fighting with the exams?

00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,300
Have you memorized English?

00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,900
No.

Leaving everything untill the last moment.

As expected, boss is indeed the boss.

You're memorizing the script?

Don't you know?

This year's thesis review is particularly strict.

[ Episode 13 He makes it snow in the south]

34
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,050
Qi Yue, it's a good show.

35
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,700
You only have four actors and four audiences.

36
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,980
Why don't you just lei it go and play the Werewolves of Miller's Hollow?

37
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,700
Four audiences are still audiences.

38
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,060
I have an idea.

39
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,860
Maybe we can change our minds.

40
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,180
How?

41
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,620
Audience is part of the performance.

42
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,730
But there's no rule

43
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,220
the audience must be present.

44
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,660
What do you mean?

45
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,820
It means

46
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,620
the audience can see you

47
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,660
through the screen.

48
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,980
Where did you get the camera?

49
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,780
You can record it with your phone.

50
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,380
Yes, it's like filming a movie.

51

I see.

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,660
If we make a short video,

53
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,060
we must have a lot of views.

54
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,860
If it's a short video,

55
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,220
it cannot be called as a stage play.

56
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,060
You don't understand.

57
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,100
Good things should integrate with each other.

58
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,300
This is called Front Art.

59

Let's go.

68
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,180
You two take close shots.

69
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,540
You take full shots with me, okay?

70
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,580
Juliet and Romeo.

71
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,970
Are you ready?

72
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,380
OK. Three, two, one. Action.

73
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,620
Romeo.

74
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,690
Do you have anything to say to Juliet?

75
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,980
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,

76
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,930
I should adventure for such merchandise.

Qi Yue, I...

78
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,580
The line is wrong.

79
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,900
It's Juliet, not Qi Yue.

80

You're the only one from Qingnan University.

Professor, I'm here to submit my thesis.

89
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,460
Professor, someone is looking for you.

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,420
Think about it.

91
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,060
Have you revised your thesis?

92
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,900
Yes.

93
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,540
Let me see.

94
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,900
What's wrong?

95
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,900
What did the professor say?

96
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,100
Is there any drama to see?

97
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,340
No.

98
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,340
I finally know

99
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,060
why Qi Yue can't burn you.

100
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,409
She was hurt.

101
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,780
She had a burn?

102
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,540
Yes, the burn was very serious.

103
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,220
She burnt here.

104
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,260
I'm going to the infirmary.

105
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,659
Give me two minutes.

106
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,620
Watch carefully.

107
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,610
You're now the battery.

108
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,340
Qi Yue is on this end.

109
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,700
So you have to

110
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,980
run towards her

111
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,660
swiftly.

112
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,340
Understand?

113
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,140
Yes.

114
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,060
I have to confess my love to her swiftly.

115
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,980
But there's a problem.

116
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,340
If the coil

117
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,220
can't maintain between three millimetres,

118
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,820
the experiment didn't work.

119
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,460
I'll go to the infirmary to find her.

120
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,460
Qi Yue is actually very timid.

121
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,100
You just need to take her to the haunted house

122
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,659
and stand in front of her to protect her.

123
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,020
Then you can confess your love to her.

124
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,460
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

125
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,420
Don't be afraid.

127
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,860
That's it.

128
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,580
You could at least scream one time.

129
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,340
We ghosts have performance assessment.

130
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,860
Give me the mask.

131

What are you doing?

132
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,730
Wait for me.

133
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,580
What should I do now?

134
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,860
Why don't you go home?

135
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,940
Let go.

136
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,300
You have to do this.

137
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,260
When the players are chatting,

138
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,100
do the unexpected, attack the unprepared.

139
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,420
It's okay.

140
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,900
Go back and practice more.

141
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,420
Let's go.

142
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,060
Don't worry. We're experienced.

143
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,730
We'll pretend it's a broadcasting failure.

144
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,180
You come in through the right entrance.

145
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,300
And we'll play your video.

146
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,580
Is this the process?

147
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,930
How do you know that?

148
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,940
To be honest,

149
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,540
you are the third person

150
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,860
confessing love here this month.

151
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,220
Thank you.

152

You're welcome.

153
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,660
Where have you been?

154
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,010
It's been too long.

155
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,700
What's wrong?

156
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,539
I can't stand men using this trick

157
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,500
that can be seen at one glance.

158
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,940
I can't believe there're people like it.

159
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,860
I should give up this plan.

160
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,680
[I’m really sorry. Please discontinue the plan we discussed earlier.]

161
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,900
They're so efficient.

162
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,060
Is it broken?

163
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,940
Why is it dark?

164
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,620
What happened?

165
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,500
I'll go and ask.

166
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,260
Don't move.

167
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,660
Sit down. I'll go.

168
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,620
Why are you going?

169
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,980
You look so easy to be perfunctory.

170
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,100
I know this kind of trick.

00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,260
Electrostatic adsorption device.

341
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,460
Lu Xiao taught me.

342
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,420
You two.

343
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,180
One of you kicked down the ladder,

344
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,460
and the other burnt the bridge.

345
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,060
Are you the ladder or the bridge?

346
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,500
I...

347
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,660
You can't lie down even in winter vacation.

348
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,700
Turn off the TV.

349
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,220
Who cares?

350
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,500
It's time to eat. Stop playing with your phone.

351
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,940
You eat first.

352
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,420
I'm about to make a double kill.

353
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,860
Don't move! There's explosives!

354
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,580
I mean the people in the game.

355
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,500
That one is poisonous. Are you stupid?

356
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,220
Let's surround them from behind.

357
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,460
The people across me are dead.

358
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,060
All their organs are out.

359
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,740
Mom.

360
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,900
Can we eat in peace?

361
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,100
What's wrong, my dear son?

362
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,980
You look pale.

363
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,540
Are you feeling unwell?

364
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,820
Someone is knocking. I'll get it.

365
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,850
Lu Xiao, why are you here?

366
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,300
The topic for the next semester's thesis...

367
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:36,900
Lu...

368
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,540
Game is good and food is delicious.

369
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,860
Who cares about him?

370
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,380
You're not the mysterious Qi Yue.

371
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,940
You're Qi Yue, the movie queen.

372
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,940
Why hasn't he come to me yet?

373
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,580
You can throw away a big bag of trash,

374
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,980
but you have to divide it into a dozen small bags.

375
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,100
It's everyone's responsibility to classify the garbage.

376
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,220
Aren't you afraid of some neighborhood aunts?

377
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,580
You guys are taking a walk?

378
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,660
Oh my, Ms. Jin.

379
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,540
We're going to throw out the trash.

380
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
This is other waste.

381
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,780
This is kitchen waste.

382
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,380
We will perfectly classify them

383
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,540
and put them into the garbage basket.

384
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,330
Ms. Jin, take care.

385
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,300
Okay.

386
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,780
You can throw away the trash alone.

387
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,380
Why do you have to drag me along?

388
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,180
To wait for this moment to humiliate me?

389
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,620
If it wasn't for throwing the trash,

390
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,980
would you stay home all the time during the winter break?

391
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,860
You don't understand.

392
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,940
I'm happy to be fat nerd during this long and fun vacation.

393
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,060
What if we meet Lu Xiao?

394
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,900
Are you not going to clean yourself up?

395
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,100
What's wrong with me now?

396
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,540
Besides,

397
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,940
if he really likes me,

398
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,820
he will like my true self.

399
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,610
Besides,

400
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,620
it's been three days.

401
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,130
He hasn't contacted me.

402
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,940
I set up the mysterious persona first.

403
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,020
Mysterious persona?

404
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,700
You're right.

405
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,340
If I were you,

406
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,460
I would ignore Lu Xiao.

407
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,380
Why isn't it here yet? It's so far.

408
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,940
There's only one garbage station in our residential compound.

409
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,220
Did you implement

410
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,620
the policy of garbage classification properly?

411
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,500
It's the wrong way. Left.

412
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,540
No, right.

413
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,300
Are you sure there is a trash station here?

414
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,900
Of course.

415
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,900
Turn right at this intersection.

416
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,540
Hurry up.

417
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,540
Qi Shuo.

418
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,810
What?

419
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,940
Turn right here.

420
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,820
Qi Shuo.

421
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,820
Qi Shuo.

422
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,460
Qi Shuo.

423
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,420
Forget it.

424
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,340
I'll definitely throw it away tomorrow.

425
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,580
Juliet.

426
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,220
Look thou but sweet.

427
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,300
And I am proof against their enmity.

428
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,820
I wouldn't have them see you for the world.

429
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,660
Romeo.

430
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,940
Juliet!

431
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,140
Romeo.

432
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,620
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,

433
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,740
I would adventure

434
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,980
for such merchandise.

435
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,420
Juliet.

436
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,940
Whispered!

437
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,980
The yonder window breaks what is light?

438
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,380
It is the east,

439
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,180
and Juliet is the sun!

440
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,860
Romeo.

441
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,340
She speaks.

442
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,220
O, speak again, bright angel!

443
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,530
I can't control the weather,

444
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,300
but I can make snow just for you.

445
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,660
Why are you here?

446
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,620
π bond is you

447
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,380
I'm the б bond.

448
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,700
Many people say it's impossible between them.

449
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,340
But I believe there's hyperconjugation in this world.

450
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,220
We are too small in this universe.

451
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,100
Just like the dusts on the white board.

452
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
They're Invisible to the naked eyes.

453
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,980
They're insignificant.

454
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,100
But they can still be together.

455
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,700
I won't let our relationship

456
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,460
become like the Lenz's law.

457
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,820
Lai ju qu liu (An alternative expression for the Lenz's law in Chinese).

458
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,500
Since you came into my heart,

459
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,980
I won't let you leave.

460
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,940
Although

461
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,540
I don't quite understand your words.

462
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,680
[Qi Yue, will you be my girlfriend?]

463
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,900
I understand this one.

464
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,980
Qi Yue,

465
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,660
will you be my girlfriend?

466
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,730
♫The past is like an impassable gully♫

467
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,700
♫I'll never have a chance to feel your tenderness♫

468
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:56,990
♫I remember the day when you turned around and kept going♫

469
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:02,780
♫You didn't stop or look back♫

470
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,140
♫So I saw you♫

471
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,520
♫Passing through my world and taking away warm colors♫

472
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,960
♫The wind chases the clouds and surrounds you♫

473
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,910
♫Only the barren wilderness is left♫

474
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:23,390
♫You left me alone♫

475
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,110
♫But then I tried to travel♫

476
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,610
♫All over the world. But you never passed by♫

477
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,770
♫Maybe we are like ships that pass in the night♫

478
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,770
♫This love has a bad ending♫

479
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:44,660
♫We missed each other naturally♫

480
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,970
Well.

481
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
They two just started dating,

482
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,220
They've been staying together until midnight.

483
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,900
Mother wasn't home.

484
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,900
And she left her son

485
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,940
at home alone.

486
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,170
Oh no.

487
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,780
My waist.

488
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,700
Oh no.

489
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,220
Oh no!

490
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,780
I can't move.

491
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,140
Am I going to lie here all night?

492
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,820
I wish Qi Yue were home.

493
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,370
Qi Yue.

494
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,420
Why are you home?

495
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,860
The law says I can't be home at this hour?

496
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,460
Shouldn't you two

497
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,900
linger with each other now?

498
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,260
No, no lingering.

499
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,580
We were socially dead.

500
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,180
Socially dead?

501
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,540
Help me up.

502
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,900
Help me up.

503
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,700
Hold me.

504
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,810
One, two, go.

505
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,650
You're old.

506
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,500
Don't force yourself if you can't handle it.

507
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,100
Tell me how did you two socially dead?

508
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,980
I want to hear it.

509
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,420
It's a long story.

510
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,980
It's on your mouth.

511
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,860
Do you want more?

512
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,900
I'll buy you more if you want.

513
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,500
Sure.

514
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,300
What?

515
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,900
It is a behavior in love.

516
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,290
A couple should feed each other ice cream.

517
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,940
But

518
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,810
I'm allergic to mango.

519
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,770
It's totally different from what I thought.

520
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,940
Qi Yue,

521
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,140
What are we going to do?

522
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,580
Follow them.

523
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
Put your hands up here.

524
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,580
You seem like knowing everything.

525
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,500
What are you two doing?

526
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,420
Are you trying to ruin the place?

527
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,580
It hurts.

528
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,180
You don't sound like

529
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,020
a human.

530
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,180
What should I do?

531
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,900
Dating is so hard.

532
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,020
It's not a big deal.

533
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,980
Ddating is

534
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,100
two people doing boring things together.

535
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,180
He always asked me what we would do next.

536
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,020
I'm not The Book of Answers

537
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,460
He respected you.

538
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,980
You should guide him.

539
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,140
How?

540
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,380
Tell Lu Xiao what you really want to do.

541
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,260
So that he can fully understand you.

542
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,500
What I really want to do...

543
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,260
Yes.

544
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Dating

545
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,700
is to share important things

546
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,300
with each other.

547
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,250
Something important?

548
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:35,690
Yes.

549
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,340
I understand.

550
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,540
Where are you going?

551
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,020
Get changed.

552
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,260
I'll listen to you.

553
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,460
Do what I really want

554
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,620
and focus on important things.

555
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,660
Thank you, my good son.

556
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,140
She is my blood mom.

557
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,900
I'm her blood son.

558
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,810
[Are things getting better or]

559
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,820
[worse?]

560
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,500
[I Belonged To Your World]

561
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,480
[I always remember that your wish is to see the snow.]

562
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,550
Romeo, how camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?

563
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,370
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,

564
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,260
I should adventure

565
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
for such merchandise.

566
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,630
I've never seen snow

567
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,690
in my life before.

568
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,590
Qi Yue, there's no such line.

569
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,340
Do you know what my dream is?

570
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,020
What is it?

571
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,750
Have you seen the movie "Love Actually"?

572
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,060
Yes.

573
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,380
There's a classic part.

574
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,320
On a snowy day,

575
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,890
a boy used a lot of cards and confessed to a girl.

576
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,190
That's my dream.

577
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,810
I see.

578
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,870
Your dream is to see the snow.

579
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,790
What are you doing?

580
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,390
I'm snowing for you.
