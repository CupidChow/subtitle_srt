[I Belonged To Your World]

3
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,470
My mom is timid.

4
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,180
She is afraid of rats.

5
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,820
But she always competes with me for tofu pudding.

6
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,100
She likes to put peanuts she doesn't like

7
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,420
into my bowl.

8
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,860
My mom always calls me a little brat.

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,660
Little brat.

10
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,900
What's wrong?

11
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,540
Wake up.

What's wrong?

13
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,740
What's wrong?

14
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,460
What happened?

15
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,300
Did you have a nightmare?

16
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,420
It's okay. I'm here.

17
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,540
I'm your amulet.

18
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,140
I dreamed...

19
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,020
I dreamed that you were getting farther away from me

20
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,780
and disappeared in the end.

21
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,180
Where can I go?

22
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,420
Mom, get up and eat tofu pudding.

23
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,580
Today is your wedding.

24
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,180
I want to see you in a wedding dress.

25
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,260
Let's go. Don't cry.

26

Mom, I'm here.

29
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,860
Qi Shuo, why are you standing in the sea?

30
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,579
Mom.

31
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,890
I crossed mountains and seas. I did it!

32
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,540
Little brat, come back!

33
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,460
In the next life,

34
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,980
we must be a family again.

35
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,620
Come back!

36
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,940

You are awake, Qi Yue.

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,220
You're awake.

40
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,700
Be careful. Don't move.

Where is Qi Shuo?

42
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,100
Daughter, you fainted at the wedding.

43
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,340
You scared me.

44

Where's Qi Shuo?

45
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,380
You're pregnant and weak.

46
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,020
Lie down and rest.

47
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,340
Where's Qi Shuo?

48
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,980
Calm down.

49
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,220
What are you doing?

50
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,220
What are you doing?

51
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,060
Dad, I got her.

52
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,220
Be careful with your baby.

You're Deng Shuling?

Everyone is unique.

56
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,300
At least that's what I think.

57
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,250
Thank you for taking me in all this time.

58
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,580
Qi Shuo, I like you.

59
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,660
You can't like me.

60

Thank you for taking care of me.

64
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
See you.

65
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,620
He hid the truth from the beginning.

66
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,620
He probably had made up his mind before he came here.

67
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,540
He would do whatever it takes

68
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,580
to change your miserable life.

69
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,700
He did all this

70
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,340
to see you happy.

71
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,060
What do you think?

72
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,420
I think

73
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,780
this is why he came here.

74
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,820
No one can change it.

75
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,220
I'm asking if you think it's ridiculous.

76
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
This is the most interesting story I've ever heard

77
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,659
in recent years.

Can you tell me where Qi Shuo is?

83
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,780
Qi Yue, I know it's hard for you

84
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,540
to accept it.

85
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,660
When I first knew,

86
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,900
I felt the same way.

87
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,020
Please tell me

88
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,020
where Qi Shuo is.

Your fate has also been changed.

What do you mean?

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,380
He left.

95
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,180
He disappeared.

96

Disappeared?

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,580
What do you mean?

98
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,170
I see.

99
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,220
He always said

100
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,780
that I'm an incompetent mother.

101
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,900
It must be because

102
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,180
I was absent from his childhood.

103
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,260
So he's playing hide-and-seek with me now, right?

104
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,820
Honey.

105
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,860
You're up.

Today is your first day to the lab

after the wedding leave.

108

You...

109
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,060
didn't sleep all night?

110
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,180
I got up early

111
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,140
and bought some tofu pudding.

112
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,220
I didn't expect

113
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,500
a long queue every day.

114
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,250
That old lady asked me

115
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,700
why that young man didn't show up today.

116
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,140
Let me do it.

117
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,700
It's still early.

118
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,380
Although we are married,

119
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,580
I'm a heroine.

120
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,500
A heroine can not only face up to challenges,

121
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,780
but also cook.

122
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,260
Let's have breakfast.

123
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,970
This is mine.

124
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm pregnant now.

125
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,620
I have to feed myself

126
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,820
and the baby.

127
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,660
Qi Yue.

128
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,420
What's wrong?

129
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,340
Nothing.

130
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,620
You should eat more now.

131
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,140
I know what you want to say.

132
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,780
I'm an adult

133
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
and a mother of a child.

134
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,100
I should set an example for my child,

135
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,700
right?

136
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,700
People say

137
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,740
parents and children are stars in the sky.

138
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,620
So no matter what I do,

139
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,260
stars can see.

140
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,020
Of course.

141
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,780
If you live a happy life,

142
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,380
stars will be happy.

143
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,540
I'll buy a new tablecloth

144
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,420
when I come back tonight.

145
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,980
No.

146
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,220
Qi Shuo accidentally spilled

147
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,180
soy sauce on it one day.

148
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,420
Professor.

149
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,780
How's your marriage life?

150
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,620
Very good. Thank you, Professor.

151
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,260
Actually, our time travel program was aimed at

152
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,260
recruiting more young researchers

153
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,580
like you.

154
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,740
Of course,

155
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,380
in Qingnan University,

156
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,700
you first proposed the topic

157
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,260
about time travel.

158
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,860
Professor,

159
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,780
I've been thinking about

160
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,340
what I told you.

161
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,620
A time traveler may just

162
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,930
return to a parallel universe

163
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,820
instead of the universe where he came.

164
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,220
If that's the case,

165
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,700
when the time traveler returns to the past

166
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,100
and changes the past,

167
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,700
even if he just makes

168
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,900
a slightly different choice from the future,

169
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,820
there will be

170
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,620
a new parallel universe.

171
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,980
And things in his original universe

172
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,420
remain unchanged.

173
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,580
