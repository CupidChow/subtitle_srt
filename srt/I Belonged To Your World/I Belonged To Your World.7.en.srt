If the professor sees us,

both of us will suffer a lot.

I'll take a look in the mirror. Okay?

Nothing.

37

If nothing happened, I'll change my surname to yours.

38

Well, my surname is also Qi.

your lipstick

48

was strawberry-flavored?

49
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,300
No girls would use a five-spices-flavored lipstick.

50

That's not what I meant.

when you two were alone,

53

did you have any

64

always show up by his side,

Yes.

72

Next?

77

You should figure it out yourself next.

78

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,820
Tomorrow morning,

174
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,700
wait for him in front of his dorm building.

175
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,660
Whether he really has an appointment or he doesn't want to see you,

176
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,100
you'll know it after you go and have a look.

177
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,890
Okay.

178
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,620
Boss.

179
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,420
Give me ten more skewers of big kidneys.

180
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,490
Okay.

181
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,820
Aren't you a weak girl?

182
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,690
[School of Mechatronic Engineering]

183
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,850
Hello, Grandma.

184
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,740
I'm fine.

185
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,900
How have you been lately?

186
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,730
Have you received the hand warmer I bought for you

187
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,260
last time?

188
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,660
Let's walk together.

189
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,690
I'm talking with my grandma on the phone.

190
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,340
Someone asked him out before me.

191
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,940
Say hello.

192
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,620
Hello, Grandma. I'm Yufei.

193
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,100
Qi Yue.

194
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,580
Are you here for me?

195
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,380
No, Zhaoyang. I have something to do.

196
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,900
You seem to be avoiding me all the time.

197
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,940
No. It's just that I've been busy recently.

198
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,620
I think

199
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,650
you have a deep misunderstanding about me,

200
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,860
so I have to spend some time

201
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,820
explaining it clearly to you.

202
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,060
There's no need to do this between us.

203
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,340
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

204
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,300
Let's go to the canteen together.

205
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,500
Let's go.

206
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,300
Go.

207
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,730
The truth is just as what I've said.

208
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,660
So you totally misunderstood me.

209
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,340
Do you know that?

210
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,420
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,140
I was distracted.

212
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,220
What were you talking about?

213
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,850
For the gift you gave me,

214
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,860
I've redeemed it.

215
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,980
What do you mean by redeeming it?

216
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,900
Come here to eat with us.

217
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,020
Come on.

218
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,340
She is the cute girl I've always

219
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,940
mentioned to you.

220
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,500
Qi Yue.

221
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:07,860
Bro,

222
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,700
I'm sorry for

223
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,500
what happened last time.

224
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,460
What was it?

225
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,340
Well,

226
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,460
I was short of money,

227
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,900
and I sold your stuff.

228
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,580
It's not a big deal. Let me tell you.

229
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,300
From now on, if you have any trouble, just tell me.

230
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,010
I'll help you.

231
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,100
We're brothers. Just ask me for help.

232
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,700
Got it.

233
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,420
I need to go to class.

234
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,100
I have to go.

235
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,140
Okay. Just go.

236
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,350
Without him,

237
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,620
I wouldn't be able to clear my name.

238
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,180
You told people about my name everywhere.

239
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,580
Did you ask for my permission?

240
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,900
Well, they kept asking me

241
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,460
who the cute little girl was.

242
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,890
It was hard for me to refuse,

243
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,820
so I told them.

244
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,700
Lu Xiao.

245
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,740
Look at me.

246
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,100
What?

247
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,380
I've just learned this magic.

248
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,620
You're amazing.

249
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,220
You saw through trick.

250
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,500
You're indeed a genius in study.

251
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,500
It doesn't taste that bad, does it?

252
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,220
It looks bad.

253
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,940
Here you are.

254
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,420
I'm full.

255
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,300
The guy who followed you

256
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,060
won't show up.

257
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,140
I can end my mission to protect you, right?

258
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,260
It seems he's over there.

259
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,500
It's okay.

260
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,810
He won't do anything in broad daylight.

261
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,850
I'm going back to have class.

262
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,710
What are you doing at noon?

263
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,100
Preparing for the Winter Olympics?

264
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,860
You're doing sports so intensely.

265
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,100
If the heroine in the TV drama

266
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,700
broke up with her boyfriend,

267
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,140
she would try to sweat a lot

268
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,060
in the gym, wouldn't she?

269
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,020
You broke up with your boyfriend?

270
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,300
You don't even have a boyfriend, okay?

271
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,740
Did you do everything as I had said?

272
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,700
Don't mention it.

273
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
He isn't as nervous as a spinning basketball.

274
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Obviously, he is having fun with Liang Yufei.

275
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,660
Do you mean

276
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,090
this?

277
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,220
At this point,

278
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,980
you still performed such a boring magic trick?

279
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,460
She merely performed a small magic trick,

280
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,530
and you think of it as intimate contact.

281
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,980
You... You saw it.

282
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,100
Why didn't you stop it?

283
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,940
Which side are you on?

284
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,820
She merely performed a magic trick to her classmate.

285
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,860
How could I stop it?

286
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
If they were only schoolmates, would she perform a magic trick like this?

287
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,060
This is obviously a hint.

288
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,300
You even helped the enemy.

289
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,380
I think now you should

290
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,780
go to get even with Lu Xiao,

291
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,380
instead of being upset here.

292
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,900
Okay.

293
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,020
I'll go and question him now.

294
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,860
How should I ask him?

295
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,780
By asking him out.

296
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
How?

297
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,090
I thought you didn't need me.

298
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,900
Of course you can't catch the chance

299
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
like holding the collar.

300
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,460
For such a good opportunity, you must seize it.

301
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,580
How?

302
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,940
Well, tonight,

303
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,170
the SHAN YU HAI Restaurant.

304
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,940
I'll ask him out.

305
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,100
Let's meet there.

306
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,340
By then, don't say that I'm a bad son again, okay?

307
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,620
Now,

308
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,700
I'm very angry.

309
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,380
Don't provoke me.

310
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,660
Good son.

311
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,460
Son, be good.

312
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,490
I'm going to take a shower.

313
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,140
Which of us actually provoked the other?

314
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,500
Bro, even if my foot was bitten by bugs,

315
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,770
it's not necessary to wrap it with such thick bandages, right?

316
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,500
You need to take precautions in advance

317
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,660
to prevent the worst.

318
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,380
What about the city basketball match?

319
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,620
I'm just messing around.

320
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,620
I probably won't be selected.

321
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,300
Such a good opportunity

322
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,060
should belong to you.

323
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,700
Have we taken the wrong path?

324
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,310
It is the downstairs of the girls' dorm, isn't it?

325
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,370
You've hurt your foot, haven't you?

326
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,580
You need to exercise more.

327
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,220
We've taken the right path.

328
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,340
What a coincidence, Qi Yue.

329
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,020
Come on. Here you are.

330
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,380
Thank you.

331
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,900
What are you doing?

332
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,260
He hurt his leg, didn't he?

333
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,220
He can't participate in the city basketball league match,

334
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,340
so I came out with him for a walk.

335
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,980
It looks serious.

336
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,340
I hope you can get recovered soon.

337
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,810
Thank you.

338
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
So, I'll go back now.

339
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,220

is transmitted at the speed of light.

342
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,340
For example, the gravitational field of the solar system is a feeble field.

343
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,610
The gravitational field around a black hole is a strong field.

Why is that?

345

You've been absent-minded lately.

Sorry, Professor. I was

distracted.

for the question you mentioned just now,

360
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,900
I wonder whether

361
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,180
there's also a strong or weak gravitational field between people.

362

Whose message did you receive just now?

Then I would hide here.

502
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,300
I would bend over

503

that oily table to do my homework.

504
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,300
The next day,

505
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,140
the teacher would ask me to go to the platform and criticize me.

506

Because it was the same to me.

511
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,860
But

512
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,530
maybe the way family express love

513
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,500
is different.

514
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:08,900
Right.

515
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,340
Sometimes I think it's strange.

516
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,700
Why would a closer one be

517
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,140
more indifferent sometimes?

518
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,860
It's like he'd rather give all his love to others

519
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,340
than bring it to his family.

520
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,780
Sometimes I wonder

521
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,180
why I'm not strong enough.

522
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,220
If I'm strong enough,

523
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,660
I can take my mom away from that person.

524
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:25,900
Zhaoyang.

525
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,650
Don't blame yourself.

526
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,100
It's not your fault.

527
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,700
Just eat.

528
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,380
The noodles are getting soggy.

529
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,420
In the past,

530
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,770
I didn't know you well.

531
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,260
But after hearing what you said,

532
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,020
my opinion about you

533
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,820
did change.

534
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,820
I'm not good at talking.

535
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,460
Anyway,

536
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,940
you will achieve

537
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,860
what you want to do.

538
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,220
No more words.

539
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,530
All the words are represented by the milk.

540
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,770
Just eat.

541
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,820
Did you go on a date or get a drink?

542
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,340
How much did you drink?

543
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,140
A bottle.

544
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,980
A bottle of white wine?

545
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,860
Amazing, Lu.

546
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,220
I admire you.

547
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,020
A bottle of

548
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,810
beer.

549
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,460
No!

550
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,180
A can.

551
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,020
After drinking a can of beer,

552
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,610
you're so drunk like this?

553
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
I take back what I said.

554
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,060
What do you take back?

555
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,420
You didn't even reply to my WeChat messages.

556
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,900
You didn't send me WeChat messages.

557
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
Have you forgotten?

558
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,940
A woman's heart is like the needle at the bottom of a deep ocean.

559
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,700
Why did you drink so much if you can't drink?

560
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,860
What have I done wrong to suffer this?

561
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,260
I'm the one who is suffering.

562
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,660
Give me back my first kiss.

563
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,620
First kiss?

564
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,700
Please. Please.

565
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,860
With whom?

566
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
What else besides your first kiss?

567
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,660
You're not strawberry-flavored.

568
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,620
You're not strawberry-flavored, either.

569
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,220
Stand up.

570
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,220
Please. Please.

571
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,420
What?

572
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,460
Why are your pajamas...

573
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,050
You need to change the hobby of wearing pajamas

574
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,690
inside a bathrobe.

575
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,620
What new fashion is this?

576
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,460
I'm afraid of making my pajamas dirty.

577
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
Why are you back at this hour?

578
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,380
Your Lu Xiao

579
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,540
stood me up.

580
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,380
Lu Xiao...

581
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,060
He didn't go?

582
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,900
Then why are you back so late?

583
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,220
I was hungry, too.

584
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,420
None of you loves me.

585
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,820
I have to love myself.

586
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,460
Either You or Lu Xiao

587
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,180
is a bad teammate.

588
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,780
What true love?

589
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,860
He's not my destined one.

590
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,380
Did you

591
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,450
eat alone?

592
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,900
Of course.

593
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,260
I...

594
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,500
I just don't understand.

595
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,490
Is Lu Xiao really the right person?

596
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,900
For others,

597
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,780
the future is unknown.

598
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,900
But for you,

599
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,090
Lu Xiao is already there.

600
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,420
The answer is obvious.

601
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,980
But why does it have to be him?

602
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,140
Because this is fate.

603
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,290
He is and is the only one.

604
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,460
How can you be so sure?

605
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,780
I can be sure that

606
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,420
if you're up to something,

608
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,490
I can only use tough tactics.

609
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,980
No.

610
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,460
I was just asking.

611
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,940
Alright. It's my birthday tomorrow.

612

Remember to invite him over for dinner.

It's November.
