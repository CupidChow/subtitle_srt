00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,420
Bye.

173
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,970
Trust me.

174
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,580
Okay? Trust me.

175
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:28,810
Bye.

176
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,220
Bye.

177
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,540
Eat well, son.

178
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,580
Okay, okay.

179
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,100
Dad, I'm at my classmate's house.

180
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,500
Did you go to the wrong door again?

181
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,220
No.

182
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,740
Isn't this the sixth floor?

183
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,970
It is.

184
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,220
Uncle.

185
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,260
Uncle, I'm Qi Yue's classmate.

186
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,140
I'm Lu Xiao.

187
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,980
Aren't you Yue's boyfriend?

188
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,500
We had a meal together.

189
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,340
You are young but forgetful.

190
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,220
Come in.

191
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,700
Mr. Qi,

192
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,260
you are not going back to the company this afternoon, right?

193
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,060
Mr. Wang from Boyue came to visit you.

194
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,420
Who is he?

195
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,220
You met him at the forum last time.

196
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,580
I saw him last time?

197
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,020
Yes.

198
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,580
Take care of him.

199
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,220
OK, Mr. Qi.

200
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,980
Bye.

201
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,250
You are...

202
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,980
Uncle, my name is Lu Xiao.

203
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,780
I'm asking if you want tea or wine.

204
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,770
It's okay, uncle. I'm not thirsty.

205
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,460
I'm just afraid that you can't remember me.

206
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,180
I remember you.

207
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,980
You are 188cm tall and at the same age as Yue.

208
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,060
You major in physics, and your dad is a teacher.

209
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,980
Your home is at No. 51 Anzhen Road in Linjiang District.

210
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,100
You remember it so clearly.

211
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,580
Yes.

212
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,620
I haven't forgotten, have I?

213
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,700
I understand you young people.

214
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,100
But let me tell you,

215
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,380
I was more nervous than you

216
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,580
when I first went to the house of Yue's mother.

217
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,860
You remember what happened so long ago?

218
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,460
Yes.

219
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,460
Every memory is precious.

220
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,340
It can't be lost.

221
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,340
But

222
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,860
why are you acting weird today?

223
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,340
It's because they said you...

224
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,740
What did Yue say about me?

225
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,580
What did they say?

226
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,580
They said you have Alzheimer's disease.

227
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,780
That brat.

228
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,580
How could she say that about her father?

229
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,390
You just said "they".

230
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,390
Who are they?

231
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,020
Qi Shuo.

232
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,830
Her tutor.

233
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,330
Her cousin.

234
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,430
Who is he?

235
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,950
That brat.

236
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,010
She said I have Alzheimer's disease.

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,530
And she lied to me about her tutor.

238
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,590
Tutor?

239
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,600
Alzheimer's disease?

240
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,370
Oh no.

241
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,470
He knows.

242
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,080
Come out! You brat.

243
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,320
You won't come out?

244
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,330
Fine. I'll teach you a lesson when you come home.

245
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,830
Do we know each other?

246
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,090
No.

247
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,890
But I believe

248
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,030
we will become good friends soon.

249
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,430
Although I'm her cousin,

250
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,530
don't you feel uncomfortable

251
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,700
if your girlfriend

252
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,790
lives with a man every day?

253
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,600
You're here.

254
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,430
Why didn't you answer my call?

255
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,790
My phone died.

256
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,680
I went to my friend's house.

257
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,150
Have you eaten?

258
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,560
Did you go to Qi Shuo's place?

259
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,730
I was worried that he's not used to living alone.

260
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,820
And I didn't want you to worry.

261
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,790
That's why I didn't tell you.

262
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,510
You went to your cousin's house.

263
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,730
Why should I worry?

264
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,570
Unless he's not your cousin.

265
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,270
What are you talking about?

266
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,160
Qi Yue.

267
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,410
There is a scientific theory in biology

268
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,300
called feedback loop.

269
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,400
In life, it generally means

270
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,920
when something happens,

271
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,020
the same thing will happen again

272
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,360
and will happen faster.

273
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,920
It's like someone subconsciously uses a lie

274
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,890
to patch up another lie.

275
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,400
But it's only snowballing.

276
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,960
It will only make things worse.

277
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,690
Yes.

278
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,550
I lied to you.

279
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,370
My dad didn't have

280
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,590
Alzheimer's disease.

281
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,970
I just don't want you to see

282
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,530
I have a cold-hearted father.

283
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,130
That's why I said that.

284
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,690
Your father is not cold-hearted at all.

285
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,490
He cares about you

286
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,710
and remembers everything about you,

287
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,520
including your tutor, Qi Shuo.

288
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,090
Tutor?

289
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,660
What tutor? Who said that?

290
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,250
Qi Yue.

291
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,160
Why did you lie to me?

292
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,260
I told you.

293
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,890
I lied about my dad.

294
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,280
Who is Qi Shuo exactly?

295
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,040
Why?

296
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,010
If he is your admirer,

297
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,230
why did he try so hard

298
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,490
to let us be together?

299
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,040
If he is really your cousin,

300
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,760
why doesn't your father

301
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,360
know him at all?

302
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,480
Qi Shuo

303
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,590
is my cousin.

304
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,490
Qi Yue, I find that I don't know you at all.

305
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,670
I think trust is the basis

306
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,800
for two people to be together.

307
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,480
I never doubted you.

308
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,160
But you don't seem to believe me.

309
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,440
I've always trusted you.

310
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,110
Qi Yue.

311
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,500
Did you conspire together to trick me

312
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,100
from the beginning?

313
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,300
I know.

314
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,230
Have a good rest.

315
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,080
Goodbye.

316
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,060
Qi Shuo is our son.

317
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,860
What are you talking about?

318
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,340
He came

319
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,270
from 30 years later

320
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,330
through a time machine.

321
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,920
What did you say?

322
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,700
Shuling.

323
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,590
Dr. Han.

324
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,430
Why did you get off work so early today?

325
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,360
Let's walk together.

326
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,740
Okay.

327
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,990
Not everything can be predicted.

328
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,290
Is it right or wrong?

329
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,310
That's it.

330
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,130
The time travel you expect

331
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,850
[DNA Identification of Qi Yue and Qi Shuo]

332
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,850
will be realized in 30 years.

333
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,860
[The probability of being his mother is 99.9999%.]

334
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,990
The first one to experience it

335
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,630
is our future son.

336
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,780
There is an official seal. It's legal.

337
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,980
You said

338
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,590
Qi Shuo is our

339
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:10,970
son?

340
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,510
I know it sounds absurd.

341
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,150
When I first heard it from Qi Shuo,

342
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,370
my reaction was exactly like yours.

343
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,420
You also mentioned

344
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,660
a time machine.

345
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,460
Yes.

346
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,150
How is that possible?

347
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,750
Time travel can only send people

348
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,850
to someone else's future.

349
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,540
There is no theoretical logic like going back.

350
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,760
And all this

351
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,900
is just a fantasy experiment.

352
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,770
But that's the truth.

353
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:48,970
Okay.

354
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:49,390
Well.

355
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,380
Even if he really came back

356
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,970
from 30 years later,

357
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,110
why did he do that?

358
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,930
He told me

359
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,480
to pursue you again

360
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,830
to change fate.

361
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,750
Change whose fate?

362
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,260
Mine.

363
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,890
So,

364
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,750
he arranged all this?

365
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,980
You pursued me and stay with me

366
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,500
just to change your fate?

367
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,109
That's true.

368
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,040
But not really true.

369
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,089
Well.

370
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,450
It was like this at first.

371
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,430
But later,

372
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,170
my love for you has nothing to do with others.

373
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,310
It has nothing to do with that stupid fate either.

374
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,230
Faster than the speed of light. Shrinkage.

375
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,910
The Casimir effect.

376
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,380
I know it's hard for you to accept this.

377
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,120
Qi Yue,

378
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,840
you said a lot today.

379
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,180
I don't know what your purpose is,

380
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,740
but I really can't accept it.

381
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,100
What purpose can I have?

382
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,310
You saw it

383
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,530
with your own eyes.

384
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,460
I think

385
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,140
I'll go back first.

386
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,800
I knew it.

387
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,660
We all believe that one day,

388
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,670
humans will realize time travel.

389
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,870
We meet again.

390
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,790
You are

391
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,090
Qi Yue's cousin?

392
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,640
Yes.

393
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,080
Lu Xiao,

394
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,640
I have something to ask you.

395
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,210
When will we have a son?

396
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,470
But he's not your son.

397
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,860
You're not his mother either.

398
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,290
Don't you want to know

399
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,300
what our future son looks like?

400
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,320
Didn't we agree

401
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,710
to get used to a life with a son

402
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,800
in advance?

403
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,760
You came to me at this time

404
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,690
because of time travel?

405
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,750
Professor, I'm really sorry

406
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,800
to bother you at this time.

407
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,690
But this is really important to me.

408
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,800
You know

409
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,060
time and space can't be separated

410
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,780
in time travel.

411
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,460
I know.

412
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,350
But according to the Theory of Relativity,

413
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,530
if humans can really go faster than the speed of light,

414
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,680
maybe we can go back to the past.

415
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,180
Is that so?

416
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,280
This theory

417
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,040
is contradictory.

418
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,350
They just overturned the theory.

419
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,830
You said "they"?

420
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,360
Yes. There is a group of elite scientists

421
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,870
in the cutting-edge science field

422
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,220
studying this topic.

423
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,850
I think

424
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,500
maybe in 30 years,

425
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,570
humans can really realize time travel.

426
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,620
30 years?

427
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,370
They can not only go to the future,

428
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,090
but also go back to the past

429
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,110
to change fate.

430
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,000
What you said is great.

431
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,980
Your confidence is needed in the scientific research field.

432
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,670
Just a guess, Professor.

433
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,530
I need to explain it to her.

434
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,730
[Institute of Oncology  Senior Ward Building]

435
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,900
Maybe I should tell her after she gets off work.

436
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,710
Will it affect her work now?

437
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,250
Xu Zhaoyang.

438
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,000
Why is he following Aunt Shuling?

439
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,990
Why isn't he answering my call?

440
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,680
Qi Shuo.

441
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,140
Qi Shuo.

442
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,590
There is medical trouble on the second floor. Come quickly.

443
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,510
Hurry up.

444
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,550
Just go. Stop looking.

445
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,390
I heard that a college student

446
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,780
stabbed a nurse with a knife.

447
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,080
Although this report

448
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,850
is from a private identification center,

449
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,360
according to Mendel's Laws of Inheritance

450
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,790
and test results,

451
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,470
Qi Shuo's genetic type

452
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,690
coincides with Qi Yue's genetic condition.

453
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,620
The parental probability is 99.99%.

454
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,720
It meets the criteria of DNA tests.

455
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,600
Xu Zhaoyang.

456
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,080
Qi Shuo.

457
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,430
What are you doing?

458
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,780
Deng Shuling.

459
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,160
Damn you!

460
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,350
Stop fighting!

461
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,140
Just go.

462
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,860
Stop looking.

463
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,020
Mr. Xu.

464
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,340
I'm sorry.

465
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,390
He...

466
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,620
He's my friend.

467
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,840
Well.

468
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,810
Shouldn't he take legal responsibility

469
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,410
for assaulting people randomly?

470
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,330
I apologize to you.

471
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,010
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,730
What's the use of the police if an apology is useful?

473
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,670
I'll pay for your medical bills.

474
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,240
As a medical worker,

475
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,180
shouldn't you deal with your love issue

476
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,770
first?

477
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

478
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,670
It's my fault.

479
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,360
[Don't be angry.]

480
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,700
Thank you for dealing with my wound.

481
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,080
I'll just pretend that

482
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,170
nothing happened today.

483
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,370
But you should take care of him in the future.

484
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,170
I'm speechless.

485
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,390
Do you believe me now?

486
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,560
I didn't lie.

487
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,830
Why are you here?

488
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,560
I'm looking for Qi Shuo.

489
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,910
You know he's here?

490
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,980
Now

491
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,880
I might need to explain it with telepathy between a mother and a son.

492
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,980
Does Qi Shuo

493
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,080
always fight with others

494
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,250
for no reason?

495
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,660
He just doesn't like Xu Zhaoyang.

496
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,350
If I don't like someone,

497
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,320
I should stay away from him

498
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,030
instead of

499
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,540
fighting.

500
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,820
You still don't believe me, do you?

501
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,620
I'm not.

502
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,080
I understand.

503
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,280
Everyone needs time to accept it.

504
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,880
A 25-year-old man

505
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,730
suddenly stood in front of you

506
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,490
to tell you that he is your son.

507
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,770
Everyone has to convince himself.

508
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,970
Is there a party in the hospital today?

509
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,270
Why are you all here?

510
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,500
He knows everything.

511
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,970
Know what?

512
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,370
Everything.

513
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,320
If you're free later,

514
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,000
let's go home and watch a movie.

515
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:31,670
He...

516
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,870
A family should be together.

517
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,890
Wait.

518
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,570
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

519
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,580
Why didn't you answer my call?

520
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,590
He knows everything?

521
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,640
Yes.

522
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,740
Including I came here from 30 years later?

523
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,370
Yes.

524
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,590
Including I'm your son?

525
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,600
Of course.

526
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,120
What do you think "everything" means?

527
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,220
Then why is he so calm?

528
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,000
This may be the style of a mature man.

529
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,330
Why didn't you inherit

530
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,050
his excellent genes?

531
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,110
Silly son.

532
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,960
You...

533
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,190
You call this maturity?

534
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,780
What a day.

535
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,590
Come on, what do you want to watch?

536
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:30,890
About Time.

537
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,600
Dune.

538
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,680
I thought you like science fiction films.

539
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,020
Why do you think so?

540
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,290
Now, the minority obeys the majority.

541
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,080
The margarine in popcorn

542
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,510
contains trans-fatty acids.

543
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,610
Eating too much will increase the risk of the coronary heart disease.

544
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,800
Just some popcorn.

545
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,820
Why are you so serious?

546
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,420
They do have much in common.

547
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,960
But is he really my son?

548
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,850
Enjoy your life, son.

549
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,510
You really have inherited my genes.

550
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,830
Why aren't you crying?

551
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,570
Why should I cry?

552
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,380
Why do you always cry?

553
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,990
Aren't you the same?

554
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,070
We travel in time

555
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,450
as we live our life every day.

556
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,480
What we can do is to do our best

557
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,700
to cherish

558
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,590
this extraordinary journey of life.

559
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,770
Look.

560
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,580
The leading actor in the movie also went back through time travel

561
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,430
to change many things.

562
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,360
Isn't this what we're experiencing now?

563
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,990
Yes.

564
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,590
The movie says love can't be changed.

565
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,200
So you and Lu Xiao are destined lovers.

566
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,260
So we must do like they do in the movie.

567
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,970
You should cherish this journey.

568
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,230
Cherish me and Lu Xiao.

569
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,710
Although

570
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,470
we will meet in the future,

571
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,740
why do I suddenly feel

572
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,470
I can't bear to part with you?

573
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,480
It's okay.

574
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,150
Don't cry.

575
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,360
Where's Lu Xiao?

576
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,520
Did you cry stealthily in the bathroom?

577
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,410
Yes.

578
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,430
I'm always slow.

579
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,350
Lu Xiao,

580
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,660
I know it's hard for you to accept all this now.

581
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,040
But that's the truth.

582
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,020
We are destined to be together.

583
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,280
Destined?

584
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,720
How about

585
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,230
you start to know each other

586
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,540
with your new identities now?

587
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,260
How?

588
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,690
You decide.

589
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:26,900
I...

590
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,180
I don't have a clue.

591
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,110
But

592
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,750
like you said,

593
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,510
a family

594
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,450
should be together no matter what.

595
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,860
Allow me.

596
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,640
My future husband.

597
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,200
This is my future son.

598
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,240
Hello.

599
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,590
Her future husband.

600
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,640
Hello.

601
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,480
My future...

602
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:03,860
son.

603
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,910
Please read carefully before donating your blood

604
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,260
and answer all the questions in the questionnaire.

605
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,790
There are so many questions on it.

606
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,850
Do you all know someone

607
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,190
through this kind of charity project?

608
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,040
That is so strange.

609
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,800
Any other questions?

610
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,490
No.

611
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,310
Are you okay?

612
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,440
I...

613
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,380
I have a phobia about needles.

614
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,430
In that case,

615
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,060
we shouldn't donate blood.

616
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,950
If an adult donates 400 ml of blood a year,

617
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,250
it will stimulate the hemopoiesis function of bone marrow

618
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,340
and create new blood.

619
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,390
In that case,

620
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,820
this should become our family tradition.

621
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,980
Do you know your blood type?

622
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,900
Yes. O.

623
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:48,970
It suddenly occurs to me that

624
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,850
I have something to do in the lab.

625
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,650
I need to go back.

626
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,830
I'll go to the lab with you.

627
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,280
I have gastroenteritis again.

628
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,160
I need to go to the bathroom.

629
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,170
I'll go to the bathroom with you first.

630
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,220
We'll donate blood when we're back.

631
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,570
I see.

632
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,590
You still don't want to accept the fact.

633
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,500
I'm not.

634
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,670
My blood type is O.

635
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,970
Your blood type is AB.

636
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,560
Qi Shuo.

637
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,210
I'm 2B.

638
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,240
Go for a blood test if you don't believe me.

639
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,160
-I'm not going. -I'm not going.

640
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,910
Look.

641
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,880
You two are exactly the same.

642
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:45,040
[Yulin Ueno Bookstore]

643
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,840
Hello, madam.

644
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,860
Your Americano.

645
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,850
With so much sugar,

646
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,110
aren't you afraid of diabetes?

647
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,050
It's too bitter. Can't I put in some sugar?

648
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,910
Why are you mad at me?

649
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,820
Lu Xiao doesn't believe me.

650
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,590
He just doesn't want to be with me.

651
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,280
No matter

652
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,240
who it is,

653
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,010
he won't believe it right away, right?

654
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,520
But why do I believe it?

655
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,620
Are you sure?

656
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,300
Did you forgot the ancient way of

657
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,430
mixing blood to see if people are related?

658
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,760
Besides, with his current topic, Lu Xiao has 10,000 ways

659
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,610
to verify the feasibility

660
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,160
of time travel.

661
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,480
Then why does he still suspect it?

662
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,580
Because he also has emotions apart from theories.

663
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,670
Emotionally,

664
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,360
if a son seven years older than him suddenly appeared

665
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,990
and told you

666
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,710
you had to pursue him to change your fate,

667
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,520
no one would believe it

668
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,990
immediately

669
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,040
and remain calm in his heart.

670
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,230
That's true.

671
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,740
Of course.

672
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,470
It means he values your relationship

673
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,270
and your future.

674
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,550
According to what you said,

675
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,690
I'm quite happy.

676
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,630
Do you remember the line in About Time?

677
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,660
Live every day carefully and enjoy every day.

678
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:09,920
Take every day

679
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,100
as the last day of an ordinary life.

680
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,510
I'll send him a WeChat message to apologize.

681
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,640
Don't.

682
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,950
I'm his son.

683
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,880
I know him better.

684
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,760
I'll talk to him.

685
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,100
Are you okay?

686
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,450
I'm fine.

687
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,370
Don't you have anything

688
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,390
to ask me?

689
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:48,850
I have.

690
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,020
If

691
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,040
I didn't throw it out,

692
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,600
the chain wouldn't have fallen, right?

693
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,710
What kind of boring question is this?

694
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,390
Even if we go back to the past,

695
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,620
we can't change what will happen next.

696
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,300
But if you didn't put this chain

697
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,390
into this cup,

698
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,150
the experiment would no longer exist.

699
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,880
Everything happens for a reason.

700
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,020
There are reasons for the reason.

701
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,780
There is no end to it.

702
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,540
Everything

703
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,300
has been decided

704
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,480
in the beginning.

705
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,990
You theorists are so annoying.

706
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,750
Professor.

707
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,050
This is the book I told you before.

708
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,660
[Isaac Asimov: The End of Eternity]

709
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,900
Even a famous science fiction writer

710
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,160
like Isaac Asimov

711
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,420
couldn't explain

712
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,280
the grandfather paradox caused by time travel.

713
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,640
You just made Qi Yue angry.

714
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,350
Do you know that?

715
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,210
If I went back to two hours ago,

716
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,720
would Qi Yue not be angry?

717
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,740
Or no matter what I do,

718
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,830
nothing will change.

719
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,480
What's wrong with you today?

720
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,220
Professor,

721
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,110
I'm not feeling well today.

722
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,790
I want to go back and read this book.

723
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,590
Okay, go.

724
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,040
Why are you two

725
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,470
studying time travel all of a sudden?

726
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,790
It looks like there are many talented people for future scientific undertakings.

727
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,010
Professor, I'm flattered.

728
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,810
I just...

729
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,280
We're not professional.

730
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:10,489
Excuse me.

731
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,969
It won't take too much time

732
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,909
for Lu Xiao to figure out the truth.

733
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,730
I'd better tell him everything.

734
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,730
Aunt Shuling.

735
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,990
I'll pick you up after work.

736
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,800
Did you eat vitamins?

737
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,900
I threw away your instant noodles.

738
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,830
Tuantuan peed in my house again.

739
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,670
Did you eat vitamins?

740
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,190
I threw away your instant noodles.

741
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,310
Tuantuan peed in my house again.

742
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,600
I'll pick you up after work.

743
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,000
Did you eat vitamins?

744
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,010
I threw away your instant noodles.

745
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,030
Tuantuan peed in my house again.

746
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,800
Did you eat vitamins?

747
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,190
I threw away your instant noodles.

748
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,250
Tuantuan peed in my house again.

[I Belonged To Your World]

750
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,370
[If I can't walk you home, no street lamps should be broken.]

751
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,800
Come and take a look.

752
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,530
This lamp here

753
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,500
doesn't work.

754
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,420
Is it for decoration?

755
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,650
This door is forbidden.

756
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,870
No one usually comes here.

757
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,040
Isn't it a waste of power

758
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:00,880
if the lamp is on?

759
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,690
But we paid property management fees.

760
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,020
Besides,

761
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,800
it's dark and unsafe.

762
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,970
If you make it work,

763
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,690
you can light up the way home for others.

764
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm just a property management staff member,

765
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,640
not a philanthropist.

residents...

00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,280
Don't.

772
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,720
It's just a piece of cake.

773
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,270
I'll turn on the light for you.
