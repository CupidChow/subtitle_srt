00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,770
Didn't you always say

175
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,820
his family members haven't been with him since he was young?

176
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,700
In my opinion,

177
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,420
you can give him a family photo.

178
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,340
A family photo?

179
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,420
This is good.

180
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,100
That's it.

181
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,180
Qi Yue.

182
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,220
Zhaoyang.

183
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,300
Well,

184
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,100
what do you think of me?

185
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,730
I've been waiting for you downstairs for a long time.

186
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,700
I have a lot to tell you.

187
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,900
But I don't know what to say when I see you.

188
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,860
Then don't say anything.

189
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
No, Qi Yue.

190
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,570
I like you.

191
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,900
Can you be my girlfriend?

192
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,650
Bro,

193
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,650
can you spare my life?

194
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,860
I'm confessing my love to you.

195
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,420
I'm not blackmailing you.

196
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,940
Anyway,

197
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,020
thank you for your love.

198
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
But I have something to do

199
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,060
and I have someone I like.

200
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,260
It's Lu Xiao, right?

201
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,340
Why him?

202
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,100
I guess it's fate.

203
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,900
You won't understand.

204
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,740
You don't have to use fate as an excuse

205
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,660
to refuse me.

206
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,500
Anyway, you are a good guy.

207
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,820
But we'd better be strangers from now on.

208
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,660
[Prescription: Lu Xiao Stomachache]

209
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,780
You're sick?

210
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,140
You should take your medicine.

211
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,300
I'll help you ask the professor for leave.

212
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,980
It's okay

213
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,500
for a man to be fragile.

214
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,580
It's...

215
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,940
It's not me. It's...

216
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,180
I have a friend.

217
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,050
What's wrong with Qi Yue?

218
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,020
She has a stomachache.

219
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,460
She didn't come to the public course.

220
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,900
As the class monitor, I need to...

221
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,340
She should be much better now.

222
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,380
Why hasn't she come out yet?

223
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,260
Where are you?

224
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,940
Why didn't you call me back?

225
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,620
Qi Shuo.

226
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,420
Where's Qi Yue?

227
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,700
She didn't answer my call.

228
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,180
Is she in the dorm or in the classroom?

229
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,140
In the classroom.

230
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,850
In the dorm.

231
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,370
In the classroom.

232
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:29,980
In the dorm.

233
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,220
It's just I'm afraid she has a stomachache.

234
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,610
She's always like this.

235
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,300
Yes.

236
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,220
She had her period this morning.

237
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,020
So...

238
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,900
Her period?

239
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,700
When?

240
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,010
Why didn't I know?

241
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,490
This morning.

242
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,940
It's so hard for me.

243
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,460
If Qi Yue wants to skip a class next time,

244
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,850
can she...

245
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,340
Skipping a class?

246
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,100
So every time she said she had a stomachache,

247
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,420
she skipped a class, right?

248
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
Not exactly.

249
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,900
Where is she now?

250
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,420
Maybe she

251
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,340
went to the auditorium.

252
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,660
She's doomed.

253
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,490
Someone confessed his love in the auditorium just now.

254
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,620
Did you see it?

255
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,810
Yes.

256
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,580
That boy is from the Department of Physical Education, right?

257
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,420
-That was quite romantic. -Love confession?

258
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,140
Auntie.

259
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,820
You are here for the show?

260
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,660
It's too late.

261
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,780
Everyone has left.

262
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,060
So, was it a love confession?

263
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,580
Did the girl say yes?

264
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,380
She said yes.

265
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,180
You young people know your tricks.

266
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,460
Damn. The ground is so dirty.

267
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,540
Where did they go?

268
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,380
They went that way.

269
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,180
Thank you.

270
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,530
Didn't I warn you

271
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,740
not to get close to Qi Yue?

272
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,020
Are you crazy?

273
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,100
Who are you?

274
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,700
Hey.

275
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,340
Alright.

276
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,180
Hey.

277
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,220
Calm down.

278
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,780
-That's enough. -Stop!

279
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,420
Who the hell are you?

280
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,180
The hell.

281
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,820
Do you know who the hell I am?

282
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,060
I am your hell.

283
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,170
I want to kick you to death!

284
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,740
Come here.

285
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,180
All right.

286
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,860
Who are you?

287
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,500
It's fine I'm ugly.

288
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,540
As long as my son is handsome.

289
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,380
You're home.

290
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,540
Why didn't you turn on the light?

291
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,380
What's wrong?

292
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,020
Where did you go?

293
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,620
I went to class.

294
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,540
What did you do

295
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,770
before going to class?

296
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,020
Who did you meet?

297
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,820
Is this a gift from Zhaoyang?

298
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,700
Is it for his love confession?

299
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,700
He did confess his love to me today.

300
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,250
What are you doing?

301
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,820
I told you to stay away from him.

302
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,780
Do you know him?

303
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,540
Have you ever got along with him?

304
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,380
Qi Yue, you're so lovesick.

305
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,060
Can you please keep your eyes wide open?

306
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,220
What do you mean?

307
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,860
Can you be reasonable?

308
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,740
I just came back,

309
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,940
and you are blaming me.

310
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
What are you doing?

311
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,980
How many times have I told you that

312
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,220
Xu Zhaoyang is not a good man.

313
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,180
You should let him go as far as he can.

314
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,380
Do you know him?

315
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,980
You haven't even got along with him.

316
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,620
I don't need to.

317
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,940
How many times have I told you?

318
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,860
You should stay away from him.

319
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,250
I'm warning you.

320
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,860
Shouldn't you

321
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,420
give me some time?

322
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,490
Can we make it fair?

323
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,860
You told me Xu Zhaoyang is not a good man.

324
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,620
But I've never seen him

325
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,420
do anything bad.

326
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,660
But I still listened to you.

327
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,900
I stayed away from him.

328
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,220
But he has his own rights.

329
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,180
What can I do?

330
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,980
Should I tell him that

331
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,620
my future son asked me to pursue Lu Xiao

332
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,340
and stay away from you?

333
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,940
You don't have to say that.

334
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,060
What should I say?

335
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,820
Should I say Zhaoyang,

336
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,740
I don't know why

337
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,980
I can't get too close to you?

338
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,380
I don't think you're a good person.

339
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,340
And I tell him

340
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,020
to go as far as he can, right?

341
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,060
Let me tell you.

342
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,010
There are 10,000 ways to refuse someone if you want,

343
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,850
right?

344
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,820
Do you understand?

345
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,860
We are in the same university.

346
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,460
We always meet.

347
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,100
Besides,

348
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,820
chasing Lu Xiao

349
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,940
has made me

350
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,170
a joke in the university.

351
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,580
Don't I have any pride?

352
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,500
I didn't ask you

353
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,250
to pursue Lu Xiao with your pride.

354
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,300
That's not why I came here.

355
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,820
Right.

356
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,380
You suddenly showed up.

357
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,460
You told me you're here to change my fate.

358
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,060
You are my son.

359
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,180
Let me ask you.

360
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,460
Am I the only one who should be responsible for

361
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,380
my future misfortune?

362
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,580
Why don't you persuade Lu Xiao to change?

363
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,660
Your fate

364
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,220
can only be changed by yourself.

365
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,060
Do you understand?

366
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,100
The truth is you don't trust me at all.

367
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,580
No.

368
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,610
It's not that you don't trust me.

369
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,940
You don't trust anyone.

370
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,820
You only trust yourself.

371
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:44,980
Yes.

372
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,260
Everything you say is right.

373
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,060
Yes.

374
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
I don't trust you.

375
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,020
That's why I came all the way here

376
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,820
to bother you.

377
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,660
Listen.

378
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,380
If you know

379
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,660
how to handle everything,

380
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,860
it won't be necessary for me to warn you.

381
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,740
I have the ability to think independently.

382
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,020
From now on, listen carefully.

383
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,340
I won't chase

384
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,500
Lu Xiao anymore.

385
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,020
I knew you wouldn't chase Lu Xiao.

386
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,140
You're such a loser.

387
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,460
If I am a loser,

388
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,290
you're the son of a loser.

389
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,460
If I am such a terrible woman,

390
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,660
why did you choose me to be your mother?

391
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,250
If I had a choice,

392
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,859
I would never choose you to be my mother.

393
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,380
If I had a choice,

394
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,980
I wouldn't choose you to be my son either.

395
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,620
But now you are still living in my house,

396
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,420
eating my food, drinking my water, and using my things.

397
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,010
Yes, I...

398
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,020
I eat your food,

399
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,300
use your things, live in your house,

400
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,220
and drink your water.

401
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,620
Sorry.

402
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,740
It's my fault.

403
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,060
I should leave.

404
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,620
Goodbye.

405
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,140
You'd better never come back.

406
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,580
Where's Qi Shuo?

407
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,330
Who are you talking about?

408
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,500
Get lost!

409
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,580
I quit.

410
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,900
Why are you giving me a video call?

411
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,780
Nothing.

412
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,460
I'm just passing by

413
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,780
to see if you're off work.

414
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,540
I'm off today.

415
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:37,900
Okay.

416
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,700
Get some rest.

417
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,060
Is something wrong?

418
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,940
It's nothing actually.

419
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,900
Can I

420
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
sleep in your house tonight?

421
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,980
I know it's a bit absurd

422
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,140
[Qi Yue: I'm downstairs.]

423
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,620
and rude.

424
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,220
Qi Yue sent me a message.

425
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,740
Qi Yue said she's downstairs.

426
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,900
What happened to your face?

427
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,140
It doesn't matter.

428
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,100
You said Qi Yue is downstairs, right?

429
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,620
Yes.

430
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:11,730
Don't tell her

431
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,540
I've been here.

432
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,210
Please.

433
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,860
He ran away from home?

434
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,780
He threw the gift I gave him.

435
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,860
He also talked about Xu Zhaoyang.

436
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,140
What does it have to do with him?

437
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,660
You know what?

438
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,460
Xu Zhaoyang confessed his love to me today.

439
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,460
I refused him without hesitation.

440
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,900
And

441
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,460
today,

442
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,020
I went

443
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,540
to prepare

444
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,220
that ugly family photo.

445
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,050
Well,

446
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,500
there must be some misunderstanding.

447
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,100
Why don't you apologize to him?

448
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,620
Why should I apologize?

449
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,900
What did I do wrong?

450
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,860
He himself has many bad habits

451
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,020
and he wants to change me.

452
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,700
OK. No apologies.

453
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,020
You did nothing wrong.

454
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,820
It's okay.

455
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,220
This...

456
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,740
This...

457
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,420
You know what?

458
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,660
He had a dream one night.

459
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,780
Do you know what he did?

460
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,660
He...

461
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,780
He talked in his sleep？

462
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,740
He sleepwalked.

463
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,260
He recited every number

464
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,340
of Pi.

465
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Stop laughing.

466
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,620
All right.

467
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,210
Why do I feel

468
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,460
you two are quite alike sometimes?

469
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,140
Really?

470
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,930
Like mother, like son.

471
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,860
What are you talking about?

472
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,100
Are you not thinking straight because you are angry?

473
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,820
You're right.

474
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
I need to powder my nose.

475
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,820
Wait.

476
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,800
-Thank goodness I didn't spill it. -Oh, no.

477
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,900
Are you trying to murder me?

478
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,460
I...

479
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,140
I suddenly want to take a shower.

480
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,250
Why did your shower head turn on automatically?

481
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,490
I controlled it remotely.

482
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,420
Look, I'm turning it off.

483
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,340
Impressive.

484
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,180
Yes.

485
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,020
I'm going to take a shower.

486
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,100
Go back now.

487
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,860
Go.

488
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,700
What are you doing?

489
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,460
I'm going to take a shower.

490
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,540
Be careful on your way home.

491
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,180
Wait.

492
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,020
Wait.

493
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,540
If Qi Shuo comes to you,

494
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,420
you must tell me.

495
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,690
-You must tell me. -Okay.

496
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,020
I will.

497
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,500
Bye. Bye.

498
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,820
Are you hiding a man in your house?

499
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,500
Bye. Bye.

500
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,260
Put it on. Don't catch a cold.

501
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:05,980
Thank you.

502
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,980
I'm sorry.

503
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,620
I lied today.

504
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,580
Actually, I quarreled with Qi Yue.

505
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,570
That's why I'm here.

506
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,540
Sit here.

507
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,090
I'll clean the wound on your face.

508
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,300
Okay.

509
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,540
By the way, how is your mother?

510
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,020
Much better.

511
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,780
It's okay.

512
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,260
Don't feel pressured.

513
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,940
I need to keep her company in the daytime.

514
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,820
Does it hurt?

515
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,180
Take this if it hurts.

516
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,700
I need to keep her company in the daytime,

517
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,770
and I have to be on a night shift.

518
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,140
If you can take care of Tuantuan for me,

519
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,540
you'll be a great help.

520
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,540
I should have brought some medicine.

521
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,380
Aunt Shuling,

522
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,780
do you think my mom is going to abandon me?

523
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,100
Nonsense!

524
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,860
Your mother

525
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,180
has been busy recently.

526
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,770
Just stay here with me for a while.

527
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,100
I'll play with you, okay?

528
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Are you unhappy?

529
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Look what gift I prepared

530
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,620
for you today.

531
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,980
Take it.

532
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,020
Why aren't you answering your phone?

533
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,660
No need.

534
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,820
That's the alarm set for Qi Yue

535
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,460
to remind her to memorize words.

536
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,180
But

537
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,620
it doesn't matter now.

538
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,620
Because of your supervision,

539
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,220
Qi Yue has become better.

540
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,420
She always said

541
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,740
if it weren't for Qi Shuo,

542
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,660
I wouldn't have done this.

543
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,860
Really?

544
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,940
When? Why didn't I know?

545
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,810
She said it multiple times a day.

546
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,330
Are you guys of the Qi family

547
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,780
all sharp-tongued and tender-hearted?

548
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,900
No way.

549
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,020
I won't be bribed by her sugar-coated words.

550
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,420
I'll be strict

551
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,460
when it's necessary.

552
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,500
What a luck

553
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,060
for me to have two of the Qi family around me.

554
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,410
I'm going to bed.

555
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,260
From now on, the living room is your bedroom.

556
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,290
Qi Shuo, let me sleep for another five minutes.

557
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,500
Just five minutes.

558
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,140
Hurry up and eat.

559
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,900
You need to memorize words for CET-4 later.

560
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,900
You really ran away from home.

561
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,870
[Anger is harmful to human body. If you are always angry...]

562
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,470
[But why are you angry?]

563
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,180
Let me ask you a question.

564
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,340
Is there anything you don't know?

565
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,820
What do girls usually get angry about?

566
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,220
For boys, there are two reasons.

567
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,900
Either they lose in a game,

568
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,540
or their new sneakers are dirty.

569
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,740
Girls are complicated.

570
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,180
It can't be generally summarized.

571
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,140
It varies from person to person.

572
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,540
Who are you talking about?

573
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,130
Qi Yue.

574
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,500
Qi Yue?

575
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,340
It must be because you refused her.

576
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,540
I didn't today.

577
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,660
Then I don't know why.

578
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,580
I don't know her well.

579
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,100
If you want to know,

580
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,340
just ask her.

581
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,140
I did.

582
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,820
She didn't reply.

583
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,060
Qi Yue.

584
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,300
How was yesterday?

585
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,540
Don't mention it.

586
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,500
I had a big fight with Qi Shuo.

587
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,980
He ran away from home.

588
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,860
What about Lu Xiao?

589
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,740
Didn't he go?

590
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,180
I think

591
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,460
I yelled at him and told him to go away.

592
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,890
Seriously,

593
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,700
you are a badass.

594
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,100
Tell me.

595
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,020
If we

596
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,860
give birth to a son

597
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,010
after ten months of pregnancy,

598
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,860
we have to feed him

599
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,820
and raise him.

600
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,140
However,

601
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,100
when he grows up,

602
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,340
he argues with you,

603
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,650
runs away from home,

604
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,300
slams the door,

605
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,900
puts your name on the blacklist,

606
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,780
and even disappears.

607
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,820
Don't you think he is your enemy?

608
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,500
I admire your imagination.

609
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,020
How did you manage to think of your future son

610
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,980
through your brother's running away from home?

611
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,900
I...

612
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,980
I'm angry for his mother.

613
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,180
Damn.

614
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,580
I forgot to submit my paper.

615
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,700
I'm running out of time.

616
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,180
Oh no.

617
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,380
You just forgot to submit it.

618
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,700
I forgot to write it.

619
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,220
-I knew it. -I knew it.

620
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,980
Usually, Qi Shuo would remind me

621
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,940
of things like writing a paper.

622
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,900
I think Qi Shuo's running away from home

623
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,780
is like chopping a leg of yours.

624
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,900
You are just one step from begging.

625
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
It's not like

626
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,940
I can't live without him.

627
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,300
From now on,

628
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,620
I will live freely.

629
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,460
Students who just arrived, take a seat quickly.

630
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,740
The class is about to start.

631
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,660
There is a vacant seat beside Lu Xiao.

632
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,100
Why don't you sit there?

633
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,900
It's too crowded.

634
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,900
If you haven't submitted your papers,

635
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,540
I'll give you another chance.

636
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,620
Send them to my email by tomorrow.

637
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,900
This is your last chance.

638
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,420
Qi Yue,

639
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,940
this is my experiment report.

640
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,180
Help me give it to Qi Shuo.

641
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,300
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

642
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,140
We are not always together.

643
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,220
I'm not his deliveryman.

644
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,300
Why should I give it to him?

645
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,740
Good luck.

646
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,260
Your little tail didn't pester you today?

647
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,940
Good.

648
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,580
If it's good,

649
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,820
you should be happy.

650
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,020
To be honest,

651
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,180
do you really hate her that much?

652
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,540
I think she's good.

653
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,980
If you really don't like her,

654
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,940
why don't you introduce her to me?

655
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,900
To be honest,

656
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,140
if I had a girlfriend

657
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,620
like Qi Yue

658
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,340
being so nice to me,

659
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,020
I would

660
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,420
wake up laughing from my dream.

661
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,100
Dream less, and study harder.

662
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,860
What a coincidence, Lu Xiao.

663
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,100
I didn't expect to meet you here.

664
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,860
Lu Xiao.

665
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,420
Come and sit.

666
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
Surprise!

667
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,410
[Qi Shuo: 1,000 yuan accepted]

668
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,420
What kind of son is he?

669
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,460
Running away from home after a quarrel.

670
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,620
If you are so capable,

671
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,100
repay your mother like Nezha.

672
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,220
Xie Jiajia.

673
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,300
Yes.

674
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,730
Take a walk with me.

675
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,780
Yes.

676
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,090
Lu Xiao.

677
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,620
There is a boy from another university who keeps harassing me.

678
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,660
He just won't give up.

679
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,140
Please help me.

680
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,250
Yufei,

681
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,900
I think you should be more independent.

682
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,860
An adult must learn

683
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
how to refuse other people.

00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,100

Don't worry.

What happened to Qi Yue?

689

You still don't know?

Qi Shuo is missing.

691
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,660
She's about to call the police.

692

I still can't reach him.

How long has he been missing?

697
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,940
Over 24 hours.

698
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,500
What should we do?

699
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,820
Should we wait here?

700
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,620
Of course not.

701

Don't worry.

702
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,060
I'll go look for him with you.

Hello.

No.

Thank you.

718
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,090
We need to think of another way.

719
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,740
This won't do.

720
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,300
Let's go to the police station.

721
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,460
What are you going to do?

722
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,220
Call the police.

723
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,060
No.

Absolutely not.

Let's leave here.

739

Okay.

740
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,340
I'll go first.

741
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,460
I can't move.

742
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,090
We both move a little to the left.

743

Left?

744

To the left.

Okay, left.

Is there anything you want to eat?

I suddenly remember

749
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,620
Qi Shuo told me

750
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,300
there is an old lady selling ice cream balls

751
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,210
around here.

752
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,940
He said when he was a kid,

753
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,620
his mother was always not with him.

754
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,260
He would go to that old lady.

755
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,220
She would give him

756
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,740
ice cream balls in various colors.

757
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,300
Maybe he went to the old lady.

758
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,220
We may find clues there.

The owner of this stall.

767
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,700
She went to the bathroom.
