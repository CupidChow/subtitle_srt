00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,660
Over the past four years,

174
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,900
I've learned not only physics,

175
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,420
but also some philosophy.

176
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,580
Bergson once said,

177
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,460
the real time is not objective,

178
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,980
but subjective experience.

179
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,180
I didn't understand it before.

180
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,340
Since I was a kid,

181
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,980
I had been a person

182
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,060
who liked to arrange my time accurately to every minute.

183
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,300
But suddenly a strange person

184
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,740
came into my life.

185
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,660
She always upset my plans.

186
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,700
It was strange.

187
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,820
I was quite happy.

188
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,020
Gradually,

189
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
I seemed to understand the meaning of this sentence.

190
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,940
The two hours we spent in watching movies

191
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,500
were five minutes.

192
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,700
The day I spent in missing her was one year.

193
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,380
Today is our last day in Qingnan University.

194
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,850
I want to occupy a few minutes of your time

195
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,340
to create something about love.

196
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,220
What?

197
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,340
So romantic.

198
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,340
Qi Yue.

199
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,940
Will you marry me?

200
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,810
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

201
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,580
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

202
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,940
♫The past is like an impassable gully♫

203
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,180
Yes, I do.

204
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,220
Marry him!

205
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:05,910
♫I'll never have a chance to feel your tenderness♫

206
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:13,200
♫I remember the day when you turned around and kept going♫

207
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,020
I envy her.

208
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,990
♫You didn't stop or look back♫

209
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,350
♫So I saw you♫

210
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,730
♫Passing through my world and taking away warm colors♫

211
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,170
♫The wind chases the clouds and surrounds you♫

212
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,120
♫Only the barren wilderness is left♫

213
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,600
♫You left me alone♫

214
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,420
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

215
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,320
♫But then I tried to travel♫

216
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,290
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

217
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,940
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

218
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,820
♫All over the world. But you never passed by♫

219
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,730
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

220
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,980
♫Maybe we are like ships that pass in the night♫

221
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,540
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

♫This love has a bad ending♫

223
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,870
♫We missed each other naturally♫

224
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,020
Why did you move back?

225
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,300
You changed the colors for blue.

226
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,660
Why don't you change me for blue?

227
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,500
Why are you pulling the curtains?

228
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
I want to develop the photos.

229
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,660
Who taught you that?

230
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,100
I read it in a book before I came here.

231
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,900
Please.

232
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,620
I know you love studying.

233
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,300
But can you stop reading those ancient books?

234
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,500
What?

235
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,900
What do you think?

236
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,850
Isn't it amazing?

237
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,180
Yes.

238
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,660
It's my fault.

239
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,340
Since you came here,

240
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,420
I haven't shown you

241
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,460
this kind of high-tech things.

242
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,380
In my time,

243
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,780
we used cloud imaging technology.

244
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,540
Don't worry.

245
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,540
I'll teach you everything as soon as you're born.

246
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,100
Look.

247
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,060
What are you waiting for?

248
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,940
Look at the photos.

249
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,620
Why aren't you in these photos?

250
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,620
Mom,

251
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,220
if you remember correctly,

252
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,250
I was behind the camera at that time.

253
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,610
How could you miss

254
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,260
such an important moment?

255
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,650
But it's okay.

256
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,780
There will be wedding photos

257
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,860
and your 100th day photos.

258
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,700
There are plenty of opportunities.

259
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,460
I need to use the bathroom.

260
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,820
There are plenty of opportunities.

261
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,140
You're here.

262
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,820
Where is Qi Yue?

263
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:30,970
She's in the bathroom.

264
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,300
I made the invitations.

265
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,140
Invitations?

266
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,500
They're beautiful.

267
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,460
I set the wedding date on October 17th.

268
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,500
Why did you choose October 17th?

269
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,740
Because I want to use this way

270
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,260
to make her remember that day.

271
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,500
Actually,

272
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,540
I was worried at first.

273
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,980
I was worried that you would change your mind

274
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,619
after knowing the truth.

275
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,900
I did think about it.

276
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,660
But I thought that would be more selfish.

277
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,380
Selfish?

278
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,339
But it's nothing.

279
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,700
Since the direction of the story has been changed,

280
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,620
the people in the story

281
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,660
will continue to live in this direction.

282
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,370
Qi Shuo, don't have more regrets.

283
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,860
What are you talking about behind my back?

284
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,260
The last bachelor party before the wedding.

285
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,820
You don't understand.

286
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,780
I'll stop talking with you.

287
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Look at the photos.

288
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
The photos I took are good.

289
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,420
I'm going to deliver the invitations.

290
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,860
Who else do you know besides Deng Shuling?

291
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,250
Why do you need two invitations?

292
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,980
Let me tell you.

293
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,540
On our wedding day,

294
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,900
we'll decorate

295
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,860
the wedding venue in blue.

296
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,940
Then my dad will hold my hand and walk towards you.

297
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,020
Then he'll give my hand to you.

298
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,620
What about Qi Shuo?

299
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,580
[Inpatient Building]

300
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:57,660
Dr. Han.

301
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,890
Hello.

302
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,820
Hello.

303
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,220
I'm Deng Shuling's friend.

304
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,180
Do you remember me?

305
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,140
The ambulance...

306
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,100
You're the person who called an ambulance last time?

307
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Yes.

308
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,660
You said Deng Shuling isn't in the hospital.

309
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,460
Where did she go?

310
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,740
She resigned.

311
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,300
She resigned?

312
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,180
When did it happen?

313
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,580
I don't know.

314
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,380
I can't reach her either.

315
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,980
You are her friend.

316
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,460
You should know it better than me.

317
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,060
I thought

318
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,180
you were her boyfriend.

319
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,420
It seems that you don't know her well either.

320
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,380
She said she likes someone.

321
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,020
She refused me indirectly.

322
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,020
Do you know who that person is?

323
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,490
I think I know.

324
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
Thank you, Dr. Han.

325
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,340
Then tell me.

326
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,300
Who is he?

327
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,780
I need to know who I lost to.

328
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,020
I'll treat you to dinner.

329
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,620
I can understand that you don't want to open the door.

330
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,740
But Qi Yue is getting married soon.

331
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,420
As her best friend,

332
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,540
I think you should witness

333
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,900
this happy moment with her.

334
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,620
I've brought the invitation.

335
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,020
Actually, it's good to have this door between us.

336
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,100
But I'm leaving.

337
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,140
I want to say goodbye to you.

338
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,700
Where are you going?

339
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,300
I...

340
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,540
Tuantuan.

341
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,180
You... Hurry up.

342
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,740
Tuantuan.

343
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,220
What do you want to drink?

344
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,700
Cola.

345

Okay.

I'll gain weight if I eat many snacks.

357
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,100
Drinking too much carbonated drinks is bad for my health.

358
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,700
I have to eat fruits and vegetables every day.

427
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,420
We haven't eaten together for a long time.

428
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,060
Yue.

429
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,820
Do you still remember

430
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,580
the small bridge in front of our home?

431
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,740
Of course.

432
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,700
I crossed it every day when I was in school.

433
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,180
Now it's been repaired very well.

434
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,820
Yes.

435
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,500
Back then,

436
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,660
you were in first grade.

437
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,020
Our family was poor.

438
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,090
Your mother

439
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,300
needed to cook at home.

440
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,100
I took you to and from school by electric bike.

441
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Electric bikes couldn't go on that bridge,

442
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,020
so I cycled specially.

443
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,100
You sat on the back seat and slept.

444
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,100
I forgot.

445
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,340
That winter,

446
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,900
we sat together and ate hot pot

447
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,180
like this.

448
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,540
I lost money in business at that time.

449
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,580
I only had 19 yuan.

450
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,860
I remember that.

451
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,450
We only ordered the soup base.

452
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,130
We brought vegetables and meat

453
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,860
ourselves.

454
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,820
When we left,

455
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,660
we wrapped the leftovers up

456
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,780
and put them in the vacuum flask.

457
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,140
We bought them back and let my mom eat them.

458
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,820
But after you divorced,

459
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,540
we didn't communicate much.

460
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,740
By the way,

461
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,260
I went to your school on your graduation day.

462
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,620
When did you come?

463
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,180
I saw you saying "Yes, I do."

464
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,500
Then I left.

465
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,660
You're Lu Xiao, right?

466
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,250
Good.

467
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,860
Don't worry, Mr. Qi.

468
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,940
I will take good care of her.

469
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,820
I don't care who you take care of.

470
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,540
Take care of yourselves first.

471
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,700
A marriage

472
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,020
is actually a risky investment.

473
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,700
You're talking like this again.

474
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,900
You're talking about business again.

475
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,220
Yue, since you were a kid,

476
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,740
I haven't cared much about your life.

477
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
But

478
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,220
I witnessed every important moment

479
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,140
in your life.

480
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,140
In the past,

481
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,220
you might not understand me.

482
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,500
But in the future,

483
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,700
you'll understand me

484
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,770
when you get married and become a mother.

485
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,220
Hello.

486
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,340
We only have this kind of tofu pudding.

487
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,500
Is it OK?

488
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,940
Did you add peanuts?

489
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,700
You told us before.

490
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,490
We didn't add peanuts.

491
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:50,890
Okay.

492
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,170
Thank you.

493
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,580
Enjoy your meal.

494
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,690
By the way,

495
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,540
when will you get married?

496
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,060
October 17th.

497
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,060
Dad, don't drink too much.

498
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,580
My daughter

499
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,580
is getting married.

500
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,140
What he said to me today

501
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,340
is more than what he had said this year.

502
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,900
Are you touched?

503
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,620
Is it a reconciliation between you and your father?

504
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,340
Of course not.

505
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,540
Didn't you say all love

506
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,980
is for gathering?

507
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,540
But as a father,

508
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,420
he just wants me to get married soon.

509
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,220
I said

510
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,050
that sentence was told by a person

511
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,260
who is important to me.

512
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,820
And I only said the first half.

513
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,660
There's the second half?

514
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,100
He said,

515
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,420
"All love in this world is for gathering.

516
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Only the love between parents and children

517
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,730
is for separation."

518
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,410
I don't understand.

519
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,220
Maybe it's because they love each other.

520
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,060
They hope

521
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,180
they can be happy

522
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,300
even if they leave each other.

523
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,010
It sounds great,

524
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,060
but don't you think it's selfish?

525
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,700
What if parents or children

526
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,820
want to keep each other by their side?

527
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,730
What if it's Qi Shuo?

528
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,380
No way.

529
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,020
He can't escape

530
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,300
next life, the life after next life,

531
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,420
and the life after the life after next life.

532
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,770
You can't escape either.

533
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,900
I'm not willing to escape.

534
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,220
Mom.

535
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,420
They don't belong to us.

536
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,620
We'll buy new things when we arrive at our new home.

537
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,740
I've lived at this home for decades.

538
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,020
I have feelings for it.

539
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,140
It's water under the bridge, Mom.

540
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,140
Those old and bad things

541
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,380
should be thrown away.

542
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,300
Let's go, Mom.

543
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:12,860
Okay.

544
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,620
Mom, get in the car first.

545
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,500
Okay.

546
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,380
Congratulations.

547
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,260
You've started a new life.

548
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,620
Yes.

549
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,420
You're right on time.

550
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,300
This is for you.

551
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,340
What is this?

552
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,580
IOU.

553
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,540
I'll see the money as the money you lent me.

554
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,420
Counting from that day,

555
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,380
I'll pay you back in a year.

556
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,620
You have time to pay me back.

557
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,740
I'm afraid I don't have time to wait.

558
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,300
Although you're sarcastic,

559
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,780
I should pay you back.

560
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,980
You've changed, Xu Zhaoyang.

561
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,540
That's good.

562
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,740
Well,

563
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,700
I have something to give you too.

564
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,980
Are you getting married?

565
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,260
I want to.

566
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,200
[To Xu Zhaoyang, Invited by the Bridegroom Lu Xiao and the Bride Qi Yue]

567
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,820
Why should I go to their wedding?

568
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,530
I'm not even their friends.

569
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,380
Consider it

570
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,300
as a wedding of your classmate in the university.

571
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,250
But they both want you to come.

572
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,030
Me too.

573
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,460

[We Don't Want to Have Any Regrets, Right?]

576
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,740
You're so annoying.

577
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,340
I told you on the phone just now.

578
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,180
You are not a family.

579
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,820
It's inappropriate to hang your photo

580
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,740
here.

581
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,490
Sir,

582
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,530
the three of us

583
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,170
are a family.

584
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,340
I need to make money.

585
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,260
If you put it in the window,

586
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,540
it'll be my advertisement.

587
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,020
How much money do you need?

588
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,340
Young man, it's not about money.

589
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,380
Is it about time?

590
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,460
I'm a student from Qingnan University.

591
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,380
Digital design, Photoshop, and color correction.

592
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,810
I can do all these.

593
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,180
That's not what I mean.

594
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,700
Sir, if you trust me,

595
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,050
you can go home and rest.

596
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,940
Leave it to me.

597
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,860
These are my ID card, student card,

598
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,850
household registration booklet, and Qingcheng Bank credit card.

599
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,620
That's enough.

600
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,090
I'll only hang it for one day.

601
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,300
Young man,

602
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,340
why are you so stubborn?

603
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,220
Because I don't want to have any regrets.
