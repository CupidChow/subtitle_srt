172
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,299
everyone is serious about this.

173
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,940
We might have other ways.

174
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,419
By the way,

175
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,659
Qi Yue told you that

176
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,100
she would meet you in the rehearsal hall in ten minutes.

177
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,100
Look. What's the light that shines

178
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,900
from that window?

179
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,500
That's the east.

180
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,490
Juliet is the sun.

181
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,100
What? Is that me?

182
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,820
You said I'm the sun?

Hush.

184

189
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,420
You asked me to...

190
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,780
I didn't.

[A Request from Ten Thousand People]

193
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,740
It's stupid, isn't it?

194
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,900
I was going to protest

195
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,980
in this ancient way.

196
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,770
We're all old members.

197
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,740
We certainly don't want the drama club to be disbanded.

198
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,940
But no matter how powerful an individual is,

199
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,420
we still need a group.

200
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,940
Where is the group?

201
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,500
Actually, when I went back,

202
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,860
I did read the play

203
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,340
Romeo and Juliet carefully.

204
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,060
What do you think?

205
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,140
I think it's too tragic.

206

Shouldn't lovers be together finally?

207
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,460
What if you were Juliet?

208
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,540
If I were Juliet,

209
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,300
I wouldn't care about social rank for marriage

210
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,530
or family hatred.

211

Love can resist everything.

212
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,860
This is a very romantic answer.

Forget it.

An indifferent top student like you wouldn't understand.

215
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,860
Now,

216
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,300
there are only the two of us here.

217
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,340
What do you want to do?

218
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
I mean

Is that me?

You said I'm the sun?

229
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,530

I...

243
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,300
Where's the director?

244
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,860
He's not coming.

245
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,860
Why?

246
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,380
Maybe he doesn't think

247
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,020
we can achieve anything.

248
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,700
It's okay.

249
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,900
In that case,

250
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,380
let's assign the roles again.

251

What do you mean?

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,060
It means

253
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,580
since no one believes us,

254
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,260
we should believe ourselves.

If there's no theater for us to rehearse,

256

now,

the whole school is the place for us to rehearse.

00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,660
We can do environmental dramas.

What is it?

261
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,300
Environmental dramas refer to

262
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,500
drama performance that is not only limited to indoor conditions.

263

Why do you know everything?

264
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,380
When will we rehearse?

265
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,580
But now we don't

266
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,100
even have a director.

267
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,900
What are you afraid of?

268
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,060
With my status,

269
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,980
can't I find a director?

270

I suspect you joined the drama club

292
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,580
not for the making of an actor,

293
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,820
but to have intimate contact

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,940

Is kissing something

305
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,580
that can be done casually on the street?

343
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,500
Then we almost...

344
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,620
Ate the same noodle.

345
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,340
It requires very good techniques.

346
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,650
No.

347
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,460
If you are experienced,

348
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,660
why did you ask me?

349
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,060
I...

350
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,060
I just wanted to test you.

351
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,980
It's time to go home.

352
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,100
It's not late. It's okay.

353
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I can go home by myself.

354
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,860
I'm not talking about you.

355
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,930
Deng Shuling,

356
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,660
is it time to get off work?

357
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,780
Let's go. I'll take you home.

358
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,300
Okay. Wait for me to get changed.

359
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,100
Okay.

360
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,940
Bad son.

361
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,980
To have a kiss,

362
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,620
first, you need to use the atmosphere

363
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,460
and get close to him with a smile.

364
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,460
Romeo and Juliet.

365
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,580
Act 2, Scene 1.

366
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,600
If something can be achived with the power of love,

367
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,730
he will take the risk to give it a try.

368
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,300
So I'm not afraid of your family's interference.

369
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,740
If they see you...

370
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,420
The chance to get close to him without limit is coming.

371
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,100
Did you feel sorry for Romeo

372
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,700
or want to flirt with him?

373
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,380
Your emotion wasn't right at all.

374
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,020
You should fall into his arms naturally.

375
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,580
Go on.

376
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,580
As long as you look at me with your gentle eyes,

377
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,380
they won't be able to hurt my body.

378
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,780
Fall into his arms naturally.

379
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,500
Is that what Juliet should do?

380
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,140
Why is she pouting?

381
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,060
I don't want them to see you.

382
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,819
Cut!

383
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,859
Well, are you trying to play

384
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,140
Michael Jackson here?

385
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,220
Qi Yue.

386
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
What's wrong with you?

387
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,020
It's too narrow here.

388
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,380
I can't stand steadily.

389
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,700
Forget it.

390
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,490
That's all for today.

391
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,329
Let's call it a day.

392
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,260
I almost succeeded just now.

393
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,540
You didn't act well today.

394
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,100
Really? Buy some food now.

395
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,180
My eyelashes fell into my eye.

396
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,860
Let me see.

397
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,340
Is it that easy?

398
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,820
Qi Yue.

399
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,540
What do you want to eat?

400
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,170
Noodles are okay for me.

401
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,250
Why is this happening?

402
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,100
Are you kidding me?

403
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,580
Qi Yue.

404
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,220
This bowl of noodles is mine.

405
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,020
Are you okay?

406
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,180
I'll buy you some water.

407
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,940
Sor... Sorry.

408
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,140
Lu Xiao.

409
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,700
What's wrong?

410
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,980
My eyelashes fell into my eye.

411
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,180
Blow it for me.

412
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,100
Boss,

413
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
have you done your homework for the public course we'll have this afternoon?

414
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,330
What public course?

415
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,260
We have to hand in the homework in an hour.

416
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,860
Hurry up.

417
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,580
Lu Xiao, bye.

418
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,260
Lu Xiao.

419
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,540
Why didn't you come to

420
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,620
the family dinner last night?

421
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,060
I was rehearsing last night,

422
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,020
so I didn't go.

423
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,380
Your drama club has been disbanded.

424
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,300
Why were you rehearsing?

425
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,700
Come to watch the show then.

426
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,460
Lu Xiao.

427
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,260
Why didn't you reply to

428
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,620
the messages I sent to you?

429
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,220
It was not convenient for me to check my mobile phone during the experiment.

430
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,140
What's the matter?

431
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,020
I mean,

432
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,180
someone has been following me lately.

433
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,580
I'm afraid it's that guy again.

434
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,300
If someone keeps following you,

435
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,980
you can report him to the school

436
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,740
or call the police.

437
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,180
Oh no.

438
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,580
There's one hour left.

439
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,780
I don't know if I can finish it.

440
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,730
There's no class this afternoon.

441
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,660
Have you forgotten?

442
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,180
It's the Summary of Mao Zedong's Theories this afternoon.

443
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,210
Can you take a look at the calendar?

444
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,020
So it's Tuesday today.

445
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,140
There's no rush then.

446
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,940
Wait.

447
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,620
What were you doing with Lu Xiao just now?

448
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,770
Were you

449
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,220
having a kiss?

450
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,980
Why aren't you smart when you should be?

451
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,660
You're stupid when you're supposed to be.

452
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,860
You and Lu Xiao are so intimate.

453
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,580
So did you kiss him?

454
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,900
Tell me. Tell me.

455
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,540
I've never had a kiss before.

456
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,540
I have no experience. How can I do it?

457
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,300
Stop laughing.

458
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,020
I've been working hard to create an opportunity all day,

459
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,460
But there were always some

460
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,740
uncontrollable factors.

461
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,020
As for kissing,

462
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,180
there are the following five key elements.

463
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,730
First,

464
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,580
you must choose a dark and windy night,

465
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,580
because when the temperature goes down,

466
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,660
our feelings will get more intense.

467
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,020
Second,

468
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,340
ask him to go to a place where no one is around

469
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,300
so that his body and emotions

470
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,660
can both relax.

471
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,100
Third,

472
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,260
further physical contact.

473
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,180
At this moment,

474
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,740
your gesture should be light and your movements should be gentle.

475
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Fourth,

476
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,860
when you do all these movements,

477
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,460
praise his eyebrows, eyes,

478
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,370
and nose successively.

479
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,700
There are five key elements, right?

480
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,420
What about the fifth?

481
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,940
Drink some wine and kiss him. That's it.

482
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,340
Why do you make it so complicated?

483
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,740
Seriously.

484
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,940
That's right.

485
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,380
My first kiss today

486
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,660
will be

487
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,620
finished officially.

488
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,670
[Liang Yufei]

489
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,980
If you say so,

490
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,620
Liang Yufei

491
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,220
is the biggest obstacle between Qi Yue and Lu Xiao.

492
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,060
It seems that it's not that simple.

493
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,380
What's so hard about it?

494
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,620
Let's play it by ear.

495
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,140
You don't understand.

496
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,660
Do you know what is the hardest thing

497
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,380
in the world?

498
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,140
What is it?

499
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,570
I don't understand.

500
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,540
Look.

501
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,780
If Xu Zhaoyang approaches Qi Yue

502
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,180
for money,

503
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,980
then Liang Yufei's purpose of approaching Lu Xiao

504
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,620
is definitely not simple.

505
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,380
Why?

506
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,780
If a person

507
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,660
attaches all his

508
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,380
emotions to another person,

509
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,460
he'll get so indulged in it.

510
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,500
For example,

511
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,420
when Liang Yufei was with Lu Xiao,

512
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,620
I think

513
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,220
she did many extreme things.

514
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,980
Once, Lu Xiao...

515
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,380
Where are you going?

516
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,260
Do you want some fruit?

517
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,500
No.

518
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Let me get you some water.

519
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,780
No.

520
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,820
Well...

521
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,220
Liang Yufei's purpose must not be that simple.

522
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,940
Where are you going?

523
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
To follow her.

524
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,700
As the ancients said,

525
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,460
"Know yourself and your enemy, and you'll never lose."

526
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,920
[Wonder Woman]

527
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,720
[Let's take a walk later. See you at the pavilion.]

528
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,450
[Let's take a walk later. See you at the pavilion.]

529
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,730
What are you doing?

530
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,980
Someone is following me.

531
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,300
I took a look.

532
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,140
There's really no one.

533
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,820
Please don't use this excuse anymore.

534
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,660
Okay?

535
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,500
It's true.

536
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,700
I heard footsteps just now.

537
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,740
I was so scared.

538
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,020
Lu Xiao, I like you.

539
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,340
What are you doing?

540
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,140
There's a hair on your shoulder.

541
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,530
Thank you.

542
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,860
I can do it myself.

543
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,260
If someone really stalks you,

544
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,540
I'll watch you enter the dorm

545
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
and ensure your safety.

546
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,260
Enough. Enough.

547
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,820
Stop drinking.

548
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,460
Do you know

549
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,660
what I saw?

550
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
You're drunk.

551
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,260
Go home.

552
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,340
Don't go back to school today.

553
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,380
I don't have a home.

554
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,900
My Lu Xiao

555
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,940
kissed another girl

556
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,380
in broad daylight.

557
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,780
You must be mistaken.

558
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,820
If I'm mistaken about it,

559
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,180
I'll poke my own eyes.

560
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,220
Calm down.

561
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,860
Calm down.

562
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,220
No.

563
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,340
I should call Lu Xiao

564
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,740
a scumbag.

565
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,460
Lu Xiao, scumbag!

566
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,820
Scumbag!

567
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,980
Let's go home.

568
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,860
You're drunk.

569
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,460
Come on.

570
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,500
Let me carry you back.

571
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,100
My son is the best.

572
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,220
A son is like his mother's little cotton coat.

573
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,900
No.

574
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,380
The son is like a down jacket.

575
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,940
All right.

576
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,100
It's even okay to say I'm like your military coat.

577
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,620
Come on. Ready.

578
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,900
Three, two, one. Go.

579
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,940
Sir,

580
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,740
I'll transfer the money to your mobile phone later.

581
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,340
Okay.

582
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,730
Okay.

583
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,410
Are you drunk?

584
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,660
I'm so tired.

585
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,460
Take a nap if you're tired.

586
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,660
You carried me behind your back like this when I was a kid.

587
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,290
Then I fell asleep on your back.

588
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,780
Am I a failure?

589
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,820
Of course not.

590
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,500
You ate a lot and weigh over 50 kilograms now.

591
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,740
You're quite successful.

592
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,860
I'm not a good mother.

593
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,500
I can't even do well in

594
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,980
chasing Lu Xiao.

595
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,580
Although I always complain about you,

596
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,620
I don't think you're a failure at all.

597
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,900
Then why doesn't he like me?

598
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,540
Am I a very lousy girl?

599
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,380
How is that possible?

600
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,220
Don't let anyone judge you

601
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,020
through anything,

602
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,570
except yourself.

603
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,340
Only when you live a good life

604
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,700
will others think highly of you.

605
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,380
Understand?

606
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,890
Remember that.

607
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
Go home. Refrain from vomitting.

608
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,380
Go home. Go home.

609
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,900
Qi Yue! Qi Yue!

610
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,580
You can't drink much.

611
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,940
Don't throw up.

612
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,980
You can't drink much.

613
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,620
Seriously.

614
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,580
Come on. Your head.

615
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,060
Three, two, one.

616
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Good girl.

617
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,460
Okay.

618
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,780
My son is the best.

619
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,700
Men are all bad.

620
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,580
My son is the best.

621
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,940
My son is the best.

622
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,940
Hello.

623
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
Is that Liang Yufei?

624
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,740
Qi Yue.

625
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,220
You didn't answer my calls or reply to my WeChat messages.

626
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,100
Qi Yue.

627
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,140
[The seat is occupied.]

628
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,120
[Stay away from me!]

629
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,080
[Stay away from me!]

630
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,420
Do you know what happened to Qi Yue?

631
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,940
No, I don't.

632
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,490
Then why can't I get through to her?

633
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,180
I'm not sure.

634
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,020
By the way,

635
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,860
about the formula of Kepler's Second Law...

636
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,620
I'm illiterate.

637
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,100
Qi Shuo, can you tell me

638
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,420
what happened?

639
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,060
It's not a good thing to offend Qi Yue.

640
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,020
I think Qi Yue misunderstood me.

641
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,780
She won't tell me.

642
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,420
But I hope you can tell me.

643
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,140
Bro, do you really not know or are you playing dumb?

644
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,900
How could you fall in love with...

645
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,220
How dare you run away?

646
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,300
I wanted to kill you.

647
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,420
The law forbids it.

648
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,900
A spoony couple. A bloody story.

649
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,180
[I Belonged To Your World]

650
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,160
[When will my Romeo fully understand it?]

651
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,740
Cheng.

652
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,940
Come and take a look for me.

653
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,580
What's wrong?

654
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,220
There's something in my eye.

655
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,980
So what should one do if something is in his eye?

656
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,660
It depends on whether it's a boy or a girl.

657
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,380
Is there any difference?

658
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,580
Of course.

659
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
If it's a boy, ignore it.

660
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,340
If it's a girl,

661
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,460
it means asking for a kiss indirectly.

662
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,620
Ask for a kiss?

663
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,820
Forget it.
