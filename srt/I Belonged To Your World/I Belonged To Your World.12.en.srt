there are no facts, only interpretations.

you just know it

Explain it to me.

She hoped I could help her.

That's it.

Your aunt also let you kiss?

70
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,220
We didn't kiss.

71
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,020
She told me there was hair on my shirt.

Lu Xiao, are you really that naive?

73

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,740
What?

75
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,540
You're blushing.

76

Nonsense. I'm not.

Thank you for that night.

80

If someone follows you again,

81
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,050
just call the police.

82
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,380
Because I have someone more important to protect.

Didn't you say

is true?

92
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,460
That's Nietzsche.

93
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,500
What do you mean?

94
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,020
You're an ordinary person.

95
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,860
Me too.

96
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,980
Our insights are not as profound as Nietzsche's.

97
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,020
I'm an ordinary person.

98
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,980
You're not.

Stop.

102
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,340
Lu Xiao just explained it to you.

103
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,500
Why are you still angry?

104
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,380
Do you think he is really stupid or he is pretending?

105
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,340
Will you not notice it

106
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,100
if a girl likes you?

107
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,060
Are you talking about Liang Yufei?

108
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,220
Yes, her.

109
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,740
Pretty girls

110
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,700
are all hidden problems.

111
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,820
What about Lu Xiao?

112
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,780
Did he respond?

113
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,580
Well...

114
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,620
No.

115
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
But he said

116
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,740
he had someone more important to protect.

117
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,740
He was looking at me when he said it.

118
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,220
Then it's simple.

119
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,300
You love each other,

120
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,010
but there is the other woman.

121
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,380
I think you should make it clear with Lu Xiao

122
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,220
at your birthday party tonight.

123
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,340
I won't invite him.

124
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,260
You bully me every day

125
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,940
because I care about you.

126
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,420
From now on,

127
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,740
whoever defends him

128
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,580
will get killed.

K.O.

130
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,980
Can't you see that Lu is in a bad mood?

131
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,940
He doesn't want to see anyone.

132
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,540
It's Qi...

133

Oh no.

134
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,180
When a man is in love,

135
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,620
it is the end of all happiness.

136

Why are you dressing like this?

Qi Yue is mad at you.

141

There are spies everywhere.

142
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,260
I need to protect myself.

143
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,860
She's still angry?

144
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,140
Young people like you

145
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
like to complicate simple things.

146

Anyway,

147

keep in touch tonight.

As long as she is in danger,

you save her.

150
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,340
She will be in danger?

151
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,700
It was just a metaphor.

152
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,380
Where are you? Why aren't you here yet?

153
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,980
I had a diarrhea.

154
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,220
I suddenly have a stomachache.

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,090
Here, sister.

175
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,140
Come on. Happy birthday.

176
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,850
Happy birthday.

177
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,420
Happy birthday, Qi Yue.

178
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,010
Thank you, my friends.

179
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,020
There is one man absent, right?

180
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,170
Lu Xiao.

181
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,980
Look at you.

182
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,940
You always do something inappropriate.

183
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,700
I'll take her to the bathroom.

184
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,300
It's okay.

185
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,020
I can just wipe it.

186
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,700
No need to go to the bathroom.

187
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,500
No. You're going.

188
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,340
Let's go.

189
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,600
[Ready]

190
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,580
Are you okay?

191
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,740
Let me remind you again.

192
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,300
Never mention Lu Xiao again

193
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,500
today.

194
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,180
Got it.

195
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,900
Lu Xiao.

196
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,660
Are you not done with it?

197
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,380
It's really Lu Xiao.

198
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,020
Lu Xiao, why are you here?

199
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,660
Qi Yue is still angry.

200
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:17,700
I know.

201
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,650
That's why I'm waiting for her here.

202
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,740
Please keep it a secret.

203
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,100
Here?

204
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,500
Good luck to you.

205
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,900
Qi Yue.

206
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,020
Let's play Truth or Dare.

207
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,380
Okay, what do you choose?

208
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,580
Truth.

209
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,260
Tell me.

210
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,460
Do you think Lu Xiao went too far?

211
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,180
Cheers. Cheers.

212
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,820
Here.

213
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,140
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

214
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,610
Happy birthday.

215
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,180
Happy birthday.

216
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,100
Drink more.

217
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,100
What are you doing?

218
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,340
Stop drinking.

219
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,820
She's in a bad mood. She can't drink so much.

220
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,740
I'll drink.

221
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,010
Drinking is a man's business.

222
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,220
Give it to me.

223
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,660
The password is 666666.

224
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,980
Send Lu Xiao a message later.

225
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,580
Does Lu Xiao really like me?

226
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,380
Yes.

227
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,100
Don't you believe me?

228
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,180
Why didn't he come to me

229
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,660
on my birthday?

230
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,220
I'm going to the bathroom.

231
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,860
Can you?

232
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,980
I can go alone.

233
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,500
The plan begins.

234
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,580
Qi Yue.

235
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,860
Don't move.

236
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,060
Let me walk to you.

237
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,620
You...

238
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,540
You...

239
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,370
Why did you drink so much?

240
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,260
You must feel uncomfortable.

241
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,980
You

242
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,820
looks like Lu Xiao.

243
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,100
Be careful.

244
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,700
Watch the stairs.

245
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,100
Come on.

246
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,060
Lift your foot. The stairs.

247
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,220
Right.

248
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,500
Be careful.

249
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:38,400
[SHAN YU HAI]

250
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,900
Right, left.

251
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,980
Okay.

252
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:38,980
Bye.

253
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,460
Bye.

254
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,180
The dorm is closed.

255
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,980
We've asked for leave for you.

256
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,530
Don't come back.

257
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,020
Who are you?

258
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,020
Why are you so fierce?

259
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,370
Just go. Go.

260
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:50,980
Go. Go.

261
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,780
I'll take good care of her.

262
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,940
Bye.

263
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,140
Let's go.

264
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,060
Bye.

265
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,740
Where are they?

266
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,140
They all left.

267
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,420
Bye.

268
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,380
We'll drink next time.

269
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,180
You two

270
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,460
are so bad at drinking.

271
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,460
But one pretended to be a heroine, and the other pretended to be a gentleman.

272
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,260
I'm not sure about being a gentleman.

273
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,820
But I'm a heroine.

274
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:17,980
Fine.

275
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,020
You're the best.

276
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,450
Where is my home?

277
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,820
Over there. Let's go.

278
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,010
Who is this?

279
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,580
Do you like me, bro?

280
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,420
Why do I meet you everywhere?

281
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,810
Xu Zhaoyang, are you crazy?

282
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,030
Look carefully.

283
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,340
The one next to me is not Qi Yue.

284
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,540
Xu Zhaoyang, listen.

285
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,310
It's not my business how you play around.

286
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,320
But if you dare to get close to Qi Yue again,

287
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,090
you won't be able to go through the gate of Qingnan University.

288
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,770
If you say so,

289
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,200
I'll go find her now.

290
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,460
Try it.

291
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,930
Qi Shuo! Qi Shuo!

292
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,690
Let's go.

293
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,110
Go.

294
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,660
Let's go.

295
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,630
So much for your taste.

296
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,740
Easy. Easy.

297
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,920
Bathroom.

298
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,270
Bathroom.

299
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,360
I'll wait for you outside.

300
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,610
Qi Yue, don't drink so much anymore.

301
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,970
Alcohol will be metabolized by your liver and kidney.

302
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,280
Drinking too much alcohol can cause diseases such as liver cirrhosis,

303
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,960
cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac failure.

304
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,230
But next time, I'll be with you.

305
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,910
I won't let you drink so much again.

306
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,650
Qi Yue.

307
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,510
Qi Yue.

308
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,080
Are you okay? I'm going in.

309
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,090
Why are you squatting on the floor? What's wrong?

310
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,690
I can't throw up.

311
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,120
Let me help you sit down for a while.

312
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,420
Come again if you want to vomit, okay?

313
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,720
Be careful.

314
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,600
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:54,980
It's okay.

316
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,460
I'm sorry.

317
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,530
It's okay.

318
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,710
Why do you think it's okay?

319
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,100
We don't have any relationship.

320
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,570
♫I don't remember how long you've left♫

321
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,880
Then what is our relationship?

322
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,890
♫It seems that it's hard to be happy♫

323
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,930
Our relationship

324
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,910
is up to you.

325
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:24,350
♫I remember you said people can't live by memories all the time♫

326
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,130
♫But only memories can make me run♫

327
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,790
♫The past is like an impassable gully♫

328
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:44,750
♫I'll never have a chance to feel your tenderness♫

329
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:52,050
♫I remember the day when you turned around and kept going♫

330
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,830
♫You didn't stop or look back♫

331
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,240
Put it under your tongue.

332
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,670
If the headache doesn't relieve,

333
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,010
take another pill in four hours.

334
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,470
Thank you.

335
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,360
The God of Wine. Never get drunk.

336
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,130
You embarrassed the Qi family.

337
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,230
Learn from me.

338
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,450
I can keep drinking all the time.

339
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,300
You really disappointed me.

340
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,740
The God of Wine. Never get drunk.

341
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,770
The God of Wine.

342
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,080
Never get drunk.

343
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,190
Stop laughing.

344
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,290
Does it hurt?

345
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,300
I'm a man.

346
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,329
In my dictionary, it doesn't... It hurts!

347
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,740
How did it go last night?

348
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,520
You were alone with Lu Xiao.

349
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,069
Did anything happen?

350
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,700
Tell me.

351
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,599
Are you sure?

352
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,660
I'm afraid you can't stand it if you know how sweet it was.

353
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,980
I'm sure I want to hear it.

354
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,790
I hope

355
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,220
it was much sweeter than I thought.

356
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,120
He said

357
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,860
he loves me and can't live without me.

358
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,810
And he asked what our relationship is.

359
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,990
Anyway, he's a clingy boy.

360
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,010
Qi Yue drank too much last night.

361
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,900
She kept asking me to be her sworn brother.

362
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,300
She even said we should write a letter with our blood and make an oath.

363
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,810
But she didn't know how to write one of the characters.

364
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,650
So it didn't work out.

365
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,540
Turn it off.

366
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,900
Yes.

367
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,800
It looks like your sworn brother

368
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,520
should be here soon.

369
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,530
I...

370
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,920
Why? What do you mean?

371
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,680
I

372
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,940
will leave you two alone.

373
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,250
Make an oath with blood.

374
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,880
What do you mean?

375
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,470
Bye.

376
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,050
You look pale.

377
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,100
It's a little hot.

378
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,140
I... I'm fine.

379
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:37,950
Let's go.

380
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,040
I'll take you home.

381
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,210
Why is it ice water?

382
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,540
I'll take my temperature for several more minutes.

383
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,370
It's okay. Let's not take your temperature now.

384
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,260
Eat something first.

385
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,200
Just several more minutes. It's fine.

386
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,610
Here. It's not hot anymore.

387
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,140
I'm full.

388
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,020
I've asked your roommates to help you apply for leave.

389
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,410
You only have one task now.

390
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:36,960
Take care of yourself.

391
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,930
A late birthday present.

392
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,840
Could it be

393
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,280
a diamond ring?

394
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,030
What is this?

395
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,370
Carbon.

396
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,470
Carbon?

397
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,530
You are giving me a piece of carbon

398
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,470
for my birthday?

399
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,280
Your birthday is on the sixth day.

400
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,210
Carbon is also ranked sixth in the periodic table.

401
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,990
But what should I use a piece of carbon for?

402
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,670
After being crystalized under high temperature and high pressure,

403
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,760
carbon will become diamonds.

404
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,670
Get well soon.

405
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,770
I've told you my answer.

406
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,910
I'm still waiting for your answer.

407
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,310
You are a smart guy.

408
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,740
What answer are you waiting for?

409
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,000
Remember to have porridge.

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,920
I'm going back to class.

411
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,230
I'm freezing to death

412
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,070
just to leave you two alone.

413
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,220
Thank you.

414
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,940
Anything interesting?

415
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,280
Lu Xiao kept asking me for an answer.

416
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,590
What answer does he want from me?

417
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,520
Are you going to use quantum mechanics

418
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,370
to explain the origin of the universe?

419
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,790
Of course it's your relationship.

420
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,830
So he wants me to confess my love again?

421
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,890
It's right to take the initiative.

422
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,610
Who said that?

423
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,970
Love starts from a bunch of flowers

424
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,490
and a love confession.

425
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,300
Mom. Please. Don't watch too many romance dramas.

426
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,790
Then tell me.

427
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,710
What should I do

428
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,050
to make him confess his love to me?

429
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,060
First,

430
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,910
break his subconscious.

431
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,510
It means to arouse his desire to protect you

432
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,730
by having the other man.

433
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,110
Of course, it's a little dangerous.

434
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,270
Didn't you tell me to stay away from Xu Zhaoyang?

435
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,670
Who said it has to be him?

436
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,300
What are you thinking about all day?

437
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,220
Get me another cup.

438
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,370
Thank you, mom.

439
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,130
You're welcome, son.

440
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,590
Do you think

441
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,110
someone would confess his love to his girlfriend

442
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,210
in the aquarium?

443
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,520
It's silly

444
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,910
to confess love here.

445
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,270
[Mermaid Theater]

446
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,960
Be my girlfriend, okay?

447
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,140
Kiss.

448
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,130
Look, isn't it silly?

449
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,270
Damn.

450
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,080
Do you think

451
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,180
animals also have partners?

452
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,730
Of course.

453
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,710
Humans and other animals

454
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:58,840
are all lonely.

455
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,190
They all need partners.

456
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,930
The male must confess love to the female first.

457
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,370
You're wrong.

458
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,760
Many animals are very unfaithful.

459
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,190
They don't confess love.

460
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,030
They only mate.

461
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,590
You're really not romantic.

462
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,550
Don't forget to pay.

463
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,720
Be satisfied.

464
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,150
We are

465
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,670
both miserable.

466
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,660
You're drinking because you are in a bad mood.

467
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,130
I'm not.

468
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,740
What?

469
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,660
Are you over it?

470
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,300
You don't like your Lu Xiao anymore?

471
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,740
A gentleman helps others attain their aims.

472
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,090
I'm not that noble.

473
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,770
But I don't think

474
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,740
it's interesting anymore.

475
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,140
I have an interesting idea.

476
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,120
But I need your cooperation.

477
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,810
I suggest

478
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,580
you should be kind.

479
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,460
What are you doing?

480
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,550
It's...

481
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,370
It's cold here. Don't catch a cold.

482
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,080
What?

483
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,100
This is a bar, not a bed.

484
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,360
Then why are you here?

485
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,120
Sit down.

486
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,930
Waiter.

487
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,520
Hello, how can I help?

488
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,200
You order. I'm going to the bathroom.

489
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,970
What would you like to drink?

490
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,030
Do you have fruit juice?

491
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes, wait a moment.

492
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,890
The more the merrier.

493
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,220
Zhaoyang.

494
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:08,990
What are you doing?

495
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,170
Did I do something wrong?

496
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,260
Tell me.

497
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,350
-You're drunk. Let go. -Tell me.

498
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,400
Did I do something wrong?

499
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,330
You're drunk.

500
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,750
Let go of me, Xu Zhaoyang.

501
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,180
Did I do something wrong? Tell me.

502
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,370
I'll scream if you keep doing this.

503
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,790
Go ahead.

504
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,840
But they know me well.

505
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,480
Let go of me!

506
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,410
You are crazy.

507
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,120
What did you say?

508
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,750
I can't hear you.

509
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,550
You are crazy, Xu Zhaoyang.

510
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,560
Let go of me!

511
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,670
I'm warning you.

512
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,770
Stay away from my girlfriend.

513
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,310
Let's wait and see.

514
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,430
Are you crying?

515
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,240
What are you watching?

516
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,890
The leading actor and the leading actress have known each other for half a century.

517
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,910
They still keep in touch every day.

518
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,620
Wait.

519
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,110
You're a man.

520
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,200
You are crying in the middle of the night

521
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,560
because of a movie.

522
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,050
You have emptied all my love skills.

523
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,270
Is it illegal to watch a movie?

524
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,960
But writing to each other

525
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,430
is romantic indeed.

526
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,370
I've never received a letter in my life.

527
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,090
By the way,

528
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,710
how's your play?

529
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,030
The preparations are in full swing.

530
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,770
Do you know what an environmental drama is?

531
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,830
It's outdoor.

532
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,590
In my era,

533
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,150
there is nothing special about it.

534
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,320
You'll know when you get old.

535
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,880
I...

536
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,510
I mean

537
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,960
good things should be integrated.

538
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,310
Like movies and dramas,

539
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,700
philosophy and physics,

540
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,580
and men and women.

541
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,430
Lu Xiao and I.

542
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,730
Just go get him first.

543
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,090
He hasn't confessed his love to me.

544
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,890
What can I do?

545
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,470
Alright.

546
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,580
Just cherish it while you are waiting, okay?

547
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,630
Go to bed. It's late.

548
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,070
Let's keep talking.

549
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,820
No way.

550
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,590
Good night.

551
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,990
[I Belonged To Your World]

552
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,010
[You may not believe this. He learned his love skills online.]

553
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,240
Lu, let's play games.

554
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,800
No, I'm searching for information.

555
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,780
Why do you refuse me every time I ask you to play games?

556
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,880
You top students are so boring.

557
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,480
Does your girlfriend know you play games every day?

558
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,790
She can't know this.

559
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,490
[Baby]

560
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,980
[Baby]

561
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,030
[Connected]

562
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,940
Hello, baby.

563
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:30,710
What's wrong?

564
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,980
You didn't reply to my message.

565
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,070
Are you playing games again?

566
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,090
How is that possible?

567
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,640
I... I'm searching for information.

568
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,400
Let me check your computer.

569
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,210
Let me show you.

570
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,310
Let me show you.

571

[How to confess your love to a girl? These details help you win her heart.]

See?

How to confess your love to a girl?

574
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,500
Zhou Xincheng.

575
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,810
Damn you!

576
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,280
Baby. Baby.
