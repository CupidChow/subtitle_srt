00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,700
on space-time theories.

174
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,020
Because all our theories

175
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,490
are based on the theory of relativity.

176
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,580
We know

177
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,740
the universe doesn't rotate.

178
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,900
[Space-Time Theories]

179
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,220
Excuse me.

180
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,420
Your views are very novel.

181
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,980
Are you a student in our school?

182
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,420
Yes. I graduated from Qingnan University.

183
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,780
Here's the thing.

184
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,620
Our laboratory

185
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,060
wants to recruit some volunteers.

186
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,580
Are you interested to have a try?

187
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,370
Of course.

188
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:48,900
Thank you.

189
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,460
Good morning.

190
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,580
You are...

191
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,460
We met on the first day of school.

192
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,140
Did you forget?

193
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,420
What's the matter?

194
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,980
Nothing serious.

195
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,860
I just

196
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,180
like to make friends with pretty girls.

197
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,060
Do you want milk tea?

198
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,700
Thank you.

199
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,020
I don't drink sweet drinks.

200
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,820
Since you're not as good as Liang Yufei in all aspects,

201
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,100
let's not compete with her.

202
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,980
Do you like coffee?

203
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,020
What about juice?

204
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,940
You even have dinner.

205
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,060
What a coincidence, Lu Xiao! You're here too.

206
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm not disturbing you, right?

207
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,300
Aren't you studying space and time?

208
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,420
There will be a play about space and time in the south of the city.

209
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,530
I happen to have two tickets.

210
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,580
Do you want to watch it tonight?

211
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,690
I have to conduct an experiment tonight.

212
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,300
I'm not free at that time.

213
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Well...

214
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm free. I'll go with you.

215
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,220
It smells good.

216
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,180
What shower gel do you use?

217
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,620
Qi Yue.

218
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,060
Are you crazy?

219
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,740
Don't you like Lu Xiao?

220
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,060
Why are you following me?

221
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,260
Gosh.

222
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,900
You look so beautiful when you're angry.

223
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,100
You want to follow me, right?

224
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:29,940
Fine.

225
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,740
I don't believe you can follow me wherever I go.

226
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,860
Exucuse me.

227
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,260
You're not from this major.

228
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,300
You can't enter the lab.

229
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,460
They're too close while experimenting.

230
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,540
How's your study?

231
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,580
I have a question that I don't understand. I want to ask.

232
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,620
Here.

233
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,420
I can't enter the lab.

234
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,500
I can't enter the lab.

235
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,340
It seems

236
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,220
you need a helper.

237
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,980
Hello, sir. I'm here.

238
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,250
You're here.

239
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,540
Let me introduce him.

240
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,940
He is the new volunteer

241
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,940
in our lab.

242
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
He's also your senior.

243
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,020
He's an outstanding graduate from Qingnan University.

244
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,010
Qi Shuo.

245
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,100
I still need to rely on my son.

246
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,860
Xincheng.

247
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Give me your data.

248
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,820
I'll record it.

249
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,660
Okay.

250
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,420
Lu Xiao.

251
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,530
There's a wide variation in my data.

252
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,420
What's the reason?

253
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,020
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,700
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,660
Well,

256
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,300
there will be a comparison if you experiment more.

257
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,460
We met again.

258
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,340
By the way,

259
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,900
you are

260
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,490
Qi Yue's cousin?

261
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,020
Yes.

262
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,940

264
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,180
of your family are weird.

265
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,460
Our IQs

266
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,140
are quite different, right?

267
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,340
See? Am I right?

268
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,380
You like this book too.

269
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,500
Yes.

270
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,850
Unfortunately,

271
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,860
many concepts are still in the theoretical stage.

272
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,540
You have to believe in yourself.

273
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,660
You'll succeed

274
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,700
in the future.

275
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,850
How is it?

276
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,860
Did the plan work?

277
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,700
I completed the task perfectly.

278
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,500
During the two hours,

279
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,380
I prevented Liang Yufei from talking to Lu Xiao

280
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,890
12 times

281
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,580
and approaching Lu Xiao six times.

282
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,300
I also helped Lu Xiao with an experiment.

283
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,340
Not bad.

284
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,790
You're indeed my good son.

285
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,540
Of course.

286
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,860
And I got a perfect chance

287
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,660
for you.

288
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,740
The students in the lab said

289
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,780
they would treat me to dinner tonight.

290
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,420
Lu Xiao is going too.

291
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,460
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

292
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,220
I just asked Deng Shuling to have dinner with me.

293
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,980
You can take her with you.

294
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,740
OK.

295
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,540
Come on. Cheers.

296
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,340
Cheers.

297
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,420
Son.

298
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,180
How about

299
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,820
we play a game?

300
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,500
Let's play

301
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,900
Fold Fingers.

302
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,380
Each of us uses five fingers.

303
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,020
Let's take turns asking questions.

304
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,180
If you fit,

305
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,860
you should fold one finger.

306
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,580
You don't have to fold it if you don't fit.

307
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,460
If all your five fingers are folded,

308
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,820
you'll be punished.

309
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,740
Do you know how to play it?

310
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
No.

311
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,100
It's okay. Just pretend you know how to play it.

312
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,340
I'll go first.

313
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,140
People

314
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,420
who have never been in a relationship

315
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,460
should fold one finger.

316
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,890
That's a pyrrhic victory.

317
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,580
Me neither.

318
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,210
People who have known

319
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,780
someone here

320
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,260
for more than ten years

321
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
should fold one finger.

322
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,580
Qi Yue,

323
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,620
why don't you fold your finger?

324
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,180
I haven't known anyone here more than ten years.

325
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,860
Don't you know your cousin?

326
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,740
Cousin.

327
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,140
Lu Xiao, it's your turn.

328
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,700
People who don't know the third law of thermodynamics should fold one finger.

329
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,940
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

330
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,850
You targeted me.

331
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,980
Then don't blame me.

332
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,220
People

333
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,980
who never failed exams

334
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,570
should fold one finger.

335
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,220
What on earth...

336
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,020
I failed my exams before.

337
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,140
My mom didn't teach me well when I was young.

338
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,060
People who never earned money should fold one finger.

339
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,820
You...

340
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,300
You all earned money?

341
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,740
I worked during the summer vacation.

342
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,420
Me too.

343
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,180
Me too.

344
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,620
When I was in high school,

345
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,580
I worked as a model to sell books.

346
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,300
You also earned money?

347
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,540
Scholarships.

348
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,260
Okay, it's my turn.

349
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,980
If you

350
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,220
like someone here,

351
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,620
fold one finger.

352
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,340
My son was quick off the mark.

353
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,620
Lu Xiao.

354
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,500
Is there anyone you like here?

355
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,300
Not yet.

356
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,020
Qi Yue lost.

357
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,260
Let me tell you a secret.

358
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,580
Qi Shuo is my son.

359
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,460
What kind of secret is this?

360
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,180
Tell another one.

361
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,700
They don't believe it.

362
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,099
Luckily, they don't believe it.

363
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,260
I like Lu Xiao.

364
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,780
Everyone here knows that.

365
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,010
Drink wine.

366
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,620
I'm thirsty.

367
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,380
I'm leaving.

368
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,100
Bye.

369
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,340
Bye. Bye. Bye.

370
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,970
Let's get in the car.

371
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,460
Okay.

372
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,380
Lu Xiao.

373
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,180
I called a taxi.

374
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,380
Can you go back to school with me?

375
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,010
I'm a little scared.

376
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,250
What are you scared of?

377
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,580
They said

378
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,770
there's a senior in white at school.

379
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:03,850
Who?

380
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,740
It's a ghost who wanders around the school

381
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,420
and kills female freshmen.

382
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,540
Yufei,

383
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,620
you have to believe in science.

384
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,100
Are you afraid

385
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,140
that Qi Yue might misunderstand you?

386
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,300
It has nothing to do with her.

387
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,730
Are you leaving or not?

388
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,260
Go back with her.

389
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
The car is indeed a bit cramped

390
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,420
for four men.

391
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,980
Sir, let's go.

392
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,100
Bye.

393
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,780
You didn't go with him.

394
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,140
Aren't you afraid that Liang Yufei will take the lead?

395
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,180
No.

396
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,460
Didn't you see how Lu Xiao treated her?

397
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Qi Yue,

398
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,140
you seem to be in a good mood today.

399
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,260
Of course.

400
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,540
Didn't you hear what Lu Xiao said?

401
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,580
He said he didn't like anyone there.

402
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,610
What's there to be happy about?

403
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I know.

404
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,780
This means Lu Xiao doesn't like Qi Yue.

405
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,980
And he doesn't like Liang Yufei either.

406
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,380
That's right.

407
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,220
But why are you so sure

408
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,300
he doesn't like Liang Yufei?

409
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:08,740
Silly...

410
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,570
Little fool.

411
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,180
At first,

412
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,740
I was afraid of Liang Yufei too.

413
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,060
She stands at the finishing line.

414
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,340
But today I found

415
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,860
she's still on that runway.

416
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,340
And after running for so many years,

417
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,820
she's still at the starting point.

418
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,660
What does this mean?

419
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,180
It means

420
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,580
she has long lost her competitiveness.

421
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,250
I just confirmed that

422
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,140
Lu Xiao is on duty in the lab tonight.

423
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,460
He should be alone.

424
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,430
[Qi Shuo]

425
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,780
[Invitation]

426
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,490
Why can't I understand these words

427
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,700
when they put together?

428
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,420
The gap between people is too big.

429
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,620
My head is not small.

430
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,090
Logically speaking,

431
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,940
the capacity should be quite large.

432
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,100
Why is there not much wisdom in it?

433
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,460
How is Lu Xiao's head different?

434
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,470
♫I don't remember how long you've left♫

435
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,800
♫It seems that it's hard to be happy♫

436
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,130
I...

437
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,460
Well...

438
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,180
This...

439
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,260
♫I remember you said people can't live by memories all the time♫

440
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,650
I'm leaving.

441
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:35,040
♫But only memories can make me run♫

442
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,180
What's wrong?

443
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,780
Did you run into the senior in white?

444
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,580
No.

445
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,380
I was afraid of being checked attendance.

446
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,580
I ran back.

447
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,540
Let me tell you.

448
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,180
My favorite perfume brand

449
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,340
has launched a new product

450
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,100
called First Kiss.

451
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,860
I sniffed it at the shop today.

452
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,700
It smells good.

453
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,380
It's just a little expensive.

454
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,020
First...

455
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,740
First kiss?

456
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,660
What first kiss do you mean?

457
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,420
Perfume.

458
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,220
It smells good.

459
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,380
Jiajia.

460
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,780
Can I borrow your mosquito repellent?

461
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,820
The mosquitoes in early autumn are merciless.

462
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,180
They gave me a big mosquito bite.

463
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,820
Thank you.

464
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,730
First kiss.

465
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,180
Why did they mention first kiss again?

466
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,860
Are you okay?

467
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,860
You called the mosquitoes in early autumn First Kiss?

468
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,540
Should the mosquitoes in late autumn

469
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,180
be called Deep Kiss?

470
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,060
So romantic.

471
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,220
Can it help to stop itching?

472
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,620
Romance

473
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,460
can't stop itching.

474
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,340
But someone

475
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,180
must be in love.

476
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,980
Due to Kerensky's failure in the July offensive...

477
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,540
Should I tell her

478
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,100
it was an accident

479
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,420
so as to avoid her misunderstanding?

480
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,140
Later,

481
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,940
it was suppressed by the Russian Provisional Government.

482
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,220
Does anyone know

483
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,140
what this is called?

484
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,380
Qi Yue.

485
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,860
July?

486
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,420
Yes. It's July Crisis.

487
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,540
Lu Xiao has a solid grasp

488
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,620
of knowledge.

489
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,460
We need to learn from him.

490
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,580
I thought he was calling me.

491
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,100
Don't flatter yourself.

492
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,050
He was just answering the question.

493
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,100
You may need to go further.

494
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,740
Understood.

495
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,780
Then you can...

496
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,660
What a coincidence!

497
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
Let's have lunch together.

498
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,420
-I have something to do later. -I have something to do later.

499
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,100
Let me tell you a secret.

500
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,580
The department of physics has a party tonight.

501
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,380
I'm going to bring Lu Xiao.

502
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,060
I...

503
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,500
I have something to do.

504
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,340
What are you busy with?

505
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,620
I...

506
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,740
We agreed to have hot pot tonight.

507
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,620
What hot pot?

508
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,180
Hot...

509
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,820
Hot pot.

510
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,900
Beef hot pot.

511
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,220
Yes. We'll have hot pot.

512
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,940
-Let's go. -Let's go.

513

Wait.

514
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,340
What's wrong with you?

515
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,060
You were flustered when I mentioned Lu Xiao.

516
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,820
No, I wasn't.

517
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,380
Did you argue with each other?

518
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,300
No.

519
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,300
I suddenly remembered that I have to go back to the dorm

520
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,210
for dinner.

521
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,340
Are you going to the party tonight?

522
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,540
I don't like that kind of occasion.

523
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,420
Good.

524
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,620
I have Qi Yue's meal card.

525
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,420
I put it in the lab.

526
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,860
Take it with her tonight.

527
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,540
I'm not free tonight.

528
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,420
I heard that

529
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,300
the electrical circuits in the educational building will be overhauled tonight.

530
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,380
The electricity of the stairs and corridors will be cut off.

531
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,540
She's a girl.

532
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,650
She'll be scared.

533
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,900
Yes.

534
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,460
She's always afraid of her own shadow.

535
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,980
She has been telling a ghost story

536
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,460
about a senior in white.

537
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,940
You think there are ghosts?

538
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,820
I...

539
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,900
I don't believe it.

540
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,460
She believes it.

Qi Shuo

544
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,900
went to the party alone

545
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,780
and asked me to run errands for him.

546
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,860
It's getting cold today.

547
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,500
Men's words

548
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,980
can't be believed.

549
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,570
Why is she running?

550
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,780
What's wrong with the light?

551
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,020
It's windy.

552
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,420
Don't catch me.

553
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,740
Senior in white, don't catch me.

554
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,660
Please don't catch me.

555
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,940
Senior in white, don't catch me.

556

Don't catch me.

557
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,100
I'm Lu Xiao.

558
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
There's no senior in white.

559
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,020
You hurt your head.

560
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,410
Your feet are fine.

561
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,740
Why did you ask me to carry you?

562
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,260
It's psychological trauma.

563
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,900
I can't walk because my legs are weak.

564
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,500
Your clothes.

565
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,380
I'll return them to you after I wash them.

566
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,330
Lu Xiao.

567
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,260
Why were you there?

568
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,860
I was passing by.

574

Why didn't you reply?

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,820
Ignore her.

You don't like her?
