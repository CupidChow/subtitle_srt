00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,659
Mom.

173
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
Wash your face.

174
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,140
This guy looks...

175
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,780
Look.

176
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,820
We do look alike.

177
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,060
Big eyes, high noses,

178
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,220
and small lips.

179
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,380
Get out.

180
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,460
I'm going to wash up.

181
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,380
You...

182
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,340
You came all the way here.

183
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,980
Do you have business to do?

184
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,250
Of course.

185
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,090
I'm here to change your fate

186
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,580
and urge you to chase your future husband.

187
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,500
Stop.

188
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,380
I still doubt if you are my son.

189
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,220
Please believe in science.

190
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,140
Why do you carry this on you?

191
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,700
I know you too well.

192
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,460
I just want you to chase your future husband,

193
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,420
Lu Xiao.

194
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,780
Why should I believe the person you said

195
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,820
is my future husband?

196
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,460
You're my mother and I'm your son.

197
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,220
I know everything about you.

198
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,260
Besides,

199
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,460
I've investigated Lu Xiao.

200
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,060
He's very considerate, reliable,

201
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,020
and smart.

202
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,340
Stop bragging.

203
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,420
Have you ever watched romantic dramas?

204
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,420
The hero and heroine who're destined to be together

205
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,980
can meet each other everywhere.

206
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,580
When the heroine is in danger,

207
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,020
the hero will suddenly appear

208
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,220
and protect her.

209
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,530
Lu Xiao and I

210
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,700
are not only incompatible,

211
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,980
but also hard to meet each other.

212
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,100
I've never watched romantic dramas.

213
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,300
But I know

214
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,580
you can take a look at your phone.

215
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,740
What?

216
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,140
Trust me and take a look at your phone.

217
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,060
[Xiao]

218
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,420
Xiao?

219
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,580
Could it be...

220
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,780
Wonder Woman?

221
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,700
Yes. It's me.

222
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,580
How did he know my phone number?

223
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,420
I don't know either.

224
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,140
Maybe

225
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,490
there is no such a plot in romantic dramas.

226
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,180
Where are you going?

227
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,780
Take a taxi.

228
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,820
From now on,

229
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,220
we have to be thrifty.

230
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,180
Let's go by bus.

231
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,700
Let's go.

Are you a devil?

233
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,340
You insisted on taking the bus.

234
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,380
It's raining now, right?

235
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Are you going to go to the school with me?

236
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,300
No.

237
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,180
I just want to find a perfect time for you.

238

Lu Xiao, I'm counting on you.

239
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,180
Study hard.

240
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,660
Don't be late.

241
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,140

Why don't you have a boy holding an umbrella for you?

246
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,180
Take my umbrella.

You're such a liar.

508
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,700
Yes.

509
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,860
This is my home tutor.

510
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,660
Sir.

511
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,900
I'm really sorry.

512
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,220
I forgot

513
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,380
to tell you I'm not available today.

514
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,020
Why don't we study another day?

515
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,660
It's okay.

516
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,020
Just remember to do your homework.

517
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,460
I won't bother you, sir.

518
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,140
I'm leaving.

519
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,340
Okay, you can study next time.

520
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,100
Okay.

521
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,620
We're in tune with each other.

522
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,060
What time is it?

523
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,330
Mom.

524
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,810
I'm sorry.

525
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,620
I'm late.

526
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,580
You're here.

527
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,940
Our family

528
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,620
values rules the most.

529
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,140
Nothing can be done without rules.

530
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,780
Right.

531
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,780
Mom, you're right.

532
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,260
There was a traffic jam.

533
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,340
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

534
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,460
I also wanted to come early,

535
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,820
but my school was just over.

536
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,180
Which one of you

537
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,690
won the first place again?

538
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,940
Tell us to make everyone happy.

539
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,580
Grandmother.

540
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,980
It's after school now.

541
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,060
Can you not mention the scores?

542
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,860
Okay.

543
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,780
I won't mention it.

544
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,500
Here. Eat more meat.

545
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,660
Being a student is too tired.

546
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,900
Yes. No one is as tired as my cousin.

547
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,700
Yue.

548
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,060
Here.

549
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,860
Eat up.

550
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,940
After eating,

551
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,020
go back and do your homework.

552
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,420
You're so picky.

553
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,100
What if you marry someone in the future?

554
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,250
Grandmother,

555
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,540
I'm allergic to peanuts.

556
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,500
You're young, but you have many problems.

557
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,660
I'm done. I'm leaving.

558
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,780
Yue.

559
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,860
Impolite.

560
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,020
Why are you here?

561
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,860
I was afraid that grandpa would come back suddenly.

562
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,900
As a home tutor,

563
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,140
appeaing in you home is...

564
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,620
Are you allergic?

565
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,100
Did you eat peanuts?

566
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,420
Why are you the only person who remember it?

567
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,700
I'm your son.

568
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,700
Of course I know.

569
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,140
Let's go.

570
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,860
I'll take you to the hospital.

571
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,420
They are also my family.

572
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,460
Not only did they not know I'm allergic to peanuts,

573
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,180
but also said I was pretentious.

574
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,900
You said you came from the future

575
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,500
to here to change my fate.

576
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,740
Is it because I'm terrible?

577
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,460
I came from the future to here to change you.

578
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,780
It's not because you're terrible.

579
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,780
On the contrary,

580
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,530
you can go to a good university

581
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,100
and live a better life.

582
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,730
To be honest,

583
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,090
I haven't

584
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,900
accepted

585
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,970
the fact that I'm your mother.

586
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,140
Actually

587
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,540
I'm not mentally prepared yet.

588
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,060
No.

589
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,340
You'll become a great mother.

590
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,660
And now,

591
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,540
you can become a better self.

592
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:07,980
So,

593
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,580
don't be upset.

594
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,140
Let's go.

595
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,860
Let's buy medicine first.

596
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,530
And then go to this night's self-study.

597
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,220
I knew it.

598
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,420
I was just touched for a second.

599
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,980
If you want to be a better self,

600
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,340
you have to study at night every night.

601
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,540
Don't waste your time.

602
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,180
Got it?

603
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,740
Why is he sneaking around?

604
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,220
No way.

605
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,540
The curve wrecker also climbed over the wall?

606
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,420
There is such a place next to the school.

607
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,100
It's shabby and dark.

608
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,540
It has a strange smell.

609
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,980
What the hell is this place?

610
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,220
Why is Lu Xiao here?

611
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,290
Be careful, there's an explosion.

612
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,680
[I Belonged To Your World]

613
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,670
[If I get closer to you, will I get closer to the answer?]

614
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,500
Everything you want to know is here.

615
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,870
[Lu Xiao]
