No one will remember a runner-up.

173
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,580
But being a runner-up

174
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,380
should be easier and happier, right?

175

You're back.

What's wrong?

179
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Why are you crying?

180
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,860
I know you are touched because I cooked for you,

181
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,380
but this is what I should do.

182
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,060
I don't deserve to eat.

183
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,420
I'm at the bottom.

184
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,740
I want to cut off my lifeline.

185
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,340
Which one is the lifeline?

186
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,820
What happened?

187
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,620
Did someone bully you?

188

Tell me.

189
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,380
No matter how hard

190

why am I always at the bottom

192
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,300
in their eyes?

193
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,140
Let me tell you a story.

194
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,980
A father and son

195
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,130
had a car accident on the highway.

196
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,300
But the father was told the child was the doctor's.

197
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,460
Why?

198
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,260
The son was adopted.

199
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,100
Or

200
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,180
he has a twin brother.

201
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,020
You're wrong.

202
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,140
Because the doctor is a woman

203
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,340
and is the wife of this father.

204
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,020
She is the mother of this child.

205
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,140
So, look.

206
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
Prejudice is common.

207
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,260
When I speak of doctors,

208
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,020
you think of men first.

209
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,980
We can't change what others think.

210
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,860
We can only be ourselves.

211
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,740
Understand?

212
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,900
I will drink

213
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,620
this bowl of chicken soup.

214
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,850
Drink it while it's hot. Don't burn yourself.

215
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,900
Got it.

216
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,180
Why are you here?

I'm sorry.

Sorry.

223
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,340

It's me.

Please come with me.

239

I don't know what you're talking about.

241

You cheated in the exam

in terms of the last question.

Why would I cheat?

I've always been a top student.

245

Besides,

246
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,180
there is no need for me to copy

I didn't say whom you copied from.

Second,

being a top student and cheating are two different things.

Third,

to give you a drumstick.

Thanks.

This seat is not taken, right?

You are too thin.

Here. Have a drumstick. Eat more.

Human body fluid is faintly acid.

The hormone in the drumstick will increase the acidity.

Can you straight-A students

If you want to do something, do it immediately.

Hello,

344
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,300
it's me.

345
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,340
Is Lu Xiao there?

346
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,940
Okay, listen to me.

Go ahead.

You cook a meal for him.

349
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,260
Now that God has given you an opportunity,

350
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,530
you must seize it.

351
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,580
I've never heard of it.

352
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,980
I know.

353
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,580
You can't even distinguish green onions from garlic seedlings.

354
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,500
Exactly.

355
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,740
So,

356
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,540
tonight,

357
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,380
take him home.

358
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,220
Leave the rest

359
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,940
to me.

360
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,580
That's it?

361
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,900
That's it.

362
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,400
There is a mole. The deal is off.

[Qi Yue]

364
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,620
Okay, thank you.

365
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,460
I'll take you to a place

366
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,180
out of your expectation.

367
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,780
Your house.

368
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,340
Can you pretend that you don't know?

369
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,580
Then,

370
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,900
where are you taking me?

371
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,460
You'll know when we get there.

372
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,579
It's too late.

373
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,140
Maybe I should go back first.

374
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,300
Are these yours?

375
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,339
These

376
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,730
are mine, I think.

377
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,300
It's because

378
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,900
I'm too tired from studying.

379
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,380
I like to study things like quantum mechanics

380
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,300
when I'm free.

381
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,300
Help yourself.

382
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,460
Take a seat or take a look around.

383
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,500
No need to change your shoes.

384
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,060
I'm going to cook for you in the kitchen.

385
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,300
Can I have a look?

386
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,740
Sure.

387
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,260
I'm going to cook.

388
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,780

00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,540
He is here.

390
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,660
Why are you still showing off your cooking skills?

391
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,140
He?

392
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,420
What should I do?

393
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,700
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

394
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,860
Qi Yue.

395
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,050
It's my first time here.

396
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,730
I should help.

397
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,460
No need.

398
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,660
I can handle it.

399
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,060
Okay.

400
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,500
Quietly.

401
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Don't expose yourself.

There are several more dishes.

405
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,260
Let's eat.

406
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,220
What are you looking for?

407
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,260
Delivery boxes.

408
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,260
Am I that kind of person?

409
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,100
I cooked these for you

410
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,380
with my own hands.

411
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,940
They look delicious.

412
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,820
It's not easy

413
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,780
to hear your praise for me.

414
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,060
After all, you usually don't talk too much.

415
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,380
You have a talent for cooking.

416
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,460
I've been living alone since I was little.

417
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,980
If I didn't have the ability

418
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,380
to live independently,

419
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,060
I would have been homeless.

Have a seat.

421
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,660
I'll go get some rice.

422

Okay.

423

But it's too late now.

And today is not my shift.

425

I can't switch my shift with you.

426
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,300
I see.

427
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,860
Let me think about it.

428

I'm already at the downstairs of my home.

composed, accurate, and cruel when dealing with this kind of people.

That's how people are.

I never believe in the past rankings.

I only believe in the present efforts.

485
