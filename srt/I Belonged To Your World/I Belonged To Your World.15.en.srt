Let me tell you.

5
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,820
We were enemies.

6
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,460
Such cooperation will only happen for once.

7
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,900
Who wants to cooperate with you?

8

I'm helping my friend get her money back.

and I'll take his bag away quickly.

11
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,500
Answer violence with violence. Is that okay?

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,060
What do you mean by violence?

13
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,820
We call this revenge.

14
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,900
Yang, you're back.

15

Yes, mom

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,980
Mom, why did you come down?

17
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,540
I came out to welcome you.

18
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,180
Wait for me.

19
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,620
Xu Zhaoyang.

20
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,290
So you are really here.

21
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,380
Well, why are you here?

22
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,340
Hello, aunt.

23
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,460
I'm Xu Zhaoyang's schoolmate in college.

I'm here for you.

25

You borrowed 3,000 yuan from me.

26
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,620
Did you borrow money from her?

27
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,500
Why did you

28
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,740
borrow money from a girl?

29
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,060
Don't listen to her nonsense.

30
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,410
When did I borrow money from you?

31
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,140
Don't you remember?

32
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,140
Mrs. Xu, I forgot to introduce myself.

33
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,540
My name is Yang Ziyun.

34
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,260
Mrs. Xu! Mrs. Xu!

35
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,420
The money is her family's lifesaving money.

36
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,260
If she can't pay the bill with the money,

You said you had just got a scholarship, didn't you?

43
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,060
Mom, it's not like what they said.

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,780
Really.

45

48

Fine.

49
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,060
I'll transfer it to you on WeChat.

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,300
I transferred it.

51
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Girl, don't worry.

52
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,500

It's not like what they said.

I thought you weren't coming.

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,100
The saddest thing for a girl

74
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,420
is that you don't care about her at all.

Do you know the theory of black holes doesn't exist?

95
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,220
It's a hypothesis put forward

for the firewall theory.

What are you talking about?

The boundary of a black hole is called an event horizon.

99
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,460
According to the classic black hole theory,

100
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,380
all material including radiation

101
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,860
can enter the inner part of a black hole through the event horizons.

102
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,380
All radiation and material inside a black hole

103
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,740
can't go through the event horizon.

Why are you acting strange today?

The top-one type of man hated by girls the most

109

is the one who denies her

and thinks her career is worthless.

111
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,700
Why are you walking so fast suddenly?

112
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,740
Men should walk before women.

113
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,060
Are you going to work tomorrow?

114
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,020
I changed my shift and I'll be on leave.

115
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,900
I don't think it's necessary for you to work there.

116
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,420
You can't make much money.

117
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,580
A woman should take care of her husband and children at home.

118
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
Do you really think so?

119
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,930
Of course. Besides, I think a woman

120
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,900
should do well in what she should do,

121
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,100
and fulfill her duty.

122

because I want to tell you something.

131
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,660
I... I like...

132
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,540
You can't like me.

133
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,410
Aunt Shuling.

134
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,820
I'm sorry.

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,340
Qi Yue.

136
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,700
I heard you caused trouble again today.

137
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,020
That's called helping the weak.

138
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,340
I merely used my courage and strategies

139
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,460
to vent the anger

140
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,700
for a girl in our dorm.

141
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,060
Why didn't you tell me

142
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,620
in advance whether it would be dangerous?

143
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,700
Why should I tell you about it?

144
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
You taught me about it.

145
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,180
A boyfriend should protect his girlfriend,

146
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,540
and this is an important lesson in love.

147
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,700
Let me give you another lesson.

148
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,300
It's called

149
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,500
"Girs help girls".

150
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,050
Just be the man behind the big boss,

151
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,860
and that'll be fine.

152
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,700
A man behind the big boss.

153
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,180
What's the benefit?

154
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,820
The benefit is that

155
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,220
you can always lean on the big boss like a little bird anytime.

156
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,980
Qi Yue, there's a meteor.

157
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,380
Physics expert, that's an airplane.

158
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,220
It's a meteor.

159
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,580
What wish did you make?

160
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,540
I wish all my family members could always be together.

161
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,490
What about you?

162
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,220
I hope it can bring us to the future.

163
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,580
Fool.

164
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,860
This is the future.

165
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,360
A shadow suddenly appeared at the end of the road.

166
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,340
Guess who it was.

167
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,260
Xu Zhaoyang.

168
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,140
How did you know?

169
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,220
Didn't you go to block him?

170
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,820
Don't interrupt.

171
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,340
I saw that person from afar.

172
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,660
I rushed there

173
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,420
after I saw him.

174
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,980
Wait.

175
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,260
You were at the end of the alley.

176
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,380
Wasn't it too early for you to rush there?

177
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,260
What do you know?

178
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,380
It was called the run-up for our boss.

179
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,820
Can you show some respect to art?

180
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,260
I'm recording a video.

181
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,540
Come on. Let's continue.

182
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,140
Then,

183
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,010
standing in front of him, I told him

184
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,420
to give me all the money he had got from Yang Ziyun by cheating her.

185
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,300
Guess what he said.

186
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,890
What did he say?

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,130
[Xu Zhaoyang]

188
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,500
Xu Zhaoyang asked you to mind your own business from now on.

189
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,140
Otherwise... I can't see the following content.

190
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,100
Not this sentence.

191
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,740
Look.

192
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,150
[Mind your own business from now on. Otherwise...]

193
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,020
Otherwise, what?

194
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,700
See?

195
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,380
A string of ellipsis dots.

196
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,460
It's so childish, boss.

197
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,180
I suspect he's threatening you.

198
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,260
Threatening?

199
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,860
Qi Yue, someone is looking for you downstairs.

200
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,260
Who is it?

201
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,500
He's wearing a uniform. I don't think it's Lu Xiao.

202
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,730
Wearing a uniform?

203
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,300
Could it be Xu Zhaoyang?

204
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,700
How dared he come to the downstairs of our girl's dorm?

205
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,460
I...

206
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,500
Come on. Don't be afraid.

207
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,890
We'll go with you to accept the challenge.

208
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,380
No need.

209
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,020
I'll settle the grudges between him and me

210
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,820
by myself.

211
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,780
Be careful.

212
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,010
You shouldn't be here, right?

213
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,220
Your question is ridiculous.

214
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,380
Only you can

215
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,700
stand downstairs in the girls' dorm?

216
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,420
You can do whatever you want,

217
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,620
but please stay away from Qi Yue.

218
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,060
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,180
I'm not interested in her anymore.

220
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,020
But make your girlfriend behave herself

221
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,180
and ask her to keep her mouth shut.

222
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,380
If the amount of money obtained by fraud reaches 3,000 yuan

223
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,460
to more than 10,000 yuan,

224
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,340
it shall be identified as,

225
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,300
according to Article 266 of Criminal Law,

226
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,620
a relatively large amount.

227
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,280
[Number to call the police]

228
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,540
No, no, no.

229
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,020
What are you doing?

230
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,730
-The girls in this building don't seem to like you. -Scumbag.

231
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,980
He's a fraud.

232
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,890
So are you going to behave yourself,

233
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,100
or should I ask someone else to discipline you?

234
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,460
I don't want to stay here.

235
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,780
Qi Yue, when did you come down?

236
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,460
That must be Xu Zhaoyang.

237
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,140
What did you tell him?

238
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,060
I taught him knowledge about law.

239
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,870
These are for you.

240
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,850
They are...

241
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,160
You and me.

242
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,080
Why is my face

243
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,470
so big?

244
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,220
Why are you giving me these?

245
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,410
You wished that all the family members could always be together.

246
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,340
We will have more clay figurines

247
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,230
in the future.

248
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,060
But why am I

249
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,710
much fatter

250
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,560
than you?

251
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,910
Are you implying that I'm fat?

252
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,380
Of course not.

253
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,350
Because you said that

254
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,630
the man behind the big boss

255
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,550
should lean on her like a little bird.

256
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,270
You've been doing well lately.

257
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,450
The woman behind Lu Xiao...

258
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,500
[The Woman behind Lu Xiao]

259
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,050
Only she can think of this name.

260
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,640
I sent so many messages.

261
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,600
Why didn't you respond at all?

262
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,100
The door has been unlocked.

263
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,000
If it's 5,500,

264
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,140
we should start from...

265
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,510
Welcome back to the lab.

266
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,320
It doesn't sound sincere.

267
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,330
I'm sincere.

268
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,470
What are you doing?

269
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,190
She's helping me check the experimental data.

270
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,030
Let me do it.

271
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,910
Let me do it.

272
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,270
If we adjust the contour velocity to 6,000,

273
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,280
do you think

274
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,370
the accuracy is high enough?

275
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,010
No need to change the contour velocity.

276
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,860
I think it might be more accurate if you change

277
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,870
the sinking depth to 6.0.

278
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,760
You two are so romantic.

279
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,220
What are you doing?

280
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,890
I'm...

281
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,120
doing nothing.

282
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,440
It seems we did the best this time.

283
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,590
It's really about the sinking depth.

284
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,720
It's printed? Let me see.

285
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,400
Good.

286
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,300
Look. After the value of sinking depth is changed,

287
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,440
it's more accurate, isn't it?

288
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Enjoy your chat.

289
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,710
What are you doing?

290
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,580
The door is locked.

291
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,610
I was worried you didn't know how to use the new lock in the lab.

292
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,010
I think you know how to use it.

293
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,520
I don't know how to use it. I don't understand.

294
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,840
Are you afraid that I'll destroy the relationship between Qi Yue and Lu Xiao

295
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,820
or are you afraid that I'll destroy the relationship between you and Lu Xiao?

296
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,410
You think too much.

297
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,440
Now the love between Qi Yue and Lu Xiao is as firm as gold.

298
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,620
Really?

299
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,590
That's good.

300
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,650
It used to be a fair competition.

301
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,160
Now I disdain to compete with her.

302
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,440
Since they're a couple now,

303
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,700
I don't want to get involved.

304
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm not the heroine in a tragedy.

305
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,140
There's no need for me to compete with her fiercely.

306
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,420
People should think about problems from a developmental perspective.

307
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,810
They have their stories.

308
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,860
I have my own story.

309
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:52,670
By the way,

310
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,730
if you have time to keep an eye on me,

311
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,870
why don't you check

312
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,300
other unstable factors?

313
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,890
What do you mean?

314
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,110
All the people of our school

315
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,210
know that Qi Yue offended Xu Zhaoyang.

316
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,300
Don't you know?

317
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,470
What's wrong with you two?

318
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,940
Nothing.

319
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,000
Do you want to go to the exhibition with me?

320
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,810
No, I don't like it.

321
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,560
Fine.

322
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,780
I knew you would say this.

323
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,339
I'll give these two tickets to you.

324
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,150
I can't find anyone to go with me now anyway.

325
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,450
It's better to give the good chance to you.

326
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,800
Take them.

327
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,190
Thank you.

328
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,990
Come on. Have some water.

329
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay. Thanks, Mrs. Xu.

330
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,650
Please sit down.

331
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,190
Okay.

332
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,140
Mrs. Xu, you live here all the year round.

333
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,270
The streets are next to your house.

334
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,490
Wouldn't the traffic

335
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,840
affect your sleep?

336
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,930
We've lived here for decades.

337
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,940
We've got used to it.

338
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,430
Just now you said that

339
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,650
you are a teacher in their school.

340
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,750
To be exact, I'm a teaching assistant.

341
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,280
Teaching assistant. Do you earn a lot?

342
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,580
Not bad.

343
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,710
If a student gets scholarship every year at school,

344
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,400
can he be a teaching assistant after graduation?

345
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Well...

346
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,260
I'm not sure about it.

347
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,920
It's okay. Yang has his own ideas.

348
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,640
He is close with his classmates.

349
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,410
He gets scholarship every year.

350
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,050
Look.

351
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,270
Half of the things in this house

352
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,410
were bought by him.

353
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,660
By the way, what brings you here?

354
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,230
Here's the thing, Mrs. Xu.

355
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,330
Mrs. Xu, actually...

356
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,270
Why are you here?

357
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,620
Home visit.

358
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,510
Mom, we need to go out first.

359
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,820
Let's go.

360
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,220
Mrs. Xu, excuse me for a while.

361
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,070
Okay.

362
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,710
Remember to ask your teacher to stay for dinner.

363
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,220
Okay.

364
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,770
Go upstairs.

365
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,280
You're so dramatic.

366
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,800
You get scholarship every year at school，

367
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,530
and you're a good fellow in the eyes of your classmates.

368
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,210
Why don't you join the show The Birth of an Actor?

369
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,210
Why did you come to my home?

370
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,430
Nothing.

371
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,110
I'm here to show my concern about you.

372
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,790
What do you want to do?

373
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,100
I just think your mother

374
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,410
doesn't know what kind of person you are at school.

375
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,720
What did you tell her?

376
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,870
So there's something you're afraid of, too.

377
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,260
I'm warning you. Never come to my home again.

378
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,200
I can promise you.

379
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,510
But you have to promise me to leave Qi Yue.

380
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,150
You have someone you want to protect.

381
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,290
Me, too.

382
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,440
Okay.

383
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,120
I promise you that.

384
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,400
But don't tell anyone

385
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,950

386
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,140

It's raining.

But it's okay.

390
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,830
I have a big head.

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,550
I have an umbrella.

Have you brought an umbrella?

Nothing. It's a prank message.

Not just that.

Mr. Qi, I can drink water.

402
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,260
That's white wine.

403
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,400
Then I'll drink grape juice.

404
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,490
That's red wine.

405
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,970
Is this beer?

406
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,200
It's whiskey.

It seems I'm not very thirsty all of a sudden.

Young man, don't be shy.

Why are you wearing sunglasses when eating?

416
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,100
When men talk, women should shut up.

Are you Qi Yue's classmate?

Yes.

That's all. Let's eat.

420
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,440
Mr. Qi, I'm 188 cm tall.

I'm as old as Qi Yue. I'm majoring in physics.

He lives at No.51 Anzhen Road, Linjiang District.

What are you doing?

425
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,260
That's the plot in dramas.

426
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,440
When a man first meets his girlfriend's parents, he needs to talk about his background himself.

That's someone else's father.

My silly daughter.

459
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,840
I met Qi Yue's father yesterday.

It's a good thing to meet her father.

462

How is he?

Come on.

No.

It seems something is wrong.

By then, let's not buy beds.

474

We'll change them to tatamis.

475
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,900
Okay.

476
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,700
Will it be our house?

Of course.

What are you thinking about?

479
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,080
I thought there would be someone else.

480
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,020
There will be someone else.

481
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,660
We can make a baby room.

482
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,250
In this case, our son can grow sturdily

483

in the room.

484
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,740
When you talk about making a baby room,

485
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,660
why do you get me involved in it?

486
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,440
That's my ideal home.

487

Oh, no!

488
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,890
I want to eat ice cream.

489
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:01,910
Let's go.

490
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,090
Take me with you.

491
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,710
Wait.

492
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,240
Are you really her cousin?

493
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,080
Of course.

494
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,220
Why did you ask about it suddenly?

495
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,990
Nothing.

496
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,590
No.

497
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,100
I have to figure out a way.

498
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,630
I hope this gene won't be hereditary.

499
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,900
What gene?

501
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,030
did her father say anything strange?

No.

503
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,450
He just doesn't know Qi Yue well.

504
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,420
He was a bit forgetful, right?

505
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,790
So I suspect he has the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

506
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,770
But he's still young.

507
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,200
I know. I know.

508
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,260
But every time when I went to their home,

509
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,730
he always forgot who I am.

510
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,490
Besides, just think about it.

511
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,930
Did he even forget about which grade Qi Yue is in?

512
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,440
It seems to be the case.

513
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,070
Yes.

514
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,970
So Qi Yue's family doesn't know Qi Yue...

515
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,170
Qi Yue doesn't know it, either.

516
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,690
I think we should keep it a secret for her.

517
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,580
It's all my fault.

518
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,350
I was too nervous yesterday, and didnn't discover it.

519
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,450
Alcohol will make acetaldehyde dehydrogenase

520
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,960
produce more free radicals,

521
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,760
and then it leads to a higher amount of

522
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,400
the typical phosphorus protein for Alzheimer's disease.

523
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,980
Yes.

524
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,790
Thanks for your hard work.

525
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,930
You must take good care of Qi Yue.

526
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:26,790
Come on.

527
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,670
Qi Yue,

528
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,100
I'll take good care of you.

529
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,520
It's getting late.

530
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,030
I have something to do. I have to go.

531
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,040
You guys eat.

532
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,840
Where's the spoon?

533
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,110
Don't people in your era use spoons?

534
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,380
Where else do you want to go?

535
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,550
I'll go with you.

536
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,790
There's no spoon.

537
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,420
I'll get it.

538
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,940
If you eat too much puffed food,

539
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,130
it'll be bad for your health.

540
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,480
If you drink too many

541
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,450
carbonated drinks, your arteriosclerosis will get worse,

542
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,800
and it'll make you get hyperlipidemia and hypertension.

543
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,970
I'll also make you fat.

544
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,980
I don't recommend you to eat them.

545
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,960
Please line up.

546
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,850
No, I can do it myself.

547
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,210
Hello, it's 100 yuan in total.

548
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,700
I'm sorry.

549
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,590
My mobile phone is out of power. I can't pay.

550
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,860
I don't want these anymore.

551
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,030
I'm sorry.

552
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,010
Let me pay the bill.

553
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,740
Thank you.

554
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,310
Stop following me.

555
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,290
This road is too dark. It's not safe.

556
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,630
What do you mean by doing this?

557
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,060
Hit me mercilessly

558
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,280
and then give me a candy?

559
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,410
That's not what I meant.

560
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
Whether the road is dark or not,

561
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,110
I still have to walk alone, don't I?

562
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,750
You don't have to follow me.

563
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,140
I'm going home. Bye.

564
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,120
Aunt Shuling.

565
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,260
I didn't expect this would happen

566
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,610
after I came back.

567
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,120
I'm sorry.

568
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,640
You can't like me.

569
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,570
I'm back, mom.

570
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,940
What's wrong?

571
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,300
It's the tenth season.

572
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,580
Penny finally married Leonard.

573
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,110
You even cried while watching a drama.

574
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,750
I've inherited that trait from you.

575
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,600
Leonard said

576
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,570
the atoms had gone through 14 billion years'

577
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,830
time travel

578
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,220
to create them

579
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,900
and make them complete.

580
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,380
So you're an atom?

581
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,250
You're talking more and more like Lu Xiao now.

582
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,690
Look. You're an atom.

583
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,420
You came back through time travel,

584
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,650
and created us.

585
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,210
And we created you.

586
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,450
Do you think

587
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
Lu Xiao will propose to me?

588
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,740
Haven't you just started to date?

589
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,920
Isn't it too early to think about getting married?

590
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,250
If he proposes earlier, we can get married earlier.

591
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,220
If we get married earlier, I can

592
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,160
give birth to you earlier.

593
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,490
You bought so many delicious foods again.

594
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,180
I suddenly don't want you to leave.

595
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,490
Without being pregnant for ten months,

596
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,000
or enduring all kinds of hardships to bring up my child,

597
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,270
I can enjoy the filial service of my son.

598
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,640
I have to

599
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,990
enjoy such good luck for a few more days.

600
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,680
You've taken the snacks out and you just leave them here?

601
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,860
Who said that?

602
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll take a bath, burn incense and eat snacks.

603
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,000
Mom, I'm going on an excursion.

604
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,040
Why did you prepare so much food for me?

605
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,640
Do you think I want to

606
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,190
to cook for you early in the morning?

607
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,950
Eat more.

608
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,630
or your classmates will suspect that your mom abused you.

609
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,480
I want to eat fried eggs with tomatoes.

610
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,420
Why do you have so many requirements?

611
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,650
Look at you. You're abusing me.

612
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,420
I think I've owed it you.

613
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,400
I'll make you suffer when I get old.

614
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,000
[I Belonged To Your World]

615
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,020
[Didn't I make a wish? I wished all my family members could always be together.]

616
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,490
Don't move.

617
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,050
Baoguo.

618
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,870
Do you think my fingers are a bit too rough?

619
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,920
No, they're good.

620
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,310
Is my skin of the backs of my hands

621
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,240
a little rough?

622
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,880
No, it's good.

623
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,030
Can you look at me?

624
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,430
Plasticine figurines.

625
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,030
What's wrong with plasticine?

626
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,420
Do the plasticine figurines represent you and Lu Xiao?

627
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,910
We look like husband and wife. We're a family.

628
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,970
Good.

629
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,530
This is good.

630
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,590
Look at this.

631
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,280
Does it look like Qi Shuo?

632
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,300
No.

633
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,940
This is my favourite figurine in the Deadpool.

634
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,950
Qi Yue.

635
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,700
Give it to me.

636
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,850
I don't care. I have to use it.

637
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,400
Xie Jiajia, give Lu Xiao back to me!
