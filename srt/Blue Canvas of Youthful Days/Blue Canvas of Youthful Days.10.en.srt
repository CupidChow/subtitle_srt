"Blue Canvas of Youthful Days"

2
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,800
(Episode 10: Seven Secrets)

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,039
Study filmmaking?

4
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:53,413
Go for it, Qi Lu.

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,679
Like you said,

6
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,524
we should do what we love.

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,266
Love who we want to love.

8
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,959
Go get ready.

9
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,079
For what?

10
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:41,203
Studying abroad.

11
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:42,255
Learning the language,

12
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,461
preparing your portfolio.

13
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:44,719
It's all pretty busy, right?

14
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,150
It won't be in time for the

15
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,536
university entrance exam.

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,882
Students!

17
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,829
Let's draw for one more hour today!

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,694
Won't that solve one more problem?

19
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,214
- Yes!
- Right?

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,618
Yes!

21
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,266
As long as we don't drop dead,

22
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,634
we keep drawing!

23
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:29,607
As long as we don't drop dead,

24
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,914
we keep drawing!

25
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,585
Yay!

26
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,891
No need to bring breakfast today,

27
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,015
I fell asleep yesterday.

28
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,297
Let's go to the cafeteria

29
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:09,513
together later.

30
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Dad.

31
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:47,555
Dad.

32
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,563
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

33
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:50,944
Why are you admitting fault?

34
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:57,898
Is it because you did those

35
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,297
disgusting things outside?

36
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,680
Or because you knew she came

37
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:03,889
and didn't tell me?

38
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:04,913
Dad.

39
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,566
I didn't expect

40
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,230
and didn't expect something unexpected.

41
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,554
When did you start contacting her?

42
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,468
Speak!

43
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Dad...

44
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,245
Don't hit my face.

45
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,913
Other people will notice.

46
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,257
You think you're all grown up now?

47
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,270
One day, you'll grow old.

48
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,621
And you'll need me.

49
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,142
That boy,

50
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:49,978
Qin Xiao, right?

51
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,087
He's taking exams this year.

52
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,837
If he fails the unified exam,

53
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,471
he would be out of options for

54
00:05:57,496 --> 00:05:58,776
university exams, right?

55
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,977
He also has a grandfather.

56
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,314
Alzheimer's.

57
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:08,029
And serious coronary heart disease.

58
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:10,646
Don't you think his grandfather

59
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,334
has the right to know

60
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,950
about these photos?

61
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Dad,

62
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I was wrong.

63
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:21,355
I was the one who approached him.

64
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,504
- Don't involve him.
- Get on your knees.

65
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:29,883
Why did you lie to me?

66
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:31,007
Did I tell you to lie?

67
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:32,360
Huh? Did I?

68
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,641
Did I tell you to lie?

69
00:06:33,657 --> 00:06:34,985
Why did you contact her?

70
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,616
Why did you reach out to her?

71
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Xiao Lu,

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,788
I've worked so hard to raise you,

73
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:44,656
and you dare to do such

74
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:46,093
disgusting things outside?

75
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,312
Out there,

76
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,920
why were you so careless?

77
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:54,128
Dad, I was wrong.

78
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:55,816
I'll do whatever you say.

79
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,324
Then tell me,

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,105
when you met that woman,

81
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:03,495
what did she say to you?

82
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:06,457
She said she'd take me abroad.

83
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,129
Take me to find her.

84
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,832
I'll make her realize

85
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:14,948
the decision she made was a mistake.

86
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:18,434
I raised her to the top back then,

87
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,283
and in a few years,

88
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:23,566
I'll raise you to the same height!

89
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:27,258
Dad...

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,136
Do you really care about her?

91
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,305
Xiao Lu,

92
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,510
you and her are Dad's greatest works.

93
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,920
Dad,

94
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,424
I have one condition.

95
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,519
Speak.

96
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,247
If Qin Xiao can't finish

97
00:07:57,263 --> 00:07:58,419
his exams smoothly,

98
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,931
I will leave with her.

99
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,533
Even if I die out there,

100
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:09,797
I won't come back.

101
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,753
In that case,

102
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:16,937
all your “works” will be ruined.

103
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,696
I'll give you one month.

104
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:36,313
Both of you finish the unified exams.

105
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,252
Even if you're not ashamed of

106
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:39,720
the teacher who taught you.

107
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,493
After that, I'll send you to Russia

108
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:44,479
to study in Repin's preparatory school.

109
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,711
My best friend is there.

110
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,808
If you want him to finish

111
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,504
his schooling in peace,

112
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:53,378
the two of you must stop

113
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:54,914
contacting each other.

114
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,639
Yes.

115
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,405
Hello, Mom.

116
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:13,695
Do you have time?

117
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,758
I want to meet and talk with you.

118
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,609
At the same café as last time.

119
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,861
Why aren't you here yet?

120
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,618
(Haha, my mom suddenly said she'd
take me to ask about going abroad)

121
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:18,849
Mom...

122
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,655
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,124
Xiao Lu, Mom doesn't blame you.

124
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,428
It's my fault for

125
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:41,102
not protecting you well.

126
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,480
I'm already on my way to the airport.

127
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm leaving tonight.

128
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:48,255
Whenever you're ready to leave,

129
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,960
I'll come and take you away.

130
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,799
I agreed to all his demands,

131
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,799
just hoping Qin Xiao can pass his exams.

132
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,279
For the first time, I realized

133
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,480
I can't control life.

134
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,113
I don't even have the power

135
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:17,410
to protect the one I love.

136
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,941
I'll give you half a month.

137
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,535
Once the exams are over,

138
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,014
Dad will send you abroad to study.

139
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:35,674
Thank you, Dad.

140
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,240
Wow. You're up so early.

141
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,559
What's the occasion, Young Master?

142
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,547
Just bringing warmth to a test-taker.

143
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:10,684
Now that I don't have exam pressure,

144
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,135
I've to take good care of my boyfriend.

145
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,840
I'll bring you breakfast every day.

146
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,287
Yeah, right.

147
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:16,854
Who's always late to the studio?

148
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,168
If I didn't call,

149
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:19,615
you'd sleep past 3 p.m.

150
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,066
Brother Xiao, even though I don't

151
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,481
need to go to the studio daily,

152
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:23,614
I can still go to and

153
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:24,737
from school with you.

154
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,062
No need.

155
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,411
Don't you still have that

156
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:29,109
documentary project with Senior Bai?

157
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,476
That's just a hobby.

158
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,625
Of course, it's not as important as you.

159
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:57,687
Brother Wu,

160
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:59,552
that sneaky guy from the other day

161
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,679
seems like he is close

162
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,343
to that child in the Qin family.

163
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,718
So I won't be participating in

164
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:07,353
the art university entrance exams.

165
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:08,616
After the exams,

166
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:10,432
my dad will send me abroad.

167
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:13,124
Thank you for taking care of me

168
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,647
during this time, Teacher Liu.

169
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,814
That's a bit of a pity.

170
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,869
But you have your path.

171
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:25,916
It's a good thing too.

172
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,002
I'll still take the unified exams.

173
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
I'll get the top score for you.

174
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:32,254
You...

175
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,888
Learned to boast shamelessly

176
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,433
from that Qin Xiao.

177
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,879
Have some tea.

178
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:46,808
Do you need help

179
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,051
reporting to the police?

180
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,015
I was careless.

181
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,396
About you going abroad...

182
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,864
Is it really what you want?

183
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,279
My dad knows now.

184
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,724
At this point,

185
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:14,923
I don't want to affect

186
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,087
his exam preparation.

187
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,635
Besides, going abroad for me

188
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,659
is also a pretty good choice.

189
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,119
Alright then.

190
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,852
If you want to keep your skills

191
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,039
sharp during this time,

192
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,484
feel free to come back to

193
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,029
the studio anytime.

194
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,759
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

195
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:52,294
In a couple of days, are you going

196
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:53,637
directly to their hideout?

197
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:56,305
Brother Li has already agreed.

198
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,945
He'll let us in to film.

199
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,969
But he's just an underling.

200
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:03,039
I haven't decided yet.

201
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,469
It seems like we haven't met

202
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,219
anyone actually in charge.

203
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,985
Not knowing what they're thinking

204
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:12,570
makes it pretty unsafe.

205
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,141
Be careful.

206
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,159
It's fine.

207
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,096
Worst case, you finish filming and

208
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,627
head straight back to Beijing.

209
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,594
Alright, I'm heading out now.

210
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,414
Qin Xiao lives nearby, I'll go find him.

211
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:27,981
Go ahead.

212
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:29,506
Spend as much time as you can

213
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,654
before going abroad.

214
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:33,785
Alright, see you.

215
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:49,613
Qin Xiao.

216
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
And you are...?

217
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,008
Grandpa, I'm Qin Xiao's classmate,

218
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:57,416
- I'm...
- Oh,

219
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,734
you're Xiao Qi, right?

220
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,195
You still remember me?

221
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:01,906
Come in and wait,

222
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,456
I'll cook for you in a bit.

223
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,654
- Sure.
- Hey.

224
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,961
Xiao Tan is at home. Go play with him.

225
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,821
Got it, Grandpa.

226
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,337
Uncle Qin, you've got a package here.

227
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:17,237
Coming!

228
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,518
It's you, right?

229
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:24,659
Huh?

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,549
With Qin Xiao.

231
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,940
Grandpa's still here.

232
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,654
I asked him who it was,

233
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,083
but he wouldn't say.

234
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,526
Qin Xiao won't be back for a bit.

235
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,981
He's still doing extra

236
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:38,973
classes at this hour?

237
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,169
When he comes back,

238
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,708
he still needs to draw. Stays up late.

239
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:46,941
Grandpa,

240
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,175
let's eat first.

241
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,413
I already saved Qin Xiao's portion.

242
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,575
He'll be back late,

243
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,304
and I'll work on assignments with him.

244
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,695
Alright, alright, sure.

245
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,179
Let's eat.

246
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,094
Why are you here?

247
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,326
Where's Grandpa and Xiao Tan?

248
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,748
They've both gone to bed.

249
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,400
Why are you back so late?

250
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,153
I'll heat up some food for you.

251
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,857
I'm exhausted. Lao Liu was crazy

252
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:23,218
with the practice today.

253
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,231
Let me give you a massage.

254
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,989
Are you sure you can do it?

255
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,912
Don't you know that all art students

256
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:30,257
are masters of massage?

257
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:35,087
Hurry and eat.

258
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:11,453
Have you lost weight?

259
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,148
Must be from all the late nights lately.

260
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:16,176
Suddenly, everyone's pushing

261
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,246
themselves so hard.

262
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,359
Your hands even have calluses now.

263
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,696
Are you going back tonight?

264
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,359
Then...

265
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,664
Maybe I won't be going back tonight.

266
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,282
Is the studio off tomorrow?

267
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:36,655
Be careful.

268
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,204
Grandpa's still around.

269
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,220
What did your mom say?

270
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,662
She said I should finish

271
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,358
the unified exam first.

272
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,626
The day after the exam,

273
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,616
she's arranged for me to meet

274
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:58,093
a portfolio teacher in Beijing.

275
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:01,282
The schedule's really tight.

276
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,148
I might have to leave

277
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:04,416
the same day as the exam.

278
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:05,468
I'll need to stay in

279
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,523
Beijing for a while.

280
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:08,895
Oh.

281
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:11,102
I'll need to take a language test, too.

282
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,884
Leaving right after the exam?

283
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,039
So many things to prepare.

284
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:21,896
I was hoping we could hang out

285
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:23,247
for a day after the exams.

286
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:28,341
Yeah.

287
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,345
We haven't even traveled together yet.

288
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,157
There are still so many things

289
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:33,563
we haven't done together.

290
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,633
After the exams, let's do

291
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,243
everything we've wanted to do.

292
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,039
Alright.

293
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,119
Let's get some sleep.

294
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:46,655
I'll grab some pajamas for you.

295
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,664
No. Just sleep like this.

296
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:48,514
I don't want to change.

297
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:49,734
It's uncomfortable sleeping like that.

298
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,250
I don't want to get up to change.

299
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,320
It's fine like this.

300
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,359
Stop hiding it.

301
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,970
I saw it earlier.

302
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,220
It's okay.

303
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:15,358
It's all in the past now.

304
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,257
Once the exams are over,

305
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,062
you'll be free from him for good.

306
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,397
Why are you up so early?

307
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,139
It's not early.

308
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,506
Grandpa already went downstairs

309
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:55,635
to the store.

310
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:58,734
Still calculating the exam schedule?

311
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,585
You don't need those scores anymore.

312
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,396
Can't I be nervous?

313
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,954
I even promised Lao Liu

314
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:06,015
I'd get the top spot.

315
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,134
Top spot? You barely

316
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,907
show up at the studio these days.

317
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,327
Fine, top spot in the neighborhood then.

318
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,913
You're really nervous?

319
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:15,938
Yes.

320
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,655
Let's go out and have fun.

321
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,160
It's our last studio break.

322
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,319
Let's take a trip.

323
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,440
But it's only two days.

324
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,788
Do we have enough time?

325
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,439
We'll leave this afternoon,

326
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,456
spend the night, and come back tomorrow.

327
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,920
Let's go somewhere nearby, okay?

328
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,001
How about the place we went

329
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,181
for our last sketching trip?

330
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,375
Relive old love memories?

331
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,572
What old love memories?

332
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,280
So I'm just an old love memory

333
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:41,305
to you now?

334
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,064
Alright, alright, I'll stop teasing.

335
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:45,012
I'll head to the studio and pack up.

336
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,602
You go home and get your stuff ready.

337
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:47,696
Meet me this afternoon,

338
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:48,625
and we'll head out.

339
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:49,657
Yeah.

340
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:11,704
Hello, Teacher Liu.

341
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,260
Why are you back all of a sudden today?

342
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,690
I'm waiting for Qin Xiao.

343
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:17,563
We're heading out for a sketching trip.

344
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:20,400
Alright. Be careful out there.

345
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,887
Are your arms better now?

346
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:25,373
They're fine. Nothing to worry about.

347
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,793
The exams are coming up soon.

348
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:27,936
Take care of your hands.

349
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,038
No more basketball, hiking,

350
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:29,904
or any risky activities.

351
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:32,177
- Okay, Teacher Liu.
- Then

352
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:33,975
- we're heading out now.
- Ah.

353
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:35,015
Alright.

354
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,066
Hey.

355
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:43,184
Hey.

356
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:45,479
What's wrong? Are you mad?

357
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:47,910
Don't ignore me.

358
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,535
Hey!

359
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,230
You can't just shut down every time

360
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,917
you're upset and refuse to listen.

361
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,079
What do you think?

362
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:00,564
I'm a teacher.

363
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,203
I'm not supposed to reveal too much

364
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:03,622
of my personal life to my students.

365
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:05,415
There are personal matters

366
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,295
I don't want them to know about.

367
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,785
I don't think there's anything

368
00:23:09,793 --> 00:23:11,073
wrong with that.

369
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,474
Do you think I'm embarrassing?

370
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:15,090
No, I don't.

371
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,162
I've never thought that.

372
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,777
We just haven't properly

373
00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:22,059
talked about this.

374
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,074
We each have our own ways of living

375
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:25,762
and our own perspectives.

376
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,279
But that doesn't mean I'm ashamed

377
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,660
of you or that I don't want you

378
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:29,785
to meet my friends.

379
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,365
But with Qi Lu, you did exactly that.

380
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,084
I've explained this before.

381
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,888
Qi Lu is my student.

382
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,068
My only concern is with my students.

383
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:42,029
I'm a teacher.

384
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:44,638
Every word and action of mine

385
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,005
could influence them.

386
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,709
That's why I want to keep

387
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:50,335
my personal life and my work separate.

388
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,005
Can you understand that?

389
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,802
Come on, don't be mad anymore.

390
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,749
Let's go grab something delicious, okay?

391
00:23:58,774 --> 00:23:59,774
No.

392
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,252
You've been saying I haven't spent

393
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:02,231
enough time with you lately.

394
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:05,068
How about I take you to the zoo?

395
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:06,107
- No.
- Yes.

396
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:07,732
Yes.

397
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,546
Why are you sitting on the other side?

398
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:56,064
Don't you want to sit together?

399
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:57,970
I'm happy sitting alone.

400
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,446
Happy sitting alone, huh?

401
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:00,656
Then I'll leave.

402
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,970
Go ahead, leave then.

403
00:25:03,174 --> 00:25:04,554
Would you dare let me jump off?

404
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:06,517
Guess whether I dare or not.

405
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,603
Don't be mad.

406
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,799
I'm not mad.

407
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,119
Really?

408
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,119
I'm not mad.

409
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,134
How could I ever be mad at Xiao Tan?

410
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,696
The wind is so strong.

411
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,079
Xiao Tan, protect me.

412
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:24,032
- Huh?
- Need Xiao Tan's protection.

413
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,093
Beg me for it.

414
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:26,556
Beg.

415
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,266
Actually, I'm afraid of heights.

416
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,735
Really?

417
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:31,935
Nope, just kidding.

418
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,376
It's my first time on a Ferris wheel.

419
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:36,884
Don't worry, I'm here with you.

420
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:40,955
Look over there, is that

421
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,847
Qin Xiao and Qi Lu's house?

422
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,290
You really care about them.

423
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,234
They're my students.

424
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:49,451
I'm a teacher. What's wrong with

425
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,290
being concerned about them?

426
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:52,454
- Really?
- Of course.

427
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,407
I don't believe you.

428
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,968
You treat them so well.

429
00:25:57,993 --> 00:25:59,102
I'm their teacher.

430
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,644
It's normal to care about my students.

431
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,128
I saw this online before,

432
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:51,656
thought it was cute,

433
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,088
so I bought it.

434
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,860
What's with that look on your face?

435
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:58,299
Are you laughing at me?

436
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,454
You're not laughing at me?

437
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,658
You're really not?

438
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,901
You're not ticklish?

439
00:27:07,145 --> 00:27:08,224
No.

440
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:12,938
You're not ticklish?

441
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:14,413
Nope.

442
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:16,360
I don't believe it.

443
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,759
Xiao Tan.

444
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,631
Why don't you move in and live with me?

445
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:33,617
After Qin Xiao's exams, okay?

446
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,897
Otherwise, if I move out...

447
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:36,377
Grandpa won't have anyone

448
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:38,002
to take care of him.

449
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Alright.

450
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:44,288
After the art exams,

451
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,663
I'll move in with you.

452
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:49,155
Then you'll have to pay Qin Xiao's rent.

453
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,377
Why are you siding with him

454
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:52,696
and not with me?

455
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,280
Siding with my brother.

456
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,720
Side with me.

457
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,839
Grandpa, I'll be out tonight.

458
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,279
Xiao Tan also has plans tomorrow.

459
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,695
We can close the store for the day.

460
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,444
Don't go out.

461
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,319
How much longer until sunrise?

462
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,000
Didn't you check the guide?

463
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,328
Let me check.

464
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,519
I can't, I'm really too tired to walk.

465
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,539
We're here, look over there!

466
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Let's wait.

467
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:30,079
The waiting is the hardest part.

468
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,141
You've got a point.

469
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,985
Look, it's here!

470
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,892
Good luck on the exams!

471
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,878
Good luck on the exams!

472
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,640
In one year,

473
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,507
we'll get into the same university!

474
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,583
We'll both...

475
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:06,052
Do what we love!

476
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:09,294
And love who we want to love!

477
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,120
Qin Xiao...

478
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,831
Maybe someday after the exams,

479
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:24,163
You'll blame me for lying

480
00:30:24,187 --> 00:30:25,867
to you again and again.

481
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,964
But in the future...

482
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,185
You must be happy and joyful.

483
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:33,482
Pursue what you love the most.

484
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,909
No one can stop you...

485
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,236
Not even me

486
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:41,240
or my love.

487
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:17,185
I...

488
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,489
Just answered a call for you.

489
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:28,298
I...

490
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,160
Just answered a call for you.

491
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:39,309
Grandpa had an accident.
