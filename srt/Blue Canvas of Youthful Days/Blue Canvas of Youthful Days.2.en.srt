is the most direct way to understand this person.

314
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,860
He was bullied in the school.

Don't go too far.

You're a fresh graduate?

337
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,940
Obviously not.

339
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,460
when he took the college entrance exams,

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,400
he would have gone to college.

Huajing?

348
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,860
His mother graduated from that university.

349
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,560
After all,

350
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,570
it's the best place for studying drawing.

351
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,790
You sound like

352
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,220
you don't want to go there.

353
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,280
That's not it.

354
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,460
I'm just under a lot of pressure.

355
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,270
I want a duck egg yolk.

356
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,990
I want a duck egg yolk in my porridge.

357
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,460
You always take advantage of me, huh?

358
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,920
I always eat the egg white.

359
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,570
Here.

360
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,440
You talk a lot of nonsense.

361
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,330
I'll wash the dishes later, okay?

362
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,370
Is it good?

363
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,140
When will your individual exhibition open?

364
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,270
Do you want me to take my classmates there to support you?

365
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,360
Do you want more?

366
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,970
Let's go.

367
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,570
Let me

368
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,390
send you home.

369
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,730
It's cold. I can go home myself.

370
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,450
Tomorrow,

371
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,180
let me take you

372
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,590
to a place.

373
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,800
Okay?

374
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,420
Are you sure the door is closed?

375
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,440
Where are we going?

376
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,260
I'll give you a small gift later.

377
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,990
I'm a little worried about Grandpa.

378
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,380
It's okay.

379
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,960
I asked a friend

380
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,310
to take care of Grandpa.

381
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,380
Why won't you go?

382
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,460
Will I be left here?

383
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,630
Be good.

384
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,810
Go check your ears.

385
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,910
Okay?

386
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,020
I promise.

387
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,750
Have your ears checked

388
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,640
before fitting a hearing aid.

389
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,980
I'll accompany you.

390
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,810
Okay?

391
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,220
Should I wear it now?

392
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,520
Try it on.

393
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,400
We'll have an examination and go for a fitting again in a month.

[The Door Opens on a View of Mountains]

395
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,890
Can you hear...

396
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,240
Is it better now?

397
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,590
You can hear me?

398
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,010
Call me...

399
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,420
Brother.

400
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,570
Brother.

401
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,580
Brother.

402
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,110
Bro-

403
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,920
ther.
