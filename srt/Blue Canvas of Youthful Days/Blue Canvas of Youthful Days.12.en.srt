00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,395
(Episode 12: Comma)

3
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:51,435
Hey.

4
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,440
Sent by Lao Liu.

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,736
They say it can grant wishes.

6
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:00,232
Will you release it?

7
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:01,577
Yeah.

8
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:08,334
Let me have it.

9
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,081
What are you doing?

10
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:21,557
What are you doing?

11
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,089
Let me take a look,

12
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,988
- just a look.
- I'll show you.

13
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,140
(Color Test Materials)

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,696
I gathered some study materials for you.

15
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:48,054
I'm not done yet.

16
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,165
I'll send them to you when I'm finished.

17
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:52,238
Did Qin Xiao tell you?

18
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:55,103
No, I overheard it.

19
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:57,118
I didn't mean to.

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,279
Thank you.

21
00:02:04,932 --> 00:02:06,411
- Sun Xiaorui.
- Huh?

22
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,436
Tomorrow's the exam day.

23
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:12,568
- I want to tell you something.
- Jiayu,

24
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:13,869
I can't think about

25
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,119
these things right now.

26
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,931
I just want to get

27
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:19,190
into a good university.

28
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,497
Do your best on the exam tomorrow.

29
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,770
It's too cold.

30
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,716
I'm heading inside.

31
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,235
Wei Jiayu.

32
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:08,875
If we get into the same university,

33
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,852
I'll reconsider what you said to me.

34
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,213
Do your best to draw.

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,732
Gather around.

36
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,385
Our exam is the day after tomorrow.

37
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:48,110
Remember to print the admission tickets.

38
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,992
Don't forget.

39
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,120
The studio will arrange

40
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,440
transportation at 8 a.m.

41
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:55,520
For many of you,

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,816
this unified exam marks

43
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,395
the end of your art exam journey.

44
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,193
That's all I have to say.

45
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:05,670
Dismissed.

46
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:21,380
Lao Liu.

47
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,756
First time hearing you call me that.

48
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,260
Teacher Liu.

49
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,115
After the exam, I'll be leaving.

50
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,629
Can you help Qin Xiao?

51
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,082
Help him get through this exam

52
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:42,285
successfully this year.

53
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:52,396
Are you going abroad with your dad?

54
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,638
I promised him

55
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,365
I wouldn't contact Qin Xiao anymore.

56
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,320
So if he tries to reach out to me,

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,279
can you talk to him for me?

58
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,375
Teacher Liu,

59
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,892
Qin Xiao will be very upset,

60
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,175
and he'll hate me, won't he?

61
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,855
You're both still young.

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,108
There's a long road ahead in life.

63
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,217
I thought I'd be able to look after you,

64
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:44,389
but I ended up being no help at all.

65
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:49,686
Can I really trust you?

66
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,815
Sometimes, I wonder,

67
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,772
being by your side,

68
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,647
is it right or wrong?

69
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:03,530
Qi Lu,

70
00:06:03,991 --> 00:06:06,358
the best thing that happened this year

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
was meeting you.

72
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:38,890
Goodnight.

73
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,098
Goodnight.

74
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,645
Let's go, let's go.

75
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,358
Gentlemen and ladies, let's move.

76
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,295
I'm not hungry.

77
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,254
Eat something.

78
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,450
Otherwise, your stomach might

79
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:57,606
hurt during the exam.

80
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:12,119
Everyone, listen to me for a moment.

81
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,338
Many of you have worked hard

82
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:15,736
for six months.

83
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,127
Spent half a year painting

84
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:18,131
poisoned apples

85
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:20,225
all for today's exam.

86
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,858
So, I hope all of you stay calm.

87
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,516
Don't be nervous.

88
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,499
Treat it like the usual

89
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:28,507
painting sessions in the studio.

90
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:29,952
If there's any problem,

91
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,056
communicate with the exam proctor.

92
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,343
When submitting your work,

93
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:34,816
be mindful of the edges.

94
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,795
Don't let your exam sheet get smudged.

95
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,608
Time, make sure you watch the time.

96
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,335
It's okay if your drawing isn't perfect.

97
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,895
But don't leave it unfinished.

98
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,802
Finish everything that's required.
Understood?

99
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:46,342
Understood!

100
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,833
It's the first time I've seen

101
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,262
teacher Liu so serious.

102
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:52,231
These six months have been

103
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:53,361
tough for all of you.

104
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:54,559
Success or failure depends

105
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:55,584
on this moment.

106
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,006
- Do your best!
- Do our best!

107
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:03,108
Do your best, Brother Xiao!

108
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,004
(Admission ticket)

109
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:28,739
Brought your exam admission ticket?

110
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,014
Yes.

111
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,910
You've asked three times now.

112
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,948
Are you nervous?

113
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,666
A little bit.

114
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,723
First, I will show you

115
00:08:57,748 --> 00:09:00,042
(Shandong Provincial 2017 Art Joint Examination)
the sealed exam envelope.

116
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,614
Please pass the exam papers and topics.

117
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,550
Start after hearing the bell.

118
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:07,126
Next, I will read the exam rules.

119
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:10,221
First, attend the exam at

120
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,879
the specified time and location.

121
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:14,213
Secondly, candidates are

122
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,175
only allowed to...

123
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,166
Secondly, candidates are only allowed to

124
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:19,816
bring materials specified for the exam,

125
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,614
such as painting tools,

126
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,579
boards, easels, and paints.

127
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,787
Focus on creating a sense

128
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:25,975
of volume and texture.

129
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,479
If you're unsure how to draw,

130
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,916
start by copying.

131
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,205
Understand what makes a good first.

132
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:33,984
Then your hands can follow.

133
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:35,704
If you can't manage basic black, white,

134
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,574
and gray

135
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,868
over-detailing highlights

136
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,665
and random smudges.

137
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,763
Put down your pens and submit your work.

138
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:17,059
Your plane ticket has been booked.

139
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,346
Tomorrow after the exam is over,
the last gate...

140
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:21,840
I'll come pick you up and
take you to the airport.

141
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,562
So, how was it?

142
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,055
Not bad, maybe.

143
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,153
The moment I saw the question,
I knew you can do it.

144
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:29,824
No, no.

145
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,603
Tomorrow is the last day of

146
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:32,908
the color exam.

147
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,775
I hope you, who inherited

148
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,816
Teacher Xiao Qi's skills,

149
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,040
perform brilliantly.

150
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,246
Absolutely.

151
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,879
But unfortunately, the set of brushes

152
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,738
Teacher Xiao Qi gave me is at home.

153
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,465
You head back to the dorm first.

154
00:10:44,488 --> 00:10:45,896
I'll go buy some fruit.

155
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Alright.

156
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,765
What's going on?

157
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,172
How does it take this long to buy fruit?

158
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:14,998
Still not back?

159
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:16,535
Don't worry, Brother Xiao.

160
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,094
I went back to get that set of brushes

161
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,744
you're comfortable using.
Just wait for me.

162
00:11:19,768 --> 00:11:20,815
Come back here.

163
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,976
It's fine, I'm already here

164
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:22,869
looking for it.

165
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,836
Stay where you are, I'll come find you.

166
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,743
Why are you in such a rush?

167
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,581
It's nothing.

168
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:34,728
I just got a little scared.

169
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:36,377
It's too chaotic around here at night.

170
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:37,587
I'm worried about you being alone.

171
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:39,002
Haven't I been coming here

172
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:40,176
at night before?

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,416
You're a candidate now.

174
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,861
I need to protect you well.

175
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,157
One candidate protecting another?

176
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,439
That's an easy way for

177
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:47,658
both of us to go down.

178
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,008
Run!

179
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,524
- Hey, you two! Don't run!
- Hey!

180
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,001
Quick, quick, quick!

181
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,165
Is that Qi Lu?

182
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,232
You ruin Brother Wu's plans

183
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:14,334
and still want to escape?

184
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:40,774
The cops are here!

185
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,509
Let's go!

186
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:44,673
Don't run!

187
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:45,757
Stop right there!

188
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:47,399
Stop! Don't go that way!

189
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:49,562
Catch them, quickly!

190
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:01,655
Are you okay?

191
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,776
Is everyone alright?

192
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,296
I'm fine.

193
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:08,015
Just that Qin Xiao's brush holder fell.

194
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,281
Not sure where the brushes ended up.

195
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:12,858
Let's go. I'll take Qin Xiao to get

196
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,100
the brushes at my house.

197
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,453
Teacher Liu, I'll head back first.

198
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,570
Alright, head back and get some rest.

199
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,136
Don't let this incident affect you.

200
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,073
Got it, Teacher Liu.

201
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,810
Where are you? Still not back?

202
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:27,435
Lao Liu held me up.

203
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,052
Forbidding me to sleep late before exam.

204
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,092
He's taking me straight

205
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,029
to the exam tomorrow.

206
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,053
Alright then.

207
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,076
Don't be late tomorrow.

208
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,533
Remember to bring breakfast

209
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:36,555
for Teacher Xiao Qi.

210
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,521
Certainly.

211
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,873
Why isn't he here yet?

212
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:48,271
(Shandong Provincial
2017 Art Joint Examination)

213
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,815
Where's Qin Xiao?

214
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,886
He had a stomachache and

215
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,018
insisted on going to the bathroom.

216
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,261
Teacher Liu's been driving him

217
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:54,176
around looking for one.

218
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,959
He's so generous.

219
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,269
Go inside.

220
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:59,004
They said you don't need to wait.

221
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,670
I'll wait a bit longer.

222
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,295
Go in.

223
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:06,896
Teacher Liu will be mad if he finds out.

224
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,748
Alright then. Tell them to hurry up.

225
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:10,991
Hey.

226
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,951
Qin Xiao's breakfast for you.

227
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,240
Alright, you can head back now.

228
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,222
Actually...

229
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,214
I could wait for him.

230
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,503
I could wait for him.

231
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,620
But I'm so scared.

232
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:35,191
And I don't want to lie to him again.

233
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,607
Alright, everyone, time's up.

234
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:57,232
Hand in your papers.

235
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:59,706
Stop painting and hand in your papers.

236
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,441
The flight is at 7 PM tonight.

237
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:02,776
From Quanshan Airport.

238
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,639
It's a two-hour drive to get there.

239
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,709
Once the exam's over,

240
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,176
come out quickly, don't dawdle.

241
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,443
I'll be waiting for you outside

242
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,490
the exam hall.

243
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:10,662
Don't contact anyone.

244
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,553
I wish time could freeze

245
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:17,349
at some moment before the exam.

246
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,680
A moment with him.

247
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,152
Did you empty out the convenience store?

248
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:24,305
Once I get into university,

249
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:26,140
I'll get to see you every day, right?

250
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,089
Sure.

251
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,379
Just worried we might be

252
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:31,755
too busy by then.

253
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:33,262
Once the unified exams are over,

254
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:34,310
you'll go to Beijing to

255
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,229
prepare your portfolio.

256
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,441
I'll visit you a day early

257
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:37,692
when it's time for my exam.

258
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:39,207
We can even go sightseeing.

259
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:41,961
Alright.

260
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,694
I'll treat you to a big meal then.

261
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,003
Always thinking about food.

262
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,433
Qin Xiao.

263
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,308
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,120
This time, I'm the one lying.

265
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,854
Delete everything on the phone. Or...

266
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,731
Have Xiao Zhang buy you

267
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,263
a new phone later.

268
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,879
The sim card...

269
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,136
Once you're in Russia,

270
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,575
we'll get you a new one.

271
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,480
This sim, toss it away later.

272
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,277
After you leave, cut all ties.

273
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,253
It's for your own good.

274
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,847
Alright, Dad.

275
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:32,576
Focus on your art after you leave.

276
00:17:32,847 --> 00:17:34,701
Thank you, Dad.

277
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,840
Does it matter what someone

278
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,457
who has only been living with you

279
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:45,754
for three months thinks of you?

280
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:35,848
What are you thinking about?

281
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,280
Memorizing vocabulary.

282
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,599
What?

283
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,919
Qin Xiao is gone.

284
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,223
If Qi Lu asks me,

285
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,679
what should I say?

286
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,985
Qin Xiao is gone.

287
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,045
Where did he go?

288
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:53,133
I don't know.

289
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:06,240
- So, how was it?
- Not bad, maybe.

290
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,134
The moment I saw the question,
I knew you can do it.

291
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,334
It was alright.

292
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,744
Tomorrow is the last day of

293
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:11,969
the color exam.

294
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,213
I'll go buy some fruit.

295
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:16,728
You head back to the dorm first.

296
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:17,752
Okay.

297
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:18,825
I'm off.

298
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,084
How does it take this long to buy fruit?

299
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,256
Still not back?

300
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,895
Don't worry, Brother Xiao.

301
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,639
I went back to get that set of brushes

302
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,186
you're comfortable using.
Just wait for me.

303
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,027
Hey, Lao Liu.

304
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,028
Someone's looking for trouble in

305
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,020
the old village area. Qi Lu doesn't know

306
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:41,919
he went back alone.
I'm going to find him.

307
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,786
If I don't reply,

308
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:43,754
report it to the police.

309
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:46,094
Don't go! It's dangerous. Stay put.

310
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,320
It's chaotic here at night.
You're alone, and I'm worried.

311
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
One candidate protecting another?

312
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,418
- An easy way for both of us to go down.
- You ruin Brother Wu's plans

313
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,574
and still want to escape?

314
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:00,106
Hey! Call the police!

315
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,800
Stop running! Hey, stop!

316
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,599
You all stay where you are! Don't run!

317
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,067
Don't go that way!

318
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,903
Catch them, quickly!

319
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,450
Is everyone alright?

320
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,652
Hand...

321
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:14,805
Does it hurt a lot?

322
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,114
Hand.

323
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,864
Keep it from Qi Lu.

324
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,239
Is everyone alright?

325
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,288
Let's go. Come get the brushes

326
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:26,337
at my house.

327
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,599
Teacher Liu, I'll head back now.

328
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,800
Don't let this incident affect you.

329
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,638
Yes, teacher Liu.

330
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,159
How's your hand?

331
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:47,934
It hurts. I can't move it.

332
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:50,605
Lao Liu, I don't think

333
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,816
I can take the exam.

334
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,270
Don't talk nonsense.

335
00:20:53,278 --> 00:20:54,574
Let's go to the hospital.

336
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:06,575
(Emergency building)

337
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,833
Where are you? Still not back?

338
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,295
Lao Liu held me up.

339
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,574
Forbidding me to sleep late.

340
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,700
Alright then.

341
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:14,919
Don't be late tomorrow.

342
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,091
Don't forget breakfast for Teacher Qi.

343
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,888
Certainly.

344
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,735
Didn't I tell you not

345
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:29,844
to act impulsively?

346
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,610
Didn't I tell you to wait

347
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:32,758
until I got there?

348
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,415
You've worked hard for half a year,

349
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:37,204
and this is your last day, Qin Xiao!

350
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:41,572
I couldn't not go find him.

351
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,033
He's just taking the unified exam

352
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:46,298
as a formality before going abroad.

353
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:47,719
And you?

354
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:50,347
You've bet half your life on this!

355
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:52,957
At least he has

356
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:54,154
his family to back him up.

357
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:55,550
Qin Xiao, have you thought about

358
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,832
what comes next for you?

359
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,277
Huh?

360
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:06,386
(Shandong Provincial
2017 Art Joint Examination)

361
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:08,431
Where's Qin Xiao?

362
00:22:08,456 --> 00:22:09,846
He had a stomachache and

363
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:11,627
insisted on going to the bathroom.

364
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:15,885
Teacher Liu's been driving him

365
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,137
around looking for one.

366
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,331
Qin Xiao's breakfast for you.

367
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,776
Alright, you can head back now.

368
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:43,969
Lao Liu.

369
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,458
If he knows I can't get into university,

370
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,685
he won't go abroad with his mom.

371
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,208
In the future,

372
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:58,679
he'll still be controlled by his dad.

373
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,911
He...

374
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,934
Lao Liu.

375
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,825
Help me keep this from Qi Lu.

376
00:23:19,307 --> 00:23:21,481
Don't let it affect him.

377
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:01,560
Why?

378
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:07,433
Why aren't you happy about becoming

379
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:08,721
the landlord instead of a tenant?

380
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:10,442
What do you mean?

381
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,334
I don't want to stay here anymore.

382
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,934
I want a change of environment.

383
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,778
Go traveling?

384
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,360
Not coming back.

385
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:20,997
Why?

386
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:24,924
I'm afraid I'll resent him.

387
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,044
Who?

388
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:27,560
Qi Lu?

389
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:31,841
I don't want to retake

390
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:33,185
the exam for another year.

391
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,537
People my age are almost

392
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:36,912
done with university.

393
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,130
I'm afraid that in the future,

394
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,388
when things don't go my way,

395
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,849
I'll blame it all on him.

396
00:24:52,904 --> 00:24:55,356
I'm afraid I'll blame him.

397
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,334
That's all in your imagination.

398
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,731
You don't have to leave.

399
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:08,794
I'm afraid that if I stay,

400
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:10,174
and he finds out I can't get

401
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,368
into Hua Jing University,

402
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,199
he won't go with his mom.

403
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:15,197
And he'll drift further and further away

404
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,813
from what he loves.

405
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,639
So you've already made up your mind.

406
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,599
You're just here to tell me about it.

407
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,177
No.

408
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:28,280
I was hoping you could help me.

409
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,000
If he comes looking for me...

410
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,439
Help me keep it from him.

411
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,624
It's okay.

412
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,702
Qi Lu probably won't call back.

413
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:56,951
Why not?

414
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,760
Qi Lu...

415
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,560
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,480
I lied to you again.

417
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,234
Mhm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

418
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:41,585
I just got back.

419
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,524
There's a project here, so I thought I'd

420
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:44,712
take the chance to visit.

421
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,438
Wanted to see if the places I used

422
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:48,192
to play at as a kid have changed.

423
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:51,518
Okay, okay. See you tomorrow.

424
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:22,502
(Qin Xiao used the first-place result in
the special selection exam

425
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,583
to pass the Huajing
University entrance exam)

426
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,307
(With the help of Teacher Liu,
he passed the exam

427
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:28,294
and was accepted into
Huajing University)

428
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,216
(Qi Lu attended the preparatory course

429
00:28:30,232 --> 00:28:32,028
of Repin as arranged by his father)

430
00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:33,325
(The following year,
he submitted a proposal

431
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:35,888
to the University of Southern California
for film directing)

432
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,349
(with the help of his mother,

433
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:38,997
he completed his studies in America)

434
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,414
Hungry?

435
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,301
I'll cook something for you, okay?

436
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:48,761
Do you want spicy or sweet?

437
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:49,786
Either is fine.

438
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,559
Alright, I'll cook something.

439
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:55,621
But I don't have the strength right now.

440
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,348
Help me cook.

441
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:10,684
Three, two, one, action.

442
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,215
This spot works.

443
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,574
That's a wrap. Cut!

444
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,942
Thank you, Director Qi!

445
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,285
All done, Director Qi?

446
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,760
It's a wrap. I'm exhausted.

447
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:31,472
- How was it?
- How was it?

448
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,210
How was it?

449
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:36,595
What did you teach them to draw today?

450
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:39,153
It went well. Taught them gouache.

451
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,326
Gouache?

452
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:42,107
I haven't painted in a long time.

453
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,536
What do you want for dinner tonight?

454
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:44,865
Whatever you feel like eating,

455
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:46,135
I'll make it for you.

456
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,692
I want to eat...

457
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,280
Braised pork.

458
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Braised pork? No problem.

459
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,640
And

460
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:55,199
let's add sweet and sour ribs.

461
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,366
Sure!

462
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,280
And then stir-fried Chinese cabbage

463
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,815
with both meat and vegetables.

464
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,530
And...

465
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,215
How about some egg fried rice?

466
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,725
Whatever you want, I'll make it for you.

467
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,085
When will your shoot wrap up?

468
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:10,574
Soon.

469
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,054
Just a few more weeks, I think.

470
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:15,054
Let's go on a trip after.

471
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,507
Where to?

472
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,480
Are you here to feed the fish
or bait them?

473
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:19,613
I'm here to bait them.

474
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:21,316
The baiting master, don't you know?

475
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,534
Stew that one?

476
00:30:25,816 --> 00:30:27,894
Jump in and catch one for me?

477
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,808
Hey, I'm just kidding!

478
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,261
Have you ever tried playing that?

479
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:34,916
Hey, speak up.

480
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:36,495
Are you there?

481
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,654
Who is it?

482
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,183
- Is Qin Xiao there?
- He's not here.

483
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,374
Is Qin Xiao home?

484
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,901
- Is Qin Xiao home?
- He's home. He's home.

485
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:44,386
Please leave a message after the beep.

486
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,284
- I should have...
- Beep.

487
00:30:57,006 --> 00:30:59,562
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong.

488
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:45,439
You can make a wish with these lanterns.

489
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,692
Then let me make a wish.

490
00:31:46,717 --> 00:31:47,717
Go ahead.

491
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:50,605
What should I wish for?

492
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:52,574
Done.

493
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,535
What took you so long?

494
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,035
You know...

495
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,143
Haa... I won't say it.

496
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,094
- I won't say it.
- Why so mysterious?

497
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,231
I don't want to say it.

498
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:03,395
It's in the past now.

499
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:08,854
What?

500
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:10,980
Let bygones be bygones.

501
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:18,134
- Qi Lu...
- Qin Xiao...

502
00:32:18,307 --> 00:32:19,868
In the future...

503
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:23,454
You must do what you love.
