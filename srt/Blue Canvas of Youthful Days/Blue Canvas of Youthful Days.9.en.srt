00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,000
"Blue Canvas of Youthful Days"

2
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:46,726
(Episode 9: The Protector's Projection)

3
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,640
It used to be okay to do this.

4
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,240
But now, for our Xiao Tan,

5
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:01,889
it's just too unfair.

6
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:06,001
So,

7
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,719
don't come looking for me anymore.

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,120
I could be your younger brother.

9
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,079
Your younger brother.

10
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm very happy.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,560
Why are you so happy?

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
I...

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,488
That thing I was struggling

14
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:55,562
with a few days ago.

15
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:56,908
About that girl.

16
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,600
Geez, what girl?

17
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,359
Anyway,

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,653
I finally took that step.

19
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,319
Well...

20
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,159
Congratulations.

21
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,613
Why that face?

22
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,347
Weren't you out with Lao Liu?

23
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,919
He said,

24
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,039
I remind him of his deceased brother.

25
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,559
I told him,

26
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,653
I'm fine with being like

27
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,052
a younger brother to him.

28
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:34,497
Why did he...

29
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:36,275
do this?

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,719
I suggested it.

31
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,203
You also think

32
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:43,493
he only cares for me as a brother?

33
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:45,355
But what does he think?

34
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,159
Maybe he just needs more time.

35
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,494
To sort himself out.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,158
What's there to sort out?

37
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,672
Love isn't something

38
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:00,767
that needs organizing.

39
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,906
Life between two people

40
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,034
will always have surprises.

41
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:05,754
There won't be any changes in life?

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,800
It's just self-deception.

43
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:10,431
One day,

44
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:12,867
he'll figure it out.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,291
Actually, I have an idea.

46
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,440
Something that might push Lao Liu a bit.

47
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,560
Do you want to try?

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Xiao Lu.

49
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,015
Mom.

50
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,800
You're back?

51
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,199
Let's find a place to sit,

52
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,319
alright?

53
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,919
I thought

54
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:07,287
you wouldn't come back again.

55
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,878
I promised you,

56
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,000
I'd take you with me when I left.

57
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,164
Did you ever consider,

58
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,579
before you came back,

59
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:21,478
that he might've beaten me to death?

60
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:31,466
Xiao Lu.

61
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,224
I've already come to terms

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,855
with being abandoned by you,

63
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,160
tossed aside to him.

64
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,040
What's the point of showing up now?

65
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,360
Those first few years after I left,

66
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,000
life was hard.

67
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,455
I couldn't even afford

68
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,659
a plane ticket back.

69
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,600
Later, I signed with a gallery.

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,351
Things got better little by little.

71
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,519
I thought,

72
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,597
I should save up and

73
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:04,576
and have a place to live,

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
I could bring you over.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,040
Are you still drawing?

76
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,369
I know you've been learning art

77
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:16,295
all this time.

78
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,360
If you like it,

79
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,600
I could take you abroad with me.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,319
We could apply for schools,

81
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,120
so you could leave him sooner.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,319
I don't like drawing.

83
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,950
Not at all.

84
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:32,655
I don't have your talent,

85
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,321
nor am I like Dad, who sees fame

86
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:35,461
and fortune in it.

87
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:39,097
Is there anything you do like doing?

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,639
I could help you with that.

89
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,839
I'll need to think about it.

90
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Senior Sister.

91
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,910
Come in, come in.

92
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:10,482
Wait a moment,

93
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:11,866
I'll make you some coffee.

94
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:22,453
Here.

95
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,959
Thanks.

96
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:26,884
Alright.

97
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:29,349
I'm here today to bring you this.

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,195
Professor Guo's solo exhibition.

99
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,156
He's missed you a lot over the years.

100
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,480
At several reunions,

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,800
he didn't get to see you.

102
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,593
This is his first solo exhibition

103
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:43,658
in 10 years.

104
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
You must come.

105
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Sure,

106
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,535
I'll definitely be there.

107
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,720
Excuse me, do you know Qi Lu?

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,279
We were supposed to meet today,

109
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,337
but my phone died,

110
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,495
and I can't reach him.

111
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,975
If I see him, I'll let him know.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,199
Thanks, student.

113
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,300
Just tell him his brother

114
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,368
is looking for him.

115
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:02,392
Alright.

116
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,613
Who are you? Why are you

117
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:05,699
looking for Qi Lu?

118
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:08,801
We're, well...

119
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
online friends.

120
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,530
You're Qin Xiao, aren't you?

121
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:12,635
How do you know that?

122
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,480
Like I said, we're friends online.

123
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:17,990
Good online friends, actually.

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,920
Of course I know you.

125
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,497
What? He's never told you

126
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,161
about his friends online?

127
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,615
Friends... well,

128
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,144
It's not like you have to always say

129
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,401
whether your friends are

130
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,558
important or not.

131
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,136
You can call me Lao Bai.

132
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:32,998
I'm probably a few years older
than you guys.

133
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,497
Just graduated last year.

134
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,800
Got it. I'll pass the message.

135
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
It's been three years,

136
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,879
and this is your first new piece, huh?

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,348
Just a little trinket I threw together.

138
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Is this Kollwitz's print?

139
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Yes.

140
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,600
A mother cradling her lost child,

141
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,120
shielding the child with her body.

142
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,759
In your work,

143
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,165
are you portraying yourself

144
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,621
as the protector?

145
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,439
When I first saw that piece,

146
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,519
I felt an emotional connection.

147
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,800
There's a story about Kollwitz.

148
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,412
Her eldest son,

149
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:17,398
sacrifice on the front lines of war.

150
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,891
While creating the image of a

151
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,983
mother mourning her lost child,

152
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,133
she sketched herself in the mirror,

153
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,508
holding her youngest son.

154
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,101
The mother-and-child reflection

155
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,170
in the mirror

156
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,647
often made her see her youngest

157
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:31,437
as if he were her lost eldest son.

158
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,120
During the creative process,

159
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,982
she would often cry in grief.

160
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,302
Her youngest son would

161
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,655
wipe away her tears,

162
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,960
telling her not to weep.

163
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,279
Sadly,

164
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,879
when her youngest son grew up,

165
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,360
he too was lost in the war.

166
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,519
In your new work,

167
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,480
the one being protected...

168
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,200
Is Yangyang.

169
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,348
Yangyang. But...

170
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,575
Ah!

171
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:04,073
Sorry! Sorry!

172
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:05,422
No, it's fine.

173
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,320
It's fine. It's fine.

174
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:13,799
That was...

175
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,574
A friend.

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,240
- Aren't you going to go after him?
- No need.

177
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,392
I met Yangyang once back in the day.

178
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
Don't you think

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,676
in your work,

180
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,519
the protected figure

181
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,265
looks less like Yangyang

182
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,440
and more like that boy who just left?

183
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,840
Is he your model?

184
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:40,147
Like...

185
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,059
Like him?

186
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,192
I hadn't noticed.

187
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,564
Those attending today's self-study

188
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,416
session should practice more sketches.

189
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:55,787
Take turns being each other's models.

190
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:56,820
Teacher Liu will be checking

191
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:57,765
them tomorrow.

192
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,270
Are you going to try that method?

193
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,960
No idea.

194
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,997
I just left his place.

195
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,220
I'll call now.

196
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:11,245
Stop nagging.

197
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Hello.

198
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,387
Lao Liu, it's me.

199
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:35,377
Qin Xiao?

200
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:37,270
What's going on with you and Tan Yin?

201
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
What happened to him?

202
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,715
Why did he say he's leaving?

203
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,411
I just got home and saw him with

204
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:44,176
his suitcase, saying he's leaving.

205
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,519
Did he mention where he's going?

206
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:46,838
I have no idea.

207
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,073
Don't worry about it. I'll go find him.

208
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,345
Where are you hiding?

209
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,611
Don't you know how worried Lao Liu is?

210
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,484
I went to a place

211
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,465
where he would definitely find me.

212
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:21,577
Are you upset about that photo?

213
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,098
I can take care of you,

214
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,578
like a brother taking care

215
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:29,968
of his younger sibling.

216
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,106
(Teacher Liu, you have to eat on time)

217
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,240
Don't you think in your work,

218
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,095
the protected figure

219
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,359
looks less like Yangyang and

220
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:43,829
more like that boy who just left?

221
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:44,954
You mean

222
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:45,979
Xiao Tan?

223
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,156
Is he your model?

224
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,080
Like him?

225
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,588
I hadn't noticed.

226
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,335
There's a story about Kollwitz.

227
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,079
Her eldest son,

228
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:05,282
sacrifice on the front lines of war.

229
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,493
While creating the image of a

230
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,822
mother mourning her lost child,

231
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,540
she sketched herself in the mirror,

232
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:13,048
holding her youngest son.

233
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,477
The mother-and-child reflection

234
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,397
in the mirror

235
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:16,930
often made her see her youngest

236
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:19,541
as if he were her lost eldest son.

237
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,430
Would finding a boy who

238
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:25,216
looks exactly like Yangyang

239
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,986
make up for it?

240
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,791
Your brother is dead.

241
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,502
Sadly,

242
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,682
when her youngest son grew up,

243
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,059
he too was lost in the war.

244
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,749
Seeing the youngest

245
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:05,176
as the lost eldest...

246
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,783
The protected one...

247
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,124
is Yangyang.

248
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,580
Like him?

249
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
So, you're here for a documentary?

250
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,650
Want to collaborate?

251
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:43,575
Oh right, you've got your art exam prep.

252
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,039
Probably no time.

253
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,791
Actually, there's something

254
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:47,977
I need to tell you.

255
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,919
I might have a chance to study abroad,

256
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,041
away from my dad.

257
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,226
That's great!

258
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,559
My mom came back.

259
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
She said

260
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,600
I could go abroad to study filmmaking.

261
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,528
What's there to hesitate about?

262
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:00,335
Go!

263
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,635
You've loved

264
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,229
filmmaking for so long.

265
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,799
If you have the chance,

266
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,000
why not take it?

267
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,399
Because of Qin Xiao?

268
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,033
If I go,

269
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,025
I might not see him for a long time.

270
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,415
And he's still preparing for his exams.

271
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,720
You're assuming things for him again.

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,297
How do you know

273
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,519
he wouldn't be happy for you,

274
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,757
knowing you've found something you love?

275
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,079
You haven't even told him about it.

276
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,673
It's me who would miss him.

277
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,759
Huajing Art university

278
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,393
has an exchange program every year

279
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:42,752
with CalArts in the U.S.

280
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,080
That school

281
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,549
also has one of the top-ranked

282
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,010
film programs in the world.

283
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,063
If he gets into Huajing this year,

284
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,600
you'd only be apart for one year.

285
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,399
Then at the same school,

286
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:55,904
you could both study your passions.

287
00:14:57,554 --> 00:14:58,915
Sounds tough.

288
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,159
Tougher than spending so many years

289
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,555
doing things you hate?

290
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,101
Alright, think about it yourself.

291
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,554
I need to meet the subject

292
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:12,099
of my documentary.

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,281
Be careful.

294
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:15,639
Sounds dangerous.

295
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,813
No worries. Worst case,

296
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:17,992
I'll call the police.

297
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,742
Good will prevail. See you.

298
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,215
Why are you here at lunch break?

299
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,889
Came to pick you up.

300
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:30,519
Boyfriend.

301
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,508
Don't make me smack you.

302
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,286
Why haven't you been coming

303
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:35,162
to the studio again?

304
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:36,642
Even Lao Liu hasn't said
anything about you.

305
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:37,841
I took the morning off.

306
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,138
Went to meet a teacher.

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,148
Don't tell me it's teacher Bai?

308
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,484
What weird things are you saying?

309
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:46,234
I saw it all.

310
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,840
Jealous?

311
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
How bad.

312
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,726
I really just went to see a teacher.

313
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,161
Then I bumped into Senior Bai

314
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:54,072
on my way back.

315
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:55,262
When I was courting you,

316
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:56,276
it was his idea.

317
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:57,975
I don't think the ideas were that great.

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,898
Not sure what he was thinking.

319
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,173
How can you still be so jealous at 20?

320
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
Come here.

321
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:32,960
Umm.. Xiao Rui!

322
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,119
- Umm... We...
- I didn't see anything.

323
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:40,144
Umm...

324
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:45,824
Forget it.

325
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:46,855
Even if I did see,

326
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:47,976
I wouldn't tell anyone.

327
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,230
- Sorry.
- Huh?

328
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,324
Didn't intentionally hide it from you.

329
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:52,370
I know, don't worry.

330
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,430
Just because I like you doesn't mean I

331
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:56,754
want to ruin things between you two.

332
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,666
I'm not some evil supporting actress.

333
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,358
I'll head out now.

334
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,383
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

335
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:02,408
Bye-bye.

336
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,615
It's all sorted.

337
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,877
Xiao Rui's a good person.

338
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,299
She won't say anything.

339
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,117
I actually thought you two

340
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,050
might end up together.

341
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,075
Why?

342
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,612
I saw her bring you bubble tea.

343
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,362
And...

344
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,079
You two hugged.

345
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,133
So, that's why you avoided coming

346
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,355
to the studio for a while?

347
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,379
Yeah.

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Qin Xiao.

349
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,330
Here, take this.

350
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,635
Consider it a reward for

351
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:39,745
keeping my secret.

352
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,424
Come on,

353
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:44,213
take it, or I won't feel at ease.

354
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:46,799
Alright then.

355
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:48,987
You...

356
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:50,621
Do you have time this weekend

357
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,295
for some sketching together?

358
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,319
Nah,

359
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:55,173
Qi Lu is busy.

360
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,901
Ask Turtle to keep you company instead.

361
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,400
Why are you purposely avoiding me?

362
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,876
Actually,

363
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,799
being liked and appreciated...

364
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,549
It's a happy thing.

365
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,257
But right now, I just want to

366
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:12,722
focus on my exams.

367
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,376
I don't know if saying this...

368
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:16,401
Would...

369
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:17,440
It won't.

370
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,440
Then, how about a hug?

371
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:25,946
As a symbol of the start

372
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:26,994
of our friendship.

373
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:41,690
Try to find Lao Liu soon.

374
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,720
He'll think of a way to help you.

375
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:49,215
Qi Lu,

376
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,863
You like to say that I make you
feel uncomfortable.

377
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:52,119
But have you noticed?

378
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,061
Who's the one who never speaks clearly?

379
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:55,975
- Huh?
- Then...

380
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,773
How about I confess something

381
00:18:57,797 --> 00:18:58,773
to you when we get back?

382
00:18:58,797 --> 00:18:59,797
Yeah.

383
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:01,105
Let's go.

384
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,920
Studying film?

385
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,639
Actually, back in school,

386
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:06,865
I joined the film club.

387
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,803
That's also how I met Senior Bai.

388
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:12,509
But,

389
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,936
later, my dad found out.

390
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,850
I didn't get a chance to continue.

391
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,561
So Senior Bai was the only one who knew?

392
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:21,653
Come on, can't you speak nicely?

393
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,458
Go for it, Qi Lu.

394
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,559
My mom said...

395
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,319
It requires one year.

396
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,830
Just one year where

397
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:39,936
we can't see each other.

398
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,244
But after that,

399
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,017
we'll be able to do what we love.

400
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,490
Like you said,

401
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,544
We should do what we love.

402
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:48,286
Love who we want to love.

403
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:50,287
Brother Xiao, what do you want

404
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,456
to be in the future?

405
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:52,496
Be a human.

406
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:54,193
Be serious.

407
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:55,599
What career do you want?

408
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,075
Where do you want to live in the future?

409
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:59,646
Haven't I told you before?

410
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,177
I want to teach kids how to draw.

411
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,841
After I finish university,

412
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:05,013
I'll become a teacher.

413
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,472
In my free time, I can still

414
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,659
do my own drawings.

415
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:11,494
Then I'll just...

416
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,458
be a director.

417
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,034
Wouldn't you need to

418
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,911
travel around a lot?

419
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:16,935
Nope.

420
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,646
I'll shoot films in my hometown.

421
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,257
After wrapping up for the day,

422
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,616
I'll come pick you up from work.

423
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:22,835
On weekends, we can go

424
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:24,176
for walks together.

425
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,474
Like today,

426
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,115
strolling by Heihu Spring.

427
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,079
When we're tired from walking,

428
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,779
we'll grab some late-night snacks.

429
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,240
Just eating and playing?

430
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,312
Isn't a happy life just

431
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:34,406
eating and playing?

432
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:43,771
Go get ready.

433
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:45,197
For what?

434
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:46,404
Studying abroad.

435
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,855
Learning the language,

436
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:49,039
preparing your portfolio.

437
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:50,507
It's all pretty busy, right?

438
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:52,527
It won't be in time for the

439
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,775
university entrance exam.

440
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,191
Actually, I'd like to help with

441
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:56,644
Lao Bai's documentary, too.

442
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,591
What's he shooting?

443
00:20:58,855 --> 00:20:59,855
He said he knows

444
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,347
someone in an urban village

445
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:02,815
who makes fake diet pills.

446
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,081
Seems like Lao Bai has some

447
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:05,159
interesting ideas.

448
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,958
Fake diet pills?

449
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,177
What's wrong?

450
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,200
Sounds kinda dangerous.

451
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,396
Maybe you shouldn't go.

452
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,793
Geez. It's fine.

453
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,160
It's not like I'm going undercover.

454
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,599
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

455
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,999
Has Lao Liu found you yet?

456
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:50,764
Where are you going?

457
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:53,877
None of your business.

458
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,640
Why are you leaving?

459
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,564
Didn't you promise to be

460
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,603
my little brother?

461
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:06,376
Why are you leaving

462
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,469
without saying a word?

463
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,197
Do you know how worried I was?

464
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,830
There are too many people that

465
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:12,931
you need to care about.

466
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,631
That was my senior.

467
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,482
She came to deliver an invitation

468
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:24,747
from the professor.

469
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,952
When you arrived, she had accidentally

470
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,210
spilled coffee on me.

471
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,350
I'm not jealous.

472
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Yes,

473
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:37,710
I know you're not jealous.

474
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,091
I just thought it was necessary

475
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:42,208
to explain it clearly.

476
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,393
And I want to turn this explanation

477
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,519
into an opportunity to confess to you.

478
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,839
Let's go.

479
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:08,936
Come home with me.

480
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,049
I want to show you something.

481
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:23,033
This relief sculpture

482
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:25,432
was adapted from this painting.

483
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,247
The image shows a mother

484
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:29,334
protecting her child.

485
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,606
Initially, I wanted to create

486
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,918
the image of a protector.

487
00:23:34,744 --> 00:23:36,585
Me protecting Yangyang.

488
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,240
But later...

489
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,359
Perhaps unconsciously...

490
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,675
That image slowly turned into you.

491
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Xiao Tan,

492
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,126
I'm not sure if it's too late

493
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,510
to say this now.

494
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,832
Or if it seems insincere.

495
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,160
That night, when I was drunk...

496
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,820
I knew it was you the whole time.

497
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,720
You took off your hearing aid

498
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,109
and couldn't hear what I said.

499
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,242
Later, I realized you misunderstood me,

500
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,081
but I didn't have the courage to

501
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:22,621
face the fact that I liked you.

502
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,242
So I just went along with the lie.

503
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,119
But now that

504
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
you've sorted yourself out...

505
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:43,241
I don't know what would

506
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,733
be considered sorted myself out.

507
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:47,180
But today, when I heard you were leaving

508
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,922
I was really scared.

509
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,070
I can't imagine a life without you.

510
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:55,927
So, Xiao Tan...

511
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,680
Give me another chance to be brave.

512
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,805
Please?

513
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,518
If you say it like this...

514
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:16,471
I'll take it seriously.

515
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,140
In the future, you will not be

516
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:21,452
snatched away by others.

517
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,847
Let's make it official.

518
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Okay.

519
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,227
Today, I realized

520
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,610
I can't just be your little brother.

521
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,680
Seeing others by your side...

522
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,555
Makes me unhappy.

523
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:50,883
Look.

524
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:52,798
This is my signature.

525
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,149
Leave your mark beside it.

526
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:31,299
What are you doing?

527
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:33,517
Looking for relatives.

528
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:34,408
Been wandering around,

529
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:35,114
can't find the place.

530
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,315
Is Xiao Jiande here?

531
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,181
There isn't, now scram.

532
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:15,737
Go find out who these two are.

533
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:17,256
Where are they?

534
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Where they live.

535
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Got it.

536
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,519
Understood.
