"Blue Canvas of Youthful Days"

2
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,448
(Episode 7: Love is a Hot Gun)

3
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:14,568
Are you upset because of that photo?

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,378
Is that why you haven't come

5
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:18,581
to see me for so long?

6
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,253
I actually have always been

7
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,323
able to tell clearly.

8
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,481
Lao Liu.

9
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,849
Lao Liu.

10
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:01,648
Lao Liu.

11
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,861
Hey, coming.

12
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,374
Lao Liu. It's already 11 o'clock.

13
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,859
The assistant doesn't know
what we're drawing today.

14
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:17,334
Everyone's been waiting for you to
set up the still life for a while.

15
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:18,639
They asked me to come find you.

16
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:22,632
You drank too much again, didn't you?

17
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,187
This kid...

18
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,210
You stayed here all night?

19
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,930
Oh.

20
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:34,703
Did you bring me back last night?

21
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,067
Sorry about that. It's been a long time

22
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,298
since I drank so much.

23
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:39,422
Thank you.

24
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:41,499
You forgot?

25
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:46,434
It's nothing.

26
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:51,513
Hurry up. The studio is waiting for you.

27
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:52,683
Oh.

28
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,559
By the way, Xiao Tan,

29
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,516
don't casually take off your

30
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,743
hearing aid anymore.

31
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,121
Close the door on your way out.

32
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,081
Huh...

33
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,246
Sorry, everyone.

34
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,988
Got delayed by something.

35
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:12,577
The weather's nice

36
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,682
and warm this weekend.

37
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:14,831
Let's go to the suburb

38
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:15,963
for a sketching trip.

39
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,841
Lao Liu. Drank too much again?

40
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:28,995
You're back?

41
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,915
Lao Liu talked with me.

42
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:34,585
He…

43
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,324
he knows everything.

44
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,519
Knows what?

45
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,650
He just told me, no matter what happens,

46
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,370
don't joke around with my future.

47
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,363
When he told you, you listen.

48
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,020
I still say the same thing.

49
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,285
I want to do what I love,

50
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,023
and love whoever I want to love.

51
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,123
That's why I came back this time.

52
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:36,641
Hurry up, everyone, hurry!

53
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,141
Got everything?

54
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,578
This isn't a vacation.

55
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:41,560
Check if you have your ID cards,

56
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,047
phones, and dorm keys.

57
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,773
Xiaorui, did the bus arrive?

58
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:46,922
Yes.

59
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,533
Alright, let's go.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,467
Let's go.

61
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,408
(Boyi Studio. Outdoor sketch bus)

62
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,215
Is there anyone left who hasn't boarded?

63
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,836
Check if any of your classmates

64
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:00,852
are missing.

65
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,164
Why aren't you with Qin Xiao today?

66
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,294
Are you the Pacific Police or something?

67
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,835
You're really nosy.

68
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:09,849
Not sitting with your crush,

69
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,599
so now you're meddling with me?

70
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:14,482
Why are you so temperamental today?

71
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,678
Hey.

72
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:17,123
Do me a favor.

73
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:19,967
Now you think of me?

74
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:21,576
Beg me.

75
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:28,455
Fine, fine, what is it, Your Highness?

76
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:32,570
I found a part-time job for Qin Xiao.

77
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:33,845
He'll be drawing some illustrations

78
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:34,671
for a fan group.

79
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,171
Tell him about it

80
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,507
and say it was you who recommended him.

81
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,769
Why don't you tell him yourself?

82
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,377
Did you two have a falling-out?

83
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:52,936
I'm giving you a chance to take credit,

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,210
isn't that nice?

85
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,080
Alright, I'll just pass the favor along.

86
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:00,105
Thanks.

87
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:01,808
Thanks.

88
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,759
Wow, hearing that from you is rare.

89
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:07,212
Can I not talk to you nicely?

90
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:14,279
- Sun Xiaorui?
- Here.

91
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:15,392
Li Yu.

92
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:16,728
You two are sharing a room.

93
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,525
Li Li. Turtle.

94
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,250
Alright.

95
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,620
Qin Xiao and Qi Lu.

96
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:31,588
Hey, hold on. Turtle.

97
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:33,549
Swap rooms. You'll room with Qin Xiao.

98
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,742
- Huh?
- You'll room with Qin Xiao.

99
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,128
Learn how to do sketches

100
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,237
properly from him.

101
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,817
Alright. Everyone got their room cards?

102
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,536
Dismissed. Go get some rest early.

103
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:57,416
Mr. Liu.

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,619
Don't overthink it.

105
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,518
Exams are coming up.

106
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,957
Don't let these things

107
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,934
affect your tests.

108
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:06,884
You're not kids anymore.

109
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,907
I can only say what a teacher can say.

110
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:11,006
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

111
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:14,727
Get some rest.

112
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,567
Right now, the image still

113
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,074
lacks color relationships.

114
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,196
It's all black and white.

115
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:36,539
Pay attention to warm, cool, pure,

116
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:37,375
and gray tones.

117
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,559
In terms of these color relationships…

118
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,181
Pay attention to these details.

119
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:44,975
Hey, look. There's a black swan

120
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:46,015
over there.

121
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,259
Oh, wait. It's actually a black duck.

122
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,429
Hey, I have a tissue.

123
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:56,319
Here, let me wipe it for you.

124
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,921
It's fine.

125
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:14,494
Did you mix this shade of gray yourself?

126
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,854
I've never seen it before.

127
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,894
It's not quite blue, not quite green.

128
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,184
Looks just like the color

129
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,465
of this water today.

130
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:23,330
That's not what I meant.

131
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:25,056
Can you go back to your seat?

132
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:43,080
- Getting the cold shoulder?
- Put your hand away.

133
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:45,734
Hey, that's not right.

134
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,519
- Look at the color of your tree.
- Focus on your own work.

135
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,072
- No, I meant the color.
- Just concentrate on your own stuff.

136
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:51,815
Let me tell you, this color...

137
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,715
If you keep talking,

138
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:53,535
I'll tear up your drawing.

139
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,559
Alright, alright.

140
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:00,545
You come here.

141
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,210
You mean me?

142
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:06,746
Hey.

143
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:07,787
I'm not coming.

144
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:12,355
Come here.

145
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:41,695
Why do you have to cling to some guy?

146
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
What?

147
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:46,574
Do you want everyone

148
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:47,700
to know your bad things?

149
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,590
Can't you be more discreet?

150
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:51,517
What are you talking about?

151
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,095
Mind your own business, alright?

152
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:21,691
Come, come.

153
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:24,044
Let's take a look at the issues

154
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,588
with this painting.

155
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:27,055
Overall…

156
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,186
It's quite touching,

157
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:29,358
such self-sacrifice.

158
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:30,834
But do you really think putting

159
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,921
a lousy painting next to hers…

160
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:33,014
will keep her from being criticized?

161
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,148
Nonsense. What do you know?

162
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:36,783
The teaching assistant already

163
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,805
mentioned it yesterday.

164
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,406
Exams are sometimes about luck too.

165
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,974
If you put a 20-point painting

166
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,102
next to yours…

167
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,699
I could boost your 85 points up to 90.

168
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,100
Xiaorui, take a look at the issues.

169
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,140
She's been struggling to keep up

170
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:51,056
in color class recently?

171
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,200
It's pretty obvious.

172
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,733
Tsk, no idea.

173
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,042
She's been staying up late

174
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,073
every night for extra classes.

175
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,346
Maybe suggest her to ask

176
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,456
Lao Liu for help.

177
00:11:58,736 --> 00:11:59,951
What do you mean?

178
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Well…

179
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,602
Putting a lousy painting next to hers

180
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,984
isn't going to solve the problem.

181
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:06,225
- What are you complaining?
- There're still details to work on.

182
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:07,895
Everything is just blending together.

183
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,933
If there's time, all those details

184
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:11,696
need to be drawn out clearly. Look,
what's this supposed to be?

185
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:14,799
What did you say to Qi Lu today?

186
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,685
He looked upset when he came back.

187
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,799
- It was nothing.
- Just some basic issues.

188
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,310
You two have been acting strange lately.

189
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:21,872
Don't meddle.

190
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,588
I noticed you seemed to have annoyed

191
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:25,908
the Class A monitor today.

192
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:27,438
Don't bring it up.

193
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:30,981
No matter what I do, she ignores me.

194
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,800
I said something wrong today.

195
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:33,833
What did you say?

196
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:35,295
It wasn't much.

197
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,921
I just commented that I'd never seen

198
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,490
that color in her paint box before.

199
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:39,552
I even complimented her,

200
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:41,334
saying the color is perfect

201
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:42,558
for sketching.

202
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:44,986
Haa...

203
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:47,191
It seems like she's entirely

204
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,722
focused on exams right now.

205
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:49,894
Getting into the same school

206
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,087
would give you more chances.

207
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:52,736
Even if you say that...

208
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,350
My art is just terrible.

209
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,042
Even if I push myself now,

210
00:12:59,058 --> 00:12:59,873
it's too late.

211
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,408
I really like her.

212
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,515
She's my first love.

213
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,043
Does she even acknowledge you?

214
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:05,859
That's your “first love”?

215
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:08,132
- You're the only one pleasing her.
- You don't get it.

216
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,320
Love is about diving in headfirst.

217
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,726
This is what I call going all in.

218
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,793
That's about it.

219
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,801
Got it?

220
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,559
Oh, right.

221
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:21,919
Qi...

222
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:23,457
My uncle…

223
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:24,559
My elder uncle

224
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:25,752
started a fan club.

225
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:27,623
He someone to draw illustrations.

226
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:28,826
I recommended you,

227
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,022
reach out to him later.

228
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,472
I think we've covered everything.

229
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,010
If you have any issues,

230
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,169
you know what they are.

231
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:41,357
Don't forget to practice

232
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:42,346
once you get back.

233
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,370
Understood?

234
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,620
Understood.

235
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:47,425
It's been tough for everyone lately.

236
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,964
After tomorrow's sketching session,

237
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:50,284
we've planned a bonfire party

238
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,136
for everyone.

239
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,235
Take this chance to unwind.

240
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,195
Alright, go get some rest.

241
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:20,745
Hey.

242
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:21,811
Where's Qi Lu?

243
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:22,836
No idea.

244
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,943
But Li Li said he went out to paint,

245
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:26,328
not in the dorm.

246
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:09,550
Alright, everyone, listen up.

247
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,622
Students.

248
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:12,740
Gather around. Let me say a few words.

249
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,064
Today, one of our classmates

250
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:16,289
has a birthday.

251
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:17,890
Let's all guess who it is.

252
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:19,393
Come on.

253
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:22,815
- Qin Xiao!
- Qin Xiao!

254
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,414
Happy birthday!

255
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,080
Let's sing, come on!

256
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:29,640
Happy birthday to you.

257
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,828
Happy birthday to you.

258
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:36,128
Happy birthday to you.

259
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:39,078
Happy birthday to you.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Happy birthday!

261
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,726
Thanks.

262
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:46,421
I didn't know what to get you,

263
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,108
so I got you some art supplies.

264
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,403
No worries.

265
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:51,669
You...

266
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:53,606
Hey. Did you get him art supplies too?

267
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,168
I didn't know what to give either,

268
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,465
so I also got art supplies.

269
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:58,244
Let's drink!

270
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
White?

271
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:02,525
Just snagged it from Lao Liu's stash.

272
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,344
Take a sip, don't chicken out!

273
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,930
Wow, impressive!

274
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:14,841
Where's Qi Lu?

275
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:16,409
I knew you'd ask about him.

276
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:17,728
Let me tell you…

277
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:19,192
Everything you see here today

278
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,319
was prepared by Qi Lu alone.

279
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:22,644
For the past two days,

280
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,398
he's been asking us constantly,

281
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:25,750
“Is the birthday gift ready?”

282
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:27,264
“Is the birthday gift ready?”

283
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:29,432
So, where is he?

284
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:30,885
He went to pick up the cake.

285
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,120
He told us not to wait for him

286
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:33,080
and to go ahead and start.

287
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,541
But he's been gone a while.

288
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:36,150
I'll give him a call.

289
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:49,894
Hello?

290
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,919
Hey, Xiao.

291
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,240
I got thrown out halfway,

292
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,708
and I accidentally tripped and fell.

293
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:56,776
Where are you?

294
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:57,893
Send me your location.

295
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,033
I'll come find you.

296
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:11,192
You look perfectly fine to me.

297
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,536
Were you worried about me?

298
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,060
Stop messing around.

299
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:18,697
Have you been drinking?

300
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,785
Otherwise, would I be stupid enough to

301
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:22,543
come here without calling for a ride?

302
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,242
Look!

303
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:28,711
Damn.

304
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:31,352
You scared me.

305
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:38,585
The last time someone

306
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:39,760
celebrated my birthday...

307
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:41,766
was when my parents were still around.

308
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:44,969
What?

309
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:46,656
Nothing.

310
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,400
20 years old now. Let's make a memory.

311
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:18,947
- Go on.
- No, I'm not going.

312
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,244
Oh, come on, just do it!

313
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,995
Where's my gift?

314
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:36,636
Who even asks for their own present?

315
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,105
Did you prepare one or not?

316
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:43,871
Close your eyes, then.

317
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:47,504
No peeking.

318
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,370
Open your eyes.

319
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,964
This is from the day at the zoo?

320
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,824
Took me three weeks to finish.

321
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,232
Don't like it?

322
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,450
No, I was just thinking...

323
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,012
When you were painting this...

324
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:45,965
Were you feeling sad?

325
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:48,073
Not at all.

326
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,000
Since I grew up,

327
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,830
this is the happiest I've been

328
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,940
while drawing...

329
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,220
Qi Lu.

330
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,069
This winter is so cold.

331
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:23,068
Let's date.

332
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:39,368
Hello, Mom?

333
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,736
Today we went to clean the

334
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,112
cemetery for him.

335
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,161
It's been four years.

336
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,831
Why can you stay out every day,

337
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:50,988
so happy, and never come home?

338
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,266
How could you just forget about him?

339
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:55,682
Mom...

340
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,586
I haven't forgotten him.

341
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,130
I'm just trying to make

342
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,437
life normal for us.

343
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,157
What is life?

344
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:05,425
You can go on living...

345
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,487
but your brother will always

346
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:09,534
stay frozen in that day.

347
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,210
Mom.

348
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:13,235
I'm taking students...

349
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:22,799
- Mom, I've already told you...
- Big brother.

350
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:28,539
Oh, it's you.

351
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,586
Sorry, there was something going on

352
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:31,304
at home just now.

353
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:32,328
Brother...

354
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,822
About that night...

355
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,307
You can remember, right?

356
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:45,417
Why are you asking that?

357
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:46,596
Am I right?

358
00:22:49,594 --> 00:22:50,594
Yeah.

359
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,253
Look to your left.

360
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:25,280
Isn't it pretty?

361
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,678
Why are you saying this?

362
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Hmm?

363
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,695
Why did you say I wasn't

364
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,788
drunk that night?

365
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,960
Because you said not to take

366
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,554
the hearing aid off casually.

367
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:44,708
I see.

368
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,637
Actually, I purposely didn't

369
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:49,022
want to hear it.

370
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:55,874
Because I didn't want to know.

371
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:01,345
Mhm.

372
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,899
So, that night, you saw me as him,

373
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:05,924
didn't you?

374
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,890
Mhm.

375
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:19,954
The kisses,

376
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:21,122
the hugs...

377
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:23,525
And all the kindness you showed me.

378
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:25,392
They were all meant for him.

379
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,084
It's true, no one can replace him.

380
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,890
Xiao Tan...

381
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:42,255
Have you thought about what

382
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:43,801
you want to do in the future?

383
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:48,267
Do you want to continue studying?

384
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,033
You're still so young.

385
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:51,619
You're about the same age as

386
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:52,877
Qin Xiao and Qi Lu.

387
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:55,127
Anything you want to do or like doing?

388
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:56,298
You can tell me.

389
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,978
I can help you manage it.

390
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:02,483
If I go to school,

391
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,459
I'll be even more like him, won't I?

392
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:08,512
- Tan Yin.
- Did you two meet in university?

393
00:25:08,537 --> 00:25:09,537
Stop bringing him up.

394
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:11,224
Just because you want to be good to him,

395
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:12,561
does that mean I have to

396
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:13,607
accept everything?

397
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,366
Let me take you home first.

398
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:49,725
About what happened after

399
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:50,944
getting drunk that night...

400
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:51,968
It was my fault.

401
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,053
Pretending not to remember

402
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:56,178
was also my fault.

403
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:58,162
At the time, I just didn't

404
00:26:58,187 --> 00:26:59,201
want to hurt you.

405
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,737
So I made a really stupid decision.

406
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:14,033
If you're angry because of this,

407
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:15,058
I completely understand.

408
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:19,941
I know my decision was awful for you.

409
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:22,060
So, if you want to scold me,

410
00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:23,205
I'll take it.

411
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:28,737
I didn't reject that kiss.

412
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:30,846
- I like...
- I can't accept it.

413
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:32,403
I...

414
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:34,010
I don't want to hear it.

415
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:46,692
Xiao Tan...

416
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,294
It's not that you're not good.

417
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:52,232
Or that I don't like you.

418
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:55,187
When I haven't sorted myself out,

419
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:56,211
I can't love

420
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:57,362
someone else.

421
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,075
I'm not 17 or 18 like you guys.

422
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:02,154
Today I like this person so I confess.

423
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:03,199
Tomorrow I like another

424
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,376
and make grand promises.

425
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,950
I'm much older than you.

426
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:07,497
I must be responsible for your feelings

427
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:08,771
and for you as a person.

428
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:19,136
I can take care of you.

429
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,418
Like a brother takes care

430
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:22,551
of a younger sibling.

431
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:24,969
But I can't

432
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,963
be with someone so much younger than me,

433
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:29,134
when I'm still a mess myself.

434
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,472
I can't use you as a distraction.

435
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:38,416
I can't accept this.

436
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,827
If what I said today hurt you,

437
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:55,843
consider it my fault.

438
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,148
If you resent me,

439
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,435
hate me, or find me annoying,

440
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
that's okay.

441
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:05,160
Alright?

442
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Let's go back.

443
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,085
Sleep in my room tonight.

444
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:42,742
The guest room's too messy.

445
00:29:45,264 --> 00:29:46,657
Drink some water and get to bed.

446
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:49,227
I still have to go back.

447
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:50,447
I have to take care of them

448
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:51,760
and return them to the studio.

449
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:54,240
Don't go. You're tired.

450
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:55,857
I can't.

451
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:58,712
A teacher took the students to sketch,

452
00:29:58,737 --> 00:29:59,856
but then leave them,

453
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:01,369
how is that acceptable?

454
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:02,462
I'm telling you,

455
00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:04,527
just thinking about 20 students

456
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,832
out of my sight,

457
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,696
makes me anxious.

458
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:13,495
Go on.
