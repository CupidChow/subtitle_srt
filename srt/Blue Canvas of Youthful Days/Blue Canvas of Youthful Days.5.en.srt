1
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,000
"Blue Canvas of Youthful Days"

2
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,107
(Episode 5: You sent me the most
distant white in winter)

3
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:50,984
Why?

4
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:53,230
Why exactly were you angry today?

5
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,164
It must have something

6
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:04,282
to do with Turtle.

7
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:09,152
Why did you come?

8
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:11,863
Breakfast delivery.

9
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:12,895
Still mad?

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,052
Why are you angry?

11
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,310
What is there to be angry about?

12
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:17,237
Just because I chatted with Sun Xiaorui?

13
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:18,706
Figure it out yourself.

14
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:20,724
Come on, Teacher Qi.

15
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,428
At least give me a hint.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,134
Well, it was so cold,

17
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:26,897
I waited for you for so long,

18
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:28,030
my hands were frozen stiff,

19
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:28,893
couldn't even draw.

20
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,382
Insisting on doing outdoor sketching

21
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,378
in the dead of winter.

22
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:32,402
Got it.

23
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:34,107
That's what it was, right?

24
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:36,301
Alright, alright.

25
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:37,628
Hurry up and head to the studio.

26
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:38,527
If we're late, Lao Liu

27
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:39,384
will scold us again.

28
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:41,646
Also, here, this is for you.

29
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:47,812
If it feels like you're not getting it.

30
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:49,543
Start by copying some good stuff.

31
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,059
All the still life sketches of apples

32
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,424
from the teaching assistants won't help.

33
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,143
The whole class has poisoned apples

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,359
like Turtle's.

35
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,410
Let's go.

36
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:57,435
Go.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,226
Even though it's color,

38
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:03,868
the black, white, and gray relationships

39
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:05,360
are the same as in sketching.

40
00:02:08,474 --> 00:02:10,216
Remember, brushstrokes follow the form,

41
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:11,739
not just scribbling randomly.

42
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:28,401
Whoa.

43
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:30,422
Isn't this book out of print?

44
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:31,900
Qi Lu lent it to me.

45
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:33,495
There's a reprint out.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,586
But this one is older.

47
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,232
Listen up, everyone.

48
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,354
Sometimes, when you don't know

49
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,390
how to draw something,

50
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:44,771
start by copying.

51
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,574
Not bad, Teacher Qi.

52
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,427
- First learn what's good.
- Do you get tips for tutoring?

53
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:51,633
Sure do.

54
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,397
What does Teacher Qi like?

55
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,826
And you have skills. Got it?

56
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,130
I need to go home at lunch

57
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:01,223
to get something.

58
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,247
It's heavy. Help me carry it.

59
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:04,537
Alright, no problem.

60
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,920
Easy.

61
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:19,454
Where's this? Your house?

62
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,040
Sort of. It's my dad's place.

63
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,038
Your dad's place is your home, right?

64
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,976
A lot of art supplies are in my room.

65
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,265
Let's go up and grab them together.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Sure.

67
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:31,645
Over here, here, here.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,770
Watch your step.

69
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:43,777
Here.

70
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:46,280
Whoa. So much stuff.

71
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,479
Give it a try. Really.

72
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:49,774
Different materials.

73
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,641
Different quality of pictures.

74
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:51,492
And different oils, too.

75
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:52,657
They create a lot of options

76
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,417
to experiment with.

77
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,630
Look at this.

78
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,379
I drew this with charcoal before.

79
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:57,998
Then I applied a layer of damar resin.

80
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,343
Added a bit of a smudging effect.

81
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,455
It really changes the effect.

82
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,574
And this one,

83
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,823
this is done with pastels.

84
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,056
I prepared a canvas with

85
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:05,014
texture before using it.

86
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,097
Added a textured base layer.

87
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,496
Then applied color.

88
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,720
It's just that it doesn't set well.

89
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,264
Anyway, it's just sitting here.

90
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,287
Help me take it back.

91
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,035
We can use it together.

92
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:22,191
Well, alright.

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
What time is it?

94
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:29,328
It's noon.

95
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,069
There's still over an hour

96
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:32,155
before class starts.

97
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,632
Let's sit for a bit then.

98
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:40,607
I ordered delivery,

99
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:42,399
let's just eat here.

100
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Alright.

101
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:48,036
Since we're here,

102
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:49,378
let's watch a movie together.

103
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,928
There's a projector at home.

104
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,172
Sit down.

105
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,774
Why are you just standing there?

106
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,623
I should head back.

107
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,279
Shh.

108
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,868
My dad's back.

109
00:06:58,672 --> 00:06:59,833
Don't move.

110
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,432
Who is it?

111
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:20,761
My dad.

112
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,125
Why are you scared of your dad?

113
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:27,583
I'm afraid he'll think I skipped class.

114
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,223
Hello, how's he doing at your studio?

115
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,230
Ah, I was so busy I forgot.

116
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:02,411
Their school had some

117
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,849
intensive training recently.

118
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:07,635
Oh, okay.

119
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:09,624
You alright?

120
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,070
Yeah, I'm fine.

121
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:14,446
Maybe you should take these

122
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:15,651
things back with you first.

123
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:17,180
I'll come to the studio a bit later.

124
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,879
Hello?

125
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Dad.

126
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,264
Later, the bottle spins, and whoever

127
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:53,553
it points to will be the model.

128
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:54,720
Alright.

129
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,759
Alright.

130
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,170
Come.

131
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,040
Where's Qi Lu?

132
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:04,251
Why didn't he show up again?

133
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,501
Out having fun?

134
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,511
Hey. It's pointing at you.

135
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,253
Something's off with Qi Lu.

136
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,149
I want to go and see him.

137
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:20,610
Come with me, I know.

138
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:24,270
Where is he now? What's going on?

139
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,196
You dared to lie. Nonsense!

140
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:28,279
- It's right here.
- Dad, I was wrong.

141
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,411
His dad didn't look too happy

142
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,096
- when he came back.
- Dad, I shouldn't have...

143
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,656
- Maybe it was because of the studio.
- What have you been doing?

144
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:34,484
Huh? You lied to me?

145
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,714
- Dad, I was wrong.
- I even asked Lao Zhao

146
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:36,977
to look after you.

147
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,085
Huh? Tell me the truth!

148
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:40,614
- I...
- Useless!

149
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,511
I promise I'll focus on the exams.

150
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:42,201
I'm sorry, Dad.

151
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,320
Mr. Qi.

152
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Who are you?

153
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,872
Hello, Mr. Qi.

154
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,214
It's Xiao Liu.

155
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,726
Do you remember me?

156
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:52,664
Observing and creating landscapes.

157
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,395
My solo exhibition was hosted

158
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,543
by your art gallery.

159
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:57,179
Oh, Xiao Liu!

160
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,922
Ah, I was so busy I got confused.

161
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,180
Come in, have a seat.

162
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,411
My kid made a mistake,

163
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,432
so I'm scolding him.

164
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:03,617
What an embarrassment.

165
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:04,642
Come.

166
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,335
How's he doing with you at your studio?

167
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,363
He's doing well.

168
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:08,775
Xiao Qi draws very well.

169
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,190
He's quite obedient, too.

170
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:11,488
If you had told me earlier that

171
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:12,527
you've learning with Mr. Xiao Liu,

172
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:13,824
I wouldn't have been worried.

173
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:15,323
Study hard with Mr. Xiao Liu.

174
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:16,558
He was the top student at

175
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,535
Huajing Art university.

176
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,894
We were speculating he surely had

177
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:19,965
some professional training.

178
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,623
Didn't expect it to be from Mr. Qi.

179
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,012
Let's continue our chat inside.

180
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,279
Sure.

181
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,386
Go.

182
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,736
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's chat inside.

183
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,707
If you had told me earlier that

184
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:52,785
you've learning with Mr. Xiao Liu,

185
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,329
I wouldn't have been worried.

186
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,892
Study hard with Mr. Xiao Liu.

187
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,314
He was the top student at

188
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,299
Huajing Art university.

189
00:11:58,323 --> 00:11:59,323
I understand.

190
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,946
Mr. Xiao Liu, I'll have to rely on you.

191
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:03,215
It's part of my duty.

192
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,576
Rest assured, Mr. Qi.

193
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,628
All our students stay in the dorms.

194
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:08,997
Then I'll take Xiao Qi with me now.

195
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:11,350
Alright, thank you.

196
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,666
Does he often act this way?

197
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,391
Actually, I met your mom once.

198
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,273
Back when I was in university...

199
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,298
She was a teaching assistant

200
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:49,775
for our basic design class.

201
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,245
She was one of the best there.

202
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,222
It's probably best not to bring her up.

203
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,894
Especially in front of my dad.

204
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,506
Qin Xiao.

205
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:05,873
Let him rest for a bit.

206
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,506
Mr. Liu.

207
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,326
Could you take me back to my place?

208
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,593
I need to change my clothes

209
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:16,733
before going to class.

210
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:47,466
We're here.

211
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,474
Qin Xiao. Take Qi Lu upstairs.

212
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:52,448
Qi Lu.

213
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:54,527
Maybe take a couple of days off

214
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,089
before coming back to the studio.

215
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

216
00:13:57,424 --> 00:13:58,424
But there's no need.

217
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,150
I can go up by myself.

218
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:43,201
Brother. Why are you here?

219
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,272
Did Qin Xiao come back today?

220
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:46,495
Oh.

221
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,205
He said he has something

222
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:49,494
to take care of. He's not coming back.

223
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:53,750
Did he say what it was?

224
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,717
But lately he's been going out a lot.

225
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:59,266
Grandpa says he might be dating someone.

226
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,891
Dating?

227
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,625
What's this all about?

228
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:07,063
Are you upset?

229
00:15:07,345 --> 00:15:08,657
It has nothing to do with you.

230
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,805
I'm really fine.

231
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,258
It just looks more serious than it is.

232
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:28,457
Stop laughing.

233
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:29,824
It's fake.

234
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,233
I just applied it on the parts of

235
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,184
your back you couldn't reach.

236
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,577
You can handle the rest.

237
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,538
Are you mad?

238
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:57,577
Mhm.

239
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:01,436
Because I was going to kiss you today?

240
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,233
I almost did.

241
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,096
Can you be serious today?

242
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,322
Stop playing around.

243
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:10,650
I feel like my brain is about to

244
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,439
explode with everything going on.

245
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:15,259
Do you feel like you're stuck with

246
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,084
a problem you can't shake?

247
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,512
Can you stop talking like that?

248
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,278
Then how should I talk?

249
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:24,286
What can I say to make you satisfied?

250
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:26,728
Smiling isn't okay.

251
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:28,145
Getting angry isn't okay either.

252
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,494
I can't curse at others, and at myself?

253
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,263
Do you have to yell at me?

254
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,089
I see you as a friend.

255
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:35,456
What do you think of me?

256
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,855
Did you get my permission?

257
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,960
Then leave!

258
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:40,765
Why do you care about me?

259
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:41,797
Just go!

260
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,861
You went to my house to make fun of me?

261
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,084
Now you're here pretending to be nice.

262
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,396
Get out!

263
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,394
Leave! Just go!

264
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,519
Ow.

265
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,799
Ow...

266
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,856
You have a fever.

267
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:24,346
You actually didn't want

268
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:25,487
to avoid it today.

269
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,240
Take a rest.

270
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:39,569
You didn't resist back then.

271
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:42,967
Listen to me.

272
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:46,178
If I listen to you, will you stay?

273
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:55,930
I'll get you a cup of hot water.

274
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,471
I'll talk to Xiao Tan about

275
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,224
Grandpa's situation, then I'll return.

276
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:00,248
Okay?

277
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:03,624
Qi Lu.

278
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:05,442
Us doing this...

279
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:06,696
Isn't right.

280
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,133
I have a fever.

281
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:11,953
I feel cold.

282
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,577
When I had a stomachache,

283
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,961
you held me then.

284
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:18,475
It was okay back then.

285
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,717
Why isn't it okay now?

286
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:23,650
Let's just sleep for now.

287
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:25,346
Okay?

288
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,318
The news said there's going to be

289
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,617
a meteor shower tonight.

290
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:14,081
Want to watch it together?

291
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:26,580
Look, the meteor shower is coming.

292
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:30,204
We're in the city.

293
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,900
How could we see it here?

294
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:35,274
But if we miss it this time,

295
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,453
who knows when the next one will be.

296
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:44,053
It's too cold.

297
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,459
Don't wait, kiddo.

298
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:49,068
You always call me a kid.

299
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,514
Well, you are a kid.

300
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,381
You're my little brother.

301
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:09,852
I won't always be like this.

302
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,477
I'll grow up.

303
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,514
One day,

304
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,124
I'll be able to take care of you.

305
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,519
What,

306
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:22,253
are you worried I'll get bullied

307
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:23,578
in a nursing home someday?

308
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:24,920
Just wait and see.

309
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:27,667
You'd be better off going back

310
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:28,848
to get a good night's sleep.

311
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,553
You've got work tomorrow.

312
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,505
The news said there's going to be

313
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:41,193
a meteor shower tonight.

314
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:42,940
Want to watch it together?

315
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,390
No, thank you, Jiayu.

316
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,157
I have class tomorrow morning,

317
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,532
so I won't stay up.

318
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:25,841
I won't wait.

319
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:31,506
Who knows when it will come.

320
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,100
I'm off.

321
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,711
I didn't know you smoked.

322
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,516
There are a lot of things

323
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,954
you don't know about me.

324
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,092
But I'm 20 now.

325
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:48,506
Nothing I've done would be

326
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:49,560
surprising, get it?

327
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:51,814
Have you ever dated?

328
00:24:53,473 --> 00:24:54,871
Do I look like someone who

329
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:55,926
lacks a girlfriend?

330
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:58,025
You're lying.
