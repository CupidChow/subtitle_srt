00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,710
Look, I have

188
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,900
a stomachache.

189
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,570
We're already out here.

190
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,240
I didn't expect that you, Qi,

191
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,330
would skip classes

192
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,180
since you're good enough at drawing.

193
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,730
Let's go to the zoo and draw animals.

194
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm surmising the exam question.

195
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,450
The theme of creative drawing of Huajing Academy of Fine Arts this year

196

will be going to the zoo.

197
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,090
Are you in or not?

198
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,860
Let's go.

199

201

203

Hey.

How old are you?

207
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,160
Who said only kids can play with balloons?

208

Which one do you want?

209

That one.

That one over there.

211

You like giraffe this much?

212
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,830
When I was little, my dad took me on my mom's sketch from nature trip.

213
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,100
We went to Africa to see animal migration.

214
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,690
My mom likes giraffes too.

215
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,320
Don't you think their patterns are pretty?

216
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,090
Let's go over there.

217
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,170
Wait for me.

218
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,500
Do you want to play this?

219

Are you okay?

220
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,430
Let me take a picture for you.

221
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,410
You like taking photos this much?

222
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,070
My face is stiff from smiling.

223
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,640
Take one for me then.

224
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,520
Come here.

225
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,440
Look at the camera.

226
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,050
Good. Very handsome.

227
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,300
What the hell, bro?

228
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
What are you filming?

229
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,720
Apico-domal consonants

230
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,790
are also known as retroflex consonants,

231
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,350
such as zh, and ch.

232
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,540
Dental consonants are also known as alveolar consonants,

233
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,720
such as z, c, and s.

234
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,230
When I was reading them,

235
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,610
if you didn't follow me...

236
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,340

I went to sketch in the park today.

256
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,990
You can hear me?

How did you...

258
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,490
Good...

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,030
Bye!

260
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,570
Is this the right way to eat it?

261
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,580
Are you used to wearing hearing aids now?

262
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,430
What's wrong?

263
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,400
Why aren't you talking to me?

264
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,020
Are you worried that you can't talk well enough?

265
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,120
But if you don't talk to me,

266
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,180
you'll be ignoring me.

267
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,380
If you ignore me, I'll be angry.

268
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,230
Brother.

269
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,380

Who did you learn this from?

Who are you going to confess your love to?

276
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,849

Good practice.

Keep up the good work.

280
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,220
I'll buy you a textbook, and you can practice according to the instructions.

281
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,830
Okay?

282
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,120
Qin Xiao should be at home now, right?

283
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,520

It's nothing.

What's so funny?

288
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,090
Look at these goldfish.

289
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,580
They are so chubby,

290
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,670
and they have those big eyes.

291
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,330
Don't they look like someone?

292
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,390
Who do you think it is?

293
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,840
I don't look like a fish.

294
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,020
Okay.

295
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,310
You don't look like it.

Affected by the strong cold front moving south,

299
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,250
it's expected that

300
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,400
the weather in Jinan will turn from rainy to snowy.

301
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,750
Moderate snow is expected in most areas,

302
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,170
and there will be heavy to severe snow in parts of the southwestern mountainous areas.

303
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,570
The temperature will drop to -4 to -2 degrees Celsius.

304
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,020
You went out with Liu again today?

305
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,900
He arranged for someone to take care of grandpa.

306
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,260
I know.

307
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,260

308
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,230
told me.

309
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,690
He also asked me

310
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,070
if you went out on a date.

311
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,900
No, no.

What's going on with you two?

313
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,380
I think he treats me very well.

314
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,420
I mean it.

315
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,610
I like him.

316
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,120
So... What

317
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,040
does he think?

318
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,160
It's okay.

319
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,290
It's your own business after all.

320
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,130
What?

321
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,630
So I'm not a good friend

322
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,960
since I make you feel lonely in your world.

323
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,380
This is so idol-like.

324
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,040
I don't have something like that.

325
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,130
Do you want breakfast?

326
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,420
I bought breakfast for both of us.

327
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,300
I didn't know it was the homework you drew for them.

328
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,150
Why did you discriminate against us

329
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,740
just for grades and the Placement Test?

330
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,820
Do you want to go to school together tomorrow?

331
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,740

How did he draw this?

334
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,640
Not to mention the test only went on for 3 hours,

335
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,690
this is too good even for a two-day holiday's assignment.

336
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,340
We should even take a picture of it and copy it.

We are not even close.

338
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,860

displayed your skill to the full in a rage today

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,860
It’s my fault for speculating others.

375
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,850
I shouldn’t have blamed Class C.

376
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,060
I lost the bet.

377
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,960
I should come here and apologize.

378
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,230
You don't have to.

379
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,910
I...

380
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,390
Maybe it was done by someone from our own group.

381
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,090
I mean,

382
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,830
even if Qin Xiao were here,

383
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,130
he wouldn't force you to apologize.

384
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,390
He is very kind.

385
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,080
What's your name?

386
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,290
I'm Wei Jiayu.

387
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,660
They all call me Turtle.

388
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,760
Thank you,

389
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,860
Mr. Turtle.

390
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
If he comes back,

391
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,390
please give him a message for me.

392
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,360
I'll honor the bet

393
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,670
and keep my promise.

394
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,070
Why is she here

395
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,560
causing us trouble again?

396
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,130
What trouble?

397
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,840
She's your future sister-in-law.

398
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,870
No way.

399
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,990
Are you okay?

400
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,040
How can I help you?

401
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,620
What are you doing?

402
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,190
Let me rub your belly.

403
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,810
Your stomach is so weak.

404
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,500
It's said that stomach is an organ that reflects emotions.

405
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,320
You look happy to me every day.

406
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,920
Stop following so many WeChat public accounts for old people.

407
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,310
Do you have stomachache a lot?
