00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,340
It's also okay if you don't go to school.

188
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,250
You can do something you like.

189
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,380
Well,

190
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,910
can I learn how to make delicious food?

191
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,720
You want to learn how to cook?

192
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,090
It's very difficult.

193
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,360
You've underestimated me.

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,070
I was once an apprentice in the kitchen of a restaurant.

195
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,830
Okay.

196
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,690
When this year's exam is over,

197
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,010
I'll take you to sign up for a class.

198
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,390
I'll also take the class myself

199
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,050
to improve my cooking skills.

200
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,880
Hello.

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,710
Can you take a photo for us?

202
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,260
Sure.

203
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,060
Thank you.

204
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,950
Take two steps back.

205
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,770
Look at the camera.

206
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,250
Three.

207
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,860
Two.

208
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,660
One.

209
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,540
Where are you?

210
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,090
Well,

211
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,250
you are that lazy?

212
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,520
When you went home from school,

213
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,320
couldn't you take it from my shop on your way home?

214
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,850
Why did you have to ask for the takeout service?

215
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,600
Liu asked us to prepare some pigments, didn't he?

216
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,420
So I went home

217
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,850
and moved my things here.

218
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
This isn't your home?

219
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,720
There's cola in the fridge. Do you want to drink it?

220
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,320
Forget it.

221
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,560
Then I have to go back now.

222
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,210
Wait.

223
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,620
Carry these things away.

224
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,620
Don't reject me in such a hurry first.

225
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,310
I used these gouaches and paint brushes before.

226
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,620
Some of them are not too wet now.

227
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,890
Some of them got a bit dirty when I blended the colors previously,

228
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,200
so I don't want to use them anymore.

229
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,730
They've also got dry by the heater in my house.

230
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
I'm thinking that

231
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,810
if you need any of them,

232
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,520
just take them away directly.

233
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,690
You were also in the painting materials shop

234
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,620
this afternoon?

235
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,020
You don't need to feel embarrassed.

236
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,660
The cost of the color lessons

237
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,590
is a little big for me indeed.

238
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,080
Thanks.

239
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,160
If you feel embarrassed,

240
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,390
you can do me a favor.

241
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,870
You have an ill intention, don't you?

242
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,870
I'm colour-blind.

243
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,070
I can't blend colors.

244
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,950
Help me blend the colors, Xiao.

245
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,870
How about this?

246
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,920
You'll be fully in charge of tidying up my pigment boxes,

247
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,120
and I'll pay all the cost for your color tool kits in the training camp. Okay?

248
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,870
Where are your things?

249
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,400
Teach me how to tidy them up.

250
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,120
To paint propylene or gouache,

251
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,880
I usually like using this kind of tool.

252
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,960
I'm used to lining up the paint boxes like this.

253
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,280
After filling a grid, wipe it with sponge.

254
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,670
Then fill another grid.

255
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,740
After finish handling all the things, spray some water to keep them moist.

256
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,600
Too much water isn't okay. Otherwise, The gouache will get degummed.

257
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,110
It looks like it's not easy to surpass you in paiting color.

258
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,310
It's not that hard.

259
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,540
When I was a kid, I learned drawing with the students who prepared for the college entrance exam.

260
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,960
Every time I went to the training camp,

261
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,620
there were some people who could draw better than me after starting from scratch.

262
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,110
But there were only these several people who could do so, right?

263
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,760
That was because there were so many students

264
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,020
in this one art studio,

265
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,900
and only a few of them were really suitable for painting.

266
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,670
At least, among these several people in Boyi,

267
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,670
Mr. Qi Lu is also included, isn't he?

268
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,980
The scale of Liu's studio is too small.

269
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,890
Have you seen any small studio that can help

270
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,930
several students get admitted to Huajing in a year?

271
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,590
You still need to have a dream.

272
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,860
What if it comes true?

273
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,570
You will definitely get admitted to it.

274
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,890
What?

275
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,680
Are you also good at fortune-telling, Mr. Qi?

276
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,500
I started drawing when I was four.

277
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,650
I've stayed in countless classes

278
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,060
and learned drawing from countless teachers.

279
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,660
But I've never seen anyone

280
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,370
who likes drawing more than you do

281
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,430
or anyone who is more gifted than you.

282
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,800
Then you're not insightful enough about the people around you.

283
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,200
There's one in front of me now, isn't there?

284
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,110
I'm just

285
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,140
being pushed to take an easier path for me.

286
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,630
Then do you like it?

287
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,810
I don't know.

288
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,050
In my childhood,

289
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,320
when my dad sent me to the kindergarten,

290
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,800
I would draw the trains

291
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,290
and railways I saw

292
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,300
on the way,

293
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,380
as well as the kindergarten.

294
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,440
While I was drawing, I talked about how I went to school.

295
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,080
At that time, he firmly believed that I should learn drawing.

296
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,260
He hired a teacher for me when I was only four, and I came back to learn drawing every day.

297
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,920
Actually, I wasn't outstanding when I was a kid.

298
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,760
But as time went by,

299
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,650
the friends around me all gave up.

300
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,840
I was quite persistent,

301
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,940
so it looks like my drawing skills are the best instead.

302
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,380
But I know that

303
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,240
there is always someone

304
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,100
who can draw better than me easily

305
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,870
after he finishes just one training camp.

306
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,420
Maybe you actually

307
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,250
have a gift for telling stories.

308
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,720
You're buttering me up while chatting with me,

309
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,250
which makes me finish my work before I know it.

310
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,940
It's okay. Let me do it.

311
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,830
Stop adding water.

312
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,940
Is this painting your enemy?

313
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,140
The fluid is flowing.

314
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,070
The brushwork.

315
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,800
I'll say it one last time.

316
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,660
The brushwork!

317
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,190
Don't just color it flatly.

318
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,780
If you color it flatly again, don't take vacation on weekends,

319
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,840
and just come here to paint the walls.

320
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,040
Why are you sighing?

321
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,390
I feel that I'm incompatible with painting color.

322
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,240
Bro,

323
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,590
is it possible that this is your first color homework?

324
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,340
Don't set your standards so high. Okay?

325
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,250
Don't compare yourself with others in terms of drawing.

326
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,380
Who said these amazing words

327
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,590
to Sun Xiaorui that day?

328
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,230
Well,

329
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,130
after I said one sentence, you would talk back with ten sentences, huh?

330
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,290
What a nagger.

331
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,670
Darn it, Xiao.

332
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,260
You are really not good at it.

333
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,910
What do you mean by saying that I'm not good at it?

334
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,710
What you said sounded a bit rude.

335
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,839
I mean I've misunderstood you.

336
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,599
You're really not repeating the grade.

337
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,579
The color you've painted

338
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,440
is almost at the same level as mine.

339
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,450
Come on.

340
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,180
Even though he didn't form the style while laying big color blocks,

341
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,980
at least the color relationship of his painting looks comfortable.

342
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,650
How come your apple looks so disgusting

343
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,030
with a purple color?

344
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,620
No apples can have the color of pure violet, right?

345
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,520
As the teacher said just now,

346
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,590
other than the color of the object,

347
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,820
there is also the environmental color.

348
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,630
So this purple is...

349
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,410
The table cloth is blue.

350
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,560
The apple is red.

351
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,390
Mixing red and blue

352
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,490
will form the color of purple.

353
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,660
Since ancient times, heroes have always appeared among youngsters.

354
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,860
The future of the art circle in China won't exist without you.

355
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,310
Who drew this big purple apple?

356
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,270
Qin Xiao.

357
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,230
[Group C]

358
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,400
Are you free this weekend?

359
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,920
There is an assignment for us to find some sketching elements on this weekend for the creation class.

360
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,360
Do you want to draw sketches with me?

361
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,570
Forget it, Qi Lu...

362
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,200
He'll go.

363
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,190
Qin Xiao will go.

364
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:32,940
Qi Lu will go, too.

365
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,470
By that time, the three of us will go together.

366
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,370
No, I...

367
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,560
Just do me a favor.

368
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,680
Oh, no problem.

369
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,500
Okay.

370
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,440
See you around school tomorrow.

371
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,380
I'm leaving.

372
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,220
Bye bye.

373
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,760
Bye bye.

374
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,590
See you tomorrow.

375
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:56,070
[Group C]

376
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,510
She's gone. Just wake up.

377
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,480
The weather is so cold.

378
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,780
She must love drawing so much that she wants to draw sketches in the open air.

379
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,250
I have to go.

380
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,010
Turtle, you know what?

381
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,060
[Group C]

382
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,280
I really understand how you feel.

383
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,760
It's so difficult to pick the flower which grows

384
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,960
in the high mountain.

385
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,660
You like Sun Xiaorui, too?

386
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,190
I like big purple apples. Okay?

387
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,270
[Group C]

388
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,810
You like big purple apples?

389
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,500
Well,

390
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,620
you still need to protect her to go through such a short distance?

391
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,420
It feels like we're tailing her.

392
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,080
What do you know?

393
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,630
Love is controlling yourself.

394
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,960
Controlling yourself.

395
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,780
For the things that we've only done with each other,

396
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,910
I don't want him to do them with others.

397
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,440
For example?

398
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,770
Drawing sketches.

399
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,230
Aren't there sketch lessons in your studio every day?

400
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,590
Oh, that's different.

401
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,780
Congratulations. You've fallen in love with him.

402
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,570
Will I scare him?

403
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,860
Just like before.

404
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,170
You can give it a try.

405
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,390
How do I give it a try?

406
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,410
If I ask him directly,

407
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,010
we won't be friends anymore.

408
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,800
Sun Xiaorui.

409
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,090
Why do you want to come out to draw sketches today?

410
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,590
It's none of your business.

411
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,830
Then what do you usually do?

412
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,050
Stay away from me.

413
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,740
I have some heat patches. Do you want to use them?

414
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,800
Slow down. Don't sprain your ankles.

415
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,060
I've bought you some candied haws,

416
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,220
barbecue chilled noodles

417
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,490
and... I don't remember.

418
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,290
Anyway, there are kebabs with many flavors,

419
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,220
including spicy ones and not spicy ones.

420
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,080
In addition...

421
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,920
You'll know after I pick them out for you.

422
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,270
Qin Xiao, I want to talk to you alone.

423
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,960
It's better to talk alone about this topic.

424
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,260
Let's go.

425
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,950
Xiaorui!

426
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,580
Turtle.

427
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,590
Tell me the truth.

428
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,920
Other than big purple apples,

429
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,530
do you also like big green hats?

430
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,970
What green hats?

431
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,970
My hat is white.

432
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,900
Then do you think that

433
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,930
under the influence of the environmental color,

434
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,060
it has turned green?

435
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,050
Well, what environmental color are you talking about?

436
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,050
There's nothing green around here.

437
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,380
There's a big green

438
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,550
prairie on the top of your head.

439
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,330
What a fool.

440
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,370
They're just talking to each other alone.

441
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,620
Why are you scolding me?

442
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,830
Because I'm upset.

443
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,640
Why are you upset?

444
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,140
Since you don't have a crush on Sun Xiaorui,

445
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,940
I should be the one who is upset.

446
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,020
Because I can't draw well,

447
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,190
and I feel sad and ashamed.

448
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,020
That's why I'm upset.

449
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,630
Okay?

450
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,330
Why are you leaving suddenly?

451
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,650
The weather is so cold that I won't draw.

452
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,980
You can go drawing by yourself if you like.

453
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,100
What's going on?

454
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,700
Have you provoked him again?

455
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,860
What did you and Xiaorui talk about?

456
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,250
She asked me if I could get used to it after the color lessons started.

457
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,480
She didn't think that she could draw well.

458
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,530
I comforted her.

459
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,540
I said I was overshadowed by Qi Lu.

460
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,640
He got angry because of that?

461
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,710
Are you angry today?

462
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,290
[What on eath is going on?]

463
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,290
[Why did you leave suddenly?]

464
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,290
[Are you angry today?]

465
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,240
[Qin Xiao]

466
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,100
Qin Xiao.

467
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,790
A handsome boy.

468
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,040
Sorry.

469
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,110
The number you dialed is out of service.

470
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,770
Sorry. The number you dialed is out of service.

471
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,870
Why?

472
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,290
Why is he angry today?

473
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,840
It must be because of Turtle.

474
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,450
Maybe you have a gift for telling stories.

475
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,100
You're buttering me up while chatting with me,

476
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,230
which makes me finish my work before I know it.
