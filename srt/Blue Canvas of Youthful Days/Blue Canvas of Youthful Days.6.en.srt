(Episode 6: Doing What I Want,
Loving Who I Want)

3
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:09,577
If I listen to you, can you not leave?

4
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:16,609
Mom!

5
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,569
Mom! Don't go!

6
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:22,468
Mom!

7
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:23,655
Mom!

8
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,749
I'll definitely come back

9
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:27,780
to pick you up.

10
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:30,866
Mom, don't go!

11
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,640
Mom. Mom.

12
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:23,738
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

13
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:58,072
You have a new order, please check.

14
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,166
Let's go.

15
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:09,884
If I listen to you, can you not leave?

16
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:38,514
What's wrong?

17
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,018
No couriers accepted the order?

18
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:44,747
It's so close.

19
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,674
Why don't you deliver it?

20
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,470
I'll go deliver it.

21
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:54,955
- Be careful, alright?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:57,695
Aren't you leaving?

23
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,407
Not going to school today?

24
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:03,367
I don't feel well.

25
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:04,797
I'm not going.

26
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:24,204
Why is it you?

27
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,798
- Where's he?
- Huh?

28
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:29,180
Him. Qin Xiao.

29
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:30,212
Qin Xiao.

30
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,230
Qin Xiao doesn't feel well.

31
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:35,469
Thank you.

32
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:51,027
Liar.

33
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:54,674
They're all liars.

34
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:06,928
Brat.

35
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,350
Do you really blame me?

36
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:12,893
You never let me dream of you,

37
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,021
not even once.

38
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,002
When are you arriving?

39
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,690
It's about to start.

40
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:13,659
I'll be there soon, in five minutes.

41
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,785
Wait just five minutes, okay?

42
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,472
Ugh, always like this.

43
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,840
I've prepared a surprise for you,

44
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:21,848
alright?

45
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,117
You're here.

46
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,367
Don't you have to take care

47
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:47,125
of Grandpa today?

48
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:49,141
Qin Xiao isn't feeling well today.

49
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,189
He's at home.

50
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:54,617
I'll go wash my face, wait a moment.

51
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:39,120
The first time I saw you,

52
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,383
I felt you looked a lot like him.

53
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,579
I'll go put the breakfast away.

54
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,322
Don't you have anything

55
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:55,479
you want to ask me?

56
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,649
He was about your age when he left.

57
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:16,874
I need to back and take care of Qin Xiao.

58
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,196
I'm leaving now.

59
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,392
(Teacher Liu, you have to eat on time)

60
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,793
I still ended up messing everything up.

61
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,581
Do you think he hates you?

62
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:10,636
Maybe.

63
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,436
I don't know.

64
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,135
Do you feel that

65
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,196
he likes you too?

66
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:23,452
Trust your own feelings.

67
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,627
And trust your own heart.

68
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:30,972
You didn't go back yet?

69
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:32,101
Yeah.

70
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,913
I'll finish packing up the paint box I

71
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:35,238
share with Qi Lu and then go back.

72
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:36,413
He already put it away

73
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:37,499
after class just now.

74
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:50,022
- Sun Xiaorui.
- Huh?

75
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:51,420
This pastel green shouldn't

76
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:52,490
be in this box.

77
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:54,600
I arranged them according to the

78
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,764
order Lao Liu gave.

79
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,409
Sun Xiaorui.

80
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,990
You can't tell the difference

81
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:05,267
between green and blue?

82
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,304
Last time, this box had blue in it.

83
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,234
Hey.

84
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,516
It's actually best to plan ahead.

85
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:16,273
This doesn't affect

86
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,411
your love for painting.

87
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,860
But it'll definitely affect your exams.

88
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:24,965
Thank you.

89
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,933
I won't tell anyone.

90
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:10,575
I'll only feel at ease if you accept it.

91
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,005
Alright then.

92
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,910
Umm...

93
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,558
Are you free over the weekend

94
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:18,011
to do some sketching together?

95
00:12:58,154 --> 00:12:59,154
Classmates.

96
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:00,463
The special admissions exam

97
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:01,558
registration starts today.

98
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,881
It'll last for three days.

99
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,411
In the coming days,

100
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:06,028
I'll talk to each of you individually

101
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,318
about your plans for the

102
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:08,718
unified exam registration.

103
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,037
For those who aren't called,

104
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,553
keep practicing on your own.

105
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:14,244
Where's Qi Lu?

106
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:22,018
Alright, alright. Keep practicing
on your own for now.

107
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,070
What's going on with Qi Lu lately?

108
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,201
I don't know.

109
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,798
It seems like after that day,

110
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:40,618
he hasn't been able to really study.

111
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,440
He hasn't come to the studio
several times already.

112
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:46,148
He...

113
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:48,775
has indeed been affected.

114
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:52,604
The special admissions spot

115
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:53,772
at Huajing Art University

116
00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:55,423
requires a preliminary exam each year.

117
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,577
You submit a recorded video

118
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,663
of your work online.

119
00:13:58,513 --> 00:13:59,663
The re-exam takes place

120
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,706
after the unified exams.

121
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,730
If you pass,

122
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,920
you get an additional 20 points

123
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,150
for the college entrance exams,

124
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,076
these 20 points can set you

125
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:09,381
apart from many others.

126
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:10,545
Understood.

127
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:14,387
Not everyone has an equal opportunity.

128
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:19,423
Some people have backup options by
default, while others only have one shot.

129
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:21,543
Do you understand what I mean?

130
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,391
I also hope I can help Qi Lu.

131
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,074
But this is the

132
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:31,300
teacher's responsibility.

133
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,758
So I hope

134
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:34,305
in the coming days,

135
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:35,869
you'll put all your focus

136
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:37,163
on exam preparation.

137
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:38,187
Can you do that?

138
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,130
Lao Liu.

139
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:42,270
Could you talk to him directly?

140
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,356
Just don't involve his dad.

141
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,083
Alright.

142
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:01,276
Where's Qi Lu?

143
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,799
It's been so many days already.

144
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,244
He's not studying anymore?

145
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:06,140
Where's Qi Lu?

146
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,905
Why are you asking me where he went?

147
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:09,898
Aren't you two close?

148
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:16,197
It's been so long.

149
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,924
Why hasn't Lao Liu called for me yet?

150
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,339
The special admissions exam

151
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,418
is about to end.

152
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:22,096
You draw like dog shit.

153
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,189
Qin Xiao.

154
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,561
Come outside with me for a bit.

155
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,728
Have you had any contact with Qi Lu

156
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,352
- these past few days?
- No.

157
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:27,749
What's up with him?

158
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,983
I can't get in touch with him,

159
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:29,864
no matter how much I try.

160
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:31,249
Today is the last day to register

161
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:32,960
for the special admissions exam.

162
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:34,772
Hey, where are you going?

163
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:35,991
You're still in class.

164
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,907
Why are you here?

165
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,707
Not going to let me in?

166
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:20,866
Not going to the studio?

167
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,389
Just wasting your days at home?

168
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,202
Can't you just get to the point?

169
00:18:25,987 --> 00:18:27,447
The registration for the special

170
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,158
admissions exam is about to end.

171
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:33,224
Is this the only reason you came?

172
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:34,249
Fine.

173
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,738
I've passed on the message

174
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:37,042
Lao Liu wanted me to.

175
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:39,192
What exactly do you want?

176
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,065
Tell Lao Liu for me,

177
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:44,862
I'm not going to Boyi anymore.

178
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:47,736
And I'm not taking the special

179
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,441
admissions exam either.

180
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Qi Lu,

181
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:52,142
I never thought that people like us

182
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:53,369
could become friends.

183
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,339
- Since we are friends now...
- Who said I want to be your friend?

184
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,983
Can you stop acting

185
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,162
stubborn like a child?

186
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,384
Who's the one acting like a child here?

187
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,319
Who's been avoiding me all these days,

188
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,452
then suddenly shows up out

189
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:08,828
of nowhere to tell me what to do?

190
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:10,592
When I was in pain, you were there.

191
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,350
When my dad beat me up like a dog,

192
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:14,506
you were there too.

193
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:19,928
Why did you start avoiding me

194
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:21,144
after that day?

195
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:26,958
I waited here for three days

196
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:28,201
before you showed up.

197
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:30,659
Are you pretending not to know?

198
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:31,920
Qi Lu,

199
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,339
I told you...

200
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,839
I'm happy to take care of you

201
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:35,726
as a friend.

202
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:36,987
You've helped me too.

203
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,815
You're the first friend I made at Boyi.

204
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:43,128
If I've made you misunderstand anything,

205
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:45,315
I apologize to you, young master.

206
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:47,362
Stop being stubborn.

207
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:49,062
Your drawing is so good.

208
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,983
Hurry back and prepare for the exam.

209
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,997
Does this look familiar?

210
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:02,843
This is…

211
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:04,824
It looks very familiar, right?

212
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,393
It's the same as the sketch you posted

213
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:08,882
on the Blue account on October 3rd.

214
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,566
I don't know anything about any account.

215
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,811
I knew it was you on

216
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:13,952
the first day at Boyi.

217
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,249
I copied your drawing and won a prize.

218
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,507
- So, I wanted to make it up to you.
- Alright,

219
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,121
there are plenty of drawings

220
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:26,108
with similar compositions.

221
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:28,105
If you feel guilty because of this,

222
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:30,285
I can say I forgive you.

223
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:31,960
Is that enough?

224
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,727
At first, I thought I just felt guilty.

225
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:39,383
So, I wanted to see if there

226
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:40,513
was any way I could help you.

227
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:41,922
Later, I realized I just wanted

228
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:43,004
to be around you.

229
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:43,961
I wanted to go to the

230
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:44,819
same university as you.

231
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,538
Even though I don't know what I like,

232
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:48,024
and I don't want to draw anymore,

233
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:49,445
but because of you,

234
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,657
I want to stay at Boyi.

235
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:52,599
But that day, when I saw Sun Xiaorui

236
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:53,825
walking with you, I was really angry,

237
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:54,696
and I didn't know why.

238
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,400
- I thought maybe I was…
- Stop.

239
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:01,082
If you keep going,

240
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:03,110
we won't even be able to stay friends.

241
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:08,106
Brother Xiao.

242
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:13,586
Qi Lu.

243
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,578
Do you know why

244
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:18,507
I always like to draw lively things?

245
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,044
I've always wanted a family.

246
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:24,590
When I was 10,

247
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,419
and my parents left me,

248
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:28,527
my biggest wish in this life has

249
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:30,246
been to have a family of my own.

250
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:35,098
A wife,

251
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:37,202
a kid,

252
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:39,542
a small house,

253
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,518
just a simple, ordinary family of three,

254
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,534
you know?

255
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:44,628
Right now,

256
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,651
I just want to get into a university,

257
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,596
so I can teach my own kids

258
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:49,658
to draw someday.

259
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:53,808
Your dad is a jerk,

260
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:56,831
but you're going to be a good dad.

261
00:21:57,221 --> 00:21:58,543
Qin Xiao.

262
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,527
Telling me this…

263
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:06,713
is really cruel.

264
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:11,918
Then let me ask you,

265
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:14,715
why hasn't Blue posted any new drawings?

266
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:17,683
- I haven't drawn much lately.
- You haven't drawn anything?

267
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:22,291
Do you think you're really mature?

268
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,322
Like you're great at

269
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:24,611
making decisions, huh?

270
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:28,924
In that crappy notebook

271
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,781
you hide like a treasure,

272
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,903
the one you don't let anyone see,

273
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:32,685
aren't all the drawings in there of me?

274
00:22:33,422 --> 00:22:34,740
Why don't you dare post them?

275
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:36,209
Why hide them if you post them?

276
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:38,006
Why can't you own up to it?

277
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:42,910
Do you know what my future goal is?

278
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:45,021
Huh?

279
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,300
I want to do what I love,

280
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,011
and love whoever I want to love.

281
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:53,417
No one can stop me.

282
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,144
I won't let you run away.

283
00:23:57,022 --> 00:23:58,845
Why are you drinking alone?

284
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,202
Actually, I chickened out.

285
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What?

286
00:24:10,107 --> 00:24:11,107
I said,

287
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:12,960
actually, I chickened out.

288
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:17,468
Xiao Tan, look over there.

289
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:22,531
What do you see?

290
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:24,541
Buildings,

291
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:26,346
cars,

292
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,859
a shopping street.

293
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,279
It's a world

294
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:32,578
different from ours.

295
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,519
A few days ago, grandpa even asked me,

296
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:41,808
are you dating someone?

297
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,633
Is it that girl who was sketching

298
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,329
with you all that day?

299
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:50,691
Do you like her?

300
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:54,293
She likes me, okay?

301
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,318
And you?

302
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:56,906
Doesn't matter.

303
00:24:57,228 --> 00:24:58,902
Why doesn't it matter?

304
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,856
Just being friends is enough.

305
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:11,410
He has so many different choices,

306
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:13,543
so many open and smooth paths.

307
00:25:13,568 --> 00:25:14,568
Roads that are easy and

308
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:15,693
comfortable to walk.

309
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:17,459
Why should I drag him to walk through

310
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,592
muddy pits and winding roads with me?

311
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:24,390
I feel like all of this is

312
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,336
just your imagination.

313
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,656
When I liked Teacher Liu, I felt that,

314
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:33,830
even though things are like this now,

315
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:36,182
in the future,

316
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:37,846
I could also take care of him.

317
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,520
The future will keep getting better.

318
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:55,434
Be true

319
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:57,148
to your heart.

320
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:06,958
So why haven't you looked

321
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,286
for Teacher Liu recently?

322
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:12,148
Because he's more honest than you.

323
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,680
So I know that he doesn't like me back.

324
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,130
Yes,

325
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,155
it's me.

326
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,180
I'll be there soon.

327
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:33,684
Hey,

328
00:26:33,812 --> 00:26:35,187
do you need my help?

329
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:36,390
No need.

330
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:38,499
Stay home and take care of Grandpa.

331
00:26:39,492 --> 00:26:40,716
And don't drink too much, okay?

332
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,142
Slipping up, classmate?

333
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:57,738
How could you make a mistake like this?

334
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:38,565
I really miss you so much.

335
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:11,710
Are you upset because of that photo?

336
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:14,390
Is that why you haven't come

337
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:15,671
to find me for so long?

338
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:24,151
I actually have always been

339
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,354
able to tell clearly.
