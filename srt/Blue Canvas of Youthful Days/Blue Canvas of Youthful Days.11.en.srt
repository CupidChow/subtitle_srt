1
00:00:00,681 --> 00:00:01,681
I...

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:05,844
Just answered a call for you.

3
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:12,780
Grandpa had an accident.

4
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:32,896
Our Qin Xiao is taking the

5
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,346
university entrance exam this year.

6
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:36,521
Next year, I'll go with him.

7
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:38,821
How can I not save money?

8
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,158
This kid

9
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,199
is named Qin Xiao, right?

10
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:18,245
He also has a grandpa with Alzheimer's.

11
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,507
Grandpa Qin!

12
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:27,038
Oh no!

13
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,751
Do you know how scared I was

14
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:46,992
when I heard you went missing?

15
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:48,882
Can't you just let me worry less?

16
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:51,835
- Stop scaring Grandpa.
- Don't you dare touch me!

17
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,747
Our Qin Xiao has been very

18
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:07,229
capable since he was young.

19
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,432
When his grandma

20
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:09,745
was sick a few years ago,

21
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:11,378
he ran around taking care of things,

22
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,588
cooking by himself.

23
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,481
"Blue Canvas of Youthful Days"

24
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,974
(Episode 11: No One's Baggage Is Light)

25
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,475
How is he?

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,238
He hasn't eaten or come out.

27
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,180
Brother Xiao...

28
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,829
Eat something, okay?

29
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:08,383
I'm fine.

30
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:21,779
This isn't the time...

31
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:24,263
For you to fall apart.

32
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:30,953
Qi Lu...

33
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,934
I don't have a home anymore.

34
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:42,010
How could I leave him alone at home?

35
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:44,114
I'm such a bastard.

36
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,339
- I'm a bastard!
- No.

37
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,887
Brother Xiao.

38
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:50,152
When he passed away alone...

39
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:51,801
How scared he must have been.

40
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,839
I didn't even get to see him

41
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:56,975
one last time.

42
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,434
Why?

43
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,192
Why?

44
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:04,669
Even though there is

45
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:05,912
only half a year left.

46
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,801
He didn't even wait for me

47
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,262
to take proper care of him.

48
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,785
I didn't take good care of him.

49
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:17,761
That's enough.

50
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:20,940
Grandpa wouldn't want

51
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:22,636
to see you like this.

52
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,729
His biggest wish was for you

53
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:26,877
to get into university.

54
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,950
He always believed in you.

55
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:34,528
Qi Lu...

56
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,528
Everyone who cared for me is gone.

57
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,148
I won't leave.

58
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,659
Brother Xiao.

59
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:00,273
I won't leave you.

60
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:07,967
From now on, for the two of us,

61
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,382
there's still a long road ahead.

62
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,511
Why did you do this?

63
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,644
You promised me.

64
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:40,731
Who gave you permission

65
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,673
to come in without knocking?

66
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:44,933
Why did you send those photos?

67
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,355
Kneel down!

68
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,872
You promised me you wouldn't hurt him!

69
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,891
Do you think I'm just a coward

70
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,156
who's been beaten all my life?

71
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,928
That I wouldn't fight back?

72
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:04,124
I've already agreed to

73
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:05,335
everything you wanted.

74
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:06,663
Why did you still do this?

75
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,357
If you didn't do those things,

76
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,396
how could the photos exist?

77
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,434
Xiao Lu.

78
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,974
Does Qin Xiao's grandpa care about

79
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,693
the photos or the person in them?

80
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:20,802
Xiao Lu.

81
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,896
I have hated disrespectful children

82
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,709
since you were little.

83
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,131
In an exam room,

84
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,600
with so many test papers,

85
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,701
candidate identification sheets...

86
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,873
Some get mysteriously smudged,

87
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,834
dirtied,

88
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,373
or become unscannable.

89
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:43,194
How many do you think there could be?

90
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:56,899
Dad...

91
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,339
Xiao Lu...

92
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,899
You've made me feel...

93
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,634
like I've failed in raising you.

94
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:47,365
Dad...

95
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,639
I was wrong.

96
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:56,074
Please, let him go.

97
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,855
I was wrong, Dad.

98
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,300
Not listening and messing around!

99
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,752
How did I raise you like this?

100
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,252
You even dared to fight back?

101
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,855
Useless scum! Ungrateful child!

102
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:33,799
Are you leaving?

103
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,135
Lao Liu isn't coming to pick you up?

104
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,330
The teachers are in a meeting.

105
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:48,849
Xiao Tan, thank you so much for

106
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,006
all your help recently.

107
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,035
Thank you.

108
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,211
No problem.

109
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,094
Take care of yourself.

110
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:56,375
I'll walk you to the main road.

111
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,379
By the way,

112
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,285
did you hear that Brother Wu's

113
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:03,462
fake medicine business got busted?

114
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:04,766
Brother Wu's place?

115
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:06,961
Lately, his people have been

116
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,516
hanging around the area.

117
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,125
It's strange.

118
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:25,420
What did you see that day?

119
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,774
This little shabby shop of yours,

120
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,158
do you believe I can make sure

121
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:29,534
you can't keep it running?

122
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,874
How about I make you some more food?

123
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,483
Won't eating this upset your stomach?

124
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,889
It's not big deal.

125
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,872
If I could cook, I'd have

126
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:56,145
made it for you already.

127
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,225
Why'd you come over all of a sudden?

128
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,928
Didn't even send a WeChat message.

129
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,068
I was just a little worried about you.

130
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,550
Is that senior of yours

131
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,575
still around?

132
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:17,278
Lao Bai?

133
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,903
He went back to Beijing after filming.

134
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,747
Seems like something happened

135
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:22,875
at that place.

136
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:24,817
The person he was filming,

137
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,799
was their workplace at the house

138
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:28,487
on the far east side?

139
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,434
How do you know that?

140
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,793
Oh, right.

141
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,793
Let me show you what we filmed.

142
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,994
Lao Bai did a rough cut.

143
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,110
What's wrong?

144
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,891
Nothing.

145
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:58,907
It's fine.

146
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:01,203
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:04,758
I just didn't want you hearing

148
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,446
about these messy things again.

149
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,469
What's the cause this time?

150
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,149
Well...

151
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:13,760
He got a bit mad when he found out

152
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:14,884
I was staying outside.

153
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,571
Really, it's nothing.

154
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,688
Let's move to the art studio.

155
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,063
You won't have to keep running around.

156
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:26,475
I was even thinking about

157
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:27,595
moving in with you.

158
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:29,680
I've already brought my stuff over.

159
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,672
Let's move to the art studio.

160
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:36,218
It'll be more convenient for me

161
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,359
to take extra classes.

162
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:39,933
Sure.

163
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,297
Let's leave tonight.

164
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,985
Why so sudden?

165
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,455
Brother Xiao.

166
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,050
Did you prepare this?

167
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,478
I was worried you wouldn't

168
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:06,775
be used to the food here.

169
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:09,524
You go draw first.

170
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,056
I'll take care of cleaning up.

171
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:13,682
It's fine.

172
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,596
There's no rush today.

173
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,198
Come here.

174
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,551
Why so harsh this time?

175
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:55,325
It's fine. Go draw. Don't waste time.

176
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:36,999
Aren't you going?

177
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,554
I'll study some English in a bit.

178
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:40,921
My mom wants me to take

179
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,616
the IELTS after the joint exams.

180
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:49,311
- You should hurry up.
- Okay.

181
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,490
In an exam room,

182
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:54,178
with so many test papers,

183
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,635
candidate identification sheets...

184
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,802
Some get mysteriously smudged,

185
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,326
dirtied,

186
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:03,654
or become unscannable.

187
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:05,654
How many do you think there could be?

188
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,050
I'm giving you one month.

189
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:41,636
After your joint exams,

190
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:45,419
After that, I'll send you to Russia

191
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:46,853
to study at the preparatory course

192
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:47,939
at Repin Academy.

193
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:54,497
If you want him to finish

194
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:56,202
his schooling in peace,

195
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,005
the two of you must stop

196
00:17:58,029 --> 00:17:59,709
contacting each other.

197
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:47,974
It's already 1 a.m.

198
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:49,555
Staying up like this is bad for you.

199
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:50,653
Everyone else in the dorm

200
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:52,036
is pulling all-nighters too.

201
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:56,578
Instead of adding details

202
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,553
to your drawings now,

203
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:58,864
Why not make a lot of drafts?

204
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,600
Focus on practicing coloring.

205
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,353
For the same photo,

206
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:03,939
try both warm and cool tones.

207
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,087
Makes sense. Long-term projects

208
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,276
feel satisfying to work on,

209
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,415
but they're not very

210
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,476
helpful at this stage.

211
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,866
I need to speed up.

212
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,366
What are you doing?

213
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,377
Teacher Qi has already passed on

214
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,315
his 15 years of artistic skills to you.

215
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,596
If you can't figure it out now,

216
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:36,159
there's nothing more I can do.

217
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,260
Hurry up and eat.

218
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,622
Look. Do you think this looks good?

219
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,536
It looks good.

220
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:55,293
I got a job as an assistant chef

221
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:56,379
in a bar.

222
00:19:58,659 --> 00:19:59,911
At night?

223
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:01,638
Yeah.

224
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:03,661
Is that okay?

225
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,723
Then I'll pick you up after

226
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:12,278
work at night from now on.

227
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,278
And I'll take you to work

228
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:15,486
during the day.

229
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Okay.

230
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:24,981
Your package is at the door.

231
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,426
Wait for me.

232
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,162
So it's like this.

233
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,553
- It's beautiful.
- Mhm.

234
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:54,396
Let's find a place to set it up.

235
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,031
What are you looking at?

236
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,859
It's beautiful.

237
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,447
These were drawn three years ago.

238
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,164
This year, we created this.

239
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,234
What's next?

240
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,099
Nothing.

241
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,078
Why?

242
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,351
You've met my mom, haven't you?

243
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,562
Three years ago,

244
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,637
I had the chance to hold

245
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,076
my first solo exhibition.

246
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,152
Right before the opening,

247
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:55,159
Yangyang got into an accident.

248
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,039
My mom has always blamed me.

249
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:06,703
You can't be blamed.

250
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:09,250
Don't blame yourself.

251
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:35,749
Come in and talk.

252
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,278
Do you have the same feelings

253
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:39,343
for Yangyang?

254
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,913
Mom.

255
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,936
He and Yangyang are different people.

256
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,804
Why can't you let go of this?

257
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:45,864
If it weren't for him

258
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:46,956
resembling Yangyang,

259
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,050
I wouldn't care who

260
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,090
you're involved with.

261
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,636
It wouldn't matter to me at all.

262
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:55,702
How can you think like this?

263
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,874
How dare you think of Yangyang this way?

264
00:22:57,899 --> 00:22:59,500
- I didn't!
- It's not like that.

265
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,074
I'm not like him.

266
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:02,394
Xiao Tan, you should leave first.

267
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:03,754
He's already in so much pain

268
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:04,836
every single day.

269
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,188
You can't keep tormenting him

270
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:07,420
just because you're suffering.

271
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:09,086
What does this have to do with you?

272
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:10,110
He shouldn't think of his

273
00:23:10,126 --> 00:23:11,180
younger brother like that.

274
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:12,320
He didn't.

275
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:14,094
He knows exactly who he likes!

276
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,171
You need to move on.

277
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:18,132
Let him go!

278
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:24,452
Both of us will never forgive you.

279
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:47,247
At the accident site,

280
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:48,872
they returned his phone to me.

281
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:52,683
His last call was to me.

282
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,500
After that day,

283
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:59,375
whenever I create something,

284
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,480
I think about that day three years ago.

285
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,285
It will pass.

286
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,253
With time, everything will pass.

287
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:11,179
Xiao Tan.

288
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,550
After work, be my model.

289
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,105
You're creating something new?

290
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:19,269
Mhm.

291
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,074
It's time to move on.

292
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,902
Mom can't do it.

293
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,285
But I can.
