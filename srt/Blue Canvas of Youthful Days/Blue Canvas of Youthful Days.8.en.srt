that's your home)

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,279
(Boyi Studio. Outdoor sketch bus)

4
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:57,767
Coffee, Teacher Liu?

5
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,517
Didn't sleep well last night?

6
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,642
No, thanks.

7
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:01,774
Xiao Wang,

8
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,649
Can you drive my car back later?

9
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:05,493
I'm really not feeling well.

10
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:07,407
No problem, Teacher Liu.

11
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,599
Car keys.

12
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,599
Thanks.

13
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,239
Hello, Mom?

14
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,719
I'm at your place now.

15
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:20,033
Where were you last night,

16
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:20,935
not coming home?

17
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,167
Didn't I tell you?

18
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:23,236
I'm with my students.

19
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:25,065
So, I came at a bad time,

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,159
causing you trouble?

21
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:27,745
I'll head back now, alright?

22
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:30,604
I'm heading back now.

23
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:33,885
Sorry, Xiao Wang, just keep an

24
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,456
eye on the car and students.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,042
I have an urgent matter to deal with.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,822
Don't dawdle over there,

27
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:39,959
get in the car quickly.

28
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:41,447
Make sure everyone checks

29
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:42,599
if their classmates or

30
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:44,068
roommates are left behind.

31
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:53,057
Mom.

32
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:57,173
My son is amazing!

33
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,120
Like a

34
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:01,023
cute teacher.

35
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:02,896
Mom.

36
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,477
Why did you suddenly come over?

37
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,347
You didn't want me to come,

38
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:09,001
don't want to see me?

39
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:10,313
Are you trying to

40
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,774
forget your brother?

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,055
No, I'm not.

42
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,199
Mom.

43
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,484
Are you taking your

44
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:18,788
prescribed medication?

45
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:22,520
Attending your regular therapy sessions?

46
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,544
I'm not sick!

47
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:27,800
Open the door!

48
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:35,513
Brother, you're back!

49
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,905
Yangyang?

50
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,263
Is it Yangyang?

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,153
Good boy!

52
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,395
Mommy missed you so much.

53
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,513
Mommy missed you so much.

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Good boy.

55
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,080
- Mommy missed you.
- Mom, he's not...

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,544
Let's go home, okay?

57
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:55,879
- Mommy missed you.
- Mom.

58
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:57,425
He's not Yangyang!

59
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,380
I'll make lots of good food for you!

60
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,731
Xiao Tan, you should go back first.

61
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,080
He's not Yangyang.

62
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,879
Why did you send him away?

63
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,639
Do you think his leaving absolves you?

64
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,782
Why did you bring a boy who looks

65
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,462
like Yangyang into your home?

66
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,520
Yangyang...

67
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,064
Yangyang can rest easy now.

68
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,225
And you?

69
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:22,369
Do you feel at ease now?

70
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:23,648
So, this way,

71
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,603
you feel peaceful and at ease.

72
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:30,769
Go!

73
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,850
Mom.

74
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,632
Stop torturing yourself.

75
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:54,185
You're a sinner.

76
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:57,390
You can't forget him.

77
00:03:58,178 --> 00:03:59,366
I've told you.

78
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,390
I haven't forgotten Yangyang.

79
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:03,720
Even if everyone else forgets,

80
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:04,869
I won't forget him.

81
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,975
If you hadn't called and rushed him,

82
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,710
how could he have been so hurried?

83
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,875
How could he have been so careless?

84
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:18,242
Fine.

85
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,439
Mom,

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,390
if you think it's all my fault,

87
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:26,969
I'll admit it. Is that enough?

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,351
Let yourself go.

89
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:32,500
It is your fault.

90
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,617
Who's that boy?

91
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:39,109
Why was he at your place?

92
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,519
Do you think

93
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:42,120
finding a boy who

94
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,825
looks just like Yangyang

95
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,734
will make up for it?

96
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:49,680
Your younger brother is dead.

97
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,890
And it was your fault.

98
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:56,820
You don't deserve to forgive yourself.

99
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:01,539
Fine.

100
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,976
Then if I die,

101
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,367
can we bring Yangyang back?

102
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,414
Go ahead.

103
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:13,312
Go die then!

104
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:53,236
Xiao.

105
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,315
Isn't it time to come for

106
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:55,644
your weekend painting?

107
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:58,371
Brother Wu, there's an

108
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:59,801
extra class at school today.

109
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:29,459
Why, if I draw you one picture,

110
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,447
you have to draw me one picture?

111
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,471
Copycat.

112
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:33,216
What did you call me?

113
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:38,313
Boyfriend.

114
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:44,849
What?

115
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,480
Big idiot.

116
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,204
Stop, stop, stop...

117
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:56,150
Brother Xiao! I'm sorry!

118
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:58,735
You're still just like

119
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,024
the first time I met you.

120
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:03,970
What was your first impression of me?

121
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:05,888
Annoying.

122
00:08:05,913 --> 00:08:06,913
Arrogant.

123
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:07,930
I thought at the time,

124
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:08,777
this kid is really annoying.

125
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,220
Better stay far away from me.

126
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:12,064
I'm telling you,

127
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:13,442
that

128
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,372
wasn't the first time we met.

129
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,755
You stalked me? Followed me?

130
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:19,193
What?

131
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,560
Are you going to draw or not?

132
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:22,826
Yes, yes, I'll draw.

133
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,169
So, when did we first meet?

134
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:36,135
That day, the award ceremony of

135
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,641
the art exhibition had just ended.

136
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:39,052
My dad picked me up.

137
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:40,981
The car got stuck in traffic

138
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:42,669
on the street near Boyi.

139
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,934
You seemed to be running

140
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:44,974
from someone at the time.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,090
You were hiding right next

142
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:47,049
to my family's car.

143
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,073
Do you remember?

144
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:49,856
Oh.

145
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,590
It was that time when I accidentally

146
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,654
painted graffiti over

147
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:53,681
someone else's work.

148
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,755
No wonder they came to give you trouble.

149
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:57,616
At the time,

150
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,443
I could see you from the car window.

151
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,039
But you couldn't see me.

152
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,063
The distance between us was about...

153
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:07,971
this close.

154
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,617
But now, the distance between us...

155
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:19,796
can be even closer.

156
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:22,905
Geez.

157
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:25,126
No wonder you're still a heartthrob

158
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:26,266
in your 20s, brother Xiao.

159
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:30,288
Change into a white shirt.

160
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:34,797
What?

161
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,130
Like in that painting.

162
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,240
Put on a white shirt.

163
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:01,657
Not taking photos.

164
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:02,873
Just capturing the scenery.

165
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:04,412
- Really?
- Really.

166
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,320
Don't be so serious, okay?

167
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,559
Qin Xiao,

168
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:08,824
look back.

169
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,370
- Look at this.
- That's handsome.

170
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:21,078
- Handsome, right?
- You get me.

171
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,265
Let's take a selfie.

172
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:25,111
- Five.
- Five.

173
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,970
- Can you shrink it?
- Of course.

174
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,919
You threw it away again!

175
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,563
- Give it to me!
- No!

176
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,063
Let me see!

177
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:11,282
Hey.

178
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:14,454
So, what made you figure it out?

179
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:19,821
Fireworks are childish.

180
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,472
But...

181
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,777
It's been a long time since

182
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,113
anyone has seen me like a kid.

183
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:07,000
Now move a bit to the left.

184
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,985
A little higher.

185
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:11,514
Even higher.

186
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:12,829
Now back to the left.

187
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:15,242
A bit to the right.

188
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:17,477
Left again.

189
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:19,001
Then right again.

190
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,191
Left, right, left, right!

191
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,025
Stop smiling.

192
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,540
We're in the classroom!

193
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:36,821
I just love looking at you.

194
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,993
Lao Liu's already caught us a few times.

195
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,915
What's gotten into you?

196
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:49,231
Heartbroken and now

197
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:50,665
you're hitting the grindstone?

198
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:51,689
It's fine.

199
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:52,975
At least I have a boyfriend.

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,837
Why are you like this?

201
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,650
Uh-oh.

202
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,049
What's wrong?

203
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:05,465
My dad invited the teacher

204
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,605
to our house this evening.

205
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,227
He wants to see my recent work.

206
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:09,982
Now you know about skipping class

207
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:10,986
and not drawing your homework

208
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,665
and what happened two days ago.

209
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,009
It's because Lao Liu covered for you.

210
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,213
Any other teacher would've

211
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,791
already informed the parents.

212
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:23,323
Use my paintings tonight as a cover.

213
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,697
Your dad...

214
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:26,915
I think my dad won't notice.

215
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:29,462
But Lao Liu definitely won't be fooled.

216
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:30,873
He's a professor at

217
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:31,888
the provincial art academy.

218
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:33,115
He's been teaching me

219
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:34,178
since middle school.

220
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:37,170
Maybe find an excuse not

221
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:38,361
to go home tonight?

222
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,385
Forget it.

223
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:40,905
He'll just bring the teacher

224
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,050
here directly.

225
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:44,504
I don't want you to go back.

226
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:49,814
Once I'm in college,

227
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:52,204
I won't return to that house.

228
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,747
So you're painting now just to avoid

229
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:56,934
painting in the future?

230
00:13:58,226 --> 00:13:59,827
I envy you, brother Xiao.

231
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,668
You've already found

232
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:03,855
what you want to do.

233
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,929
Didn't you already say?

234
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,023
Do what you love,

235
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
and love who you want to love.

236
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,565
Honestly, I didn't fully understand

237
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,432
what I'd love doing in the future.

238
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:18,572
My focus was on the second part.

239
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:22,413
Many people your age don't

240
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:24,118
know what they love.

241
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,921
At least you've ruled out

242
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:26,948
something you don't love.

243
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:28,322
Isn't that great?

244
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:31,362
I thought you'd criticize me.

245
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
For what?

246
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:35,360
For being selfish, naive,

247
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,591
or showing off.

248
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:38,370
Having resources but still complaining.

249
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:39,909
Who even says that stuff?

250
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:41,681
In the studio

251
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:42,895
I used to study.

252
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:44,948
Or school friends.

253
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,581
They don't know a thing.

254
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:48,182
Just a bunch of kids.

255
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,628
Of course, you're still a kid too.

256
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,065
I do have something I like.

257
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:57,082
What is it?

258
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,784
I'll tell you once I figure it out.

259
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,641
Let's have a drink.

260
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,355
- Alright, alright.
- These paintings

261
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,440
are much better than before.

262
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:18,702
Here.

263
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:19,834
Although the details

264
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,064
aren't deeply refined,

265
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,230
the color relationships feel harmonious.

266
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,770
The brushwork is bold and decisive too.

267
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,085
These pictures are very different

268
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:30,797
from your previous ones.

269
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,298
To be honest,

270
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,722
did you really paint these?

271
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,878
Teacher Zhang, I'm sorry.

272
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,741
As long as you don't feel like

273
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:40,897
you've wasted your time,

274
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:41,960
that's what matters.

275
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:44,296
Year after year, just idling away

276
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:46,372
you feel frustrated, and honestly,

277
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,404
so do I.

278
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,140
Look at your previous works.

279
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,007
They're not terrible,

280
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,921
but they're not truly good either.

281
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,529
Teacher,

282
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,179
could you not tell my dad?

283
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,218
I just wanted to show you his paintings.

284
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,780
I know I haven't made much

285
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:04,519
progress during this training period.

286
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,257
Is this friend of yours close to you?

287
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:09,282
Yeah.

288
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,320
His picture has a good meaning

289
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,734
and emotional.

290
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:15,726
He really loves painting.

291
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,570
If he had the same resources as you,

292
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:19,874
he'd achieve even more.

293
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,740
So you should think about this,

294
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,225
you're enjoying all these privileges,

295
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,560
why not put

296
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,023
more effort into it?

297
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,116
Teacher, I'm sorry.

298
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,320
I don't know what your plans are,

299
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,234
but your father has invested

300
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:35,442
so much in you.

301
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,866
You might feel pressured,

302
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,429
or rebellious,

303
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:42,096
But in this world, there is nothing

304
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,854
wrong with being a parent.

305
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,663
Sometimes their strictness,

306
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,585
in the end, is for your own good.

307
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:50,394
Yes,

308
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:51,553
my dad...

309
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,273
has sacrificed a lot for me.

310
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:57,960
So, Teacher Zhang, how's everything?

311
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:58,985
Thanks for your hard work.

312
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,094
It's still transitioning towards

313
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,602
the exam-focused approach.

314
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:03,881
Xiao Qi.

315
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Not bad.

316
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,008
Alright, let's head inside and talk.

317
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:08,687
Lao Guo and the others are here too.

318
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:09,927
We're all planning to organize

319
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:10,961
a group exhibition.

320
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,695
We'll consult a curator to discuss

321
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,914
the content later.

322
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,839
- Sure, sure.
- Let's go.

323
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:38,296
Taishan cigarettes, one pack.

324
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,799
20 yuan.

325
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:44,885
One pack.

326
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:50,166
Also, for the three to four guys

327
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,345
working under me,

328
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,627
calculate the cigarette money

329
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:53,590
for these past few days.

330
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,982
Let me tally it up.

331
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,674
Another 20 yuan.

332
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
That's 40 total.

333
00:17:58,386 --> 00:17:59,386
40?

334
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,441
Alright.

335
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,690
Hey.

336
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:10,260
How's our old man's health?

337
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,339
Huh?

338
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:12,635
Hey.

339
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:14,546
I know a really skilled doctor.

340
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:16,038
Let me introduce him to you.

341
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,429
You should take your grandpa

342
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,255
for a visit.

343
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Thanks, Brother Wu.

344
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,202
Why are you being so polite?

345
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,788
By the way, that thing we talked about,

346
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:25,983
painting for East Street...

347
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,999
How's the progress?

348
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:29,488
Brother Wu, didn't I

349
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:31,155
mention it over the phone last time?

350
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,445
I really can't spare time

351
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,617
before the exams.

352
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:35,121
Qin Xiao,

353
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,265
Brother Wu can find you work,

354
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:40,804
but he can also make sure

355
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:42,437
you don't get any work at all.

356
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:45,288
This little shop of yours,

357
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,337
if I wanted to shut it down,

358
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,709
do you think I couldn't?

359
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,208
I'm sorry, Brother Wu.

360
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,130
The school hasn't given us a break yet.

361
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,819
If I had time, would I say no?

362
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:57,616
Please keep looking out for our family.

363
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,265
You brat.

364
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,897
What did you see that day?

365
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,733
Didn't you just

366
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:08,912
tell me where to draw

367
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:10,225
the picture on the wall?

368
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:17,044
Fine.

369
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,610
You punk.

370
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,319
I'm leaving.

371
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:34,633
Brother Xiao,

372
00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:36,188
I'm home.

373
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:38,615
I want to see you.

374
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:25,138
What's wrong?

375
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:26,767
I just missed you.

376
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:29,463
I missed you too.

377
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:31,767
You're in a bad mood?

378
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:35,010
You're in a bad mood too.

379
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,470
Let's go out on a date.

380
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:41,767
It's 3 a.m.

381
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,130
Isn't that okay?

382
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:44,728
The streets will be empty.

383
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:00,840
When I was a kid, I used to come

384
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:02,152
here to play in the water.

385
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,762
Me too.

386
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:06,127
Hey, did you ever take a picture

387
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:07,432
with that tiger statue?

388
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:08,675
Of course!

389
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:11,198
Back when my grandpa was still healthy,

390
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:12,444
he used to come here often

391
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:13,652
to fetch water.

392
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,640
I remember when I was in school,

393
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,696
during holidays like Labor Day

394
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,081
and National Day,

395
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,826
our teachers would organize us

396
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:23,691
to be volunteer tour guides.

397
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:26,675
Our school did that too.

398
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:28,540
But I guess we weren't

399
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:29,665
in the same grade.

400
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,011
Not too far apart.

401
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:32,701
When I was in seventh grade,

402
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:33,777
you were in your final year.

403
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:35,151
That's not much of a gap.

404
00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:39,198
This area of the old town with water,

405
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:41,714
it's my favorite part of the city.

406
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:47,870
During the day,

407
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,034
when the sunlight hits

408
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,159
the water's surface,

409
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,886
the colors are beautiful.

410
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:01,933
Just sitting here,

411
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,276
makes me feel like...

412
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,713
whether it's people from

413
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:05,737
my neighborhood,

414
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:07,737
or people from yours,

415
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,472
everyone takes a walk here.

416
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:13,424
Everyone enjoys the same mist,

417
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:14,455
its smell,

418
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,753
its colors.

419
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,728
It's moments like these

420
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:19,962
that make me feel...

421
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,487
I am also the owner of this city.

422
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:26,714
This is my home too.

423
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,091
In the future,

424
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,393
wherever I am,

425
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:19,144
that will always be your home too.

426
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:45,049
I'll head up now.

427
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:46,652
I'm leaving.

428
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:50,020
Go ahead.

429
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:02,965
Wait.

430
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:04,655
Turn around!

431
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:06,125
Can't I at least watch my boyfriend

432
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,337
leave after he walks me home?

433
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:08,361
Don't do this.

434
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:09,621
Just turn around!

435
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,119
This is too...

436
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,299
What are you embarrassed about?

437
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,041
I'm over 20. Do you see me as

438
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,775
someone who lacks a girlfriend?

439
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,081
Okay, okay.

440
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:28,861
If you say it again...

441
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,525
Why did you call me here?

442
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:56,845
Enough already.

443
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,986
You're always drinking.

444
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
I can't help it.

445
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,410
If I don't drink a little,

446
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,551
I can't sleep at night.

447
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,916
That boy,

448
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:13,080
he's your younger brother?

449
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,799
So you were lying to me before?

450
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,556
That day, after the snow stopped,

451
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:38,056
I was waiting for the sun to come out.

452
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,697
It doesn't snow often in the south.

453
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:46,329
I thought the sunset on the snow

454
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,275
would be beautiful.

455
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:53,017
So I waited outside all day.

456
00:25:55,268 --> 00:25:56,713
But the clouds were too thick.

457
00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:58,642
They never cleared up.

458
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:01,650
In the end, I didn't see anything.

459
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,549
So, you waited the whole day.

460
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:12,189
I knew it was cloudy that morning.

461
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:16,541
But I still waited, hoping for the sun.

462
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,244
It was bound to be disappointing.

463
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:22,744
So?

464
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:26,145
So,

465
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,338
I shouldn't have waited

466
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:30,322
in the first place.

467
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,530
Do I really look that much

468
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:39,624
like your brother?

469
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,658
The first time I noticed you at the bar,

470
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:49,182
it was because your profile

471
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:50,674
looked just like Yangyang's.

472
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:52,720
He passed away?

473
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:54,594
Three years ago.

474
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:56,985
A car accident.

475
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:01,392
Does seeing me make you sad?

476
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,321
Sometimes, yes.

477
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,104
Could you do this with your brother?

478
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,666
We wouldn't hug like this.

479
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:24,205
Usually we argue and fight.

480
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:27,999
After Yangyang passed,

481
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,147
I couldn't accept it.

482
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:34,786
I couldn't stay in the city

483
00:27:34,811 --> 00:27:36,185
where he lived.

484
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:39,913
So I bought a random plane ticket,

485
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:42,866
and ended up in this unfamiliar place.

486
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:47,680
You didn't do anything wrong.

487
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:52,938
So, Xiao Tan,

488
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,094
you understand, right?

489
00:27:55,944 --> 00:27:57,461
I really like you.

490
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:00,747
But I can only take care of you

491
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,208
like an older brother would.

492
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,172
I can't love someone

493
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:09,703
who looks so much like my brother.

494
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,727
Before, it might have been okay.

495
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:17,867
But now, for our Xiao Tan,

496
00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:19,617
it's just too unfair.

497
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:22,523
So,

498
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:32,990
don't come looking for me anymore.
