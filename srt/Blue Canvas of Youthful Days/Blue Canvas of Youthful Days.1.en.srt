My father taught me to observe life since I was young.

86
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,940
He often said

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,909
that art is derived from life.

88
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,800

She left behind many works when she was alive.

95

96

Are you here today to learn about the training camp?

Did your parents not come?

193
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,920
Joining the training camp now doesn't leave much time.

194

Are you Uncle Zhang?

195
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,950
I've always heard from my dad

196
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,030
that your studio produces top students who get admitted to various colleges every year.

197
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,360
So my dad arranged me here before the exam.

198
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,510
I have some basics, so I shouldn't fall behind.

199
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,090
My dad said I might trouble you in the coming days.

200
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,530
Thank you very much.

201
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,080
You’re talking about Zhang’s studio, right?

202
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,780

203
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,310

205
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,880

Sorry, Sir.

207
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,370

You did a good job.

212
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,080

By the way, Mr. Liu,

are those paintings outside done by your students?

221

Yes.

222
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,300
We focus a lot on sketching.

223
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,010
A lot of sketch practice helps students better control shapes.

224
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,900
Can I meet the student who painted that piece?

225
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,060
I like his style.

226
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,970
