6
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,860
Come on, let's study.

7
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,980
Oh, yeah, Teacher Fu Nan will test you on Chinese idioms, right?

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,739
I've collected the past papers for you to try.

9
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,720
Thirty questions.

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,140
I'll time you. And you try doing the test.

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,040
If you're stuck with any question, just skip it.

12
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,173
Hoon, hello.

13
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,220
Hoon, you didn't tell me

14
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,299
that you'd come back earlier.

15
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:40,659
I would've prepared a big meal.

16
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,059
Ma, this is all right.

17
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,419
Actually, the main reason Nozomi came was

18
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:47,270
she wanted to try your Hokkien noodles.

19
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,579
And how about you two?

20
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,580
When did you start seeing each other? Why didn't I know about this?

21
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,660
Well... I wanted to be sure first.

22
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,080
And then I would tell you all.

23
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,260
Actually, Nozomi is a tour guide.

24
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,160
I met her in Japan.

25
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,540
Wow, my son, you've never disappointed me.

26
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,820
So hurry up. I want to have grandchildren.

27
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,540
Ma.

28
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,060
I was just teasing, Nozomi-chan.

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,400
Teh, Hoon has brought his girlfriend to see me.

30
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,719
When you have one, bring her here to see me, all right?

31
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,339
Teh already has one. I think the name's Tarn, right?

32
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,779
The girl that Ma told me you brought here.

33
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,500
Ma!

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,940
All right, all right, we'll stop talking about this.

35
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,579
Let's eat!

36
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,513
Okay.

37
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,219
Oh-aew.

38
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:56,619
When Teh and Tarn become a couple, don't forget to tell me, okay?

39
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:58,553
Ma!

40
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,493
Of course.

41
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,340
Nozomi-chan,

42
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,450
what do you like about my son?

43
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,060
Ma.

44
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,940
Well, I really want to know.

45
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Well, Hoon is sincere, and he loves me for who I am.

46
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,820
I don't have to change anything about myself.

47
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,859
I don't feel uncomfortable when I'm with Hoon.

48
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,680
I feel like...

49
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,180
Hoon is a good friend, and also a good boyfriend of mine.

50
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,400
He's just as the same as the first day.

51
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,479
Tarn has been to your place?

52
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,430
You've never told me.

53
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,720
Well, it's not important, so I didn't tell you.

54
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,650
It happened a long time ago,

55
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,100
I myself can't even remember it.

56
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,100
I don't even remember when we became close again.

57
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,573
Okay.

58
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,950
I don't want you to get mad because of this stuff.

59
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,320
Why can't I get mad?

60
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,380
I won't be like this ever again.

61
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,193
And...

62
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,200
You and Tarn,

63
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,200
how are things now?

64
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,273
It's the same.

65
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,653
Okay.

66
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,420
<i>[04:40 a.m | Tue. 30 Nov.]</i>

<i>[oh.aew: You're not up yet today?]</i>

71
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,160
Teh, don't worry about it. Make yourself at home.

72
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,900
And where are your friends drawing today?

73
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,299
I told my friends I wanted to draw alone today.

74
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,450
So you won't feel uncomfortable.

75
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,453
Go on.

76
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,573
Teh.

77
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,000
Could you color it for me?

78
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,253
Here.

79
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,670
Choose the color that you like.

80
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,693
Shit.

81
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,440
What's wrong?

82
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,139
I'm losing my focus now, Teh.

83
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,040
I shouldn't be losing it like this, Teh.

84
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,573
Why?

85
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,440
Did anyone do anything to you?

86
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,110
Well,

87
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,800
after that day that you and I...

88
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,020
I don't know why.

89
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,419
I feel like I've focused only on you.

90
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:04,579
I focus on whether you'll be interested in me.

91
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:07,779
And, last time, you told me if you're free, you'd come see me, right?

92
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,539
But then you went tutoring with your friends at the resort.

93
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,939
And you told me that you'd come see me right away after you're back,

94
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:16,980
but you postponed, Teh.

95
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,739
And what about Oh-aew?

96
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:21,980
You could get up at 4 a.m. to tutor him.

97
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,659
And today, when you said you're coming to see me, right?

98
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:28,980
I was so happy, so damn happy.

99
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,360
And then I realized that you had less interest in me.

100
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,640
What has happened to you, Teh?

101
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,380
Are you bored with me?

102
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,370
Am I a nuisance to you? Or what the hell is it?

103
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:45,779
Can you tell me right now what your feelings toward me are?

104
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,613
Tell me now.

105
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,690
I really don't know what's going on with me.

106
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,393
I'm so sorry.

107
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,900
I think

108
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,500
you should live your own life to the fullest.

109
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,250
If you want to be with your friends, then go.

110
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,899
So you'd know what your heart is telling you,

111
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,800
what you're feeling.

112
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,120
Is that a good idea?

113
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,733
Tarn.

114
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,100
You should go home now, Teh.

115
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,779
I have to pass this admission exam.

116
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,830
I want to have a place to study at.

117
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,340
<i>[oh.aew: I'll arrive at your place sooner than usual, I'm going to…]</i>

118
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,220
"Bang Dao Mang" means the opposite of "Help".

119
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,580
Or "to be more of a hindrance than a help."

120
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,073
And...

121
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,960
why couldn't I study at your place today?

122
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,859
It's too crowded at home now.

123
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:37,280
There are Ma, Hoon and Nozomi.

124
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,160
You won't be able to concentrate.

125
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,930
So I found this quiet café for you to study.

126
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,933
Let's be real,

127
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,900
if you don't want to get up at 4 a.m.

128
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,379
or you don't want me to go to your place,

129
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,330
you can just tell me frankly.

130
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,293
I'll understand.

131
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,553
But...

132
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,573
But what?

133
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,400
Could you reply to my messages?

134
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,419
You haven't replied to my texts all day.

135
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:22,170
You are acting like there is something upsetting you.

136
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,150
Well, you want me to reply your messages every day?

137
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,939
Well, hasn't it been like that all this time?

138
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:34,460
It's not every day.

139
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,540
I've got other things to do in my life as well.

140
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,720
But when you didn't reply to my messages, you were on Instagram.

141
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,070
Actually, if you don't want to do it,

142
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,680
it's fine.

143
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,340
But don't do this to me in the first place.

144
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,299
All right, put your pens down.

145
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,020
And everyone, count your score.

146
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,140
Then, write it on the right corner of the paper as usual.

147
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,010
We will take a 10-minute break,

148
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,870
afterward come back and I'll give you the correct answers.

149
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,540
We'll go through it together.

150
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,040
All right, let's take a break.

151
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,250
Hey, do you want to have some A-Pong crêpes?

152
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,820
Teh, A-Pong?

153
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,860
Nah, I'm too lazy.

154
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,180
I'll sit and wait here.

155
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,920
- What?
- Oh-aew, what else?

156
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,190
What the hell happened between with you two again?

157
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,120
Come on, let's go before the break is over.

158
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,780
Come on.

159
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,280
If you want to eat, just catch up.

160
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,380
<i>Yeah, hurry up and go.</i>

161
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,620
<i>[11/30 points]</i>

162
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,780
Let's play rock, paper, scissors. The winner gets to eat for free.

163
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,900
- I get to eat for free.

00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,573
Get off me!

326
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,479
Asshole!

327
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,780
I'm so confused right now.

328
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,980
I just want to know if I can still love you.

329
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,250
What's going on with you?

330
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,620
I don't know what to do.

331
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,499
Here first. I said that the focus was on this admission test.

332
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:07,320
There will be an accent and there will be grammar...

333
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:28,739
- Hey, P'Rose.
- N'Oh-aew, someone's left you these sheets.

334
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,900
- Where is he now?
- He's over there.

335
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,850
- Okay, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

336
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,960
So, you came alone?

337
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,813
Yes, I came by myself.

338
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,139
But you have to go to school.

339
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:56,260
Text me and I'll come to pick you up.

340
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,360
The guys miss you.

341
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,860
Don't worry about me.

342
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,619
You can go home. You still gotta study for the exam.

343
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:08,120
I have, but have you?

344
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,700
I don't think I'll take the exam.

345
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,260
I'll work at this resort.

346
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,540
But you want to get into Communication Arts.

347
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,590
You must take the exam.

348
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,750
What happened to you?

349
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,640
What's the problem? Do you want my help?

350
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,420
You can tell me anything.

351
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,680
I can keep listening to you.

352
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,390
You can text me, you can call me. I really can listen to you.

353
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,680
Or let's talk now. What's wrong?

354
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,059
I'm okay.

355
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:55,840
I can work at this resort.

356
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,719
Don't you be like this.

357
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:03,573
Tell me now.

358
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,833
I'm exhausted.

359
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,259
I don't know why I'm fighting for it.

360
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:18,540
I just want the time to pass by quickly.

361
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:23,300
Why are people born to suffer?

362
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,710
Is this because of Teh?

363
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,160
It's all right. There, there.

364
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,750
I know that you're sad right now,

365
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,850
but you still have a goal to reach.

366
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,093
Let me help you.

367
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,679
Don't be slow. You'll be late. I've prepared your ticket.

368
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:51,380
And when you get off the cab, check your things. Don't forget.

369
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,953
Teh!

370
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,113
Hey!

371
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,350
What are you guys doing here?

372
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,340
Well, we have to come to see our friend off to Bangkok!

373
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,760
You guys really didn't have to.

374
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,800
I won't be gone for long. I'll be back tonight.

375
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,953
I knew it.

376
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,253
Just tell me.

377
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,379
Oh-aew didn't go to school this past week.

378
00:57:56,379 --> 00:58:00,119
He was neither at school nor at tutoring school.

379
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,299
Why didn't you guys make him go?

380
00:58:04,299 --> 00:58:05,980
We tried everything.

381
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,980
We called and he didn't answer. We texted him and he didn't reply.

382
00:58:10,179 --> 00:58:12,980
I went to see him at the resort.

383
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,500
He was in despair.

384
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,810
He looked terrible.

385
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,580
And he told me he wouldn't take the exam to get into uni anymore.

386
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,480
He will work at his family's resort business.

387
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,870
Did he really say that?

388
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,180
Can you go talk to him?

389
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,159
Well, I really don't know what you guys are fighting about.

390
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,260
But you should at least call him.

391
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:46,880
You could be the only one who can help him get back on his feet.

Flying for the first time is like this.

Teh has been so good at studying since little.

Time has passed, and now he got into uni.

488
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,539
All children are well. Um...

489
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:10,859
And they are both ready to settle.

490
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:13,000
Here.

491
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,059
You guys are grown-ups now.

492
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:18,419
You have my permission to have girlfriends!

493
01:09:18,419 --> 01:09:23,160
Look at them, coming as couples.

494
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,020
Excuse me. I—

495
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,800
Teh and I aren't a thing. We're just friends.

496
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:53,540
I'm very tired, Mom. Would you excuse me?

497
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,240
Why were you quiet earlier?

498
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,180
Why didn't you say no when I said we weren't a thing?!

499
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:20,120
Are you afraid that others will know what you are… Teh!

500
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:27,340
What the hell are you talking about?

501
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,680
I'm not fucking anything.

502
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,919
- Go home.
- Come here.

503
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,719
- Go home now.
- I won't!

504
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,430
Why the hell would you embarrass my mom?

505
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:42,890
There are lots of people.

506
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,880
Could you please go home?

507
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,760
Please go home now.

508
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,800
I feel like...

509
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,120
I've been used by you all these times.

510
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:19,000
And I don't even know how serious you've been with me all along, Teh!

511
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,720
But right now,

512
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,180
you're throwing this away for another person?

513
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:35,420
You hurt me and I'm all right with that, Teh!

514
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:39,740
But right now, you're hurting yourself!

515
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:43,500
Go home, please.

516
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,853
No.

517
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,200
You don't have to say sorry to me.

518
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,539
Because the person you need to apologize to

519
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:56,900
is your mom!

520
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,453
Fucking asshole!

521
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,379
I shouldn't have said it like that.

522
01:12:19,379 --> 01:12:22,020
Now, Tarn got upset.

523
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,160
Ma, don't overthink it.

524
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,020
Tarn will be all right.

525
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,279
- She understands.
- Okay.

526
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:33,600
So what happened earlier?

527
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:48,619
I will go take the admission exam.

528
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:50,239
What happened?

529
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:53,290
And what about you going up to confirm your place?

530
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,920
I didn't sign it.

531
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,900
What's wrong, Son?

532
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,770
I gave it to my friend.

533
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,419
Why did you do that?

534
01:13:22,419 --> 01:13:25,370
Why did you give it to your friend?

535
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:29,359
Give me your phone. I'm going to call the teacher now.

536
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:30,779
Give me the phone number.

537
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:31,659
Ma!

538
01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:32,779
- Ma, calm down.
- Give me the number.

539
01:13:32,779 --> 01:13:35,359
- I'll find the number.
- Ma, calm down.

540
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,280
If the teacher hears my voice,

541
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,180
- he'll recognize me and sympathize.
- Calm down, all right?

542
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:44,399
Right now, you go pray to the gods.

543
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,079
- Go. They'll help us.
- Ma!

544
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:50,879
Mom, please believe me. It's too late.

545
01:13:50,879 --> 01:13:53,320
I've made my decision.

546
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,339
If you care about what your friends think, don't tell them then.

547
01:13:57,339 --> 01:14:00,020
Because I'll get in anyhow.

548
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,019
Just let them think that way for now.

549
01:14:02,019 --> 01:14:06,179
What if in the end, you won't make it? Huh?

550
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:07,659
What are we going to do?

551
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:10,010
Aren't you going to be stressed out?

552
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,699
And look at you.

553
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:21,999
Performed as Yongjian, saved money for your studies,

554
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,299
don't you think it's a waste of money?

555
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:27,579
And you had to take an extra Chinese class,

556
01:14:27,579 --> 01:14:29,919
coming back home late at night.

557
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,899
Mom, come here.

558
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:37,560
When you eat you don't eat on time. And you get stomachaches.

559
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,719
Now, you had medicine more than food.

560
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:46,159
When you got bad scores, you cried badly.

561
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,559
You wouldn't go to school.

562
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,360
You know what, I won't take it anymore.

563
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,000
I won't.

564
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,300
I won't take it.

565
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,320
Here, you said you were going to make me proud!

566

Why don't you be like him? Huh?

567
