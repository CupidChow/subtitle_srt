This is the consequence of being reckless.

45
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,580
You got your place at the university and rarely came to the last term of school.

46
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,179
Or if you did, you didn't really pay attention to what the teachers were teaching.

47
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:09,020
Ignoring your studies like this makes me think you're irresponsible.

Please allow me to study for the admission exam.

63
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:08,220
You may not. Every subject is important.

64
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,780
Although it's not for the admission exam,

65
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,299
you still need to study for your own future.

66
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:16,940
More importantly, studying for exams is on your own time.

67
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,180
It's how you manage the time for it.

68

76

77
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:40,520
Once you have a uni to study, we'll talk.

78

And you always have faith in me, believing that I can do anything.

163
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,780
Therefore, this coming exam, I hope you do your best.

164
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,420
I know you can do it.

165
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,660
I'll be there for you.

166
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,539
Teacher, can I bless the same person?

167
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:41,070
I want to bless Oh-aew.

168
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,539
Of course.

169
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,400
There's no rule in this. Do as you wish.

170
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,453
Thank you.

171
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,693
Oh.

172
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,780
Did you know that you're a talented person?

173
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,219
So, in this coming exam, don't forget your goal.

174
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:03,470
You can do it anyhow.

175
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,000
And about you saying that you'll be there for me,

176
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,660
I say...

177
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,970
I'll be there for you too. That'll never change.

178
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,260
I don't know if you know why...

179
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,920
I go pick you up and drop you off every day,

180
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,060
if you don't,

181
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,730
I just want to tell you that...

182
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,673
I like you.

183
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,300
I've liked you since 10th grade.

184
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,690
Since the first day of school,

185
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,410
I had no friends, and no one to talk to.

186
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,570
Until you came along.

187
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,820
You took me to hang out, for lunch,

188
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,380
and I got to meet our friends.

189
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,259
It might be funny...

190
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:16,010
to think that I'm a closed person, with no friends. Something like that.

191
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,640
But that day, I felt like...

192
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,040
you're the best.

193
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,510
I wanted to be your closest friend.

194
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,740
And when time passed,

195
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,060
my feelings for you slowly kept growing.

196
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,210
Until I got confused like...

197
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,400
shit, I like you?

198
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,470
Is that possible?

199
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,399
Then I was certain, when I saw you sad.

200
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,620
That time, I felt like...

201
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,353
Shit!

202
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,780
I felt for you more than I'd even imagined.

203
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,980
Although I'm shy, never really expressing my feelings toward you,

204
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,980
I... am not ashamed to have good feelings toward you.

205
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,370
Would you try opening up to me?

206
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,359
All right, that's enough, let's not overdo it.

207
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,280
I will give both of you a chance to sort it out outside the classroom. All right?

208
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,313
Right.

209
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:43,690
Go clear it out between you two.

210
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,953

I can only like girls.

- Bro, Ma won't be okay with it.
- Hey.

Listen.

Even if you held a guy's hand,

there would be people who are okay with you.

you'll be one lucky man.

Am I right?

327

she won't be happy, either.

It's your life.

I can like anyone?

You can always like anyone you want.

340

And if you really like him,

341

you walk up to him, and tell him that you like him.

342
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,259
And if he doesn't like you, forget it.

343

Okay?

344

- Can't have friends sitting at the table anymore or what?

358

All of you guys are in a relationship already.

Just let him go for now. He's upset.

00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,900
I want you to know that, no matter where you are,

492
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,680
you are still you, Teh.

493
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,059
No one can take away who you are.

494
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:44,000
No one can take away your dream from you.

495
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,779
And remember this,

496
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:48,779
a guy like you is one of a kind.

497
00:54:48,779 --> 00:54:50,880
Be proud of it.

498
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,459
Hey, hey, hey! You!

499
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:08,259
Don't mess up my picture. It took me a long time to draw.

500
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:10,720
No more hugging.

501
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,550
I'll hang it up for you.

502
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,600
Stick it on.

503
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,340
How's that? How's that?

504
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,140
I drew you very handsomely.

505
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,440
More handsome than the actual person.

506
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,920
Thank you very much.

507
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,270
Having you as a friend is really great.

508
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,253
Well...

509
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,513
Yeah?

510
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,380
The thing that we agreed on,

511
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,120
that after I got into uni,

512
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,700
I'd give you an answer on whether I am willing to be your girlfriend or not.

513
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,819
Well, since we've reached this point,

514
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:02,320
do I still have to give you an answer?

515
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,700
Well, do you still want to answer?

516
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,160
I think I do.

517
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,693
And...

518
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,360
I have the answer in my heart already.

519
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,459
But first I want to know

520
00:57:32,459 --> 00:57:35,090
when we were in P.E.

521
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,110
and you said you wanted to clear things up,

522
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,699
and had a confession to make about us,

523
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:43,650
can you tell me first what was that all about?

524
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,960
That day you said

525
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,180
you felt like you had been used.

526
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,760
I just wanted to tell you that

527
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,300
I have never used you.

528
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,680
And when I said I liked you,

529
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,860
I really liked you.

530
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,600
I liked you

531
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,260
during the two years I've been hitting on you.

532
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,620
I liked you as much as a guy like me could.

533
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:35,740
Shit, but for a while, I've been confused.

534
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,040
I'm really confused.

535
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,680
Like...

536
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,380
sometimes, I don't even know my own feelings.

537
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,139
That's it.

538
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:51,673
Yeah...

539
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,473
I'm sorry.

540
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,493
And...

541
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:12,780
What about the thing that you wanted to confess?

542
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,040
Well...

543
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,673
I was scared.

544
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,740
I was scared that when we had a fight, you'd stop being friends with me

545
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,660
or even hate me.

546
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,050
I don't want to lose you.

547
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,540
I still want to be friends with you.

548
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,020
Even if now I don't think of you as what I thought before,

549
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,460
we can still be good friends, right?

550
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,380
I'm actually relieved that you came.

551
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,480
At least, you still wanted to be my friend.

552
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,213
Your turn now.

553
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,353
Or…

554
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,500
your answer is…

555
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,360
My answer is…

556
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,220
I still want to be your friend.

557
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,259
What we've been through…

558
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:08,040
We're so amazing that we got through all that.

559
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,200
If you don't love me anymore, we can still be friends, right?

560
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,413
Shit.

561
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,273
And...

562
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,280
How about Oh? How is he doing?

563
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,680
I haven't talked to him.

564
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,800
Since I knew that he finally passed the exam.

565
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,993
Teh,

566
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,020
if you want to congratulate him,

567
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,120
don't forget to tell him yourself.

568
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,480
Why are you crying?

569
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,900
I wanna pee.

570
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,700
Water started to run from my eyes instead.

571
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,673
Teh,

572
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,540
no matter what happens to you,

573
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,520
I'll be there for you.

574
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,180
I'll never abandon you.

- Hello, Ma.
- Are you here to see Teh?

582
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:03,080
He's inside.

583
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,440
Go ahead and go inside. Go.

Oh, no. Actually, I'm about to run to fulfill my vow.

01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,190
you would've worn this uniform.

652
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,590
Don't think about it.

653
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,353
When I gave it away,

654
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,350
I really gave it to you.

655
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,220
I think I'm going to try studying at Prachayanan first.

656
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,920
If it's not okay, I'll drop out and move to another.

657
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:46,230
My dream is...

658
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,860
in here.

659
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,100
But you!

660
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,059
When I gave it to you, you didn't even say anything to me!

661
01:18:03,059 --> 01:18:07,220
I did, in an Instagram story.

662
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,350
That doesn't count.

663
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,453
It's all right.

664
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,753
From now on...

665
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,670
I'll be the one to speak to you first.

666
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,240
No, I'll do it.

667
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:38,150
Bas and I...

668
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:41,200
became friends once again.

669
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,533
Tarn and I

670
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,140
became friends once again as well.

671
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,440
How about you and I?

672
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,873
I understand.

673
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:36,140
Since it has reached this point already,

674
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,120
I don't care about anything else.

675
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:47,940
Becoming friends with you once again, I can do that.

676
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:52,780
Or even becoming a rival, I can do that too.

677
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:56,640
Or even you liking me or hating me,

678
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,760
I can take it all.

679
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,700
You can be whatever you want to be.

680
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,790
It's not important to me anymore.

681
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,880
But can I ask you for one thing?

682
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,330
Do not disappear like that again, please.

683
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,460
If I can be anything,

684
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:43,240
can I be your boyfriend?
