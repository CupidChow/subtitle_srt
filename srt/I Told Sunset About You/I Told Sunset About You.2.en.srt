Hey, Bas.

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,519
I'll help you with that.

10
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,219
Here.

11
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,760
- Bye-bye.
- See you. See you.

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,820
Is Bas your chauffeur?

13
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,899
Chauffeur, your ass.

14
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,039
Mom, hello.

15
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,959
Hello, dear.

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
I'll be tutored here.

17
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,539
Make yourself at home, Oh-aew.

18
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,373
See?

19
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,280
You're tutoring your friend now.

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,879
But you have to go back to study too.

21
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,639
Ma, I already got in, I don't have to practice my Mandarin Chinese anymore.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,859
Okay, don't change the subject.

23
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:04,019
You still need your last semester's GPA.

24
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,680
Mom, I've been stressed for years.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,479
Let me have my school break.

26
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,939
I'll go to school next week. Okay?

27
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,199
Okay.

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,279
You can do well already, I know.

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,719
I'm just worried that you won't finish school. That's all.

30
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,119
Since you've already got into the faculty that you wanted.

31
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:30,179
I forgot. Hoon left you this before going to work.

32
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,700
What is it?

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,039
He said it's a gift for the one who passed the exam.

34
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:41,580
You were complaining about having back pain to him, weren't you?

35
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,720
- What is it?
- Here.

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,199
- What? A plane ticket?
- Take a look!

37
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,980
- Is this for real?
- Yes!
- Give me a hug!

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,940
Don't forget to say thanks to Hoon.

39
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,559
Whoa. Will I get to be on the plane?

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,533
What's wrong?

41
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,893
Is it not delicious?

42
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,019
No, it is delicious.

43
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,370
The sauce smells great, just like how it used to.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,833
Well, I've been thinking about what you talked about with Ma.

45
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,539
That you got into the faculty that you wanted.

46
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,459
So I've been asking myself,

47
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,810
which are the four faculties I should choose after the admission exam?

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,750
Aren't you gonna choose Communication Arts for all four places?

49
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,630
The first two will be Communication Arts.

50
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,950
But the third and fourth will have to be Business Administration.

51
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,440
Just in case I have to go help the resort business at home.

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,690
You want to work at the resort?

53
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,579
I thought you only wanted to get into performing arts.

54
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,513
I do.

55
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,179
But when my dad asked if I could make it,

56
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,300
I got scared.

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,700
But if you choose what you like,

58
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,839
you fight for it, and do it well,

59
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,380
both money and stability will follow.

60
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,880
You're talented, so you can choose.

61
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,420
It's not like everyone can do it like you do.

62
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,150
I'm just a 12th grader.

63
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,360
Why do I need to be in a hurry to choose my future?

64
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,173
Hey, calm down.

65
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:07,420
You still got time.

66
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,920
Take your time to think.

67
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,519
How about this? Right now, you just focus on studying,

68
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,299
and do your best on the exam, get a good score.

69
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,700
And then you'll be able to choose a good faculty that you want to get into.

70
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,113
I'll help you personaly.

71
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,793
Hello?

72
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,653
Oh, yes.

73
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,640
From the Faculty of Communication Arts, Anantasart University?

74
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,173
What did they say?

75
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,019
I'm the first one on the waiting list?

76
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,633
Really?

77
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,520
- And what do I have to do?
- Damn!

78
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,259
I'm happy for you!

79
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,839
- So if one person abdicates, I get in right away, right?
- Really?

80
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,019
I'll look forward to your call.

81
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:42,779
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,459
Teh! I'm the first one on the waiting list!

83
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:46,859
I'm really happy for you!

84
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:48,299
Keep going!

85
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:49,860
I still have hope!

86
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,039
Let's go celebrate! It's on me today!

87
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,979
Hey, wait, celebrate later.

88
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,040
Today, you're to be tutored.

89
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,440
You still need to study.

90
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,900
- I'll call my mom.
- Yes.

91
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,379
Look... I wrote in big letters that say "Waiting-List Announcement Day."

92
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,873
Give it to me.

93
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,979
Look... On this day, I will go

94
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,579
to confirm my admission

95
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,020
as a uni student in Bangkok first.

96
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,339
Let me color it, so it will be visible.

97
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,739
Even if you look from Promthep Cape, you'll still be able to see it.

98
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,099
You use a pen with coconut scent?

99
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,879
Oh, of course. For a guy like me, coconut scent is a signature.

100
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,499
- You take it back now. It's so damn stinky.
- Shit.

101
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,299
What? Coconuts smell great.

102
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,219
It makes you calm and relaxed.

103
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:13,239
My hair smells like coconut too. Wanna smell it?

104
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,479
- No!
- Come on.

105
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,420
- No! No, don't!
- Come on.

106
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,720
No, don't!

107
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,039
Tuty, why are you barking at him?

108
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,120
You're excellent at barking. Exceptional at being jealous.

109
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,119
Anyhow, you can't just wait for someone to give up their spot.

110
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,659
Come on, let's start studying.

111
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,979
The vocab has like 5,000 characters? How can I memorize them all?

112
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,439
No, you don't have to remember them all.

113
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:53,659
The Chinese Proficiency Test only needs HSK 4.

114
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,139
That's only 1,200 characters.

115
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:57,860
But if you can memorize them all,

116
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,819
and you want to memorize the rest, you do it later in case it's in the exam.

117
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,539
There are only 26 letters in English.

118
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:05,499
In Chinese, you have to memorize it as a picture, a story.

119
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:09,039
One character is for one word, one meaning.

120
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,899
In the past, have you ever tried to recite any vocabulary?

121
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,980
- Or have you never recited any?
- Yes, I have.

122
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,159
But I don't understand it.

123
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
See? Ugh.

124
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,079
Well, there are lots of lines interconnected to each other.

125
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,480
How did you memorize it?

126
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,559
I practiced the Chinese characters on a notebook every day.

127
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,099
You... Have you ever practiced at all?

128
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:43,599
Yes, I have. But not this much.

129
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,119
Just seeing this makes my hand ache already.

130
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:50,359
First thing first, you have to practice the Chinese characters every single day.

131
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:52,599
Practice until your brain absorbs it.

132
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:55,139
No matter how boring it is, you have to do it.

133
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,119
You know, I did it until I got used to it.

134
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,399
When I think of something or when I don't want to say anything,

135
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,599
I release it by writing it in Chinese.

136
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,839
This is another way that helped me memorize it.

137
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,990
Why did you write this word on the entire page?

138
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,320
<i>[Rival]</i>

139
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,740
I don't know.

140
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,660
I don't remember.

141
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,580
- Give it back!
- You meant me?

142
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,879
What?

143
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,419
- Hey!
- Give it back!

144
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,819
- You really meant me?
- Yes! I am going to put it away.

145
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:33,653
Come on, let go!

146
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,040
Really?

147
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,460
What?

148
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,659
Where are you going?

149
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:48,540
Follow me.

150
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,220
Where to?

151
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,070
I have something to show you.

152
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,059
Why are you bringing all the toys out?

153
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,700
No.

154
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,913
Here.

155
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,620
These are flash cards.

156
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,279
I carried them with me to recite every day.

157
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,799
One set contains twenty characters.

158
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,360
All of this contains 1,200 characters.

159
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,130
I'll give them all to you.

160
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,440
Are you sure you want to give them to me?

161
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,650
I'm afraid that I'll get too good if I keep these to myself.

162
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,379
Yeah, take them.

163
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,480
When you have spare time, recite them or while you eat, recite them, something like that.

164
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,159
But after the revision, you have to come back and practice Chinese handwriting.

165
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,259
And that's not enough.

166
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:52,039
Every time you see me, we have to revise these characters.

167
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,019
And translate them, and also work on pronunciation.

168
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,420
I guarantee you, you'll be able to memorize it.

169

- If you don't want them, it's fine—
- Hey!

170
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,313
I do.

171
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,390
Well, you didn't seem to be responding, so I thought you didn't want them.

172
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,113
Well,

173
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,280
I was just thinking...

174
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,810
It's no surprise you're so good at studying.

175
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,330
Maybe you should save the compliment for someone else.

176
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,760
Please help me until I get in.

177

What are you happy about?

179
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know. But I like it.

180
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,930
Just keep saying that again.

Show it, your nose bridge.

188
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,810
Was that an insult?

189
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,860
Come on, just keep doing it.

190
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,910
What's wrong with my front profile?

191
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,370
- Smile?
- Yes, like this.

192
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,839

- One, two, three.

Take "Lixiang."

324
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,899
The root of it is "Xin," which means "Heart."

325
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:07,059
So the words will be about things involved what's in your heart.

There are other words that contain "Xin."

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,160

- "Mao."

335
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:41,199
- It means...?
- "A cat."

336
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,281
- Very good.

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,600
Yes!

"Zai xiang yi xiang", "Zai xiang yi xiang". Come on, think, think.

340

Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

341
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,780
There's a "Xin," meaning a "Heart."

342
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,620
What's the heart involved…

343
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,419
"Li Xiang" means "ideal."

344

"Zhan, Zhan."

345
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,380
Very good.

346
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:14,660
I'm so good at this, tutoring you.

347
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,233
Here.

348
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,713
Where else?

349
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,093
That's enough.

350
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,080
I don't wanna go home yet. My brain is still working.

351
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,980
Wow, so enthusiastic.

352
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,659
You want to have O-aew?

353
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:58,399
And we'll continue guessing the words at the restaurant.

354
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:59,840
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You want to?
- Yeah.

355
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,879
Let's go. I'll go change.

356
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:04,359
What for? No one is going to look at you.

357
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,020
The whole crowd at the restaurant will.

358
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,080
Look at how handsome I am.

359

<i>[The Memory at On On | Phuket Old Town]</i>

360
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,699
Hey! MoRaoYuLok!

361
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,819
Hey!

362
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,779
What a coincidence.

363
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,379
Phuket is such a small town.

364
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:30,140
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I invited them.

365
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,773
Sorry.

366
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,779
When did you invite them?

367
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,339
Oh, after we finished tutoring.

368
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,819
I told Bas, and he invited everyone.

369
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:48,780
But don't worry, I ordered extra red beans for you.

370
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,173
Let's go.

371
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,219
Guys, yesterday was a freakin' madness.

372
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,679
- I was about to go eat with Karakade, right?
- Yeah.

373
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,599
And there was a car following...

374
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,899
- Why?
- with full beam on.

375
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:06,699
- Oh!
- So, she was really angry.

376
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:10,339
She shouted, "What the fuck are you doing?"

377
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:11,659
Wow, why is she so aggressive?

378
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,780
Yeah.

379
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,199
And what happened next?

380
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,799
It was her Mom's car!

381
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,279
Oh, what a pity!

382
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,500
My girlfriend is extremely adorable.

383
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,879
You just love to praise about your Nong Karakade, don't you?
<i>(T/N: Nong prefix used to call someone younger)</i>

384
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,420
Well, Nong Karakade is adorable.

385
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,999
You guys never had any girlfriends, so you wouldn't know.

386
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:32,020
- What? Why you have to be such a dick?
- Why?

387
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,239
Leave me out of it,

388
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,860
Manao and I are still good.

389
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,979
- Again?!
- Yeah.

390
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:39,279
I used to have a girlfriend, so leave me out of it, too.

391
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,379
Hey, I used to have one, too. Teh is also seeing someone.

392
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,919
So there's only you left, Oh.

393
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,599
Never had a girlfriend.

394
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,939
Never talked with anyone.

395
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:51,250
Never.

396
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:53,659
Well, I've never dated anyone.

397
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,259
Never had a girlfriend.

398
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:58,480
- And I've never lost my virginity.
- Hmn...

399
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,640
Chaste!

400
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,540
Oh. My. God.

401
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,480
- Let's speak low.
- It's already low.

402
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,140
My voice is gone today.

403
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,319
No, but low.

404
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,953
Really.

405
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,260
Karakade <i>(Hibiscus)</i> is adorable, isn't it?

406
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,800
Well, it's just like me.

407
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,260
Well, let's live together.

408
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,199
I'm tired. Being here with you guys makes me really tired.

00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:29,120
- My friend.
- Tired of laughing?

- Uh...
- Let's say.
<i>[Oh-aew: What's wrong?]</i>

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,593
Bas.

413
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,193
Bas.

414
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:39,320
You said it like you were burping.

00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,540
Take the red beans too.

418
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,479
Hey, I don't eat the red beans.

419

No.

Will you take it?

422
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,999
Oh my god.

423
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,300
You eat a lot.

424
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,479
Open your mouth wide.

425
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,420
Eat.

426
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,153
Teh!

427
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,593
What?

428
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:32,130
What's wrong? Did someone do something to you?

429
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,373
No, it's nothing.

430
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:38,620
I was probably confused...

431
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,379
We were going to come here and guess the words.

432
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:44,079
And you invited all of them, so I got confused...

433
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,630
like, how are we gonna do it now?

434
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,100
What?

435
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,499
We can all guess together, it's fine.

436
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:53,779
How will you focus then?

437
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,730
You'll just play around.

438
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,073
Okay.

439
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,973
You!

No.

442
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,113
But...

443
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,259
you've just spread the word about yourself.

444
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,180
You told me not to tell anyone,

445
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,660
but you did it yourself.

446
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,153
About what?

447
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,420
Being a virgin?

448
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,319
Why? They are my friends, too.

449
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,770
Why can't I tell them?

450
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,233
"Mmm" what?

451
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,260
Actually, I don't know what's wrong with me.

452
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,510
But it'll get better, forget about it.

453

Teh, you said you were gonna take a week off,

Yeah?

I'm still a virgin.

Say it.

485

I didn't like it when...

486
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,839
you said everyone was your friend too.

487
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,100
Shit, it was like... I don't like that...

488
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,119
I thought it was like we'd become close to each other again.

Well, I don't know how to explain. Never mind.

00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,220
Why are you thinking so much?

494
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,040
You're my closest friend.

495
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,360
All right.

496
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,480
I guess that's it.

497
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,670
You're still not okay.

498
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,359
Forget about it.

499
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,980
It's...

500
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,280
It's not a big deal.

501
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,473
Yeah.

502
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,600
So you were upset...

503
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,580
that I told other people what I had told you, right?

504
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,840
All right, then. I have a secret

505
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,280
that I've never told anyone.

506
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,530
But I will only tell you.

507
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,193
What is it?

508
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,059
- I like Bas.
- Shit!

509
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:56,939
Really?

510
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:58,260
For real?

511
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,100
- What?
- Shit!

512
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:03,739
Tell me! How?

513
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:05,020
In a moment.

514
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,660
- Hurry! I want to know.
- Hold on, I'm too shy to tell…

515
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,580
- Are you embarrassed? Hurry up.
- In a moment.

516
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,799
Well, it was last semester,

517
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,300
when all of a sudden, Bas said to me,

518
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,659
"My way home goes past the pier."

519
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:24,099
"I can pick you up." I was like, "Oh damn, that's convenient."

520
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,559
"Isn't it nice having someone pick you up?"

521
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,919
And then, he really came.

522
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,759
- Really?
- After that,

523
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,159
we kind of had a few moments in the car sometimes.

524
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,460
I see.

525
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,093
What?

526
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,939
Hey, just tell him. It's your last semester.

527
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,093
No.

528
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:47,299
I don't know what he thinks of me.

529
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:50,420
- Hey!
- He seems to like girls.

530
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,699
And I don't want to lose him as a friend.

531
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,020
I'll help you.

532
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,180
How?

533
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,100
Hey! I will help you!

534
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,180
But you...

535
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,240
Don't get too distracted that you can't focus on your study.

536
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,430
The exam is coming.

537
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,890
You're good now, right?

538
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,059
- I was not upset in the first place.
- What a pity.

539
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:19,299
Who is upset?

540
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:22,339
"I was not upset."

541
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,739
You were making a long face.

542
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,573
All right.

543
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,099
I have someone that I like too.

544
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,600
Oh, really?

545
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,770
Who? You never told me.

546
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,119
Her name is Tarn.

547
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,919
But we're not a couple yet. Just talking, you know?

548
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,380
- "Talking, you know?"
- "Talking, you know."

549
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,540
I'll show you her picture.

550
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,620
Here.

551
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,280
Cute, right?

552
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,070
I'll go follow her.

553
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,060
Go get her! This drawing girl.

554
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Of course, I will.

555
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,710
- Can I ask you one thing?
- What?

556
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,520
- About what I told you.
- Um.

557
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,370
Keep it a secret.

558
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,453
It's a secret...

559
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,439
How are your pants?

560
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:20,079
They haven't been worn for so long, are they tighter now?

561
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,200
No. I guess, I stay fit as always.

562
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,900
- Boo!
- Bullshit!

563
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,740
- Not at all.
- Play ball.

564
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,820
Where are you going?

565
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,119
- What?
- Where are you going?

566
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,019
- Play ball.
- Play ball.

567
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,600
- Go...
- Do you go to the field?

568
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,759
I come, I come, I come.

569
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,540
- Do you want to go? Yeah.
- Go.

570
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,360
Believe me, just running is already exhausting.

571
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,519
- Are you tired of running?
- What's mine?

572
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,120
Running one lap is tiring. Do you understand that I'm panting?

573
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,900
Hey, hey, help me eat. Leave me alone.

574
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,179
What is Phillip good at?

575
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:00,140
<i>[Teh: Try to get closer to him.]</i>

576
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,119
Here is the striker, "Lippolooh."

577
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,099
I can't run anymore.

578
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,033
Run.

579
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,579
Hey, but wait.

580
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:12,430
- Where are we going to get a ball to play?
- Yeah.

581
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,333
Let's steal one from a kid.

582
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,419
<i>[Oh-aew: What for?]</i>

583
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:19,920
What game are we going to play?

584
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,299
How are we...

585
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:26,741
Yeah.
<i>[Teh: If he doesn't move away, he might be into you.]</i>

586
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,840
Well, you, you, you Telugu.
<i>[Teh: If he doesn't move away, he might be into you.]</i>

587
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,420
That's all four of us.

588
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,359
- Nobody.
- Nobody played with us at all.

589
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,759
Did you forget Phillip?

590
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,740
What?

591
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,099
I'll take Nong Karakade to sit and watch.

592
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:41,220
Full of encouragement.

593
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,360
- Already.
- I can't.

594
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,710
If you don't have a boyfriend, you can't do it.

595
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,799
Shit, what did you bring me this time?

596
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,633
Disgusting.

597
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,760
You haven't drunk water yet, it's stuck in your throat.

598
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
I'm about to puke.

599
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,880
Here's mine...

600
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,920
"I don't know either", that's what they say.

601
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,400
I can't.

602
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,673
You idiot.

603
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:21,460
Call me idiot and then Bas.

604
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,493
What did you say?

605
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,060
Choke and die.

606
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,040
Dead Kai.

607
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,300
No.

608
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,053
Why?

609
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,820
Hey, write your name down or else it will get lost.

610
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,520
<i>[Oh-aew]</i>

611
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,770
<i>[Oh-aew: Why would friends write names on the sheet for each other?]</i>

612
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,400
<i> "Wae."
(T/N gagging sounds because it's too romantic and sweet)</i>

613
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,860
<i>[Teh: A smart-mouth online, but such a loser at the cafeteria.]</i>

614
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,680
<i>[Dibuk Restaurant]</i>

615
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,139
It's good now that you're back to take the extra class with us.

616
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:05,979
So you can tutor Oh as well.

617
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:08,419
Also, if you score less than Phillip,

618
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:11,680
you have to reconsider yourself.

619
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,379
Damn.

620
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:16,120
If you scold me, slap your mouth.

621
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,320
Why?

622
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,819
Guys, my girlfriend just got a new haircut.

623
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:23,160
- Hey.
- How is it?

624
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,399
Isn't she pretty?

625
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,799
Gosh.

626
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,879
But wait, who's that girl on the right?

627
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,879
I've never seen her before.

628
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,979
She's kind of cute.

629
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:34,819
- Let me see.
- Shit.

630
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,160
You want to take a look, right?

631
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,440
Where? Where?

632
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,480
This person.

633
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,540
Yeah, kind of cute.

634
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,140
You like her, but she's not as cute as my girl.

635
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,700
Quit it. Quit it.

636
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,560
Our relationship is over...

637
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,680
Going to break ties with your friends?

638
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,479
- What is this person?
- This is the beast.

639
00:42:57,479 --> 00:42:59,879
Wow. Already?

640
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:01,999
- Can't you?
- Why don't you have a girlfriend?

641
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:06,560
Do you want to know if Bas likes you?

642
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,980
Try to observe him closely.

643
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,700
Damn so cute.

644
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,500
What are you going to do?

645
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,519
You'll see.

646
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,900
Just like Nong Manow.

647
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,340
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah.

648
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:26,599
- What...
- What is it?

649
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,433
What is it?

650
00:43:28,433 --> 00:43:30,500
I'll be hitting on Oh-aew.

651
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,520
You must be joking, right?

652
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,480
I'm being serious.

653
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,699
Just kidding.

654
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:05,539
Asshole.

655
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:08,799
- What are you playing at?
- Oh.

656
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,180
I'm just teasing... Just teasing.

657
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,953
I say...

658
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,593
Ai Oh!

659
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,010
Are you free on Sunday afternoon?

660
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,020
Let's go study together.

661
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,693
Well...

662
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,920
I'll let you know.

663
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,000
You can send me a message tonight.

664
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,940
So… on the way home with Bas today, did you two kiss in the car?

665
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,699
<i>Are you nuts?</i>

666
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:20,879
But earlier in the car, he was talking to me more than usual.

667
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:23,219
If he hadn't turned on the radio,

668
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:26,500
he would have heard my heart beating so fast.

669
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,993
<i>Annoying!</i>

670
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:33,679
How about you and Tarn?

671
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:35,599
Does your heart beat fast like this?

672
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,299
Every single time that I'm with her.

673
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:40,679
<i>Whoa, that much? Why?</i>

674
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:43,219
Well, because I am not her boyfriend yet.

675
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:45,180
I get to pursue her every day.

676
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,720
And each day, my heart pounds really fast.

677
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,699
<i>One more thing is that I really like seeing her.</i>

678
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:54,699
<i>When I see her sincerely following her dreams.</i>

679
00:45:54,699 --> 00:45:57,950
<i>It's like I'm surrounded by the person with the same vibe.</i>

680
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,919
How about you? What do you like about Bas?

681
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:05,579
He's handsome, all right?

682
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,440
<i>Do you think I'm handsome, too?</i>

683
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,610
I've told you this before. You're good-looking just from the side.

684
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,500
Go let him tutor you.

685
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,759
Well, he's not only handsome,

686
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,240
he's also kind

687
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,600
He's very kind to me.

688
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,950
Although he seems quiet and not caring,

689
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,379
he's a good listener.

690
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:40,120
<i>And he always supports me.</i>

691
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,350
<i>When you were joking about hitting on me,</i>

692
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,420
and Bas was reacting that way…

693
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,400
Do you think he thinks something of me?

694
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,899
No?

695
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:00,099
I think there's a possibility.

696
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:04,100
If not, why would he avoid eye contact when you looked at him?

697
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,520
You go for it!

698
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,990
Then this Sunday,

699
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,819
can he come study with us?

700
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,319
No way.

701
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,479
If he comes, you won't listen.

702
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:30,080
You'll only be looking at him.

703
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,239
But it's up to you.

704
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:40,880
If you want him to tutor you, then go.

705
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,380
But you have to focus, and not only look at his face.

706
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,280
Then I should let you tutor me.

707
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,259
So, what's the deal? Are you going to change your mind?

708
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,040
Then, can I go study with him?

709
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,040
But I promise you I will focus.

710
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,960
Please, please.

711
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,620
Oh.

712
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,280
Try reading it once and try to get the main ideas

713
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,090
so it will save you time. Try.

714
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,593
"Jiayou."

715
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,453
Go for it!

716
00:49:56,453 --> 00:49:57,779
"Ke Yi Ma?"

717
00:49:57,779 --> 00:49:59,220
What?

718
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,299
Ah! "Ke Yi." "Ke Yi."

719
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:02,580
"Ke Yi."

720
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,513

Teh, don't you have to go tutor Oh-aew today?

725
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,940
I want to see you.

726
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,980
Don't you want me to?

727
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,879
You're annoying.

728
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:37,839
Really?

729
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,000

How was the tutoring yesterday?

758
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,860
Yesterday? It went well, we used flash cards.

759
00:56:57,019 --> 00:57:01,220
So... Do you want to guess the words before our teacher comes?

760
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,540
What are you watching?

761
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,839
Guys, should we find a quiet place to practice for the exam this weekend?

762
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,739
How about going to my resort?

763
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:18,779
Stay a night and wake up to swim!

764
00:57:18,779 --> 00:57:20,060
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

765
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,439
- Let's do that.
- Yeah.

766
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,779
- Dive into the water.
- Yeah.

767
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:25,259
You're so cool, Teh.

768
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:27,459
You already got accepted into university. Then teach us!

769
00:57:27,459 --> 00:57:29,899
How could you manage to memorize all 1,200 characters?

770
00:57:29,899 --> 00:57:33,299
You have to practice your Chinese handwriting a lot.

771
00:57:33,299 --> 00:57:34,819
How about this?

772
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:37,219
The days that I don't have to spend with Tarn,

773
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:39,459
I'll make you guys flash cards.

774
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:41,900
- Wow.
- Yeah, of course.

775
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,999
- You want them? Kai. Phillip.
- Yeah.

777
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,273
You want them?

778
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,100
So you can recite the words during the day.

Excellent. I'm so lucky.

- I like Teh.
- All right.

00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:14,980
Great, I'm good at Chinese for sure.

Great!

Hey, don't forget to make us the cards.

- Right, of course.
- Okay.

787
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,919
We will be waiting for good news from you.

I'd like to have a word with my friend.

836
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,900
Give me the flash cards.

837
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,190
You want to tutor me now?

838
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,600
I never said I didn't want to.

839
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,433
"Fang Xin,"

840
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,953
meaning "to trust."

841
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,913
"Guan Xin,"

842
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,160
meaning "to care."

843
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,520
"Shang Xin,"

844
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,193
meaning "sad."

845
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,859
If you can't memorize it, just remember easily that

846
01:07:00,859 --> 01:07:05,340
for these two words, their roots are from the character "Human."

847
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:09,900
Plus "Li" means "Force."

848
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:13,099
And this word

849
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:16,250
"Xin," which is "Heart."

850
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,779
When these two combine, it's like

851
01:07:19,779 --> 01:07:24,740
two people using force to hurt each other's hearts,

852
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,500
which means "Sad."

853
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,693
I don't like it.

854
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,230
That you didn't keep your word.

855
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,693
How so?

856
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,699
You said you were going to study.

857
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,800
I don't see you studying at all.

858
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,590
Although I got distracted from time to time,

859
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,630
I really focused on it.

860
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:24,859
Words that I couldn't translate,

861
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:29,760
I really practiced the Chinese characters just like you said, right then.

862
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,959
Some words, I wrote 30 times.

863
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,520
Here, my hand is all sore.

864
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:46,120
If there's something wrong, you can tell me.

865
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,019
Don't just stay quiet and leave me hanging.

866
01:08:50,019 --> 01:08:51,940
If I don't know what is wrong with you,

867
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:53,859
when you like or dislike something,

868
01:08:53,859 --> 01:08:56,280
you can tell me frankly.

869
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,920
I won't look at you as a stupid person.

870
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,199
But if you really don't want to tell me,

871
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:08,040
it's all right.

872
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,140
I'll try to be more observant.

873
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,539
And I'll keep asking if you're all right.

874
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:19,133
Is that okay?

875
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,833
You too.

876
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,870
If there is something, tell me.

877
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:41,319
About your study or not, I can always listen.

878
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,059
I know that you're about to be in a relationship.

879
01:09:45,059 --> 01:09:46,780
I get it.

880
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:52,440
But don't give my time to others.

881
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,560
You too.

882
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:17,960
Don't give my time to others.

883
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,433
"Ke Yi."

884
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,293
"Ke Yi."

885
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,400
How about Bas?

886
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,253
How did it go?

887
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,559
Just like that.

888
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,400
Just like what?

889
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:58,040
Your knees touched. Your knees touched.

890
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:02,459
How about you and Tarn?

891
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:05,160
How are things? You haven't told me.

892
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,940
Really?

893
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,173
You kissed?

894
01:11:20,173 --> 01:11:21,833
Tell me.

895
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,000
Come on. How?

896
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,320
How do you think it went?

897
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,313
Hey, hey!

898
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,333
Don't come...

899
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:42,440
What's that smell? Why does it smell so good?

900
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,280
It's still the same coconut scent.
