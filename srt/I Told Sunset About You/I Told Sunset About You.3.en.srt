Ah, come on now. Don't get mad.

94
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,370
I'll go straight to you once I get back from the resort.

95
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,180
<i>All right. You go study.</i>

96
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,799
<i>My tutor is here. I'll be off soon.</i>

97
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,559
Okay. Study hard, all right?

98
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,179
And hurry home and go to bed early. Let me know when you're home.

99
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,220
Bye-bye.

100

Why do you want to know?

105
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,459
Well, I'm worried. It's good to know if she's home yet.

106
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:33,840
To see if she's safe.

107
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,479
And tomorrow, I'm not tutoring you.

108
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:42,659
Try doing past exams so you'll know how well you can do.

109
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,439
Do it like others, so you'll also know if you can finish in time,

00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,299
how focused you are,

111

119
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,379
Did you lie to us?

120

What?

121
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,019
If you want to be better at it, you have to make them yourselves.

122

How many of you are there? One, two, three, four, five!

That's 6,000 words!

125
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,779
Whoa, if I made them all, I wouldn't have a life!

126
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,539
Then why did you say so?

127
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:02,199
Well, so you guys would be enthusiastic!

128

You didn't have to come here. We can meet you at the resort, the weather's hot here.

161
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,200
No, you're VIPs.

162
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,420
I have to welcome you by myself. Welcome aboard.

163
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,279
Line up and get the garlands. And get on the boat.

164
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,580
Look, there are a lot of customers.

165
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,939
Go on.

166
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,620
- Line up.
- Come on.

167
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,039
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

168
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,859
- After you.
- Go ahead, please.

169
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,139
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

170
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,930
Thank you, Mr. Oh-aew.

171
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,880
Thank you.

172
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,380
Such a gentleman.

173
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,660
Being at the end of the line.

174
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,693
No.

175
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,770
I want to sit with you.

176
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,200
Let's go. Get on the boat.

177
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,419
Guys, wait a moment.

178
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:06,080
The housekeeper is cleaning up.

179
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,620
Okay, okay.

180
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,040
I'll be responsible.

181
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,720
I can't take it anymore.

182
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,710
- Why are you smiling?
- Look at the condition.

183
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,560
It's my problem.

184
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,040
Back smash...

185
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,819
Don't crush the hat.

186
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:31,460
- Oh, crush... at all.
- No.

187
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,713
Are you dead?

188
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:37,119
Come here and die, can you live?

189
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,820
Okay, let's rest for a moment.

190
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,213
Hello, Tarn.

191
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,590
Yeah, we arrived at the resort.

192
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,433
Did you eat?

193
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,540
I'll call you tonight.

194
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,240
I miss you too.

195
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,579
Okay. We'll talk later. Bye-bye.

196
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,899
- Really?
- Yeah.

197
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,199
- Prepare a book to read.
- This bastard is just laughing only.

198
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,780
Only laughing.

199
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,279
Welcome, everyone. Here you are.

200
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,079
Fantastic.

201
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,220
Oh my god!

202
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,159
- Welcome.
- Wow!

203
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,293
Here.

204
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,819
Do you like it?

205
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:35,819
- Good.
- Very much.

206
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,180
I chose the best room available for you all.

207
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,459
- Cool!
- Wow!

208
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:44,939
So you guys, you know, be motivated to study well, okay?

209
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,239
Let me know if you need anything.

210
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,939
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Yes. Make yourself at home.

211
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:56,539
There are three bedrooms.

212
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:59,459
This, that, and the one over there.

213
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,239
So two people per room.

214
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,139
Choose your partner.

215
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,859
I'll be with Kai.

216
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:07,710
Kai and I snore pretty badly.

217
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,339
I'll be with Bas then.

218
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,073
Yeah, sure.

219
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,120
Teh, so you're with me, all right?

220
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,099
Yeah, that's right,

221
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,913
Phillip.

222
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,619
So shall we go put our things away?

223
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:30,359
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Let's keep things on the bed.

224
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,539
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go.

225
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,473
- To the room?
- Yeah, let's go.

226
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,000
Sharing a room with Bas gets you pretty excited, huh?

227
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,419
How about you?

228
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,920
You're okay with sharing it with Phillip?

229
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,860
Well, yeah.

230
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,793
Yeah.

231
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,240
Hey, is there something wrong?

232
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,639
- No.
- No, nothing.

233
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:53,140
Shall we go study?

234
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,240
- Let's go.
- Go.

235
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,653
Come, Oh-aew.

236
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:02,393
Come on.

237
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,280
The time is almost up.

238
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
- "Ni Hao."
- Hey, "Ni Hao."

239
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,060
Let me see.

240
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,560
- You're not correcting me at all.
- That's correct.

241
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,759
- "Er."
- Wrong.

242
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,160
- That's also correct.
- Once in a while, it's right.

243
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,140
That's incorrect.

244
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,679
No. This is the answer.

245
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,199
Is it correct, though?

246
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,260
- That's incorrect.
- Yours is incorrect!

247
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,559
Mod.

248
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,620
Come on. Let's see.

249
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,599
This one is correct!

250
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,700
Incorrect.

251
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,780
Yours is incorrect, not mine!

252
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,690
Oh-aew, your score is 59.

253
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,779
Wow... you're getting better at this!

254
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:53,919
Good.

255
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,720
And lastly,

256
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,579
Phillip, your score is 47.

257
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,433
I called it.

258
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,960
<i>[04:00 a.m. Sunday, 28 November | Alarm: Press "snooze" to repeat the alarm.]</i>

259
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,853
You are awake?

260
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,459
Yeah, to study.

261
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,500
Is it too bright? I'll turn the light off.

262
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,839
No, no. It's just that I'm not used to this bed.

263
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,890
It's not like mine at home.

264
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,560
Oh-aew. Next Chinese New Year, let's go somewhere, will you?

265
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,020
Let's go, just the two of us, after finishing the admission exam.

266
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,890
And find something nice to eat?

267
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,133
Sure.

268
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,700
I'll invite Mod and the others too.

269
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,950
It's no fun just the two of us.

270
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,873
Okay.

271
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,999
So, I'll go study outside.

272
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,450
You go back to sleep.

273
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,480
You got up so early.

274
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
You came to study?

275
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,760
Do you want me to tutor you?

276
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,439
You also got up at 4 a.m. to study?

277
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:46,560
How about you?

278
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,810
What the hell are you doing at this hour?

279
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,060
I'm not sleepy yet.

280
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,959
I wanted to get up to have some coffee.

281
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:59,660
- Do you have a problem with that, asshole?
- I was just asking.

282
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,810
Relax.

283
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,353
Oh!

284
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,780
What the hell?

285
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,130
You guys woke up so damn early.

286
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:23,219
Oh... You get up to study at 4 a.m. too?

287
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,799
And you?

288
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,800
Why the hell did you wake up this early?

289
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,279
Wait...

290
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,599
"Ni Hao."

291
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,930
I'm going to take a stroll at the beach.

292
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,159
So, I'm going now.

293
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,580
Um... bye.

294
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,659
What mood?

295
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,400
I am not going to do it anymore, I'm too tired.

296
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,819
Even if it's not the subject you're good at,

297
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,619
you can do it, if you really put your mind to it.

298
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,739
Even if it gets better only for a little bit,

299
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:14,540
that means your hard work pays off.

300
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,279
And the important thing is,

301
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,059
you'll have the goal to do better and better the next time.

302
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,940
It will definitely get better.

303
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,859
Next time, my score will definitely be better than Bas's.

304
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,800
Beat the whole country.

305
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,760
Can I have a reward?

306
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,259
What?

307
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:44,380
Well, I want some encouragement.

308
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,513
Here you go.

309
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,513
There.

310
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,473
What?

311
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,739
All right, all right.

312
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:45,639
A big prize.

313
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,800
Tomorrow, no tutoring!

314
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,479
Huh? Will I be able to study enough?

315
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,999
Of course.

316
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,239
Studying everyday isn't good.

317
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,460
Your brain needs to rest.

318
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,219
- Yes!
- "Yes!"

319
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:01,913
"Yes!"

320
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,460
Don't!

321
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,833
I'll push from behind.

322
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,940
Don't!

323
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,619
How is it...?

324
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:33,799
Sharing a room with Bas...

325
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,020
Did you have any sweet moments?

326
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,620
I don't really know if he likes me.

327
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,719
But earlier, he asked me to go hang out.

328
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,779
Finding a chance to share the room.

329
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:03,659
Then asking to go somewhere together.

330
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:06,700
Oh! Annoying!

331
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,653
I don't know.

332
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,953
But...

333
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,420
I don't really feel my heart pounding like it used to.

334
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,400
When he asked me to go hang out,

335
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,910
I didn't really want to go anymore.

336
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,593
Why not?

337
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,880
Are you bored with him?

338
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,460
Or...

339
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,610
does he like somebody else?

340
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,300
Or...

341
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,980
do you like someone else?

342
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,993
Huh?

343
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,773
Really?

344
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,233
Who is it?

345
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,940
Who is it? I want to know!

346
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,570
I think you know.

347
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,060
You really don't?

348
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,700
But I think you do.

349
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,400
Or you really don't?

350
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,070
But I do think you know.

351
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,380
Since when?

352
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,193
I don't know.

353
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,693
And you?

354
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,313
Since when?

355
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,613
I don't know.

356
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:19,339
I just know that I want to be close to you.

357
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:21,459
And I don't want you to be close to anyone else.

358
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,293
That's all.

359
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,153
Okay.

360
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,960
Whatever suits you.

361
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,110
But I think you're jealous.

Well, if you want to study, I can help you with that.

All right, all right. No tutoring.

384
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
Do you want to go somewhere?

385
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,620

What did you ask for?

392
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:00,179
I asked if I could get into the Faculty of Communication Arts at Anantasart.

393
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:04,759
I promised to fulfill my vow by running from your home to the tip of Promthep Cape.

394
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:08,679
Hey. Why from my home?

395
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,819
In case I don't have enough energy, I'll have Hokkian noodles at your place first.

396
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:17,339
Damn. You're nuts. Your legs will be exhausted.

397
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:22,840
And I also said

398
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,780
I'd run before sunset.

399
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,599
So I'll be able to shout to the sun that I finally made it.

400
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,493
Oh-aew!

401
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,659
Isn't that too difficult?

402
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:37,879
What if you get unlucky, running and not seeing the sunset,

403
00:48:37,879 --> 00:48:41,060
you'll have to keep running until you see one, huh?

404
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,093
It's up to destiny.

405
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:50,600
But I think luck is always on my side.

406
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,879
Do you want to try running today? So you'll know if you really are a lucky person.

407
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,410
Will you run with me?

408
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,239
Sure.

409
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,419
- Let's go.
- I want to see a lucky person.

410
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,979
Let's go!

411
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,639
What? For real?

412
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,753
Come on. All right.

413
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,813
Wait.

414
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,839
Step with your left foot first.

415
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,673
Why?

416
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,353
I don't know.

417
00:49:26,353 --> 00:49:30,979
My mom said on an important day, always step with the left foot first.

418
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,239
I told you so.

419
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,440
Don't get yourself in trouble.

420
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,760
Come on. Come on.

421
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,520
I can't do it anymore.

422
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,560
Can we call it a day?

423
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,320
Hey, don't give up just yet.

424
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,000
So you'll know what to prepare for the real day.

425
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,579
All right.

426
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:21,380
I'll let you stop for a bit.

427
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,299
You can rest,

428
00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:26,150
but you can't quit.

429
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,193
Let's go!

430
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,140
Let's go.

431
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,159
Yeah, let's go.

432
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,633
Come on, now.

433
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,213
Let's go.

434
00:52:14,213 --> 00:52:15,300
Come on.

435
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,133
Let's go.

436
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,173
Damn!

437
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,913
So unlucky.

438
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:40,240
The clouds are blocking the sun.

439
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,459
You said you were lucky.

440
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:48,010
Well, just wait and see on the real day.

441
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,290
There's no chance to rehearse shouting to the sun.

442
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,739
There. If you really get into the faculty,

443
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:05,620
you'll have to run and shout at the tip of the cape,

444
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,720
as you vowed.

445
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,400
Shit, the way down there is so rough.

446
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,880
I almost fainted from running earlier.

447
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,280
I'll run with you on that day.

448
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,240
Really?

449
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,210
Then you put on the school uniform. Let's put it on together.

450
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,779
You promised.

451
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,940
Do as promised.

452
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,779
Let's take a picture and post on Instagram.

453
00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:52,419
When you see this picture on my Instagram,

454
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:55,659
it will be a reminder, so you won't forget.

455
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,313
Come.

456
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,099
Hey, then let's make the face

457
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,610
as if we're walking to the university for the first time.

458
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,780
What kind of face?

459
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,380
Like you're so damn happy.

460
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,280
So, so damn happy.

461
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,739
All right. Come on, now.

462
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:21,199
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

463
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:22,580
One.

464
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,059
Two.

465
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:25,493
Three.

466
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,233
How is it?

467
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,410
I already tagged you.

468
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:52,280
<i>[oh.aew: Shuo Hua Suan Shu @teh_tunn]</i>

469
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:09,080
<i>[teh_tunn: As promised.]</i>

470
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,180
In order to keep my promise,

471
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,520
you have to pass the exam and get in first.

472
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,120
I'll make it.

473
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,560
We're going to go study together.

474
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,779
When I was a kid,

475
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:51,859
I never had anything for my mom to brag about.

476
00:55:51,859 --> 00:55:54,680
She always bragged about Hoon.

477
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,579
And Hoon was really good at everything.

478
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,699
Good at studying, at sports,

479
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:00,819
there are so many certificates at home.

480
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:03,820
So my mom always overtly bragged about him.

481
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,339
But actually,

482
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:10,499
I don't think she knew that she only praised Hoon.

483
00:56:10,499 --> 00:56:12,860
She might want to give me a compliment too.

484
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,580
But there's nothing about me to be praised for.

485
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,380
Why wasn't there anything to be praised for?

486
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,530
You're so good at studying.

487
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,870
Whatever I'm good at,

488
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:25,450
Hoon always surpasses that.

489
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:30,580
When I got a 3.9 GPA, Hoon got a 4.00 GPA every semester.

490
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,699
Until one day,

491
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:37,100
"Sword over the Moon" was on TV,

492
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,779
and my mom said to customers in the restaurant,

493
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:46,140
"Teh looks so much like Yongjian, he can become a male lead actor."

494
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,899
You know, I couldn't sleep that night.

495
00:56:47,899 --> 00:56:51,259
I got Hoon's phone and started watching "Sword over the Moon" all night.

496
00:56:51,259 --> 00:56:53,339
Until the next morning.

497
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:55,740
And I thought to myself,

498
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,560
"Am I really that cool like Mom said?"

499
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,700
And you know what,

500
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,620
when I told her that

501
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,179
I wanted to become a protagonist like Yongjian,

502
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:07,460
she told everyone in the restaurant

503
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,579
that when I grow up,

504
00:57:09,579 --> 00:57:12,930
I would become a protagonist, a celebrity, and appear on TV.

505
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,439
So I guess, that's it. That's the beginning of all this.

506
00:57:18,439 --> 00:57:20,320
After that,

507
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,710
I read everything about how to become an actor, which faculty I should be studying in, and what to do.

508
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,280
I envy you.

509
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,980
Well... The thing is, you knew what you loved,

510
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,619
and you could narrate it scene by scene.

511
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:39,680
And very clearly at that.

512
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,813
Do you remember?

513
00:57:44,813 --> 00:57:46,619
I used to tell you

514
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,720
that I wanted to beat you.

515
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,460
Thank you so much

516
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,760
for making me feel that way.

517
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,260
Before that,

518
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,420
I never wanted to do anything.

519
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,960
But when I wanted to beat you,

520
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,560
it pushed me.

521
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,419
You're like a rival

522
00:58:12,419 --> 00:58:14,920
and also an inspiration to me.

523
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,420
Keep competing with me.

524
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,380
Don't give up first.

525
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,520
Talking like this reminds me of the old times.

526
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:11,280
Well, listening to you earlier reminded me of this verse.

527
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,259
What does it mean?

528
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:17,659
The first part says "The stories in the past,

529
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:20,150
vanishes very quickly, like smoke."

530
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,690
And what about the next part?

531
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,680
"You're the one whom I've been looking for for a long time."

532
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,740
Translate it more.

533
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,480
You sing and I'll translate.

534
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,259
That means something like,

535
01:00:07,259 --> 01:00:11,760
"Promises are blown away like grains of sand."

536
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:23,830
"If heaven destined us to meet,

537
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,760
why would it divide us apart."

538
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:50,900
"10,000-li-long river couldn't stand in my way."

539
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:09,160
"10,000-li-wide land

540
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,470
is just a distance of a blink of an eye."

541
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,360
"Even separated by time,

542
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,820
