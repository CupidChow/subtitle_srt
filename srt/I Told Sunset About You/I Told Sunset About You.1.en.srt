Okay, Teacher.

160
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,040
Teh, it's all in Chinese.

You can do it. I'll help you.

163

We're gonna start with the play in Chinese, "Sword over the Moon."

We have to take Yongjian to do his mission on time.

You were able to say it! That was exactly right!

179
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,860
When I see you in costume

180
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,560
saying the lines, it makes me want to play Yongjian.

181
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,859
Hey, it's all right.

182
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,500
You are already skilled.

but one day, you'll get to perform.

185
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,960
But if it's you who gets to perform, I'm happy with that.

186

193
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:24,899
What? It means, "Can you do it?"

194
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,820
- Yeah!
- No!

195
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,739
You have to say "Ke Yi," which means "I can."

Earlier, it was so much fun!

I was nervous to death.

If you didn't help me, I would be in trouble.

217
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,759
Earlier, I talked to Miss Nuan.

218
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,460
She said if there will be another play, she wants me to do it again.

219
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,490
So I told her that I would like to.

220
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,980
I like it. I want to be a better actor.

221
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,559
You like acting?

222
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,079
I think I started to like it since I played with you at the shrine.

223
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,639
And today,

224
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
when the audience applauded and cheered me on,

225
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,020
I felt so damn good.

226
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,020
I think I want to become an actor.

227
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,340
Why haven't you ever told me that you like acting?

228
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,599
Hey, it's not like I didn't want to tell you.

229
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,239
It's just at first, I wasn't so sure.

230
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:53,679
And I told you now that I'm certain.

231
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,819
When you tell me only now,

232
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:01,659
I feel like you wanted to steal the role of Yongjian from me on purpose.

233
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,599
Hey, I didn't want to play him.

234
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,619
Miss Nuan was the one who chose me.

235
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,000
So you're saying I wasn't chosen?

236
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,719
But at last, the one who told me to play was you.

237
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,559
The reason I encouraged you... was because you're my friend!

238
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,640
I never thought that you would become my rival!

239
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,890
So that means I should have let you play, right?

240
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,079
What if Miss Nuan had chosen you, and I said I'd wanted to play,

241
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,300
would you have let me?

242
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,720
Forget it. I think someone like you will quit eventually.

Very high!

275
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:51,459

- "Admission" system.
- "Admission."

Other students go through that system.

It is a little bit slower, and he may not get to go abroad,

00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,100
Teh...

312
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,100
You...!

313
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,900
Let's go, let's go get something to eat first.

314
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,940
You seem really tired.

315
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,430
For how many hours did you sleep?

316
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,759
Three hours.

317
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,099
I'm dying. I clocked my drawing time.

318
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:22,360
But it always exceeded 2 hours.

319
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,680
I have to pass the admission exam!

320
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,460
I'll keep drawing.

321
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,099
If you're this tired,

322
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,050
you might want to consider having a boyfriend?

323
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,300
Do you want a cute boyfriend like this?

324
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,979
Here we go again.

325
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:49,339
I told you I'd give you the answer after I pass the exam.

326
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:50,619
Don't push it!

327
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:53,459
I don't want to put my focus on love right now.

328
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,450
I'll get a headache.

329
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,730
All right, got it, got it.

330
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,890
I was kidding.

331
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,939
I've been hitting on you for 2 years.

332
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:07,100
Give me some points for my effort.

333
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,439
This time, don't back out, all right?

334
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,620
All right.

335
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,779
But if you can't wait for me,

336
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,879
and in the meantime, you meet someone better than me,

337
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,659
you can go after her.

338
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:23,220
I don't want you to waste your time on me.

339
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,250
Well, do you still like me?

340
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,690
If you still like me,

341
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,713
I'll wait.

342
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,399
By the way, if you don't pass the special program exam,

343
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:59,730
you'll use your Chinese language points for the admission system, right?

344
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,639
This afternoon, I'll be taking an extra Chinese class

345
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:07,739
with my old friends from the Chinese program at my old school.

346
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,419
So that means you might meet your old friend,

347
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,920
the one you told me you had a fight with when you two were younger, right?

- Yes.

- I will not attend a class.
- How do you go to special education?

355
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,670
I like to play games.

356
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,299
Every day I think about this.

I haven't seen you in so long.

366
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:04,559
I told you that you didn't have to go for the Math-English Program.

367
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,459
You'll use Chinese Language to get into university anyway.

368
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:12,639
- Well, I'm good at it. I wanted to, Phillip.
- Aha!

369
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:14,659
Why don't you let Sui teach you?

370
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:16,079
- Oh, Sui, right?
- Yeah.

371
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,020
Sui is my mother!

Anyway, it's good he's taking the extra class.

375

This course aims to prepare you for the university entrance examination.

403
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:07,219
Whoever is not good at Chinese must work harder.

404
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:09,660
First, let's check

405
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,099
which of you wants to go to which faculty.

406
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:16,920
Who wants to get into the Faculty of Arts?

407
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,019
Wow, lots of people.

408
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:22,340
And who wants to get into Business Administration?

409
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,600
And who wants to get into Communication Arts?

410
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,639
And who wants to be a teacher like me, entering the Faculty of Education?

411
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,539
All right. First off,

412
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,539
I've prepared a pre-test for you all

413
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,219
so I know the level of your Chinese skills.

414
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:47,519
Thirty questions with thirty points.

415
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,179
When you are done,

416
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:53,660
write down your points on the top right of your answer sheet.

417
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,030
Don't cheat, all right?

418
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,100
I want you to write only what you really know, understood?

419
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,479
So I'll know what your weaknesses are.

425
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,620
I'll be super satisfied.

426

Well, I want to win.

428
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,759
I think he must have high hopes for this round.

429
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,299
Because this round does not involve the admission exam score.

430
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:37,479
A guy like him won't get in by the admission system.

431
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,640
Come on, whichever system gets you into the faculty,

432
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,220
eventually, you both will be studying performing arts.

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,490
Yeah.

Hey, you. After today, I'll change my drawing practice time.

438
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:03,039
I'll go to bed at 8 p.m. and wake up to practice at 4 a.m.

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,519
Why?

440
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,959
After a whole day at school, I have no energy to draw.

441
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,559
Waking up early to draw sounds better.

442
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,060
Couldn't you tell how I'm doing now?

443
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,960
So that means we will talk less?

444
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,219
All right, all right. Then,

445
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:29,380
you get up to talk to me at 4 a.m. and be my company.

See? You won't get up. You are one to talk.

I'm always here for you.

450

Just a bit longer and we'll graduate.

451
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,893
Just a bit.

452
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,339
All right. Let's eat and we can go to bed early.

Chinese vocabulary is very important.

If we read this word out

482

we will know the question.

483
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,159
The answer isn't very difficult at all.

484
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,059
Therefore, you must recite a lot of vocabulary.

485

Well... When I was in 11th grade, I got my own place in the city.

But I got bad grades and my mom took it back.

688

So I still take the boat ride with wind hitting my face, just as before.

We still have the rice vermicelli that you loved.

693
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,430
Why didn't you ever say hi to me?

694
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,630
I didn't know what to say.

695
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,359
And you didn't say hi to me, either, asshole!

696
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,340
I did, but you never replied!

Talking through Mod doesn't count!

698
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,930
So if I hadn't said anything to you first,

699
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,080
you wouldn't think of talking to me, right?

700
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,300
Actually, I thought about texting you.

701
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,200
But I just didn't hit the send button.

702
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,040
Back then, I was also wrong.

703
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,410
When I said something, I didn't consider your feelings very much.

704
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,730
You were not wrong at all.

705
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,320
I was... I was selfish.

706
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,780
I'm sorry, too.

707
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,530
Let's go eat Hokkien noodles at my place sometime.

708
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,560

709
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,693
Are you all right?

710
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,060
If we are to become friends again,

711
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,993
I can do it.

712
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,380
But being as close as we were,

713
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,340
I don't know about that.

714
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,620
Do you remember that time

715
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:24,820
when we were young, and you said, "Someone like you would quit eventually"?

716
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,380
Honestly, I was very sad about that.

717
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:36,313
You know, I put a lot of pressure on myself.

718
01:02:36,313 --> 01:02:38,999
I pushed myself to be the Drama Club president,

719
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,880
and I got it.

720
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,720
I tried to put lots of photos on my Instagram

721
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,020
because I wanted to show you

722
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:53,500
that I didn't lose interest like you said I would.

723
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,730
But when I saw you becoming better and better,

724
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,360
I started to despise you.

725
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,013
All right,

726
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,053
I get it.

727
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,110
Just do whatever you feel like doing.

728
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,070
We don't have to come back and become close friends like before.

729
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,480
I will get into economics!

730
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,719
I will get into business administration!

731
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,919
I will get into hotel management!

732
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,640
I will get into arts!

733
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,260

01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,200
You didn't reply to my message.

753
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,780
I was napping in the car.

754

I see. Where did you guys go?

755
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:01,319
Bas's place is on the way to the pier, so he picked me up.

756
