Didn't Gwi-nam fall from the fourth floor?

Yeah, I threw him off.

109
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,740
So how did he manage to survive?

111
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,950
Maybe he doesn't die.
He comes back to life.

He's not a human or a zombie.

Do you remember that girl
in the teachers' office?

You could be right.

She'll be okay.

You can't guarantee that'll happen.

We can't guarantee
anything right now, can we?

We don't even know if we're gonna live.

127
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,000

could you just abandon her?

Mm-hm.

131
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,020
Maybe they started the rescues.
Let's get to the roof.

132
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,520
What if that's the end of the rescue?

133
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,820
Maybe it's only the beginning.

134
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,780
We don't even know if it'll come back.

135
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,740
I don't think we should try
to go up to the roof.

136
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,280
[Mi-jin] What if it does come back?
What then?

137
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,620
-Nothing.
-Yeah, right.

138
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,830
We can't make it to the roof, anyway.

139
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,870
How are we gonna carry him up there?

140

Yep.

141
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,750
-Just leave me and go.
-For real?

142
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
Yeah. You should just go.

143
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,050
You mean it? You know me, right?

144
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,550
I'll do it.

145
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,510
Should we?

00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,930
Shouldn't we?

147
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,680
Don't act all tough.

148
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,560
There are enough crazy tough guys outside.

149
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,610
I'm not gonna die from this, am I?

150
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,650
[sighs]
How would I know if you'll die?

151
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,820
Anyway, I think we should put up
a sign or something outside.

152
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,160
How's anyone going to know
if we're in here and save us?

153
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,200
Doesn't this place have a roof?
Can't you just get there?

154
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,740
They'll see us on the roof.

155
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,540
Well, there is a ladder
that leads to the roof, but--

156
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,420
There is, right? Where is it?

157
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,750
-It's outside.
-Outside?

158
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,790
Yeah, outside.

-Oh.

162

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,470
-I'll put you outside for five seconds!
-[Min-jae] Help!

166
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,430
This is too big.

167
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,560
How about this?

168
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,690
-Break it apart.
-Here's a big one.

169
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,020
How's this?

170
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,810
Not that one. Put it down.

171
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,980
Not this?

172
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,440
-Grab anything big and colorful.
-[Hyo-ryeong] Can I use this?

173
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,780
[Wu-jin] Joon-yeong, go up there and look.

174
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,820
[Hyo-ryeong] Careful. Careful.

[grunts]

176
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,870
[Ji-min] How does it look?

177
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,660
-First…
-[Hyo-ryeong] Yes.

178
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,290
The "O," it's just too narrow.

179
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,120
He said the "O" is too narrow.
Dae-su, hand me that long one.

180
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,920
[On-jo] It should be
much bigger than this.

181
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,420

[Wu-jin] Guys, keep it up.

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,380
That goes over there.

It goes like this.

-Fill that spot in too. That's it.

It looked like your colleague
totally dumped you and took off.

Should I blast him on my show?

253

-It's a distress signal.

I know that. What does it stand for?

330
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,290
It doesn't stand for anything.
SOS is just SOS.

331
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,920
That makes no sense.

332
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,590
[On-jo] That's just how it is.
It doesn't mean anything.

333
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,670
Then rescue quickly…

I thought you'd know.

337

I do know. Look it up.
You'll see I'm right.

338
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,060
Whatever. How can I look it up?
I don't have a phone.

339
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,730
What?

340
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,530
I asked On-jo what SOS mean,

341
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,320
and she said it doesn't mean anything.

342
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,910
Just say you don't know next time.

343
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,200
Well, it's true.

344
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,740
It's true.

345
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,330
-Really?
-Mm-hm. She's totally right.

346
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,540
Why don't you believe her?

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,210
Hey, prez.

348
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,330
What does SOS mean?

[sighs]
That jerk!

350
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,090
Forget him. Let him be.

351
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,760
Is it true, though?

352
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,260
What?

353
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,180
Are you sure SOS doesn't mean anything?
Isn't it supposed to be an acronym?

354
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,310
-You don't believe me, either?

00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,440
You were scared.
So were the others. That's all.

707
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,480
So make sure you go back to them later.

708
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,200
Go to them and tell them…

709
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,780
and tell Gyeong-su

710
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,450
that you're sorry.

Stay alive.

714
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,210
You have to stay alive.

[somber music]

716
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,300
And you're gonna help them
this time. Okay?

717
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,060
Do at least one thing to help them,
you understand?

718

724
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,790
It wasn't your fault.

725
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,040
It was my fault.

726
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm sorry for cornering you.

Na-yeon, you have to stay alive.

[ominous music]

741
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,910
[Ji-min] My mom and dad prepped
everything for my transfer.

742
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,870
They said to just go to Seoul.

743
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,040
But I really didn't want to go there.

744
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,000
[fire crackling]

745
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,590
I wouldn't have had any friends,
and I was afraid of the Seoul kids.

746
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,840
I didn't know what to do.

747
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,350
Then On-jo gave me a great idea.

748
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,100
She said I just had to cut school
for five days.

749
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,060
Then the principal can't write you
a recommendation.

750
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,270
So that's what I did.

751
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,900
It's all thanks to On-jo…

752
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,780
that I didn't have to transfer.

753
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,370
[fire crackles]

754
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,750
I should've just gone to Seoul.

755
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,960
Then none of this
would have happened to me.

756
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,510
[Wu-jin] People have always said…

757
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,800
my sister was an archery prodigy
ever since she was little.

758
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,970
So our parents only cared about

759
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,140
trying to get my sister
onto the national team.

760
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,190
They've never paid attention to me at all.

761
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,190
I'll give you all my attention,
brother-in-law.

762
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,530
Don't be sad. You have me.
[groans]

763
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,370
Thank God that I have Dae-su.

764
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,660
I don't really have anything to say.

765
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,790
I wouldn't really know…

766
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,130
but I feel like I made friends.

-It's… nothing.
-[Gwi-nam] Well…

781
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,570
I have to go to the roof.

782
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,160
But the door's locked.

783
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:22,830
So I'm going that way.

I just want some water, really.

Not stuff like that.

Be completely honest.

Yeah.

Why do you keep on stalling?
Do you have a crush?

Uh, pretty much.

Do I know her?

Who is it?

You.

Hey. Stop that.

I said it all, so it's all good.

846

How is it all good? You're a jerk.

You were my best friend.
