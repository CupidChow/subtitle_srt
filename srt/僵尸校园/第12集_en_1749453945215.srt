I couldn't find you.

364
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,770
I saw the others a few times around here.

365
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,230
I wanted to see them,

366
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,280
but I couldn't do it.

367
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,200
I thought it might remind me.

368
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,530
Will you forget if you don't see them?

369
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,540
I went to the mountain last night
and saw a campfire.

370
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,540
I think someone lit a fire
on the school rooftop.

371
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,500
On the rooftop?

372
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,090
Are you sure about that?

373
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,720
I could have been mistaken,
but I'm pretty sure.

374
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,890
Nam-ra said that we should have a campfire

375
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,020
if we should ever meet again.

376
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,820
I plan on going tonight.

377
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,370
I'll go with you.

378
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,960
I'm sorry about that day.

379
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,210
What day?

380
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,710
That day when Nam-ra tried to bite you.

381
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,090
Sorry I couldn't do anything.

382
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,010
Don't worry. It's okay.

383
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,310
Your choice that day saved us all.

384
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,640
Don't tell the others.

385
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,480
It might be too dangerous,
so let's go by ourselves.

386
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,760
I told you not to tell them.

387
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,150
Hey, I told you not to tell anyone else.

388
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,940
Um…

389
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,690
I said it was between us.

390
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,280
She said she'd tell the cops
if we didn't take her.

391
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,620
They won't give me special admission
for surviving the zombie attack.

392
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,370
How is that even related?
We'll be arrested if we get caught.

393
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,830
Might as well go to jail
if I can't get into college.

394
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,760
Let's go. Climb that wall, huh?

395
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,130
Wait. You're really coming?

396
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,430
All of you?

397
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,640
You're not the only one who feels guilty.

398
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,180
We were all hurt, too.

399
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,310
Being alone doesn't make it hurt less.

400
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,610
Come on.

401
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,150
Didn't you say there was a rope?

402
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,730
-How do we get up there?
-Move.

403
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,030
Are you sure?

404
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm going as well.

405
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,950
-[Ha-ri] Get on all fours.
-[Dae-su] What?

406
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,450
-Come on.
-[Mi-jin] You heard her.

[tense music playing]

408

I MISS YOU ALL

409
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,070
What's that?

410
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,030
[Dae-su] Well…

411
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,070
I couldn't throw it away.

412

Joon-yeong.

413
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,990
I promise to bring a box next time.

415
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
I see a light.

00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,840
-Do you?
-No. Where?

417
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,380
It's over there.

418
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,720
[Hyo-ryeong] Hey, I think
that really is our school.

[Dae-su sighs]

420
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,060
[Dae-su] What a mess.

421
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,650
I know.

422
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,360
[Dae-su breathes deeply]

423
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,050
Come on.

424

Do you really think it's Nam-ra?

428
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,620
Mm-hm.

429
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,500
I don't know why, but…

430
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
I think it's her.

431
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,300
Who do you think?

432
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,980
Maybe…

433
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,270
it was kids who came back
to the school like us.

434
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,690
Maybe it was a YouTuber or something.

435
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,490
Like those kids who like haunted houses.

436
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,740
No.

437

Nam-ra.

438
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,250
Maybe she lit it because she missed us.

439
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,000
How would you know that?

440
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,920
I don't know for sure.

441
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,090
But I think I do.

442
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,890
[Nam-ra] You made it.

443
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:40,770
Oh…

Hey, prez.

Am I still your class president?

It's nice.

I wanted to go see you,
but I didn't think I should.

No, it's okay.

457

Let's go. Come with us.

I still have things that I have to do.

What things?

Mmm…

461

There are some others like me.

462
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,730
Some of them ran away
from the school a while ago,

463

but there are still a few left.

You're not a zombie.

Don't say that.

You know how we're not really kids,
but also not quite adults yet, either?

[Nam-ra] That's like me.

nor a monster.
