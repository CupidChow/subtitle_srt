[sighs]

189
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,720
We may have ceased
our rescue operation for now, but…

190
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,060
there might not be another time
to rescue survivors.

191
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,770
Strengthen the blockade
on the outskirts of Hyosan.

192
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,240
The moment the blockade
is penetrated by the infected,

193
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,610
we'll have to step up and…

194
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,490
abandon Hyosan.

195
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,250
[suspenseful music]

196
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,710
[party leader] Take this.

197
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,340
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

198
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,220
Childish to think the party leader
came personally to save me.

199
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,390
You came to dump me.

200
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,520
My NIS source says

201
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,190
something is going to happen very soon
in Hyosan.

202
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,770
In your district.
If something bad really does happen,

203
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,700
I'll say you even resigned from your post
thinking it would help prevent it.

204
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,110
No one would even think of blaming you.

205
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,530
Blame me for what?

206
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,870
Trust me, you're gonna sign it.

207
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,410
I'll protect your political career
until the end.

208
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,540
Do you need time to think it over?

209
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,420
You failed Hyosan.

210
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,630
They'll just abandon it?

211
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,180
Sign it within the day,

212
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,180
and hand it to the person in charge
of this place.

213
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,180

215
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,780
Hmm…

216
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,120
Sir, um, can you hear me?

217
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,790
-[party leader] Let's go.
-Excuse me, sir!

218
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,120
Oh, damn.

219
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Assemblywoman?
You're getting us out now, right?

220
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,590
The party leader came,
so it'll all be resolved very soon, right?

221
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,420
[Dal-ho] He says he'll save us, right?

222
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,970
Ma'am?

223
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,410

[sighs]

226
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,740
I thought about it all night long.

227
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,820
How do I live?

228
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,240
What do I do?

229
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,010
Why don't we talk about this later?

230
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,640
Tomorrow or the day after.

231
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,010
Or next week, maybe.

232
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,310
[soft music]

233
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,390
Let's get out of here and eat some food,

234
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,140
and shower first, okay?

235
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,400
We'll talk about it then.

236
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,150
Hmm?

237
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,320
We have a lot to talk about, you know?

238
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,240
Let's give it time.

239
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
[soft music continues]

240
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,470
Whatever happens…

241
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,510
please don't give up.

242
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,010
Okay?

243
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,600
Okay.

244
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,660
Never.

245
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,660
Mm-hmm.

246
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,950
You too.

247
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,210
Mm-hmm.

248
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,790
It'll be okay.

249
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,010

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,520
[Su-hyeok] What is it?

256
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,780
Do you see something?

257
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,330
The smell is stronger.

258
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,410
[sniffs]

259
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,000
[sniffing continues]

260
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,840
I can't really smell anything.

261
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,260
I think they're all coming this way.

262
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,090
The smell is really strong.

263
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,310
Doesn't matter.
We're all trapped in here for good now.

264
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,640
And there's no way to get out.

265
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,730
Please don't say that.

266
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,810
So don't.

267
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,820
I think we're done.

268
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,070
Ah, damn it!

269
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,280
Let them kill us if they want.

270
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,330
[sighs]

271
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,160
-[Wu-jin] Ha-ri.
-[exhales deeply]

272
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,090
[Wu-jin] You didn't fail
in the preliminaries, did you?

273
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,380
No.

274
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,670
I did really well.

275
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,220
Your tournament.

276
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,010
What happened?
Why did you come to the school?

277
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,980
-You're her brother?
-Yeah, I am.

278
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,860
She got a perfect score,
so she made it to nationals.

279
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,770
I saw her.

280
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,030
Really?

281
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,320
Mm-hmm. It's true.

282
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,870
No way. Really?
You're really in the nationals?

283
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,620
Mom and Dad don't know?

284
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,120
[scoffs]
Bro, how could they now? Look around.

285
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,370
She jumped out of archery bus
and ran to the school to find you.

286
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,330
Kid.

287
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,250
You be good to her.

288
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,460
And to me too.

289
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,050
Who is she?

290
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,760
[Wu-jin] Why does she keep
talking for you?

291
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,390
She's my friend.

292
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,730
[chuckles]
Yeah. We're freaking besties.

293
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,150
[gasps]
You scared me.

294
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,940
What's your deal?

295
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,450
[clears throat]

296
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,360
I…

297
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,030
You?

298
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,620
I think you're the perfect girl.

299
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,500
What? You freak.

300
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,790
[quirky music]

301
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,830
Hey.

302
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,920
What's wrong with you?

303
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,760
I watched you
when you were shooting your arrows,

304
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,970
I saw you train every morning.

305
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,090
I went to every tournament
and cheered for you.

306
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,680
Caught myself yelling "copper beauty"
a few times.

307
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,350
I really liked you for many years.

308
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,980
[Dae-su] Now…

309
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,400
I wanna be a man, not just a fan.

310
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,780
I'm gonna die, anyway.
I just wanna say what I want first.

311
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,960
Cool.

312
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,330
You're Dae-su, right?

313
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,130
You call my brother "brother-in-law"?

314
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,300
Yeah.

315
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,550
So that means you knew.

316
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,840
Brother-in-law, you told her?

317
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,470
Yeah, I might have.
[chuckles]

318
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,930
Must be nice to meet me.

319
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,390
Yes.

320
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,400
-Then you're okay with dying?
-Yes.

321
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,310
What? Today?

-[grunts]
-[groans]

323
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,650
Good. I'm pissed off and needed to vent.

324
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,030
Wu-jin, stop her.

325
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,280
-Ha-ri, hey.
-Stop her.

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,120
-Come here. Get over here.
-I'm sorry. I was wrong.

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,250
-No. I'm glad you told me.
-[Dae-su] Hey. No, that's not it.

329
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,910
-Yes, it is. Get over here now.
-No, I…

330
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,420
Why don't you understand?
I really like you.

331
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
-Get over here, dear husband.
-[Dae-su] Wu-jin. Hey.

332
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,630
-[Wu-jin] Sorry.
-Stop her, Wu-jin.

333
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,840
-No!
-Beat him up, sis.

334
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,670
Get over here. You punk.

335
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,550
-[Wu-jin] He needs a good beating.
-[Mi-jin] Look at him dodging.

-That's not it!

[Ha-ri] Come here. Gonna get you, asshole!

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,820
-Hey, hey, stop it. Stop it. Stop her.
-I don't want to come between you two.

342
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,320
-Right now.
-Okay. Only if you promise not to hit me.

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,900
What are you doing?

349
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,450
Can we move this?
Do you think it's possible?

350
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,790
We can tie all the carts in a circle,
then we can just use them as a shield.

351
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,550
[Wu-jin] This way.

352
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,350
We need strings or something
to tie them together.

353
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,020
[Mi-jin] Is this it?

354
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,680
[Joon-yeong] This?

355
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,230
Cut as many as possible.

356
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,160
Hey. There's no way this is going to work.

357
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,450
We should flip it over completely,
so that we can hide underneath.

358
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,540
Uh… We should stand it up.

359
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,830
Yeah, zombies sure can't climb that?

360
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,330
[sighs]
That's enough.

361
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,920
Don't be stupid. Okay? Let's redo them.

362
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,750
It's too short if we close the lids.

Unless you want us crawling?

364

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,390
Say it to my face!

367
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,010
If you don't like it, make your own.

368
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,930
[scoffs]

369
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,060
There.

370
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,640
Oh, shit. Are you crazy?

371
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,600
What's wrong with you?

372
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,150
-Sis, stop her.
-Come on. Say that again.

373
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,280
Do everyone a favor
and stay out of our way.

374
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,490
Hey, you.
[grunts]

375
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,990
[groans]
Shithead!

376
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,240
"Shithead"? Shithead. What the fuck?

377
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,200
Stop it.

378
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,660
Joon-yeong, you too.

379
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,750
Who the hell is she to tell us
we have to redo it?

380
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,500
"Who the hell is she?"
Your fucking nightmare.

381
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,590
-You're coming with us, right?
-You're the ones coming with me.

382
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,840
[sighs]

383
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,670
You won't just leave them here, right?

384
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,880
I wish, but no.

385
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,140
We're going together, anyway.
Why fight now, huh?

386
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,510
Just do as I say
unless you wanna die out there.

387
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Which you might.

388
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,890
We're tryna make it that high,
so we don't die out there.

389
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,390
Enough already.

390
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,400
How many people have died on our way here?

391
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,440
[Su-hyeok] We can't lose anyone else.

392
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,320
We shouldn't waste energy
fighting among ourselves.

393
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,820
I'm not fighting to die.

394
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,320
I'm fighting because I wanna live.

395
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,990
Then do as I fucking say, asshead.

396
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,910
Unless we split up.

397
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,210
-Problem solved.
-[clangs]

398
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,040
-Get back here. You hear me?
-Joon-yeong.

399
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,250
[Mi-jin] Get back here!

400
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,750
Let go of me, asshole!

401
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,670
You think I'm doing this,
because I wanna die?

402
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,470
[clanging]

403
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,010
We'll vote on it.

404
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,600
[sighs]
You are?

405
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,890
Class prez.

406
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,770
One. Split up.

407
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,690
Two. Stay together.

408
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,160
-Okay, we voted to stay together, then.
-Is it smart to vote

409
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,700
on life and death matters
and just follow the majority?

410
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,000
What if we collectively decide
to do the wrong thing?

411
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,460
You know, there's such a thing
as collective intelligence.

412
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,290
There are too many
unintelligent people here.

413
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,840
You can't make intelligence
with a bunch of idiots.

414
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,420
So then what do you suggest?

415
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,130
Do we vote about voting, huh?

416
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,260
Fuck! How the hell did
your kids survive up to now?

417
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,430
Sorry, but can you mind your own business?

418
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,770
You started the fight, now we're voting.

419
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,480
Give me an arrow, so I can stab him.

420
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,060
Anyway, let's move on now.

421
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,400
One. We make the outside higher.

422
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,490
Five votes.

423
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,950
Two.

424
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,460
We fold the lids, make a box.

425
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,130
So that's four.

426
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,630
What the hell? I thought you were with us?

427
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,840
I changed my mind.

428
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,300
Option one received the majority vote,
so make the walls high.

429
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,720
Wait. Your vote.

430
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,480
If you're for option two, it's a tie.

431
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,810
Option one.

432
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,270
Oh, shit.

433
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,570
Okay. Let's do it.

434
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,820
Okay, but don't resent me
when the zombies climb over

435
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,110
and kill us all.

436
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,910
Don't worry, I'll take the front
and any blame.

437
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,080
You hold back.

438
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,330
Oh, what an asshole. Fuck.

439
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,710
Why are kids so damn rude these days?

440
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,040
And you're not?

441
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,590
Don't say that in front
of the underclassmen.

442
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,670
This is the virus that was created
using Lee Byeong-chan's method precisely.

443
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,760
This is a sample from an infected.

444
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,220
[doctor] The two viruses
are 98 percent match.

445
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,600
Are you saying everything he says
in the videos is true?

446
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,940
Yes. When someone gets infected,
their heart stops.

447
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,440
Only the virus survives.

448
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,940
It stimulates the brainstem
and moves the body.

449
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,780
They're like moving corpses.

450
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,610
We haven't found any way to save the dead.

451
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,490
You're telling me that he's dead?

452
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,290
Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun is dead
from a medical perspective.

453
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,960
[doctor] But she's, ugh…

454
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,880
Difficult to explain.

455
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,670
She was found alive.

456
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,970
There has never been a virus with such
a fast rate of infection in history.

457
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,810
Our only solution
is getting rid of the host.

458
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,060
I'm not going to tolerate
the sign of indifference!

459
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,270
Your only job is to find me a cure.

460
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,650
Commander, sir.

461
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,320
They broke through the barricade.

462
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,410
[soldier] It's spreading into Yangdong.

463
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,910
[Seon-moo] How bad is the spread?

464
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,870
[soldier] They're taking route 643
into downtown Yangdong.

465
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,870
<i>We sent army reservists
in the area to the barricades.</i>

466
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,960
[growling]

467
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Send all the reservists to create
a lockdown zone in Yangdong

468
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,340
and evacuate the city.

469
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,130
-Call in all the advisers.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,800
You said you had a friend in the NIS?

471
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,100
Yes.

472
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,890
Ask him to meet officially.

473
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,890
Yes, sir.

474
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,730
[Joon-yeong] You have to tie
the knots harder.

475
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,570
[Hyo-ryeong] Here too?

476
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,070
-[Dae-su] I hope we're not doing…
-[Hyo-ryeong] Can you do it?

477
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,910
-…anything stupid.
-My hands hurt.

478
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,990
-[Wu-jin] Just do it.
-[Dae-su] Hey, that looks good.

479
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,620
Hand it to me. We're gonna die, anyway.

480
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,330
-[Mi-jin] Hey, come here.
-[Hyo-ryeong] Me?

481
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,000
-[Dae-su] I almost got killed confessing…
-Hey. Chocolate bar.

482
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,800
Let me see.

483
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,470
You think we can eat it, huh?

484
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,590
Oh, no, expired.

485
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,930
Okay, so what?

486
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,220
Okay, yeah, you're right.

487
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,730
[wrapping rustling]

488
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,690
Only take a tiny bite.

489
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,240
[Dae-su] It needs to feed all of us. Okay?

490
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,410
Oh, shit. I said a tiny bite.

491
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,830
I only ate freaking this much.

492
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,210
Selfish bastard.

493
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,050
[gulps]

494
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,680
I'm full, so…

495
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,070
Mmm.

496
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,160
[munching]

497
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,170
I really don't want that. Here.

498
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,220
-Hey.
-[Dae-su] What?

499
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,680
Joon-yeong didn't have any.

500
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,100
[Wu-jin] How could you eat it all?

501
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,770
I…

502
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,270
I… I thought I was last. I'm really sorry.

503
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,240
I guess we just… armor up, right?

504
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,330
-That asshole.
-Joon-yeong, you put on the best armor.

505
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,660
[gloomy music]

506
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,630
[grunting]

507
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,090
Take off your shoes
and I'll do yours first.

508
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,300
Just hold on a sec.

509
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,390
[suspenseful music]

510
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,600
Hold on tight.

511
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,780
Hey, Cheong-san.

512
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,950
What?

513
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,080
Do you really hate me?

514
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,330
Mm-mmm.

515
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,370
Why not?

516
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,420
Crazy.

517
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,880
I've never hated you at all.

518
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,380
That amazes me too.

519
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,050
[sighs]

520
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,770
[Mi-jin breathes heavily]

521
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,400
This is it.

522
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,030
Here we go.

523
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,950
Hold on.

524
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,660
This will work?

525
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,280
It will work.

526
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,000
-Just stay next to me, okay?
-You stay next to me.

527
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,750
[Wu-jin] And don't get killed.

528
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,300
You don't want it, so we both can't move.

529
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,890
I'm scared.

530
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,360
I'm gonna take the lead.
You take the back.

531
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,280
Are you ready?

532
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,700
[sighs]
Shit.

533
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,330
You better be right with this.

534
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,460
We've seen so many zombies already.

535
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,630
They're not smart enough for this.

536
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,770
[suspenseful music]

537
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,060
[grunts]
Push!

538
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,230
-Hurry!
-[growling]

539
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,770
Let's go!

540
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,650
More!

541
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,650
Turn!

HYOSAN

[NIS agent] Each of those red dots

618
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,670
is the location
of a random cell phone in Hyosan.

619
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,550
At first, they begin with erratic movement
and that gives us nothing to analyze.

620
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,270
But slowly, they move collectively.

621
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,440
If you look at them as a whole,
they're traveling outward.

622
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,610
Because there is nobody left
in the city to eat.

623
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,200
They're slowly beginning
to increase their territory.

624
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,240
Consider them like a dangerous animal
in the mountains

625
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,370
entering civilization
when they run out of food.

626
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,120
Let's just cut to the chase.

627
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,380
You predicted a spread, right?

628
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,550
That's why you proposed
expanding martial law

629
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,380
to the NSC when Yangdong's gone.

630
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,890
So it isn't entirely precise.

631
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,640
But look.

632
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,440
In one week, it reaches Seongnam,
Hanam, Gwacheon, Anyang,

633
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,350
and Gwangmyeong.

634
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,860
Coming right after, the city of Seoul.

635
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,070
Seems a bit of a stretch, if you ask me.

636
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,610
Just one person.

637
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,910
It's a simulation of what will happen

638
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,490
if just one infected person
gets out of Hyosan.

639
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,380
[NIS agent] That's what will happen.

640
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,760

is reaching 250.

[Seon-moo] Tell Tactics to come up
with a strategy to bomb Hyosan.

648
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,080
To bomb the city, sir?

649
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,710
Do you really plan to blow up Hyosan?

650
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,090
Hyosan may fall, but Korea will remain.

The infected are one thing,

654
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,470
but what about the civilians
that we haven't rescued?

655
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,810
Don't think about the ones
we have to kill.

656
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,390

will justify everything.
