and run out through the back door, right?

365
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,640
Not here. Farther back.

366
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,020
We need more room on this side.

367
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,230
And why is that?

368
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,770
There aren't that many of us,
but there are lots of zombies.

369
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,360
Ah…

370
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,780
She sucks at school,
but she's pretty smart.

371
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,940
Hey.

372
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,400
It's a compliment.

373
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,820
[Cheong-san] Let's give it a shot.

374
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,660
We can figure out the rest later.

375
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,750
We have a TV too.

376
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,250
We should be able to connect it
and make it louder.

377
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,250
I will have to look for the cord though.

378
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,250
-Hey, can you help me look, Ji-min?
-[Ji-min] Sure.

379
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,630
-Me too.
-[Joon-yeong] It should be over here.

380
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,050
[Dae-su] Let's give it a shot.

381
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,010
Guys.

382
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,970
[On-jo] We should untie that.

383
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,890
[Cheong-san] We should build
a frame first.

384
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,230
I'll do the moving.
You guys work on the frame.

385
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,310
It's okay.

386
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,100
Su-hyeok.

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,810
-[object clatters]
-[Wu-jin] Keep it down.

388
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,400
She'll never be able to get close
to the others this way.

389
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,490
And no one will approach her.

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,660
But so is trust.

They're gonna swarm all over it.

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Make sure to build a strong foundation.

Ow, it hurts.

Suck it up.
You're supposed to be a senior.

436
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,220
Why do seniors have to put up
with everything?

437
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,880
I'm not smoking,
and you can't handle that?

-You'll die if you don't smoke?
-Yes, of course.

439

I feel like I'm going to fucking die,
so you suck it up too, all right?

Once we get past the tennis courts,

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,810
we can go through the construction site
and up the mountain.

drop him and shoot, okay?

Okay.

You pick them up, okay?

Hey. Go without me. Okay?

474
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,400
Idiot.

475
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,860
You can't take me anyway.

476
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,700
You'll post about it on Facebook
if we leave you..

477
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,950
I won't.
[grunts]

478
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,070
I don't trust you.

479
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,160
Stop pretending to care.

480
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,410
You killed Ha-lim.

[Joon-seong breathes heavily]

482
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,500
You don't care about anyone.

483
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,050
You're such a dick.

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,680
Let's try once again. Stronger this time.

486
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,390
Okay.

487
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,140
[Joon-seong coughs]

488
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,770
What the hell do you want from me anyway?

489
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,030
It hurts like crazy.
Do you know what dying feels like?

490
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,200
Yeah.

491
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,620
I feel that way every single time
I take a test.

492
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,870
But…

493
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,620
I can only take so much of your pain.

494
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,580
Shut up and be quiet, all right?

You're okay? Doesn't hurt?

498
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,060
you know…

499
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
I'm thinking that
we should probably use our skills

500
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,860
to get ourselves out of here first.

501
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,410
And then they can send
the army in for the kids after, you know?

502
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,070
I think that makes more sense.

503
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,530
Sergeant?

504
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,120

If we all die,

505
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,210
who's going to tell them
about the important laptop--

506
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,830
Ho-seong.

507
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,960
Ho-cheol.

508
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Ho-cheol.

509
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,420
Do you know why some people run
to safety when they are in danger?

510
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,180
Because there are others
who are running into danger for them.

511
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,060
Why put ourselves in danger
if there's no reason to?

512
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,640
You're so frustrating.

513
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,770
I ought to just…

514
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,310
If you die,
I'll put in a request with the higher-ups

515
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,980
for a statue of you as big as the one
of Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

516
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,320
Okay? Happy?

517
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,990
[Jae-ik] What's with this guy?

518
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,700
If you're feeling scared,
you could just stay here.

519
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,870
Goodness. Very well put. Yes.

520
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:56,750
Okay, listen.
We're gonna leave together now.

521
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,630
We're gonna go zoom on the motorcycle, hm?

522
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,800
What about Mommy?

523
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,300
Well, your mommy…

524
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,100
Let's just come back for her later, okay?

525
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,650
My son is about your age.
He's very handsome.

526
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,480
I can introduce you to him if you like.

527
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,450
I already have a boyfriend though.

528
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,330
Uh… Hey, what did I say to do
once we go out?

529
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,410
You said to keep my eyes shut tightly
and hold onto you.

530
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,250
That's right. Good girl. Very good.

531
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,340
Are you ready?

532
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,170
Uh, no.

Ah, there's nothing.

591
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,290
Can you climb down?

592
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,080

[Jae-ik] Stay still.

Stay right here.

602
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,360
Bring the bike close. Shit.

603
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,030

Aren't you guys coming?

617
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,320
We left a gap over there for you.

618
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,660
Let's go.

619
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,000
Why aren't you coming over?

620
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,420
Well, someone has to stay
to open the door.

621

[sighs]

622
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,390
Couldn't you have come up
with a better plan?

623
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,310
[Cheong-san] It's okay.

624
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,810
-I'll come over right away.
-[Su-hyeok] Wait.

625
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,140
I'll come.

-It's fine.
-[Su-hyeok grunts]

627
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,310
It is not fine.

630
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,000
What happened with you and Gwi-nam?

631
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,370
He said he was gonna kill you.

632
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,840
Shit.

633
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,510
It's because I saw him
killing the principal.

634
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,180
I said I was going to tell the cops,
so he tried to kill me.

635
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,510

00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,150
Mm-hm.

640
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,110
He fell from up high
when I was fighting him.

641
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,200
-And I'm in love with Nam-ra.
-Huh?

642
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,250
I've liked Nam-ra for a while now.

You have?

644
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,750
You be good to On-jo, okay?

645
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,550
Don't treat her like she's a guy, moron.

646
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,930
You ready? I'll do it.

647
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,550
Go. Get over there.

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,170
[medic] We need to study him
to create a treatment or a vaccine,

683
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,590
but we don't have equipment or scientists.

684
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,180

[machine beeps]

686
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,470

under any circumstances,
do you understand?

688
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,230
Find scientists and build the facility.

689
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,350
We will airlift all necessary equipment.

-[medic 2] Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun.

691

A week away from discharge,
but he volunteered for the operation.

692
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,950
Get his parents consent to do research.

693
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,500
We're under martial law,
we don't need his parent's consent.

694
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,960
If you decide to give consent,

695
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,500
we can begin the experiment
or autopsy right away.

696
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,590
I said call his parents.

697
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,720

698
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,300
that's our duty
for taking away their child.

00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,320
There's assemblywoman awaiting testing.

703
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,280
[Seon-moo] She has to follow rules.

704
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,030
It's Park Eun-hee
from the National Defense Committee.

705
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,950
[Seon-moo sighs]
Damn it.

706
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,590
[Seon-moo] I'm the commander here.

00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,220
Nice to meet you. I'm--

708
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,470
[Seon-moo] Even if you are
an assemblywoman,

709
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,010
around here you're not going
to get any special treatment.

710
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,600
That's all I came to tell you.

711
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,350
Don't bother these people
trying to do their jobs.

712
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,230
I'd appreciate it
if you'd stay quiet and follow the rules.

713
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,610
That's fine. I have a favor to ask though.

714
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,110
Please send a chopper

00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,030
There's a firefighter on his way there.
He's by himself.

Commander. Hey. Wait!

717
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,160
You got to send the helicopter
to the high school.

718
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,960
We have to save the children!

719
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,130
Even wars can't rid of schools.

720
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,510
Even if you win,
if the schools are gone, we've lost.

So far, zero sir.

724
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,230
We don't think anyone got out

725
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,610
because all the students
were in class at that time.

726
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,660
Are choppers available?

727
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,160
No, sir. They've all been sent
on missions.

728
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,420
Request a Black Hawk immediately.
Have them scan high schools in Hyosan.

729
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,000
Absolutely, sir.

we can check there.
