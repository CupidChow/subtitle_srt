00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,400
That.

358
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,160
[foreboding tense music]

359
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,910
[Joon-yeong] You want me
to climb up on that?

360
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,200
But there are zombies
in the science lab too.

361
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,750
There weren't any
in the supply room. Right?

362
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,040
That's true, but…

363
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,130
We have to find Cheong-san.

364
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,760
There's no one else besides us
to start looking

365
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,300
and rescue people.

366
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,890
[sighs]

367
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,560
Yeah.

368
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
It would be good if we had the drone.

369
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,690
We can find Cheong-san and then
we can see how things are outside.

370
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,740
[Nam-ra] We might even be able to send
an emergency message and ask for help.

371
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,780
Sure, that would be really great.

372
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,580
But who's gonna go?

373
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,790
I wanna go.

374
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,330
I took a fire rescue class,
and I've climbed ropes before.

375
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,710
No, I'll go.

376
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,340
You already went out there.

377
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,090
[On-jo] You can't keep
putting yourself in danger.

378
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,380
The drone isn't finished yet,

379
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,220
we need to find
a few more parts to run it.

380
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,550
Do you know what to get?

381
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,390
[ominous music]

382
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,310
[Joon-yeong sighs]

383
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,060
Then I have to go anyway, I guess.

384
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,980
I'll go with On-jo.

385
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,110
No way.

386
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,990
I'm actually going this time
so stand back.

387
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,110
But you can't.

388
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,370
He can't.
[chuckles]

389
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,080
The rope won't hold you.

390
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,290
It was fine when I came down.
But it'll snap if I climb up, right?

391
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,830
-Yeah. Right.
-[Dae-su] Yeah. It'll snap.

392
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,290
[Wu-jin] Right. Good boy.

393
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,750
Joon-yeong, come with me.

394
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,130
Mm.

395
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,970
It's too dangerous.

396
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,890
I'll go.

397
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
[Joon-yeong groans]

398
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,480
Thank you.

399
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,360
But I don't want you…

400
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,940
to be put in danger anymore.

401
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,530
[Joon-yeong] I'm going.

402
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,780
[groans]

403
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,580
I'm going.

404
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,800
[grunting]

405
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,800
[breathes nervously]

406
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,480
[Ji-min] Be careful, On-jo.

407
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,320
Be safe. We'll be watching, okay?

408
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,650
[suspenseful music]

409
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,490
[grunts]

410
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,330
[suspenseful music continues]

411
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,710
[Hyo-ryeong] Do you think…

412
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,220
it's really safe out there?

413
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,380
I'm sure it is.

414
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,890
Like you said,
there are soldiers and cops, right?

415
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,310
I wanna go to my dad's factory
and my mom's <i>sundae </i>place.

416
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,270
[snorts]
Whatever.

417
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,570
You hate the smell
of leather and <i>sundae</i> anyway.

418
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,360
[sniffles]
Yeah, I do.

419
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,780
I just want my mom's <i>sundae </i>soup.

420
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,910
[scoffs]

421
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,000
So you finally grew up?
You should have said that earlier.

422
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,420
Now, it's too late.

423
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,340
[sighs]

424
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,090
[zombie growling in distance]

425
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
[quirky music]

426
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,090
[Jae-ik] Hey. Hey, look.

427
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,800
I bet there's a key in there, right?

428
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,520
[sighs]
I don't think so.

429
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,020
Shouldn't we just hide somewhere safe
and wait to be rescued?

430
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,190
Hey.

431
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,320
He said the solution
is on his laptop at the school.

432
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,650
We have to hurry and notify
Fire and Disasters HQ.

433
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,660
The people who have important information
need to survive, am I right?

434
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,700
So doesn't our survival come first?

435
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,620
Why do you keep acting
better than everyone

436
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,290
like some elite leader of society?
You're from Seoul University?

437
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,460
-Yeah.
-Huh? Wait?

438
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,210
You really went there? Serious?

439
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,090
Well, I haven't graduated yet.
I'm going back.

440
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,380
Oh, grad school?

441
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,550
-No. I'm a sophomore.
-What?

442
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,050
Your exams? You retake?

443
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,470
Uh, few times. Yeah.

444
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,680
I went after high school.

445
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,600
Oh, wow. I guess you must really
had your nose to the crime stuff, huh?

446
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,480
Your face says it all.

447
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,240
Hey. Apparently, you're smart,
so I'm gonna say this once.

448
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,240
Be quiet and follow me.

449
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,280
[splutters]
Wait.

450
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,370
[grunts]

451
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,740

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,760

[screaming]

460
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,300
[Ho-cheol] Hurry up!

461
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,550
Please spare me!

462
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,140
-[Jae-ik] Come on. This way.
-[Ho-cheol screaming]

463
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
[Ho-cheol] Wait.

464
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,270
-[Jae-ik] Let's go! Here.
-[bell chimes]

465
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,350
Hurry!

466
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,150
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW BUSINESS

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,280
[Ho-cheol] Oh, my God.

469
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,070
It's a zombie, sir.

471
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,820
There's a zombie in here.

-It's all right. Come on.
-[zombie growling]

479
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,680
Sure?

480
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,140
She's tied up. it's okay.

481
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,480
A student should be in school.
Why is she in a chicken place?

482
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,940
And why she tied…

483
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,030
Oh, my gosh!

484
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,860
-What? What? What?
-[spluttering]

485
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,120
Right there. There.

486
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
What? What is that?

487
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,920
Oh, shit.

488
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,170
[Ho-cheol] Is… is it okay?

489
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,380
Is, is the baby a zombie?

490
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,470
No. It's alive.

[growls]

495
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,120
Why don't you go check the fridge
for some milk or something?

496
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,750
Why? Are you thirsty?

497
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,670
It's for the baby.

498
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,960
We need to feed this baby somehow.
It's very dehydrated.

499
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,920
What if there's no milk?

500
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,550
Can you just check first?

501
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,680
Check the fridge,
and if there's no milk, come back,

502
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,100
and we cross that bridge
when we come to it, okay?

503
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,890
Uh, yeah. You're right. Yeah.

504
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,270
-If there's no milk, maybe I should bring?
-Just check first. Can you do that?

505
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,110
[Jae-ik] Check. Damn it.

[croaking]

507
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,950
What do we do now?

508
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,370
What else can we do? Back to HQ.

509
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,290
What about that?

510
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,460
It's hard enough with just us.

511
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,000
Are you gonna bring it along?

512
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,920

Oh, careful.

517
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,400
The drone and the bag are right there.

521
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,700
[Joon-yeong] Okay. Where was it?

522
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,450
Where is the battery?

[suspenseful music continues]

527
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,010
I can't stop thinking
about this one thing.

528
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,930
What?

529
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,310
If eventually everyone in the world
but us ends up turning in too?

530
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,150
No way.

531
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,650
But if that were true?

532
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,280
Nah.

533
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,370
Then we'd be the minority.

534
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,580
And all minorities

We're not the minority.

537
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,130
But what if that actually happens?

538
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,470
You think you could make it through this?

00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,550
[pensive music]

540
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,050
I don't know.

541
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,020
But I don't wanna be a zombie.

542
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,440
[Su-hyeok] You don't recognize anyone.

543
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,060
And…

544
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,320
I won't even recognize you.

545
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,160
In case I do get bitten,
I have a favor to ask.

546
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,830
No.

547
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,790
Don't get bit.

548
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,420
-If by chance--
-No.

549
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,710
Don't get bit. You can't.

550
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,880
[Su-hyeok] Don't even think about dying.

551
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,310

Is it working?

610
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,620
I think it will.

[Dae-su] Holy crap.

617
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,600
That thing's crazy fast.

618
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,350
I'll take it outside
after I find Cheong-san.

619
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,890
If I find any rescuers out there,
I'll land in front of them.

Okay. Okay, okay.

-[suspenseful music]

623
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,400
They say when people know
their situation is hopeless,

624
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,450
that's when they despair.

625
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,660
Sweet saying.

626
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,580
But what does that mean?

627
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,710
Even if everyone in the world
but us turned into zombies,

628
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,880
we can't fall in to despair.

629
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,680
Ahh. So that's what that means?

630
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,470
Nam-ra.

631
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,600
It's best to make a plan
and try to stick to it,

632
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,190
but we're not all top students,
and we can't be as smart as you.

633
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,020
Being logical isn't part of human nature.

634
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,940
In a crisis, it's better to be logical.

635
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,610
We need hope more than logic.

636
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,030
Don't you think that's best right now?

637
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,950
Hey. I think…

638
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,950
flying the drone
is what we need right now.

639
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,460
-Okay. Try it.
-Here goes.

00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,340

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,790
I shouldn't even bother studying.

648
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,710
Shit.

649
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,290
I can't take my CSAT anyway.

650
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,540
Shit. I'll never studying again
as long as I live.

651
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,420
Can you please be serious
for once in your life?

652
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,300
I'm dead serious right now.

653
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,300
What are you gonna do?
Keep looking for your brother?

654
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,810
The archery center has an emergency phone.

655
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,020
It automatically connects
to emergency services.

656
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,270
-Really?
-Yeah.

657
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,730
We got a hotline installed a while ago
because of some injuries.

658
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,860
And if it doesn't connect?
All the phones and internet are dead.

659
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,030
It doesn't matter.

660
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,400
That's where all the arrows are anyway.

661
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,660
I have less than 20 left.

662
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,030
We'll need more
if we wanna leave the school alive.

663
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,120
-I think, uh--
-Okay, let's go.

664
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,000
Go to the archery center
so we can get your arrows.

665
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,250
Then we should probably go home
or maybe go to a supermarket.

666
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,500
You know. In most zombie movies,

667
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,670
the ones that go to supermarkets
always manage to survive in the end.

668
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,130
And they have cigs.

669
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,340
I think that we--

670
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,470
[Min-jae] The dumpsters
are right under these windows.

671
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,640
I think it's better to jump
than use the stairs.

672
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,230
[sighs]
Yeah. Let's jump.

673
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,100
Falling from the third floor is way better
than falling your exams, right?

674
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,940
Hey, let me get a word in!

675
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,940
Hey, Min-jae.

676
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,240
Go down first and shoot any
that come running.

677
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,650
[Min-jae] Okay.

678
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,950
Then you two go down
and help him out as much as you can.

679
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,780
I'll cover you out in the hallway
and bring up the rear.

680
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,780
Mm.

681
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,160
What do you wanna say?

682
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,120
Uh, I think we should just stay here.

683
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,040
The adults will rescue us.

684
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,340
If you wanna stay, be my guest.

685
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,050
But I don't trust adults.

686
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,100
Ahh, shit. She's just so my type.

687
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,350
[Joon-seong sighs]
I'm too scared to stay here alone.

688
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,230

[Dae-su] You're right. It is.

What's he doing? Where's he going?

740
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,870
[Dae-su] Look this way! Over here!

He can't hear you, Dae-su!

743
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,330
[Wu-jin] Be quiet, will you?
You're so damn loud.

744

Yeah. I couldn't charge it,
so it's almost dead.

747
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,930
Now that we know for sure
where Cheong-san is,

748
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,760
let's go look somewhere else.

749

You wanted to check outside
and ask for help?

On-jo, is that okay?

751
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,350

I think we should look
outside of the school grounds.

you have to wait your turn.

838
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,290
Then you should've explained the situation
and asked her to wait somewhere else

839
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,580
and then escorted her.
