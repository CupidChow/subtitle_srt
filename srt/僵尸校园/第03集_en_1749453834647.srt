So you're telling me,

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,570
that this whole mess started with a virus
made by a high school science teacher?

This virus.

Why would you do something like this?

Listen, we can't be fighting
each other in a moment like this.

We don't know what's going on
out there with those--

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,100
Are they zombies?

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,390
What about the other teachers?

125
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,060
Has anyone called the cops?

126
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,270
Don't worry, I'm sure someone already has.

127
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,980
I just don't have
my phone on me, right now.

Neither the police nor first responders.

130
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
We just have to wait a little longer.

[On-jo] So were I-sak's.

133
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,990
What if all of this started with Hyeon-ju?

134
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,750
She went to the hospital.

135
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,370
What if it spread in there as well?

136
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
[Hyo-ryeong sighs]
Maybe that's why no one's coming.

137
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,590
But wait. They still work, right?

138
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,340
Uh, internet. The internet.

-It just did.
-Oh, sorry.

[Joon-yeong sighs]
School ones are so slow.

146
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,730
[Wu-jin] Maybe it's not online?

147
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,190
[Joon-yeong] It must be.

354
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,000
-Ms. Park, look.
-Mm.

355
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,510
Well, it really doesn't look like a bite.
Thank god. It's a scratch.

356
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,090
He's okay.

357
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,720
Done yet?

358
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,470
I said, are you done with me now?

359
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,190
Wait. This means the computer's gone.

360
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,400
No internet…

361
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,820
Couldn't you have thrown something else
instead of the computer?

362
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,860
What was I supposed to do?
It's trying to get in.

363
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,780
No, you did good. Thank you. Don't be mad.

Why should I?

367

He did it to save us all.

368
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,040
Why can't you just say that you're sorry?

369
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,630
Because I'm not sorry.

370
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,000
I saw everything.

371
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,300

[Na-yeon] <i>I'm right.</i>

374
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,840
He could be infected.

375
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,390
Na-yeon, enough.

376
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,560
It really did.
That thing grabbed his hand.

377
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,640
Wait, can touching his hand infect him?

378
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,190
I have no idea but maybe.

379
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,310
I held I-sak's hand when she fell.

380
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,150
Why is nothing happening to me?

381
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,030
Because he has a cut on his hand.

382
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,610
And since there's an open wound,
it's probably gonna be different.

383
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,990
-That's fucking--
-Don't.

384
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,700
Stop blaming me.
Why don't you just think for yourselves?

386

387

I know you always hated Gyeong-su,

388
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,620
but I think you're really crossing
the line here.

389
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,330
This is about life and death.

390
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,750
She's always like this.

391
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,210
[scoffs]

392
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,090
If it weren't for him,
we would definitely all be dead right now.

393
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,470
And now, he might be the one
killing all of us.

394
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,260
Now you're the one who's killing me.

395
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,760
-Just shut up, Na-yeon.
-Look at my hand, I'm totally fine.

396
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,680
-Don't you see that?
-Hey, that's enough, all of you! Okay?

397
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,600
We're ending this.

398

-Enough.

Let's do this.

403
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,700
Gyeong-su, you're going to wait
in the recording room for ten minutes.

404
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,990
I know it'll be hard,

405
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,240
but at least it's better
than people thinking you're infected.

406
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,500
No one else thinks that I'm infected.
It's only her.

407
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,370
Gyeong-su, would you please do it?

408
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,540
Fuck ten. I'll do half…

409
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,550
I'll just do a full hour.

410
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,010
There's really no point doing an hour
since it takes less than five minutes.

411
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,760
-Stop overreacting.
-It's just to be sure.

412
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,510
[Ms. Park] Is that enough?

413
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,430
And if nothing happens,
you'll apologize, right?

414
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,350
Yeah.

415
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,480

[all] Yes.

If we do this,
who's gonna step up next time?

418

We all be too scared.

419
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,450
You're right, but…

420
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,830
Let's consider this a way
to learn to trust each other.

421
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,170
I do… trust Gyeong-su.

422

00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,700
Why should I?

705
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,830
He's like this because of you.

706
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,040
-[Na-yeon] What did I do?
-[Ji-min] Like you don't know?

707
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,840
Was it wrong to suspect him?

708
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,250
You did too. Everyone did.
It wasn't just me.

709
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,010
I always believe him.

710
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,050
Me too.

711
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,890
Well, I didn't. She's right.

712
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,180
But I didn't insult him like you did.

713
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,850
Why are you picking on me?

714
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,180
'Cause you deserve it.

715
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,690
That's enough, Ji-min.

[Ms. Park]
You remember your promise, right?

719
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,740
After 30 minutes you'd apologize.

720
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,580
Okay.

721
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,420
It's been 30 minutes.

722
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,040
All right.

724

[Dae-su] She's doing it. Holy shit.
She's really doing it.

725
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,560
Hey.

726
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,680
I'm talking to you.

727
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,650
You're ignoring me?

Oh, yo. They're talking.
That's good. Right?

731
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,780
[Na-yeon] Why don't you answer me?

732
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,120
Apologize and get out.

733
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,870
How's your cut doing?

734
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,580
Why do you care?

735
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,370
Show me.

736
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,580
-[Dae-su] Oh, shit. She's touching him.
-[both laughing]

737
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,670
Well, that's pretty bold of her.

738
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,470
[Na-yeon] I suspected you
because the situation called for it.

739
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,850
And I was really mad earlier.

740
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,060
I'm still mad at you.

741
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,610
I guess…

742
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,070
[Dae-su] She's Gyeong-su type?

-[laughing]
-I have no idea.

744
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,910
You know I've always looked down on you.

745
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,460
It's fine. It's all in the past.
Let's just go.

746
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,790
I'm not apologizing.

747
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,170
You deserve to be looked down on.

748
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,710
Our complex banned you welfies,
but you force your way in.

749
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,930
[Na-yeon] And how dare you push me?

750
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,550
Listen, you fucking…

751
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,140
You thought I'd apologize?

752
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,390
[Dae-su] Kiss, kiss.

753
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,100
[Wu-jin chuckles]
This is so crazy.

754
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,060
Everyone is taking your side.

755
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,020
I was cornered
because of a nobody like you.

756
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,320
Stay the full hour.

757
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,650
I hope you never come out again.

758
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,490
Fucking welfie.

759
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,240

-Come here you piece of--

-Wait, wait, what?
-Gyeong-su, what's wrong?

You're fucking…
you're such a fucking cheat.

-I don't understand why I have to take it?
-[Ms. Park] Did you really say that?

768
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
You promised me you'd apologize to him.

769
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,850
-[Dae-su] Dude, forget about her.
-I did nothing wrong.

770
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,850
You only think about yourself.

771
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,940
You said to close the door
before anyone could get in.

772
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,690
You said it would be safer for us.

773
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,900
That's not right.

774
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,280
We almost died
when Gyeong-su pulled Coach Kang in.

775
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,820
[Na-yeon] Why aren't you mad at him?

776
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,240
That was not his fault.

777
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,240
How is he supposed to know that
that was gonna happen?

778
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,250
-That's enough. Quiet, everyone.
-We'd be quiet if she were gone.

779
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,420
You're all so annoying.

780
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,090
What if I'm right about this?

781
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,800
Then will you finally admit
I saved you all, huh?

782
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,760
I don't understand.
How can you still be like this?

783
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,020
Look.

784
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,440

You still think I'm wrong?

As you can see, it's highly contagious--

910
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,290
We were notified too, no need to explain.

911
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,880
How long do we have to stay here?

912
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,840
They're sending over a helicopter,
but it's gonna take time.

913
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,010
So it looks like
you'll have to wait a bit longer.

914
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,010
Did you notify them
that I was here as well?

915

What?

916
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,850
I'm asking if it's taking time
to get a chopper

even though they know I'm here?

918
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,060
No, I did not tell them who was here.

919
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,730
You should've told them.

920
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,020
That way, they'll send one
right away to pick us up.

I didn't do anything to Gyeong-su.

I didn't do anything.

why he's being so stubborn?

He's always like this.

974

You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

975
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,330
No, I didn't.

976
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,460
You wiped that
on the scratches on Gyeong-su's hand.

-No.
-Take it out.

I said no.

00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,760

Nam-ra, that's enough.

987
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,440
Nam-ra, do you realize
what you're saying right now?

988
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,450
If that is true,

989
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,700
it means Na-yeon killed Gyeong-su.

990
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,280
[Nam-ra] It's true.

991
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,250
Na-yeon did it.

992
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,620
She killed him.

This is blood.

00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,720
I wiped Gyeong-su's hand.

998
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,100
This is his blood?

999
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,770
You can't tell?

1000
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,600
Then put it on your wound.

1001
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,030
Wipe yourself with it
if you're so confident.

1002
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,900
Like his blood is so clean?

1003
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,660
He was a zombie.

1004
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,040
He was just fine until you infected him
with your handkerchief.

1005
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,000
Na-yeon, you--

1006
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,870

Leave me alone! Fuck!

That dirty welfie pushed me.

1019

Na-yeon, you didn't…

1020
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:47,040
So, you did do it.

1021
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,620
How could you just fucking--

1022
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,290
I didn't kill him, okay?

1023
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,920
Gyeong-su fell, but he got up and ran.

1024
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:56,050
[Na-yeon] He's still alive.

00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,220
Stop ganging up on me.

You all made fun of him too.

No matter what happens, you stay alive.
