They can't find
the homologous sequence of the virus.

What does that mean?

109
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,940
All living organisms have a root system,

110
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,490
if you follow a specific route,
you can trace it back to its origin.

111
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,200
Sort of like a genealogy for viruses.

112
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,990
But we can't figure it out.

113
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,540
Are you saying it's a brand new virus?

114
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,460
The KDCA is analyzing it too
but so far they can't identify it either.

115
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,300
We need to identify it
so we can start creating treatments.

116
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,220
You are supposed to be the experts.

117
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,390
How the hell could you not
have identified it by now?

118
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,520
It's strange.

119
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,190
The RNA structure changes
every time we test it.

120
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,940
It's almost like the virus
is evolving on its own.

121
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,200
We rescued a detective
from Hyosan Police Station.

122
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,660
And he seems to know
a lot about the virus, sir.

123
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,630
There's a laptop
in Hyosan High School that has--

124
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,050
Hey.

125
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,260
You need to start from the very beginning.

126
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,550
But we don't have much time.

-[scoffs]
-[gasps]

128
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,720
The disease spreading in Hyosan
is called the Jonas Virus.

129
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,770
Lee Byeong-chan, a science teacher
at Hyosan High School, created it.

130
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,600
He left his laptop
in the school science lab.

131
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,570
He said it has everything we need in order
to get ourselves out of this catastrophe.

132
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,980
In his computer?

133
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,110
-Do you think his story is credible?
-Yes.

134
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
The research says
the initial reports of the outbreak

135
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,240
were from Hyosan Hospital's ER
and the high school.

136
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,830
And says the girl that was taken
to the ER was a student there.

137
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,500
I'm positive that Hyosan High School
was ground zero.

138
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,550
Keep questioning the detective.

I thought for sure you were dead.

149
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,380
You let me go knowing I'd die.

150
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,590
Uh, I'm sorry.

151
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,920
-I was just--
-[Eun-ji] It's fine.

That's just how you are.

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,310
You wanna hear some good news?

155
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,600
I set the school on fire.

156
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,270
It's should be burned
to the ground by now.

157
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,360
You set fire to the school?

158
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,980
Yeah. It's great, right?

159
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,740
Are you all right?

160
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,570
I'm doing okay.

161
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,320
Why?

162
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,580
You don't seem like yourself.

163
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,210
I'm hungry.

164
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,880
And I get worked up when I'm hungry.

165
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,920
Do you want this then?

166
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,470
They're giving them out
but the line's crazy long.

167
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,510
You should eat first.

168
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,640
No, I don't want that.

169
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,270
But I think this is all they have.

170
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,270
I don't want that. I want something else.

171
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,690
Like what?

172
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Mmm…

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,070
Yeah.

176
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,950

What the hell is with that Gwi-nam kid?

You said he got bitten.

183
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,310
I don't know.

184
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,480
It looks like he became
something totally different.

I don't think he can die.

186
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,730
What if he climbs back up here?

187
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,780
He's bad enough…

188
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,610
but to be honest,
I'm scared of Nam-ra too.

189
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,700
You saw her fighting before.

190
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,580
Well…

191
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,000
I think it's reasonable to assume
they're both half-bies--

192
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,710
What?

193
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,500
Are you really okay, Nam-ra?

194
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,800
You won't do that to us, right?

195
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,590
Would you believe me
if I said that I wouldn't?

196
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,850
Why do you have to say it that way?

197
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,680
Can you at least try
to make us believe you?

198
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,190
We're going to be together anyway.

I…

203
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,830
I've never done anything but study.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,380
I don't think I was naive,
I think I was a coward.

205
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,090
I was too scared my grades would drop
and my mom would get mad.

206
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,630
So I didn't do anything.

207
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,640
I was too scared to make friends.

208
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,680
My mom would always ask me
what rank they were in class,

209
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,350
what their parents did,
how big their house was…

I never thought I'd get a chance

213

to sit around a fire
with all of you like this.

214
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,290
It's really nice.

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,370
It's my first time.

216
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,000
If we somehow manage to get out of here.

217
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,420
I really hope we could make a fire…

218
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,720
and hang out like this again.

219
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,760
I really hope we can do that.

220
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,140
Sure, let's do it.

221
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,440
If anyone wants to make a fire…

222
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,990
we can all get together.

223
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,530
Sorry, Nam-ra.

What now? What?

229
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,670
Why don't you two just date already?

230
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,050
You guys are so annoying.

No, what is it?

-Okay?
-You're not landing the chopper?

394
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,500
We can't. It can get unstable.
He's gonna pull you up, so don't worry.

395
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,270
[soldier 1] You can't go all at once,
so let's go one by one.

396

We can't all go?

397
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,400

What the hell is that?

413
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,210
I believe she's infected but asymptomatic.

414
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,680
So she has a disease but…

415
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
there was no way to tell she was infected?

You're saying
we can't differentiate between

420
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,460
the healthy and the infected?

421
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,960
[military officer 2]
Connect to the team at Hyosan High!

422
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,050
-[military officer 1] Yes, sir.
-[military officer 2] Where's team bravo?

423
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,600
Don't rescue anyone.

424
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,640
[soldier 1] Say again.
Did you mean everyone?

425
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,180
We just discovered a case as asymptomatic.

426
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,770
[soldier 1] But their temperatures
are fine.

427
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,520
It was the same thing
with the girl we brought here.

So do as I say.</i>

433
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
[soldier 1] Understood. Over.

[machine whirring]

435
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,790
Cancel the operation.

436

-What's going on?
-I don't know!

443
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,470
Why did you take that off?
Wait a minute. What?

and answer some questions.

532
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,760
Are you recording this?

533
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,020
-[investigator] Yes, we are.
-[Dal-ho] Wait a minute.

534
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,020
Aren't you supposed to tell us
if you're gonna record the investigation?

535
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,400
[investigator] We're gonna record
this conversation. Give your consent.

536
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,770
Would you please point
the camera at me directly?

537
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,940
[investigator] Go ahead.

538
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
[camera whirring]

539
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,160
Is it set?

540
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,330
[military police] Yes.

541
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,620
[sighs]

542
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,540
I'm Assemblywoman Park Eun-hee.

543
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,550
I've been accused of aiding and abetting
firefighters Nam So-ju and Kim U-sin,

544
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,260
who had saved my life,
and their escape from the camp.

545
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,840
I am being interrogated.

546
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,680
But I was not an accomplice.

547
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,890
I was the true offender.

548
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,480
Ma'am, are you kidding me?

549
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,400
That's not true. Stop recording, huh!

550
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,860
Stay back.

551
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,940
I don't understand why you're doing this?

552
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,110
What are you doing ma'am?

553
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,580
Do whatever you think is best.

554
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,040
I won't get involved anymore.

555
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,300
Firefighter Nam So-ju saved us,
and he did this despite the fact

556
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,930
that his daughter was nearby.

557
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,640
He tried to go save his daughter
after he saved us

558
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,930
but The Martial Law Units stopped him.

559
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,690
His daughter was everything to him.

560
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,690
I said I'd take responsibility,

561
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,860
and that he should escape by any means
necessary to save his daughter.

562
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,530
Even if it's not allowed
under martial law,

563
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,950
no one can ever stop
a father's love for his daughter.

564
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,120
Regardless of the punishment
imposed on me…

565
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,790
I will always stand with…

566
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,460
the powerless citizens.

567
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,510
[panting]

568
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,060

572
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,120
On-jo.

573
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,080
Hey, Dad.

574
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,510

575
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,600
[gasps]

576
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,980
Please help us.

577
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,270
My wife and baby…

578
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
[shushes]

579
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,150

-[breathes heavily]
-[whimpers]

582
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,050
I can't do it alone.

583
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,140
We need equipment
in order to cut through the frame.

584
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,310
[shuddering]

585
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,810
Please. Please help us.

586
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,100
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,400
I need to go find my daughter now.

588
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
I'm really sorry.

589
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,570
[sobbing]
Please, sir. I'm begging you.

590
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,110
[sobbing]

591
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,490
Our baby…

592
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,410
Please, sir. Save them.

593
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,450
Please, sir.

594
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,120
Listen to me.
They'll start sending rescuers soon.

595
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,670
You have to hang in there until then.

596
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,830
But those monsters,
they could have come first.

597
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,960
[car hissing]

598
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,630
Shit.

599
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,050
[sniffles, cries]

600
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,850
[shuddering]

601
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,520
Here.

602
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,900
Here. Take this.

603
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,860
You have to hang in there. You understand?

604
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,360
[man sobbing]

605
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,160
[cocks gun]

606
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
[ominous music]

607
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,580
[man] You have to help me.

608
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,410
Get back here.

609
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,250
Right now.

610
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,380
[Byeong-chan] <i>There's no more hope left.</i>

611
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,800
It's like every sin entered the human body
in concentrated form.

612
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,300
Even if we can conquer this virus,

613
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,470
I worried that a world ruled by humanity
will never return.

614
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,390
Can we still believe people are beautiful

615
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,110
after seeing them
become the worst possible creatures?

616
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,110
If you shoot me now,

617
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,190
they'll come running right away.

618
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,110
We're gonna die anyway.

619
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,110
Whether I do or I don't.

620
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,780
My daughter is waiting for me.

621
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,660
[sobs]

622
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,500
I'm begging you…
[crying]

623
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,050
Please don't go.

624
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,300
[thunder rumbles]

625
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,430
Don't go.

626
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,100
[Byeong-chan] <i>There was something we'd say</i>

627
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,480
at the pharmaceutical company
whenever we hit a wall.

628
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,570
"Science begins with imagination
and ends as a mystery."

629
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,650
I went to see a shaman on my way home.

630
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,160
[zombie growling]

631
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,250
He told me this right here
would immediately fix everything.

632
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,170

00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,300
[Eun-ji sobbing]
<i>Please help me. Help me!</i>

634
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,800
[crying]
I'm human.

635
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,510
I'm not a zombie!

[whimpering]

637
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,680
You idiot.

00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,230
[bottles clink]

639
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,230
[whimpers]

640
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,570
She's either positive or negative
depending on when we test her.

641
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,570
What does that mean?

642
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,620
We have to assume it's a fusion
or some kind of evolution.

643
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,410
Like a mutation?

644
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,330
Yes, that's correct.

645
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,040
The virus is hiding
in the RNA of the cells.

646
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,040
We can only detect it when it manifests.

647
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,500
If it's dormant, it won't show up.

648
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,050
That means tests don't tell us
whether or not the subject is infected.

649
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,010
That's right.

650
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,220
It's like the human and the monster
are fighting inside the patient.

651
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,520
Is it at all possible…

652
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,100
that there are others like her?

653
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,190
[breathes deeply]

654
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,860
As per KDCA's recommendation,

655
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,240
it's best to presume

656
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,660
that they're infected
even if they show no symptoms.

657
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,410
[foreboding music]

658
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,920
Going forward,

659
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,210
separate everyone from Hyosan

660
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,760
and considered them infected
but asymptomatic.

661
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,470
And monitor later rescues
separately and more closely.

662
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,760
[laughing]

663
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,470
-Oh, I know.
-[Dal-ho laughs]

664
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,930
Yeah. You really are amazing.

665
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,850
To use us in that situation.

666
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,400
She didn't use you at all
she just made the best of the situation.

667
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,280
[Eun-hee] When it rains,
you set up your barrels.

668
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,200
And when it's windy,
you set up the turbine, right?

669
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,490
That's politics.

670
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,120
You'll use that video
for your campaign, won't you?

671
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,960
Even though you didn't save anyone,
you'll get lots of votes

672
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,460
like you did something huge.

673
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,250
Hey, she did.

674
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,840
She took full responsibility
just to get you out of this mess, okay?

675
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,060
She never told our captain
he should try to run and escape.

676
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,480
[sighs]
Listen, U-sin.

677
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
[sighs]

678
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,900
Disasters usually create heroes. Huh?

679
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,650
Whether or not he saves his daughter,

680
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,820
Mr. Nam will come out of this a hero.

681
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,320
That's what we're gonna be
working on right now.

682
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,660
Don't you want your captain to be a hero?

683
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,660
-That's not what I--
-And we're all on the same page.

684
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,040
Let's look at the big picture here.

685
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,880
From this moment on,
we are on the same team.

686
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,710
We just have to stick together.

687

[Dal-ho] What the hell?

689
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,300
[soldier 6] In the interest
of stopping this spread,

690
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,180
we're taking you to a special quarantine.

691
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,230
For safety reasons,
you'll be handcuffed during transport.

692
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,600
Do we look like criminals to you?

693
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,020
Why are you suddenly
imprisoning all of us?

694
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,320
Also, how dare you try to put handcuffs
on an assemblywoman, huh?

695
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,150
[soldier 6] Please obey the rules.

Don't test my patience.

698
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,820
It's martial law,

00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,450
-not a military dictatorship.
-[soldier 7] Please obey the rules.

700
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,000
Listen, we won't follow
unprincipled rules.

701
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,170
Kill me first
if you're gonna take her away, huh!

702
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,630
-Come on. Make a shield.
-Yes, sir.

703
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,090
Hold on.

I'm not going. I'm scared.

if the zombies catch us?

[Cheong-san] It's not like anyone
is going to save us if we stay here.

I'll scream and lead the zombies away.

789
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:49,850

it will be me.

794
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,700
Because of the rain,
all the scents came to me at once.

795
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,910
They got mixed up.

796
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,500
The rain is really loud too.

797
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,130
I'm sure the zombies' senses are dulled.

it should be reliable.

00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,480
I don't know.

808
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,410
I think some of us
might not be able to keep pace.

let's pair up and hold hands.
