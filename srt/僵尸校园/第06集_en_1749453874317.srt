Do you know what that's like?

No, I don't.

53
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,950
Then don't act like you know everything.

54
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,170
Don't tell me what to do.

You don't know what it's like being me.

-No.
-[Ji-min] Exactly.

57
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,050
So just leave me alone.

Every exam, I'm always last.

59
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,010
Well, not completely last.

60
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,100
Whenever I get my report card, my dad says

61
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,060
that my grades won't get me
into Seoul University,

62
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,110
so I shouldn't even bother having hope.

63
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,490
He says to make sure
I don't get hurt or sick.

64
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,910
To just stay healthy.

65
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,700
No offense.

66
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,120
I don't care about your dad.

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,500
I didn't believe him.

68
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,460
I'm sure he'd love it if I got into Seoul.

69
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,460
He was only saying that.

70
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,920
But…

71
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,880
[sniffs]

72
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,350
He would also say to me…

73
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,140
if anything ever happens,

74
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,440
he would be the first one there for me.

75
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,900
But he's not.

76
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,910
He's not.

77
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,450
Who knows?

78
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,830
Maybe he can't come.

79
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,790
What if my…

80
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,840
my dad died?

81
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,220
At least you can have hope.

82
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,010
My hope is dead.

83
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,390
Is there hope?

84
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,280
Is it stupid of me to wait for him?

85
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,030
Or should I run away? Give up?

86
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,120
I don't know anything.

87
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,040
Both I-sak and Gyeong-su are killed.

No one.

95
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,190
I gotta go.

96
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,490
I feel like I'm going crazy in here.

97
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,200
Okay, then.

98
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,870
So let's leave.

99
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,160

This is where we are.
This is where Cheong-san is.

113
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,180
If we turn our music only on this speaker,
the zombies will go left.

114
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,180
Then we'll take the stairs on the right,

115
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,560
get Cheong-san, and go to the roof
using the center stairs.

116
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,980
But why the roof?

117
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,770
Choppers keep flying around.

118
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,860
If we light a roof fire,
they might come save us.

Speakers. Will the zombies really go
towards the sound?

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,740
I think she's right.
They're drawn to sound.

121
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,910
That's right. They come running
whenever they hear us.

122
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,870
Can we turn on only the speakers we need?

123
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,080
Yes. The ones in the cafeteria,
yard, and library, too.

124
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,670

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,300
[thumping]

364
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,460
[sighs]

365
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,800
We can't…

366
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,970
go to the roof?

367
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,940
[Hyo-ryeong]
We're trapped again, aren't we?

368
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,350
[panting]

369
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,310
There are zombies out there, so…

370
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,440
Let's just think a little.

371
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,440
This is so annoying.

372
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,240
[breathing heavily]

373
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,950
Hey.

374
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,710
Hey, Nam-ra.

375
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,290
What happened to your arm?

376
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,170
That's a bite mark, isn't it?

377
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,390
[people clamoring]

378
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,690
[clamoring continues]

379
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,400
[woman grunts]

380
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,290
I can't eat pork. Is there anything else?

381
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,790
Take it and go!

382
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,210
-Hold on.
-Go on. Get out of here.

383
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,290
I can't eat pork!

384
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,170
-Come on, we're all waiting.
-[refugee] That's enough!

385
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,840
[people clamoring]

386
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,440
I'm good.

387
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,310
Are the cell phones working in here?

388
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,980
No. There won't be service here.

389
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,150
[Eun-hee sighs]

390
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,190
So you're telling me…

391
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,780
a politician can't talk
a way out of here?

392
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,280
It's true.

393
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,410
I've never been treated this way before.

394
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,250
There's nothing politicians
can't do in our country, right?

395
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,580
Don't be sarcastic.

396
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,210
I've never done anything illegal.

397
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,750
Never did anything improper my whole life.

398
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,550
Then can't you do it just this one time?

399
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,380
I really need to leave.

400
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,760
Wait a little.

401
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,470
I'll get you a helicopter
after we're tested,

402
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,310
and send you to your daughter's school.

403
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,600
The test isn't the problem.

404
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,940
Even if we test negative,
we'll still have to quarantine here.

405
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,900
It was nine days for MERS,
two weeks for Covid-19,

406
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,770
and even three weeks for Ebola.

407
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,530
And then what?

408
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,950
Are you saying we have to stay here
even after we get tested?

409
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,530
It depends what they consider
the incubation period is.

410
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,700
[gate clanks open]

411
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,130
Please eat as much as possible,

412
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,500
and leave your empty food containers
by the door.

413
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,090
Hold on.

414
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,970
Special Mission?

415
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,140
I was a Master Sergeant when I left.

416
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,850
Are you our senior officer?

417
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,220
He was also Special Mission Unit.

418
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,390
Nice to meet you.

419
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,690
Sorry. I'd buy you a drink
if we had met outside.

420
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,980
[military medic 1] It's fine.

421
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,070
Tell me, how long are they considering
for quarantine?

422
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,440
We don't know, sir.

423
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,650
Sure you do.

424
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,650
[military medic 1] It's true.

425
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,950
They don't know what this virus is,
so they don't know the incubation period.

426
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,370
From what I hear, they're thinking
a minimum of, I don't know, four weeks.

427
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,200
What? That means we have
to be here for at least a month!

428
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,960
Wait until you get tested.

429
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,960
Wait a minute.

430
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,460
-Yes, sir.
-Well…

431
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,750
I'm sorry,

432
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,340
but I have to get out of here
much sooner than that.

433
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,840
[sighs]
Sir.

434
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,560
Even judges and prosecutors
are standing by and waiting.

435
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,970
Connections don't work here.

436
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,850
I know. And I'm very sorry.

437
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,730
-I sincerely apologize.
-For what?

438
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,570
[gasps]

439
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,650
[groaning]

440
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,860
What good do you think that's gonna do?

441
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,200
[choking]

442
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,700
Why are you doing this?

443
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,750
[breathing heavily]

444
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,170
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.
I have to get to the school.

445
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,920
I already said I'd follow protocol
and help you.

446
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,430
Those protocols kept me
from saving too many lives.

447
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,640
I'm leaving.

448
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,850
Please help them out,
so they are not punished,

449
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,770
not too severely at least.

450
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,690
[Eun-hee] You create this mess,
but you want me to clean it up?

451
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,240
I know you're a mother as well.

452
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,660
I'm a father.

453
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,960
[clattering]

454
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,080
[grunts]

455
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,210
[So-ju] Hey.

456
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,380
Why did you do that?

457
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,970
What? He… He tried to get up.

458
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,680
So what now?

459
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,930
Don't even think about coming with me.

460
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,850
You want me to stay here
after what I've done?

461
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,060
[sighs]

462
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
[tense music]

463
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,490
[indistinct chatter]

464
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,170
[helicopter whirring]

465
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,590
[U-sin] We can't go that way.

466
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,900
[So-ju] There are no kids
in school uniforms.

467
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,150
No one got out.

468
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,740
No one saved them.

469
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,740
No.

470
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,120
That's not it.

471
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,370
Move. Step back, Su-hyeok.

472
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,120
That's not it, asshole.

473
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,580
Tell him.

474
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,670
You weren't bitten by a zombie.

475
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,090
Say something.

476
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,060
Gwi-nam.

477
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,930
He bit her. It wasn't zombies.

478
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,060
Who?

479
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,350
Gwi-nam. The bully.

480
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,270
-Yoon Gwi-nam?
-Yeah.

481
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,190
Nam-ra. Did Gwi-nam really bite you?

482
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,150
Say it clearly.

483
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
It's true.

484
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,540
Gwi-nam was bitten by zombies.

485
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,330
[scoffs]
Bullshit.

486
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,040
I saw him get bit.

487
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,800
If you get bitten by zombies,
you turn into one.

488
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,670
-So if Gwi-nam bit her--
-He's not one of them.

489
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,050
-[zombies growling]
-[banging on door]

490
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,260
Gwi-nam wasn't a zombie.

491
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,640
He wasn't.

492
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,150
He literally talked to me.

493
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,770
You saw him. He wasn't a zombie at all.

494
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,030
Are you sure he was bitten by a zombie?

495
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,360
Yeah.

496
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,370
So I'll turn into a zombie.

497
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,580
You won't.

498
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,160
I…

499
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,250
Never mind. So be it.

500
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,920
Su-hyeok, thank you.

501
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,130
Hold on, prez.

502
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,470
I wonder why you never called me
by my name.

503
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,480
You won't.

504
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,370
She won't turn into one.

505
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,080
Don't you trust me?

506
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,540
I saw when Gwi-nam got bitten.

507
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,920
-It happened after fighting with me.
-I fought him, too. Believe me.

508
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,540
I know.

509
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,630
[tense music]

510
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,850
You see?

511
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,820
If she turns, I'll throw her
out the window, so she can't attack you.

512
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,200
So back off.

513
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,410
-[Cheong-san] Su-hyeok.
-[Su-hyeok] Back off, asshole.

514
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,830
You shouldn't do this.

515
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,870
I owe it to you.

516
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,050
Don't come closer.

517
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,300
I'm warning you.

518
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,970
Screw you.

519
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,310
I warned you first.

520
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,180
Get lost.

521
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,430
Gyeong-su was enough.

522
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,440
I won't lose any more friends.

523
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,900
[Cheong-san] Get out of my way.

524
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,860
I said to stop it--

525
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,160
Get out of my way!

526
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,700
Stop it, both of you!

527
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,370
[zombie growling in distance]

528
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,760
If I feel strange in any way…

529
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,140
I'll just end it quickly.

530
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,730
Sorry, but--

531
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,190
No need to be sorry.

532
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm actually not sorry, not at all.

533
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,110
Sorry.

534
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,650
Su-hyeok.

535
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,530
Kill me if I turn.

536
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,830
Hey! Hey!

537
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,220
That's enough.

538
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,270
She should've turned by now.

539
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,350
Not yet.

540
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,560
She was bitten by Gwi-nam,
so she should be fine.

541
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,900
He was bitten by zombies.

542
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,650
Su-hyeok says he wasn't.

543
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,490
I saw it with my own eyes.

544
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,780
Su-hyeok has no reason to lie.

545
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,950
And you're telling me that I do?

546
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,660
Su-hyeok was saying--

547
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,660
I know you like him, but…

548
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,870
This is a little more important,
don't you think?

549
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,590
Why would you bring that up?

550
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,010
Because you always take his side.

551
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,970
I don't do that.

552
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,260
Yes, you do.

555
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,660
[Mi-jin] Does it hurt a lot?

556
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,000
[Joon-seong] I said we shouldn't come out!

557
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,130
I said we would all die!

558
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,090
[Min-jae] We stopped the bleeding
and sterilized the wound.

559
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,550
So you'll be fine
once you get to a hospital.

560
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,380
How can I go to a hospital right now?

561
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,630
What a joke.

562
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,470
Stop complaining. You'll be fine.

563
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,510
[Joon-seong] It's all your fault.
It's your fault.

Of course, it's broken.
I said it wouldn't work, didn't I?

568
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,780

Don't do it!

Get out of my way! Let go of me!

590
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,970
Stop it. Are you blind? Look at Nam-ra.

591
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,970

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,650
Does she?

594
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,360
And he's not bleeding, right?

595
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,360
It's true. There's no wound.

596
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,660
But if Gwi-nam bit her--

597
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,660
She's still fine,
which means you'll be fine.

598
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,920
Come on, put that down.

00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,920
Stop being stubborn.

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,250
-Why do you care?
-What?

606
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
It's weird.

607
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,130
You've always hated me.

608
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,970
Sometimes, I still do.

609
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,890
What's wrong is wrong, though.

610
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,270
She seems fine. Let's…

611
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,270
She would've definitely turned by now.

612
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,730
No.

613
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,740
I'm not okay. I wanted to bite Su-hyeok.

614
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,040
That's not true.

615
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,080
Stop that.

616
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,910
I really did.

617
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,750
I wanted to bite him.

618
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,630
Wait, what do you mean by that?

619
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,300
I mean…

620
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,550
I wanted to bite him.

622
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,980
I shouldn't stay with you any longer.

623
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,480
If I hadn't come to my senses,
I would've bitten him.

624
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,270
Hey, come on, stop that.
What's wrong with you?

625
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,360
[sighs]

626
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,150
I'll go.

627
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,530
Please wait.

628
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,160
You saw Gwi-nam get bitten by zombies?

629
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,660
I told you a hundred times, yes.

630
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,410
And you saw Gwi-nam turn?

631
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,830
No, I didn't.

632
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,460
I was busy running away.

633
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,630
Su-hyeok, you definitely fought Gwi-nam?

634
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,170
Yes, I did.

635
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,470
There's no reason for either to lie.

636
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,510
Maybe Gwi-nam was bitten,
but was not affected.

637
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,850
In the movies, there are always people
who are immune, remember?

638
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,810
Still, she tried to bite him.

639
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,810
She could have bitten him for real.

640
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,690
Regardless, she isn't normal.

641
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,900
So I'm not going with her.

642
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,030
Ji-min, stop.

643
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,030
What? Are you saying that I'm wrong?

644
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,200
Maybe.

645
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,160
I really don't know what we should do.

646
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,290
We can't pretend she's fine.

647
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,790
Enough.

648
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,670
Please don't fight.

649
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,470
Leaving will solve everything.

650
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,610
Don't go. Where would you go?

651
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,320
Stop it.

652
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,230
Please.

653
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,740

Nam-ra's hands are warm.

00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,340
She isn't a zombie.

659
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,300
So cut it out,
and let's talk how to get to the roof.

-Ji-min!

No way!

She may be fine now,
but who knows what's gonna happen

when she turns?

664

Guys, say something. This is wrong.

665
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,560
She said herself
that she wanted to bite him.

666
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,980
She has zombie blood in her veins.

-Hold still.

Happy? This way,
she can't get to you if she turns.

677
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,250
I'll get bitten instead.

I have to go.

Be back in a minute.

682
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,620
It's probably not gonna start, you know?

683
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,740
Why are you so damn pessimistic, huh?

684
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,870

That's obviously fine.

Oh, I can't go. There's no way.

Fine, go ahead.

Yes, I am. I go to Seoul University.

703

Okay, then, I'll break
all the windows on my way out,

704
