Let's begin the briefing.

We plan to emit sounds using drones

406
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,050
to lure the infected
into target locations.

407
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,470

to maximize the resulting impact

Out of 170,000 residents,
110 are in various quarantine camps.

we estimate 50,000 are infected

and 10,000 are uninfected or asymptomatic.

418
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,410
We'll send soldiers after the explosion
to evacuate whoever is left.

[Wu-jin] I really think that
that's the only way out.

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,540
No. It drops into
the basement on that side,

451
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,540
and there are exposed steel bars.

452
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,290
No way we can jump.

453
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,670
That side faces the school,
so there's no point trying it.

454
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,260
The ground is filled with zombies,
we'll die if we go down.

455

There's a door on the first floor
that leads to the mountain.

456
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,760
We have to go that way.

457
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,260

Can't we reach the roof
if we use that and the windows?

460

If someone goes to the roof and screams,
the zombies will follow them.

461
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,570
Then I'm pretty sure it'll empty out
in there, and the rest can escape.

Send in the troops in the early morning
to take care of the rest.

You're here to chat?

777
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,610
Or you came to watch?

778
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:16,660
I came to tell you,
Hyosan was bombed last night.

779
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,830
What was that?

780
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,000
Forty percent of the population

You should be ashamed of yourself.

785
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,600
[Seon-moo] I thought about it.

786
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,940
Could anyone…

787
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,110
offered comfort to the people
of Hyosan now?

788
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,860
That is why I came to see you.

789
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,820
Please tell the people of Hyosan…

790
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,410

This morning,

799
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,370
I watched the final video
of Lee Byeong-chan,

800
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,750
the man who created the virus in his lab.

801

804
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,260
<i>but he failed.</i>

805
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,090

00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,280
[Byeong-chan crying]
<i>Please stop!</i>

812
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,490
<i>I respect the decision he made.</i>

813
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,620
[crying]

814
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,370
<i>Lee Byeong-chan was a father
and a husband.</i>

815
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,330
<i>I'm sure he couldn't kill anyone.</i>

816
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,920
However, I am a soldier.

817
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,760
So today,

818
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,930
I ordered the bombing
of the city of Hyosan.

819
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,260
No one else has instructed me to attack.

820
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,680
No one ordered me to do anything.

821
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:30,730
It was my decision and mine alone
as the martial law commander.

822
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,860
I take full responsibility.

[Seon-moo] Hi, it's me.

828
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,230
Did you eat?

829
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,310
[sighs]
Look at the time.

830
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,980
How come you haven't eaten dinner yet?

831
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,690
And the kids?

832
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,400
Mm-hmm.

833
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,360
It's not a big deal
if they miss school a few times.

834
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,820
Better to stay healthy, right?

835
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,490
Yeah.

836
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,080
Well, I guess
we can just look for a tutor.

837
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,750
Mm-hmm.

838
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,670
It doesn't matter if it is expensive.

[chuckles]

840
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,220
Okay, well. Maybe not too expensive.

Mm-hmm.
