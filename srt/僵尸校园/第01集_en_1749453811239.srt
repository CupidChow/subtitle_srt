Mom. If you wanna change names,
you should start with the restaurant.

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,990
Why are you using my name?

283
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,790
I named it Cheongsan Chicken
way before you were born.

284
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,790
Exactly. You named me
after the restaurant.

Look, so this is a new recipe
we just came up with.

291
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,520
So this one is just a little spicy,
and this one's really hot.

It's salty.

How about this one? Is it spicy?

No. It's salty.

-I don't think it's salty at all.

It's true.

I swear she knows every other smell
except that one.

333
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,730
Since she never smelled it before,
it has to be a rotting corpse.

he started acting weird.

[muffled gasp]

708
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,600
[Mr. Lee] <i>A virus…</i>

709
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:02,650
is somewhere between a living organism
and a non-living organism.

710
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,610
Like a living organism,
it adapts to its surroundings and evolves.

711
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,830
Everything that evolves in this manner

712
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,000
should be considered
an independent living organism.

713
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,420
Mr. Lee, the textbook says a virus is not
an independent living organism.

714
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,420
Whether or not it's categorized that way

715
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,380
doesn't depend on its metabolism,
but its will to survive.

716
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,260
[students laughing]

717
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,300
[shuddering]

718
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,840
If its will is so strong…

719
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,510
[students laughing]

720
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,680
I'M SO SEXY

721
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,850
-[laughing continues]
-[shudders]

722
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,810
The instinct to survive
actually surpasses intelligence.

723
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,730
[whimpers]

724
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,240
[Mr. Lee] And eventually the ecosystem
is dominated by that will.

725
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,610
Humanity has never once
completely defeated a virus.

726
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,330
<i>Leucochloridium paradoxum.</i>

727
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,250
[sobbing]

728
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,500
This parasite's
final destination is a bird.

729
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,630
The parasite enters a snail
and infects its ocular tentacles.

730
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,340
That makes the snail put itself
in the path of predatory birds.

731
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,720
So the infected snail commits suicide
at the whim of the parasite.

732
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,850
[suspenseful music]

733
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,520
-Tell me.
-[shudders]

734
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,940
Now, is that because the snail
is less intelligent?

735
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,900
It's not.

736
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,740
It's because
the parasite's will to survive

737
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,450
is much stronger than the snail's.

738
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,660
-Shut up when the teacher's talking.
-[Mr. Lee] The evolving…

739
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,870
…and hereditary will to survive is…

740
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,910
Keep your head up.

741
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,460
…the sole standard by which
living organisms are defined.

742
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
[ominous music]

743
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,340
So is the textbook wrong?

744
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,680
The textbook?

745
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,350
It's wrong.

746
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,980
[snarls]

747
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,020
[ominous music continues]

748
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,780
[growls]

749
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,530
-[snaps]
-[grunts]

750
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,740
[bone cracks]

751
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,660
[Sun-hwa] In fact, none of us
are completely free from prejudice.

752
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,620
We all have
preconceived ideas about others.

753
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,330
Here, "free from" means
the lacking in or unincumbered by.

754
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,210
Anyone want to interpret this?

755
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,210
[tapping on board]

756
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,300
Okay.

757
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,630
Hee-su.

758
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,510
I need to use the bathroom.

759
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,970
Okay, go.

760
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,390
[students murmuring]

761
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,430
Okay, then.
[Sun-hwa sighs]

762
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,690
Anyone wanna have a crack at it, huh?

763
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,230
[tapping on board]

764
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,520
Class president?

765
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,150
The truth is, all of us have
some sort of prejudice.

766
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,530
[Nam-ra] We all have preconceptions
about other people.

767
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,580
Hmm, okay. Nice.

768
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,250
[inhales]
Next, Bare-su. Stand up.

769
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,620
[students laugh]

770
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,620
Stand up.

771
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,040
[Su-hyeok] Yes?

772
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,460
What's with "Bare-su"?

773
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,920
Mm…

774
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,420
It's short for Barefoot Su-hyeok. Bare-su.

775
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,760
-[girls laugh]
-Ah.

776
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,430
He hates wearing socks.
He's so weird about it.

777
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,140
I can smell it a mile away.

778
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,010
[class laughing]

779
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,970
Okay, Bare-su.

780
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,770
What did Nam-ra say a minute ago?

781
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,390
[shushes]

782
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:27,770
Ah…

783
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,190
[class] Ah…

784
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,770
-[girls giggling]
-[class murmuring]

785
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,650
She was absolutely correct.
A hundred percent.

786
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,240
[class laughing]

787
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,110
What was her absolutely correct
answer then?

788
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,950
[exhales]
Hmm…

789
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,910
-[murmurs]
-[chuckles]

790
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,910
All right…

791
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,330
[exhales]

792
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,750
-[Su-hyeok] Huh?
-[door slides opened]

793
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,670
[suspenseful music]

794
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,250
[Sun-hwa] Hyeon-ju.

795
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,460
-Hey, Hyeon-ju.
-[class clamoring]

796
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,920
[gasps]
Hyeon-ju!

797
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,010
Hey. What's wrong? Are you okay?

798
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,590
-Hey, Hyeon-ju.
-[Na-yeon] Is that blood?

799
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,840
Ms. Park.

800
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,390
Yeah, it's me. Do you recognize me?

801
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,970
He grabbed me…

802
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,180
[breathes shakily]

803
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,060
The science teacher grabbed me
and locked me up.

804
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,520
-[Sun-hwa] He locked you up?
-[students murmuring]

805
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,730
The science teacher?

806
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,690
-Mr. Lee Byeong-chan, huh?
-[gasps]

807
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,440
He tied me up…

808
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,110
-[Na-yeon] I told you, didn't I?
-[breathing heavily]

809
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,440
[Hyo-ryeong] Just shut up, okay?

810
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,110
Let's go to the infirmary, okay?

811
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,950
-What kind of a psycho does this?
-Nam-ra.

812
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,320
[Sun-hwa] Make sure
they study on their own.

813
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,410
And please don't say anything to anyone
until I come back and confirm the facts.

814
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,120
Hyeon-ju. Can you get up?

815
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,040
I'll carry her.

816
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,460
[Sun-hwa] Okay.

817
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,580
-Can someone help him out, please.
-Here.

818
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,670
-[Sun-hwa] Good.
-Okay.

819
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,380
-[Sun-hwa] Go back to your seats!
-[Su-hyeok grunts]

820
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Now.

821
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,130
[tense suspenseful music]

822
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,470
[all panting]

823
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,180
-Hyeon-ju.
-[I-sak] What's wrong?

824
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,520
[Sun-hwa] Guys, hold her still.

825
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,020
-[rapid footsteps]
-What's wrong with her?

826
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,860
[all panting]

827
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,490
[groans, breathing heavily]

828
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,320
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

829
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,740
What do I do?
[whimpering]

830
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,450
[nurse] Does your stomach hurt? Is it bad?

831
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,490
Let me see.

832
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,040
Please help.

833
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,870
-Huh?
-[nurse] Uh, wait, hold on.

834
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,870
Put her on the bed.

835
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,620
-Please take a look at her.
-Here, lookout.

836
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,250
[beeps]

837
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,800
Her temperature is way too low.

838
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,970
Here, hold it down
so she doesn't kick it off.

839
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,090
[growls]

840
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,510
[Su-hyeok] Hold her. Hold her.

841
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,220
-Hyeon-ju, Hyeon-ju. It's okay.
-Call an ambulance right now.

842
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,850
I'll give her a sedative
and clean her wounds.

843
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,760
[Sun-hwa] Okay.

844
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,470
[Hyeon-ju grunting]

845
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,730
[Sun-hwa] Hyeon-ju. It's okay.

846
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,650
Hyeon-ju. You're okay now.

847
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,270
[tense suspenseful music continues]

848
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
[keypad beeps]

849
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,820
EMERGENCY CALL

850
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,780
-[phone line ringing]
-[Hyeon-ju snarls]

851
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,620
[groans, sighs]

00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,460
[breathes heavily]

853
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,300
[grunting softly]

854
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,720
-[Hyeon-ju] Too hot.
-Hang in there, Hyeon-ju.

855
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,050
Your temperature is a little too low.

856
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,720
Too hot. I'm too hot.

857
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,970
You're going to the hospital soon.

858
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,760
We're all here for you,
so don't worry, okay?

859
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,560
The science teacher gave me a weird shot.

860
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,390
A shot?

861
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,850
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan gave you a weird shot?

862
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,480
He tried to kill me.

863
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,650
[breathes shakily]

864
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,530
-Hey, Hyeon-ju, tell me what shot?
-[Hyeon-ju gasps]

865
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,610
I'm gonna kill them all.

866
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,240
-[shrieks]
-Hyeon-ju.

867
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,870
-[snarls]
-[gasps]

868
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,120
[Sun-hwa] Hey, are you okay?

869
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,540
-Hold her down so I can give her the shot.
-Okay.

870
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,790
Just a minute, okay?

871
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,130
Hyeon-ju. Just hang on.

872
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,180
[Hyo-ryeong] It's so strange.
Hyeon-ju was really odd.

873
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,180
-[Na-yeon] Yeah, totally.
-[Hyo-ryeong] It's weird.

874
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,430
Everyone else saw that, right?
First, she just disappeared all day,

875
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,270
then she comes in all bloody
talking about the science teacher.

876
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,440
She could have gone somewhere
and got hurt,

877
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,900
then came back here
and collapsed all of a sudden.

878
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,820
-It's got to be true.
-Did you hear something?

879
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,150
You know how we heard
his son went missing?

880
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,530
I heard he didn't go missing.

881
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,030
-Suicide.
-Come on, don't fall for that.

882
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,950
-That's silly.
-He committed suicide?

883
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,790
-You believe that?
-No, really. It's true, okay?

884
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,580
Hyeon-ju hung out with the same crowd
that bullied Jin-su all the time.

885
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,750
So the science teacher
went after them one-by-one.

886
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,880
He hunted them down.

887
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,760
-And kill them.
-Who said that?

888
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,010
-All his students.
-[Ji-min] Which one?

889
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,100
Last time I saw Hyeon-ju
was in the science lab.

890
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,220
[breathes sharply]
Hey.

891
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,680
I think maybe…

892
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,100
Mr. Lee made porn with Hyeon-ju.

893
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,980
-[Gyeong-su] Porn?
-Hey, you moron.

894
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,770
Get your mind out of the gutter, asshole.

895
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
[Wu-jin] You fat ass.

896
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,520
[Dae-su] Why are you cursing at me, dick?

897
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,030
[Wu-jin] Because you're a fucking pervert,
dumb ass.

898
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,530
[Dae-su] So why did he kidnap her then?

899
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,780
-Have you ever been kidnapped?
-Of course not. Stupid.

900
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,320
-Easy, I'm your brother-in-law.
-[scoffs]

901
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,070
-I told you to stop saying that.
-[grunts]

902
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,660
-[class clamoring]
-[student] Hey, tell us what happened?

903
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,160
I-sak, wait, what happened?

904
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,420
-[Gyeong-su] Hey, what happened?
-[Wu-jin] How is she?

905
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,580
[Hyo-ryeong] How's Hyeon-ju?

906
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,250
It's no joke.
She was biting people and trashing around…

907
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,170
Where's On-jo?

908
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,130
She got hurt.

909
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,300
Where? How bad?

910
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,510
She'll be fine.

911
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,090
Uh, Hyeon-ju bit her?

912
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,470
I think she went crazy.

913
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,970
[I-sak] Her temperature is super low,
but she said she was hot.

914
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,560
She tried to bite us.

915
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,230
-[Na-yeon] What the hell?
-So does she have rabies?

916
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,600
[Dae-su sighs]
What an idiot.

917
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,900
And Hyeon-ju had this weird smell.

918
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,020
-[Na-yeon] What smell?
-The same one as the science teacher.

919
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,520
-A rotting corpse.
-Yeah, that.

920
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,860
-I knew it.
-And she said,

921
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,740
Mr. Lee gave her some kind of weird shot.

922
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,400
What a total psycho.

923
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,820
-[class clamoring]
-Shouldn't we tell the police about this?

924
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,490
I don't know.
Ms. Park said she's gonna handle it.

925
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,200
Look…

926
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,500
She's just been sitting there studying.

927
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,420
Yeah, well, she is the top student.

928
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,540
-So? Where's On-jo?
-[I-sak] In the infirmary.

929
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
[suspenseful music]

930
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,520
[grunts]

931
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,730
It seems like she went
into shock due to hypothermia.

932
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,980
I manage to give her a sedative.

933
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,190
Okay. We'll take her to Hyosan Hospital.
Did you contact her parents?

934
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,490
Yeah. I did. They're on their way.
Please take good care of her.

935
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,820
-Will do.
-[nurse] Thank you.

936
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,200
AMBULANCE

937
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,200
Thank you.

938
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,790
-[On-jo's father] Are you okay?
-[nurse] That was scary.

939
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,620
Look at me. Were you scared?

940
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,870
Definitely.

941
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,790
[sighs]
Man.

942
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,090
So, what's wrong with her?

943
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,800
I don't know.
I'll tell you later when I get home.

944
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,130
I'm on calls, so I won't be home.

945
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,550
Just try not to get it wet.

946
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,430
Call me right away
if you need anything at all.

947
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,180
I'll rush right over. Okay?

948
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,310
-Okay.
-Good. Bye, hon.

949
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,850
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

950
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,400
Thank you and take good care
of her for me please.

951
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Given the situation,

952
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,110
-I can't stick around.
-[Sun-hwa] Okay.

953
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,240
-Hurry up, Dad.
-[Sun-hwa] You should go.

954
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,320
[engine revving]

955
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,790
Thank you for your help, guys.

956
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,380
I'm going to head back in a few minutes…

957
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,210
Please make sure you don't tell anyone
about this just yet, okay?

958
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,340
-Yeah.
-Mm-hm.

959
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,260
[Sun-hwa] All right.

960
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,140
I think it's better not to tell anyone
for the time being.

961
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,180
Sounds good.

962
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,890
[Sun-hwa] Go back to class. Let's go.

963
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,310
Are you okay? Does she bite you?

964
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,480
-No, it's just a scratch.
-You sure you're all good?

965
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,820
Hey. You wanted to meet on the roof?

966
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,450
-What?
-You said come up after lunch.

967
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,290
Can you just tell me now?

968
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,370
I'm actually
playing basketball after lunch.

969
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,420
[cheeky music]

970
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,550
What's that?

971
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,760
NAM ON-JO

972
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,470
[stammers]
Wait. This means…

973
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,730
you wanna go out with me.

974
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,650
Yeah.

975
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,190
But aren't you with Cheong-san?

976
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,520
No.

977
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,360
We've lived next door
ever since we were little kids,

978
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,110
and his mom always gives me free chicken…

979
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,610
[inhales]
…and I do like chicken.

980
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,910
I love it actually.

981
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,120
-[flustered exhale]
-But not him, I swear.

982
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,030
Ah, okay.

983
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,740
-[Cheong-san] On-jo!
-So I--

984
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,370
Where did you get hurt?

985
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,330
How bad is it, huh?

986
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,710
You're such a klutz sometimes.

987
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,000
[On-jo scoffs]
I'm fine.

988
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,680
How bad was she hurt?
She's pretty clumsy, huh?

989
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
[clicks tongue]
No.

990
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,930
Hyeon-ju tried to bite us.

991
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,760
She got hurt
trying to stay out of the way.

992
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:42,810
Hey.

993
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,930
You're going out with On-jo?

994
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
Right?

995
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,020
Mm-hm. Right.

996
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,820
[sighs, clicks tongue]

997
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,030
Can't believe you bought that? You freak.

998
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,950
Seriously, even if it was
the end of the world,

999
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,610
and it was her, me, and a zombie,

1000
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,490
I'd honestly rather date the zombie.

1001
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,450
Why do you ask?

1002
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,790
[Su-hyeok] No reason.

1003
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,830
[chuckles awkwardly]
Let's go.

1004
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,580
[Su-hyeok] Anyway, what's for lunch today?

1005
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,080
Do you have any idea?

1006
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,750
[Cheong-san] I want some <i>tonkatsu</i>.

1007
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,380
[ambulance siren wailing]

1008
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,170
[suspenseful music]

1009
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,300
How far are we from the hospital?

1010
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,880
-We're almost there.
-[gasps]

1011
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720

[foreboding music]

1015
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,530
She went to the hospital.

1016
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,410
[sighs]

1017
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,580
-Wait.
-Mr. Lee. Wait.

1018
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,580
You don't understand.
She can't be in a hospital.

1019
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,580
-Let all calm down.
-What are you talking about?

1020
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,080
No! Let go of me!

1021
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,290
No! It's time for you
to explain yourself here.

1022
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,790
We can't send Hyeon-ju to a hospital.

1023
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,500
We have to put her in quarantine.

1024
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,710
[yelling] Hey.

1025
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,960
Sit down, Mr. Lee.

1026
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,340
You've already turned things upside down

1027
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,380
when you're at school
with the story about your son.

1028
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,640
How the hell could you say that?
Jin-su was the victim!

1029
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,430
And of course, you forced us to bury it.

1030
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,480
Oh, that's some crack of bullshit, huh?

1031
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,980
You know how the school's evaluation
is just around the corner.

1032
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,270
You should've called me
before calling an ambulance, Sun-hwa.

1033
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,980
What do you think
is gonna happen if the police come?

1034
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,610
Well, I already called the police.

1035
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,740
A teacher should deal
with school matters internally.

1036
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,450
[principal] I'll call the police
if we need them.

1037
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,450
-Tell them not to come.
-[Sun-hwa] I mean…

1038
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,660
-[Jae-ik] Mr. Lee.
-[grunts]

1039

It's been a while,

I have a great idea.

1248
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:36,980
Just ask Cheong-san.

1249
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,850
Forget it.

1250
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,770
Seriously, he and Su-hyeok
are really close.

1251
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,280
Why don't you
just ask Cheong-san how he feels?

1252
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,570
[scoffs]
No.

1253
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,780
On-jo. You have to listen to me.

1254
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,080
There's a good chance Su-hyeok
already told him everything.

1255
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,750
It doesn't matter. He'll make fun of me.

1256
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,580
Put mine away too, gopher.

1257
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,960
[I-sak] Hey, Cheong-san.

1258
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,090
On-jo needs to talk to you.

1259
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:06,720
Hey. So, you're close to Su-hyeok, right?

1260
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,550
For sure. Why?

1261
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,470
Told you?

1262
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:12,970
What is it?

1263
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,350
Nothing. So get lost.

Hey. A real friend
would help out right now.

1270
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,830
Wait a second? Did Su-hyeok say something?

1271
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,750
No.

1272
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,910
Did you fight?

1273
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,580
I just said no.

1274
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,380
Then what's going on,
did he say that he likes you?

1275
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,010
Did he say that?

1276
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,720
-What?
-That he likes me?

1277
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,300
Who? Su-hyeok?

1278
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,680
No? He didn't say anything?

1279
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,020
Hmm, what are you talking about?

1280
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:58,890
Earlier…

1281
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,610
-You can't tell anyone, okay?
-About what?

1282
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,020
You really can't tell anyone.

1283
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,440
About what, On-jo?

1284
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,780
I asked him out earlier, but I don't know.

1285
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,280
[On-jo] He hasn't said anything.

Yeah, what?

1289
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,080
Any chance you could ask him
what he thinks about me?

00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:25,790
[laughs awkwardly]

1291
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,920
We're not close.

1292
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,720
Yeah, you are.

1293
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,760
No, we're not, really.

1294
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,680
Can't you help me out for once?

1295
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,560
