ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IN KOREA

00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,850
Hello, everyone!

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,100
I'm Orangibberish, and I always get
to the truth behind the rumors.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,610
Okay, today, I'll be uncovering the truth
behind the Hyosan zombies rumor.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,900
I'm on my way to see
if it's really turned into Zombieland

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,190
like they've been saying online
and on social media.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,610
You know what I'm talking about.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,030
FINALLY
HE'S REALLY GOING

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,200
Whoa. It's already pretty crazy.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Look out there.

[Orangibberish] Do you see that?

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,250
It's bumper to bumper
with cars trying to get into Hyosan.

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,630
There are so many cars.

18
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,760
Hold on.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,970
I'm gonna have to get out
and hike my way in.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,470
[Orangibberish] I came up the mountain
to avoid the traffic jam.

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,100
See that there?

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,890
That is Hyosan all the way
down there in the distance.

23
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,980
Okay. I'll…

…show you the gear…

First. A helmet.

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,400
A hockey mask. A pair of knee pads.

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,450
Shin guards. Very important.

29
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,780
This is emergency food.

30
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,990
First aid kit. And water.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,290
And the most important of all, an axe.

32
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,790

slice them up like roast beef.

Your dad's a firefighter,
so I'm sure he's fine.

And I'm guessing my mom and dad
are at the restaurant.

That's the most important thing to my mom.

She's probably out there selling chickens
to the zombies right now.

some of her chicken.

You mean, screaming?

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah.

117
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,770
Maybe they didn't die, then.

118
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,900
They wouldn't have been quiet
if zombies were biting them.

119
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,530
They must be alive.

No one answers me.
I'm always talking to myself.

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,040
-I think you're right.
-Forget it.

124
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,420
I didn't hear anything, either.

125
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,720
Me neither.

126
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,930
I was scared because I didn't know
how I'd feel if I heard them screaming,

127
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,810
but I didn't hear anything.

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,770
Come to think of it, neither did I.

129
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,270
Then I'm right. They're alive, right?

130
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Should she be alive?

131
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
What do you mean?

132
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,530
She's a murderer.

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,030
[Ji-min] She killed Gyeong-su
and walked out of here on her own.

134
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,580
Is it even right for her to be alive?
Aren't you all being fake?

135
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,750
What about Miss Park?

136
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,370
Should she have died too?

137
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,710
[Ji-min] Is that our fault?

138
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,500
Either way, we're responsible
for what happened.

139
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,420
Why is that?

140
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,880
What did we do wrong?

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,050
Na-yeon killed someone,
then played the victim,

142
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,550
and chose to leave on her own…

143
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,810
because we didn't listen to her.

144
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,230
If no one's on your side,
is it okay to kill?

[Ji-min] Miss Park acted
like we were wrong.

146

We didn't tell Na-yeon to go out there.

We didn't tell Miss Park
to go out there, either.

I do.

We have to go, too, actually.

I told you no one would come.

No one cares about this school.

163
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,750
If they did,
they would've saved us by now.

164
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,710
So we wouldn't have been
attacked like that.

would burn down.

They'll save us.

They just have to.

00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,550
that you want to die.

182
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,430
Why are you blaming me for this?
Su-hyeok brought it up.

183
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,640
Pooping's not a crime.

184
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,100
It's not a crime, but…

185
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,400
But what? Don't you need to go?

186
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,650
Yes, I do.

187
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,360
-Not poop, but, you know…
-What about you?

188
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,360
I don't… Pooping? No.

189
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,370
Don't you need to go?

190
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,200
Why are you asking me?

191
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,250
Why are you getting annoyed?

192
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,370
What do you want from us?
We can't go out, anyway.

193
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,340
[breathes deeply]

194
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,840
I have an idea.

195
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,050
[Dae-su] First…

196
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,430
The girls and the guys will take turns.

197
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,850
Where?

198
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,810
Here.

199
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,270
[Hyo-ryeong] You're crazy.

200
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,850
Stop it, man.

201
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,940
[Dae-su] Why?

202
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,110
The girls can wait in the other room,
and the guys can just pee out the window.

203
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,320
What about… poop?

204
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,780
Poop. Well…

205
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,950
You can take off your pants
and hang out the window.

206
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,540
Like this.

207
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,500
Outside.

208
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,540
Like you're taking a dump
at the edge of a cliff.

209
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,630
-Like this.
-[Wu-jin] What reaction is he hoping for?

210
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,840
-[Hyo-ryeong] Stop being ridiculous.
-[both sigh]

211
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,420
But someone has to hold you,
so you don't fall.

212
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,050
How are you going to wipe your butt?

213
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,260
-Well, someone else should.
-[Hyo-ryeong] What is he saying?

214
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,220
Idiot.

215
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,470
Let's just hold it.

216
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,270
If the rescuers come--

217
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,140
It'll take a while for them to get here.

218
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,610
It may be the same outside of the school.

219
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,730
[On-jo] I don't know
how long we'll be stuck here,

220
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,280
but my dad always told me

221
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,660
to separate the bathroom
from where you sleep

222
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,200
if you find yourself stranded.

223
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,700
Where will we create a bathroom and how?

224
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,990
Right there.

225
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,710
-Yes, sir.
-[zombies gagging]

226
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,090
-They're sending a chopper.
-[sighs]

227
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,550
We have to get to the roof
by 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

228
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,130
What do you mean,
we have to go out to the roof

229
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,680
when it's swarming with the infected?

230
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,430
Also, 11:00 a.m. tomorrow?

231
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,600
Why can't you arrange it
for 11:00 p.m. tonight?

232
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,350
Yes, tomorrow. We'll spend the night here.

233
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,980
How can the assemblywoman sleep here?
Radio in again!

234
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,480
We'll have to stay here tonight,
so you're gonna have to create

235
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,780
a temporary bathroom.

236
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,320
-U-sin.
-Yes, sir.

237
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,660
[sighs]

238
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,420
Nam-ra and you guys, try to look
for something to cover the window.

239
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,330
Okay.

240
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,340
Cheong-san and Joon-yeong,

241
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,090
make something that can absorb urine
and feces to use as a toilet.

242
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,260
Cheong-san.

243
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,850
And then the rest of you…

244
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,510
A screen?

245
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,180
-A screen?
-Yes, a screen to block.

246
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
MUSIC 3

247
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,780
Come with me. Come on.

248
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,660
-That's the bathroom.
-[scoffs]

249
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,570
[Dae-su groans]

250
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,630
[Joon-yeong] Put this in here.

251
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,970
Why don't we put this
on top of the basket?

252
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,380
Oh, okay.

253
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,560
Okay. We're all gonna
use this as a toilet,

254
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,310
so that it will absorb urine and feces
as much as possible.

255
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,560
[Cheong-san] Put this in there too.

256
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,610
Dae-su's got a big butt, so let's…

257
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,320
-[On-jo] Why don't we tape CDs up there?
-[tape screeching]

258
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,570
-One more?
-Is there more tape?

259
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,780
[tape screeching]

260
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,500
-[clanking]
-[grunting]

261
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,670
[boys grunt]

262
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,510
What's going on?
Did they make the toilet yet?

263
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,760
What's taking them so long?

264
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,840
[Joon-yeong] That's good.

265
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,220
-This should be good enough.
-[Joon-yeong] Okay.

266
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,180
[grunts]

267
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,600
[Dae-su] How do we poop on this?

268
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,730
Use the cover for poop,
and without for pee.

269
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,650
Get out.

270
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,770
-Oh.
-Out.

271
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
How do we use that?

272
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,940
-Get out. Get out. Get out!
-Come on. Don't push me! Aah!

273
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,190
-[unzips pants]
-[clangs]

274
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,110
-[urine pattering]
-[sighs]

275
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,490
[Joon-yeong grunting]

276
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,990
At least there are cops
and soldiers out there, right?

277
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,790
But if you watch the movies,
they can't do anything, either, right?

278
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,340
Yeah, but they always save everyone
in the end.

279
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,050
[sighs]

280
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,880
-Here's the tissue.
-Pee. Just pee.

281
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,800
-[both sniff]
-[door slams]

282
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,560
-Oh!
-[Su-hyeok] Shit!

283
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,560
-Why don't you just stay inside?
-[Ji-min groans]

284
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,230
-[Dae-su] Does it smell?
-[door slams]

285
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,940
-Shit.
-[Dae-su] What?

286
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,060
Stop being so dramatic.
It doesn't smell at all.

287
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,900
[Hyo-ryeong] Sit somewhere else.

288
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,860
-[exhales deeply]
-There's nobody there.

289
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,700
There are no lights on
in the stores and apartments out there.

290
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,280
They all ran away or died.

291
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,660
What do you mean by that?

292
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,620
No one's coming here to save us.

293
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,500
Why do you have to be so pessimistic?

294
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
Don't you know my mom?

295
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,590
She would've torn the school apart
looking for me, but she isn't here yet.

296
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,800
So, what do you wanna do?

297
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,090
I'm just trying to point out the facts.

298
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,260
We all know that no one's coming.

299
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,300
So I think we should just figure out
what we're gonna do next.

300
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,180
We have to wait to be rescued.

301
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,230
We can't leave somewhere safe
to go somewhere dangerous.

302
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,730
And what if nobody comes?

303
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,690
We haven't been waiting that long yet.

304
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,820
How do you think we have to wait?

305
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,280
-Do you think we should wait until we die?
-No.

306
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,320
I'm saying let's wait as long as we can.

307
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,820
There's no way we can go out
right now, anyway.

308
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,120
[Su-hyeok] It's probably
because it's nighttime.

309
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,580
I'm sure somebody will come
in the morning, maybe.

310
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,710
There are a lot of choppers flying around.

311
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
Let's just wait until tomorrow,
and we'll see.

312
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,930
[gasps]

313
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,480
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

314
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,980
What do you mean?

315
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,020
You're leaving first
for a personal matter?

316
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,190
How could a firefighter say
something like this during a crisis?

317
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,610
I'll take any punishment
when this is over.

318
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,910
I'll resign if I have to.

319
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,910
Listen.

320
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,740
Do you intend to leave all these people
and go by yourself?

321
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,500
You'll abandon your sick colleague
and leave a kid in charge?

322
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,040
A kid? He's not a kid.

323
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,750
He's a firefighter.

324
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,920
[sighs]

325
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,720
Fine.

326
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,430
I made a mistake.

327
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,770
Please accept my apologies.
I didn't mean to offend you.

328
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,890
But this isn't just about you.

329
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,190
My daughter is at school…

330
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,030
but I can't reach her.

331
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,030
I know she's waiting for me.

332
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,240
[sighs]

333
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,780
I need to go. I'm sorry.

334
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,700
Stop. Wait.

335
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,160
Let me tell you something.

336
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,300
[Eun-hee] His apartment is right there.

337
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,340
If he says he needs to go save his mother,

338
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,220
do I let him go?

339
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,010
And she lives right over there.

340
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,180
She has a husband and children.

341
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,900
Is it the right thing to do
to let her leave?

342
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,400
Knowing they'll all die if they go out?

343
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,700
I'll go even if I'll die.

344
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,950
That's exactly why I'm saying this.

345
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,250
You're a firefighter.

346
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,500
I'm a politician.

347
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,090
Do you know when it's the hardest
for people like us?

348
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,880
Right now.

349
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,180
Because we have to save the most people,

350
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,550
not the people most precious to us.

351
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,770
[exhales heavily]

352
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,070

and became a substitute teacher.

533
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,030
Our principal took you in
as a permanent member of the faculty.

534
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,570
You should be a team player

535
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,570
and work for the school too.

pretty much to run away.</i>

539
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,250
<i>And they kept finding him
and harassing him.</i>

540
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,540
I guess it was fun for them.

541
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,510
Like they're playing with a toy.

546

Just fight back, would you?

547
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,280
Just be a man for once
and fight them back!

548
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,700
I'm sorry, Dad.

549
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,370
I just want to disappear.

550
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,460
That would be easier for me.

[Byeong-chan] <i>That's when I realized it.</i>

552

We live in a system of assault.

553

A complete nobody like me…

554
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,350

to try and commit suicide again.</i>

561

[Jae-ik] <i>You created…</i>

562
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,470
<i>a monster.</i>

563
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,600
That's how desperate I was to save him.

564
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,640
Rather than die as a human,

565
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,560
I wanted him to survive as a monster.

566
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,770
Don't you realize
that monster is killing everyone?

567
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,440
Who cares if they all die?
They were all complicit.

568
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,360
You crazy asshole.

569
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,860
Who created this world?

570
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,780
I warned that if you ignore it
for being a minor assault,

571
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,040
violence would eventually rule the world.

572
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,410
But no one listened to me.

573
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,660
"It happens."

574
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,040
"Kids fight."

575

"They were bullied,
because they deserved it."

576
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,250
The bastards who thought that
and shunned them

577
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,630
made this world the hell
of what it is today!

[breathes shakily]

579
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,190
No. You're the one who made this hellhole.
It's on you.

580
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,690
Maybe as a cop, I'm partly responsible.

581
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,780
But what about those people out there
dying without knowing why?

582
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,660
Sure. Maybe they're partly responsible
like you say.

583
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,910
But there are certain things
you must pay with death,

584
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,370
and certain things you must pay
as you live.

585
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,330
You wanted to change the world.

586
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,920
Not for everyone to die like this, huh.

Well, there has to be
some kind of treatment.

594
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,780
There's not.

595
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,630

00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,880
Did you see him turn into a zombie?

710
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,460
He may have already.

711
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,220
There's no guarantee he didn't.

712
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,680
Shut up.

713
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,510
Why are you arguing?

714
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,890
Just fight, okay?

715
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,060
Sorry.

716
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,400
Come with me if you want.

717
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,360
She's so cool. Fuck.

718
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
So annoying.

719
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,450
[sighs]
Wait up.

720
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,960
They'll come for us eventually.

721
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,500
How long do we wait?

722
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,290
Until they come.

723
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,840
There's no guarantee they'll come, though.

724
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,880
So? You want to go out there?

725
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,880
Even if they come, they won't find us
if they don't know we're here.

726
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,300
Well, we can put up a sign for help.

727
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,260
[Ji-min] How?

728
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,180
I remember my dad taught me
a signal that's used internationally.

729
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,890
[Hyo-ryeong] What is it?

730
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,980
[On-jo] <i>It's Cheong-san. Bye, Dad.</i>

731
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,770
[So-ju] Hey, have another bite. Okay?

732
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,520
[So-ju] Hey, kid!

733
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:51,190
It was red and blue arranged together

734
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,950
to create some sort of a pattern.

735
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,290
Should we write "SOS" on a curtain, maybe?

736
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,040
Yeah, let's do that.

737
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,550
[Nam-ra] We can't last long, anyway.

738
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,930
Three minutes without oxygen,

739
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,970
three days without water,
three weeks without food.

740
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,220
What's that?

741
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,220
How long a person can survive.

742
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:23,730
It's only been a day, you know.
We have to try the best we can.

743
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,730
We'll show signs of dehydration today.

744
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,400
And we won't be able to move by tomorrow.

745
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,190
What are you trying to say?

746
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,700
Are you saying we should go out, or…

747
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,080
are you saying we'll die, anyway,
so we shouldn't bother doing anything?

748
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,960
I don't know.

749
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,750
Then don't say anything.

750
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,880
I think the prez means we should think
about anything else that we can do.

751
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,010
[Su-hyeok] Right?

752
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,220
-No.
-No?

753
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,060
We don't know anything at all.

754
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,890
We need to know something
before we can make plans.

755
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,440
-[Ji-min] What more do we need to know?
-What Nam-ra means--

756
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,400
You don't know what she's saying, either.

757
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,320
No.

758
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,870
Are you saying we need to understand
the situation in order to take action?

759
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,660
Yes, that's right.

760
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,240
Well, I totally agree with that.

761
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,290
We need more information to decide
whether to wait, run, or get out.

762
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,420
What can we find out on this situation,
and also, how?

763
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,750
We can check online
if we have a cell phone.

764
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,590
But we don't.

765
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,510
The teacher's office.

766
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,640
Why are you telling me that now?

767
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,600
Sorry.

768
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,390
Why are you telling me that, Cheol-su?
What do you want me to do about it?

But I couldn't because of the zombies.

783
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,520
I was going to ask the rescuers
to find his phone if they came, but…

784
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,060
It's past nine, right?

785
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,730
Not sure. I don't have my phone.

786
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,610
No way.

787
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,570
It can't be nine yet.

788

-Don't do this.
