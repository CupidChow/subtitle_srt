-[doctor] What happened to her?
-She came from the school.

211
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,840
She was bleeding when we got there.
But we're not sure exactly what caused it.

212
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,550
-When was she injured?
-We got the call about 30 minutes ago.

213
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,140
[doctor] Why is she lethargic?

214
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,140
[So-ju] She seemed to be
having seizures at first,

215
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,470

[handcuffs clinking]

218
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,660
[Jae-ik] You received the PhD
in cell biology in the US,

219
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,780
returned to Korea.

220
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,620
You were a pharmaceutical researcher
and quit, then teaching.

221
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,670
You should be a college professor
with this résumé.

222
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,880
Definitely not
some lousy high school teacher.

223
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,760
The hospital needs to put Hyeon-ju
to quarantine, nothing less.

224
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,550
Why would a teacher decide
to chain a student?

225
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,600
If I were a college professor…

226
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,180
If I were a prosecutor, or a reporter,
would you have listened?

227
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,020
Ah, that's why you did it.

228
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,940
Because no one listened to you
or understood how you felt?

229
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,530
You were lonely, maybe saddened.
Is that it?

230
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,150
Fine.

231
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,740
Let's do nothing.

232
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,280
Everyone will die.

I hate you assholes. You're a sick kind.
Can't stand you.

237
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,090
You commit the crime,
but you blame others, society, everything.

238
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,640
When you reported your son missing,
you said, "The world swallowed my son."

239
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,390
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
What, is the world an anaconda?

240
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,560
[Jae-ik scoffs]

241
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,770
It didn't swallow him.

242
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,230
Tell me what really happened to him.

243
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,740
You killed your son.

244
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,330
But you reported him missing
to avoid being a suspect. Am I right?

245
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,500
Your son isn't missing, is he?

246
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,580
What happened to him, huh?

247
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,830

255
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,400
the mouse would lose its senses
due to the overwhelming fear

256
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,860
<i>and attack the cat.</i>

257
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,280

00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,350
[Joon-seong]
We should stay here a bit longer.

720
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,810
[Ha-lim] Right. Okay.

721
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,900
[Joon-seong] Do you think they're gone?

722
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,560
[Ha-lim] What do we do?
Shouldn't we go out and call the cops?

723
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,990
We can't go out now.
I'm sure they're still out there.

724

[Ha-lim sighs]

726
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,740
Also, who the heck is smoking
in here right now?

727
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,490
And who are you that you're hiding
in the girls' bathroom, huh?

728
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,290
Be a man. If you can even do that.

729
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,500
You… Who are you?

730
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,840
Leave her alone. It's Mi-jin.

731
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,800
Mi-jin? Park Mi-jin?

732
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,760
[Ha-lim] Yeah.

733
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,880
Joon-seong. I'm really dizzy.

734
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,470
[Joon-seong] Is it bad?

735
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,970
-Oh, no.
-I don't know. It's weird.

736
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,640
[Ha-lim] Everything sounds muffled,
and I'm dizzy.

737
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,650
[Joon-seong] Don't worry,
it's probably just from the shock.

738
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,110
We'll go to the hospital
when things calm down, okay?

739
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,690

-Okay.

741
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,740
Hey, open up.

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,290

[lock clanks]

744
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,660

Mi-jin.
[whimpers]

750
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,590
Listen carefully.

751
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,310
You know how to play tag?

752
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,810
[Mi-jin] We hide.

753
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,440
We run to get away from someone.

754
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,980
Now…

755
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,030
Now, you are it.

Don't stand there! Help!

761
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,310
But Ha-lim's in there.

762
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,270
She was bitten. You got that? Now, help.

763

[grunting]

764
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,900
[Ha-lim] Mi-jin, don't do this.

765
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,820
I'm okay.

766
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,320
Let me out.

767
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,660
Shut up, zombie fucker!

768
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,240
[Ha-lim] Joon-seong, don't do this.

769
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,490
Let me out.

770
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,540
We ran away together earlier. I saved you.

771
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,000
If you let her out, we all die.

Get it together. Look up.

775
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,390
What do you want from me?

776
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,150
-We have to kill her.
-Kill Ha-lim?

777
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,360
She's not Ha-lim. She's a… zombie.

-[groaning]
-[Joon-seong] Still, I don't wanna.

779
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,030
[Mi-jin] Do we have any other options?

780
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,280
[Joon-seong] I don't know.

781
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,000
Mi-jin. I hear you.

782

I know.

783
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,460
[Ha-lim] Do you really have
to do that to me?

784
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,880
You're going to turn, eventually.

I mean it. I really wasn't bitten.

906

This will kill us faster.
It's just gonna be--

Why? Did you see something?

1046
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,760
No. But you go first.

1086
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,540
The second floor? Broadcasting room?

1087
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,250
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1088
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,340
Were you with the other kids
by any chance?

1089
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,880
They're in the science lab.
They'll come down now.

Careful. Careful. I got you.
Hold on. Hold on.

1095
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:08,650
You're so heavy.

1096
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,190

-I got you.

1102

Let go.

1103
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,880

1106
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,510
-Not my legs!
-Watch out for your neck!

1107
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,350
Good. You did great. You did great.

You have to get it together.

1116
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,800
Everyone in here lost a friend, On-jo.

1117
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:23,180
Do you know how many people died?
Why are you so…

1118
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,350
There's just no one left that I like.

1119
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:32,520
Well, there are people who like you.

1120
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,940
Like your dad.
