1
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,701
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION AND THE ELEMENTS
OF THE STORY HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY

2
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,996
JAESONG-GANGSEONG DINING EVENT

3
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,845
Who are you?

4
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,097
You look somewhat familiar.

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,307
Move aside.

6
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,729
I'm the Dreams' general manager, Baek
Seung-soo. If you give me some time...

7
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,398
I will...

8
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,651
sell the Dreams off.

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,156
So you're the general manager
of the baseball team.

10
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,741
You created noise while doing your job.

11
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,867
Yes.

12
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,537
It's the same baseball team
that you created

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,581
after starting Jaesong Group,

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,959
at a plywood factory. The baseball team
that was founded as soon as

15
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,339
-Korean professional baseball started.
-What's with this punk?

16
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,718
I can get that you have
no love for the baseball team.

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,596
You shifted your company's field
to the heavy industry.

18
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:40,266
I know that you have no interest
in keeping a baseball team as well.

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,477
So, what is it that you want to tell me?

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,145
Don't just walk away from it.

21
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,274
I suggest you at least collect
the investment that you initially put in.

22
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,651
It's not like

23
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,028
we haven't attempted to sell the team.

24
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,279
I will do that.

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,285
And also, old people's time

26
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,372
is more valuable than that of the youth.

27
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,835
Young ones fail to know that.

28
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,463
Even if it's Jaesong Group, the team
is worth tens of billions of won.

29
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,507
Rather than throwing it away,
you can sell it and--

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,176
If you need a job, come find me.

31
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,982
Yes.

32
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,153
What's the reason for suddenly
breaking up the team?

33
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,655
The stars of the hot stove league
now were the Dreams.

34
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,868
We have decided to break up the team,

35
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,536
taking responsibility

36
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,288
for the underwhelming performance

37
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,498
that the team has shown to our fans.

38
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:52,130
It is the right moment to leave while
we can still receive a goodbye ovation.

39
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,383

40
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,844
After that, Lim Dong-gyu has
been added to the team.

41
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,304
At least for this year, it seemed

42
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,681
like the Dreams were getting
recognized as the dark horse.

43
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,516
You must not know the Dreams that well.

44
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,894
Creating buzz in the winter
to make it seem

45
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,856
like something is going to happen
during the season

46
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,109
is a way for weak teams,
despite unintended,

47
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,736
to deceive their fans.

48
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,613
Are bad performance
and management to blame?

49
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,991
-Is there something we aren't aware of?
-That's it.

50
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,492
Excuse me, sir!

51
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:26,539
-Please say something.
-Is it because you don't have enough time?

52
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,299
Welcome.

53
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,595
Please give me the same thing
as what this man is having.

54
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,721
Yes.

55
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,479
What are you doing?

56
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,899
Do you own this place or what?

57
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,275
How rude.

58
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,364
Fine.

59
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,159
I'm not your boss anymore.

60
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,870
You acted like some noble or high class

61
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,747
even though it didn't suit you.

62
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,084
-But you drink at a place like this.
-What's wrong with a place like this?

63
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,127
If someone who'd even sell
his soul to work

64
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,256
is going to enjoy his drinks
at a place like this,

65
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,799
that's a bit disappointing.

66
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,469
You haven't sold your soul while working?

67
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,932
-No.
-That's the problem.

68
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,852
All the workers out there

69
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,313
sell their souls when working.

70
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,694
It's because you act all proud
that you get fired

71
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,488
and cause trouble for your employees.

72
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,616
Now that the team has even disbanded,

73
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,703
you're causing a lot of damage
to all the employees.

74
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,873
If I heard this sometime before,

75
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,002
it would have delivered a blow,
but now, it doesn't.

76
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,047
Even if I listened to you well,

77
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,551
you wouldn't have increased
your investment in the team

78
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,971
or done better to the employees.

79
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,057
If nothing is going to change,
don't waste your emotions.

80
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,393
That's a wise choice.

81
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,396
If nothing is going to change,

82
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,274
it means Jaesong and the Dreams
don't want each other.

83
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,567
So Jaesong Group should

84
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,694
at least take its money.

85
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,945
So, you're attempting

86
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,072
to sell the team?

87
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,576
You'll do something I failed to do?

88
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,830
-Our capabilities differ.
-Baek Seung-soo.

89
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,541
In this region,

90
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,462
there isn't a single person

91
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,256
who can afford to manage the Dreams
that hasn't rejected to do so.

92
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,551
I'm sure you know very well that I am

93
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,927
a man of my word.

94
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,847
Rather than just disbanding it,

95
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,807
if you take at least 20 billion won,

96
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm sure Chairman Kwon Il-do
will appreciate you more.

97
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,271
Why is a future jobless man
worrying about me?

98
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,150
With the help of his brother,
a successful self-made businessman,

99
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,402
your father became
the president of a baseball team.

100
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,031
Despite failing to take it
to the championships,

101
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,617
I heard he had a special affection
for the team.

102
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,659
You punk!

103
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,828
There isn't anyone left who will

104
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,748
remember the former president,

105
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:17,293
who took his son
to the baseball field every day.

106
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,753
Stop it.

107
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,797
I'll make just one request.

108
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,301
Give me one week
to set up talks to sell the team.

109
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,430
Baek Seung-soo.

110
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,307
You mentioned 20 billion won.

111
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,060
The chairman is managing
a business worth one trillion.

112
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,770
So he's going to look at you,

113
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,147
who argue that 20 billion won
is a reason to sell the team,

114
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,316
as nothing but petty flies.

115
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,695
I'm barely keeping him satisfied.

116
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,032
Do you expect me to mess this up
just because of the Dreams?

117
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,910
You feel emotions too.

118
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,206
Achieve nine times, but fail once,
and you feel terrible.

119
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,551
You should eat the food.

120
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,177
It's easier on the stomach.

121
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,480
You hardly have a chance.

122
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,781
The disbandment is not final.

123
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,408
Management is sorting it out.

124
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,202
Even if the team gets disbanded,
there will be a draft anyway.

125
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,746
So please refrain
from contacting me like this.

126
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,291
No, I'll hang up.

127
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,670
Sir.

128
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,883
The younger players are also receiving
calls asking about their health.

129
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,677
Give them a talk.

130
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,054
Sure.

131
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,186
The team has not disbanded yet.

132
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,689
I know it's hard playing baseball
with a worried mind.

133
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,442
But you all are skilled
enough to be chosen elsewhere.

134
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,487
Resist for now, even if you get
a call from other teams.

135
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,113
Let's do...

136
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,574
what we're supposed to do.

137
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,742
-Yes.
-Yes.

138
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,035
Do you understand?

139
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,453
-Yes!
-Yes!

140
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,959
We have yet to find
a company to negotiate with.

141
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,588
The general manager plans to seek
approval from Jaesong Group first.

142
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,090
The company is proceeding
with a new big business

143
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,759
that makes this baseball team look small.

144
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,053
So it seems to think of the cost as tiny.

145
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,393
Excuse me.

146
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,062
Why are you leaving?

147
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,690
Please excuse me as well.

148
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,984
Where are you going?

149
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,904
-Where are you going?
-In the middle of a meeting!

150
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,698
-He must have a package waiting.
-What is this?

151
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,618
Why are the Red Hawks calling?

152
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,871
I understand why

153
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,373
the two team leaders went out.

154
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,334
Our team leaders are quite popular.

155
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,044
I will firmly

156
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,547
reject their offer and come back!

157
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,881
Please sit.

158
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,799
Yes.

159
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,219
Why am I not receiving any calls?

160
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,347
-What?
-No one from another team is...

161
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,474
Well...

162
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,561
I ordered a game pack, but the order is...

163
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,853
being delayed.

164
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,566
I apologize.

165
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,442
So where did we leave off?

166
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,237
What are you looking at?

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,446
It's not what you think.

168
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,824
Yes, it is.

169
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:42,164
Yes. I'm Lee Se-young, the Dreams'
operations manager forever.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,875
Sabers?

171
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:46,836
Sabers?

172
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,923
Our disbandment has not been
determined yet.

173
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,134
So I do not think this call
is appropriate.

174
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,428
Why would you...?

175
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,470
Hey!

176
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,222
Introduce me to them!

177
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,642
I can't introduce you.

178
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,645
If you want to leave, then leave.

179
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,398
This is a meeting to bring
the Dreams back to normal.

180
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:24,040
YOU HAVE RECEIVED ONE MILLION WON
FROM KOWN JAE-WOO.

181
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,555
Why did you send me the money?

182
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,436
Can't a son pay for his father's
medical treatment?

183
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,775
Can't a son even pay for his father's
medical treatment?

184
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,362
And why did you take care of
someone else's...?

185
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,573
Do you think
they'll ever thank you for it?

186
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,453
Father.

187
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,757
It's nothing. I'll hang up.

188
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,614
Why are you giving this?

189
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,367
I know you threw it out.

190
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,537
But I was worried you might regret it.

191
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,415
You're being thoughtful for no purpose.

192
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,709
Send me back to the scout team.

193
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,547
Why?

194
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,218
I want to do real work
rather than interfering with others.

195
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:12,940
Mr. Chairman.

196
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,151
Will you give me...

197
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,863
one week before disbanding the team?

198
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,781
Hey, Kyung-min.

199
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,409
Can't you distinguish
between the big and little deals?

200
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,953
I think we can get
at least 20 billion won.

201
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,873
We can expand our facilities
with that much money

202
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,333
and put spurs to our new businesses

203
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,877
to have a good start.

204
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,088
Can you do something we failed
in the last few years in a week?

205
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,423
Not me,

206
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,425
but Mr. Baek will.

207
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,593
Then,

208
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,847
that general manager can do in a week

209
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,849
what you couldn't do for years, right?

210
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,811
The baseball team that showed a loss
of seven billion won a year

211
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,481
can fill in the losses of three years
in one week.

212
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,650
And it's unnecessary for Jaesong Group

213
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,612
to leave the region with a bad image.

214
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,115
It's only a week.

215
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,576
All right.

216
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,745
If you return

217
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,914
without the 20 billion won,

218
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,083
can I send you back to your father

219
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,669
instead of our heavy industry?

220
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,173
I'll take the risk.

221
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,801
You must have liked baseball a lot.

222
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,887
Weren't you

223
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,056
predicting this would happen?

224
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,976
How would a single general manager
predict the big deal between firms?

225
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,648
What will you do with the schedule for the
exhibition game and the regular season?

226
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,985
I'm the one who's the most flustered,
but I still am sorry.

227
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,364
Do you have any measures prepared?

228
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,367
Before I set up any measures,
by any chance...

229
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,035
By any chance what?

230
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,828
If we negotiate,

231
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,290
will you be able to adjust
the league entrance fee

232
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,417
to the firm that will take over our team?

233
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,546
Are you even planning to negotiate?

234
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,590
Is the adjustment possible?

235
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,303
PRESIDENT KWON KYUNG-MIN

236
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,139
All right. We'll do our best then.

237
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,768
Yes.

238
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,318
Have a seat.

239
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,908
You were promised one week, right?

240
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,745
Why do you never start
a conversation by saying thank you?

241
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,915
Right. Thank you.

242
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,876
"I'm grateful" would be better.

243
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,086
Yes, I'm grateful. It is one week, right?

244
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,757
Do well.

245
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,552
Yes, I'm planning to.

246
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,179
Even if you succeed in negotiating,
it doesn't mean

247
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,432
that you're more capable than me.
You know that, right?

248
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,518
I've never even made
that comparison before.

249
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,855
So which company did you find?

250
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,357
-PF.
-The IT company?

251
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,109
The web portal?

252
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,903
Yes, you're right.

253
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,034
Haven't you left work yet?

254
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,202
Mr. Baek.

255
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,579
Why did you come back?

256
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,748
We have a meeting with PF.

257
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,709
Is PF the past...?

258
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,294
Yes.

259
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,171
Why do you have so much work these days?

260
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,591
If we fail to sell our team,
we're thinking of getting

261
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,677
a title sponsor to make it
into a publicly-owned team.

262
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,388
I have work to do because I have
to visit Dongjin City Hall tomorrow.

263
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,016
Are you also thinking of making
it into a publicly-owned team?

264
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,143
If we'll be supported like we were
by Jaesong Group,

265
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,645
we're better off without it.

266
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,565
-But selling the team is the best way.
-Yes.

267
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,610
But if I make this work,

268
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,530
-at least you can stay.
-Pardon?

269
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,368
You could modify the contract
that you renewed with Jaesong Group.

270
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,579
Whether we're selling the team
or making a publicly-owned team,

271
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,665
they won't be able to exclude you.

272
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,751
Can we afford to consider that?

273
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,294
Of course.

274
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,838
We are very determined right now.

275
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,570
Mr. President.

276
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,785
Oh, welcome.

277
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,831
-Have a seat.
-Yes.

278
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,135
When is my next meeting?

279
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,553
It's at 47 minutes.

280
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,887
At 47 minutes.

281
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,931
We don't have a lot of time.

282
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,225
Right. Let's begin.

283
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,977
Sure.

284
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,022
Our biggest requirement is

285
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,565
an employment buyout.

286
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,067
Not only the players,
but also our employees

287
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,861
and the coaching staff.

288
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,154
That'd be difficult.

289
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
Would it?

290
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,325
I didn't know

291
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,120
our negotiation would stop here.

292
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,081
But PF has never run a sports team before.

293
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,543
We should still have room to recruit
some people of our own.

294
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,171
The Dreams have enough personnel prepared

295
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,964
to run the team.

296
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,215
They'll be able to run it.

297
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,093
But I'd like to hire people
who could do it better.

298
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,428
And the selection process

299
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,972
can be evaluated using various indicators.

300
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,308
So you would use different indicators

301
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,936
to evaluate the personnel
even if you have no experience.

302
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,938
May I interpret it that way?

303
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,565
Mr. Baek.

304
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,233
Have you sold used cars before?

305
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,279
When you sell your used car,

306
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,074
do you ask the buyer
how he will use the car?

307
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,204
You can't really compare
the team to a used car.

308
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,997
Is that so?

309
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,292
It's fine.
You can describe it as you please.

310
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:10,339
I merely wonder why you would choose to
take the instability of forming a new team

311
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,050
when you're taking over an existing team.

312
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,384
That's what I meant.

313
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,139
You don't have a different opinion
on the hometown, do you?

314
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,851
I think it's better for both parties

315
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,645
to stay in the current hometown.

316
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,773
What do you think?

317
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,276
I think staying is the answer.

318
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,945
I'm thinking the opposite.

319
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,280
Sir.

320
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:41,411
We don't have much time. And baseball is
known to be the most local sport.

321
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,415
If it's a local sport,
why did you come to PF?

322
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,835
There are other companies
in the local area.

323
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,588
Which region do you want?

324
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,258
Seoul.

325
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,138
Do you mean Seoul, where it's
crowded with three teams already?

326
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,640
Are you aware that you must offer

327
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,183
other expenses to the other teams,

328
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,810
you must pay for the league entrance fee

329
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,104
if you choose Seoul as your hometown?

330
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,982
I think that's way better

331
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,775
than staying in Dongjin

332
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,861
which is completely irrelevant to PF.

333
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,407
Sure.

334
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,911
Will you be able to share your thoughts
on the sales price today?

335
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,416
I'm not sure.

336
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,421
Is PF really willing to buy the team?

337
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,341
No.

338
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,430
The Dreams called me
if I'm interested in it.

339
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,932
We're planning to organize a sports team,

340
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,643
but running a baseball team seems

341
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,103
a bit burdensome.

342
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,689
Do you like baseball?

343
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,359
Yes, I do. But I'm not totally into it.

344
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,112
But...

345
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,450
is Kang Doo-ki that good at pitching?

346
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,077
-Sir.
-Yes?

347
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,250
I was a bit rude, wasn't I?
Was I too frivolous?

348
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,004
It was a bit of both.

349
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,423
Okay. I apologize.

350
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,928
I don't know much about baseball,

351
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,848
but I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Baek.

352
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,975
They were mostly good things.

353
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,146
Trading is supposed to be done secretly,

354
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,606
and you've done it greatly.

355
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,400
Yes, I only did my best.

356
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,197
I heard you gave a presentation
to convince the staff.

357
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,240
That's right.

358
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,533
Can you do the same

359
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,994
for me?

360
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,957
About why PF

361
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,084
has to take over the Dreams.

362
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,587
Sure, I can do it here right now.

363
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,755
Really?

364
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,590
You mean, 100 percent?

365
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,885
Are you 100 percent sure
that you can convince me?

366
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,429
That's up to your intention.

367
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,265
I doubt it.

368
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,975
-Sir.
-No.

369
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,519
I think I'm not doing wrong now.

370
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,565
I believe a perfect speech

371
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,068
has the power to convince

372
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,028
someone who is determined to say no.

373
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,073
That is how I've reached this far.

374
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,825
Isn't that right?

375
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,827
Yes, that is right.

376
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,287
Good.

377
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,623
Okay, I better do it if I have time

378
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,625
to be torn whether or not to do it.

379
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,503
I'll get ready and come back.

380
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,255
Thank you for your time.

381
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,256
No problem.

382
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,141
I think he's a little strange.

383
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,227
Yes, I'll prepare for the presentation
as soon as we arrive.

384
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,314
What do you think about making it
a publicly-owned franchise?

385
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,233
The city of Dongjin didn't sound
that negative about it.

386
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,194
I bet the reality would be different
from what they said.

387
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,698
A sponsoring company
or a small local company

388
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,658
managing a baseball franchise

389
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,244
may look like a beautiful picture
from the outside.

390
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,748
It could be different in Seoul,
but for a countryside club like us,

391
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,959
the employees' salary might be
reduced to half all of a sudden,

392
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,045
or it might be managed barely

393
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,755
with the least number of staff.

394
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,341
Then what is your opinion?

395
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,342
Well,

396
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,886
I think PF is our only way through.

397
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,226
CEO isn't easy to deal with.
Why this place out of all the others?

398
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,313
Big companies are being very conservative

399
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,315
because they don't expect
any advertising effect.

400
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,776
But this company is young
and not based on any community.

401
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,402
I think it's their strength.

402
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,696
Right, and crucially,

403
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,157
they wanted to open
a baseball franchise once.

404
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,159
Their plan didn't come true
due to some reasons,

405
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,913
but it's those reasons why I think
PF is the best option we have.

406
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:53,830
Figures.

407
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,542
If there were a lot of other alternatives,
I would've sold it off already.

408
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,795
Just because he isn't easy to deal with

409
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,047
doesn't mean we can't communicate.

410
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,430
REASONS TO TAKE OVER THE DREAMS
FIRST, ADVERTISING EFFECT

411
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,018
ON AVERAGE, 28.1 BILLION WON

412
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,313
It comparatively costs a lot to run
a domestic baseball franchise.

413
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,399
Thus, the industry is dominated
by big companies.

414
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,735
Advertising was its original purpose,

415
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,737
but it doesn't hold any meaning
at the moment.

416
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,783
So those big companies
want to back out from the industry now.

417
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,409
However,

418
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,372
Taegang Bank signed a contract
with the Whales

419
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,958
as their main sponsor in 2015.

420
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,878
Their image had been low
in the financial circle,

421
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,588
-but it hiked up dramatically and--
-Okay.

422
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,259
I know that story. Next.

423
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,718
Okay.

424
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,220
GOOD CHEMISTRY WITH PF

425
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,307
All right, PF struck the youth
with their web portal,

426
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,851
and their strength is that

427
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,853
it's highly inclined to entertainment.

428
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,146
And this goes very well

429
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,523
with managing a baseball franchise.

430
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,150
Fine.

431
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,568
Tell me something new.

432
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,863
DREAMS' CHANCE TO WIN

433
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,741
We have

434
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,370
scouted Kang Doo-ki, the top player
of the national baseball team.

435
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,415
His WAR is

436
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,041
more than seven.

437
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,794
And as for the foreign player,

438
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,046
we've scouted Robert Gil,

439
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,506
the former Major League player,

440
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,466
instead of the okay player, Andy Gordon.

441
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,428
Moreover, we've strengthened
our stable defense

442
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,432
and as reported in the articles,
we're the winner of the Rule 5 drafts.

443
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,558
Lastly...

444
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,726
LIM DONG-GYU

445
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,604
the scariest batter in the fall
is to return late summer.

446
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,189
That's Lim Dong-gyu.

447
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,985
But you placed last
for four years in a row.

448
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,695
Isn't it a bit too much

449
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,779
to expect to win?

450
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,697
All right.

451
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,202

452
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,455
Kang Doo-ki and Robert Gil have proved

453
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,207
their skills in the league

454
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,668
by playing against two pitchers
with 15 wins.

455
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,962
And regarding our defeat
in the second match,

456
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,381
you'll know if you look at the details.

457
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,260
It was the process
for our promising pitcher

458
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,887
to overcome his yips.

459
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,432
You might be able to escape last place.

460
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,517
I agree to that point.

461
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,355
Exhibition games started recently.

462
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,439
Kang Doo-ki...

463
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,359
and Robert Gil went up the mound

464
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,652
in turns.

465
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,363
Our team won two times against the Whales,

466
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,906
that placed fourth last year.

467
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,199
And today...

468
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,577
THE DREAMS TAKE DOWN THE PELICANS

469
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,371
Who was the opposing team today?

470
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,081
The Pelicans, that placed third.

471
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,375
Irrelevant to the disbandment issue,

472
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,502
I'd like to stress
that we continued to prepare

473
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,836
for this season.

474
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,548
Thanks for the speech.

475
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,926
Is this all?

476
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,512
Weren't you

477
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,265
going to found a baseball franchise?

478
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,394
I must say it's not so creative
to come to a company

479
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,521
that gave up on founding a franchise.

480
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,233
You should've rather avoided coming
to such a company.

481
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,653
You had to start from scratch
at that time,

482
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,821
but now,

483
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,032
this team has the most-wanted
national athlete, Kang Doo-ki,

484
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,077
and the fifth batter
of the national team, Lim Dong-gyu.

485
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,912
I'm suggesting that you take it over.

486
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,582
I bet none of the baseball fans
in the country wants

487
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,917
the Dreams to be disbanded

488
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,878
and the industry to be left
with nine teams.

489
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,966
You took action to fund
a new franchise, but failed,

490
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,010
which caused the fans to criticize you.

491
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,470
I wish you take nice revenge.

492
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,972
It's all in the past.

493
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,140
An outdated story.

494
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,354
Are you done?

495
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,106
No.

496
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,274
There's more.

497
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,903
I've given you logical reasons.

498
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,322
May I tell you

499
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,908
what I really want to say from now on?

500
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,369
Can it be more effective

501
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,954
than the logical reasons?

502
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,498
WHAT KIND OF COMPANY IS PF?

503
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,336
What could it be?

504
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,754
What is this?

505
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,007
KOREAN INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEUR AWARDS

506
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,555
Aside from the web portal,

507
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,099
you've developed various programs

508
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,060
such as an anti-virus program.

509
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,021
You've won various awards
with your friends too.

510
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,066
You've run a startup company as well.

511
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,567
Let's stick to the Dreams.

512
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,027
No, this is necessary.

513
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,030
I couldn't find
why the company was named PF

514
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,366
anywhere on the website.

515
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,951
But I found the answer
from the interview you did

516
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,371
when you were running the startup company.

517
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,374
I was surprised because
it was simpler than I thought.

518
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,877
Playground Friends.

519
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,961
PLAYGROUND FRIENDS

520
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,631
When all the others went
to academies in Daechi-dong,

521
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,341
you and your two friends played together

522
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,469
at the playground. Your friendship
is older than 20 years.

523
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,806
Where are those friends now?

524
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,057
Why are they...

525
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,476
working in another industry?

526
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,816
WHAT KIND OF COMPANY IS PF?

527
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,859
"I'd like to return the company's profits

528
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,237
to the society through a healthy method."

529
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,239
Your young resolution

530
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,408
was so nice.

531
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,035
Stop now. This is personal.

532
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,204
Let's hear him out to see how far he goes.

533
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,957
In the process of expanding
the business in the beginning,

534
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,544
you must've lost a lot of things
under the excuse of inevitability.

535
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,004
But if you...

536
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,091
keep the promise that you made

537
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,052
to your friends over a canned beer

538
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,971
together in a small office,

539
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,932
they might come back to you.

540
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,394
You even know that?

541
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,939
The existing information
is enough to figure this out.

542
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,317
There was someone's hard work
who memorizes

543
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,486
all the information about entrepreneurs.

544
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,957
The shareholders weren't fond of the idea.

545
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,668
The size of the company
was smaller than now too.

546
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,212
Instead of sharing the value,

547
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,798
they put priority on development.

548
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,009
I decided to respect their opinion.

549
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,305
Efficiency, intensiveness, growth first.

550
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,767
You have achieved a lot of results

551
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,102
under these words.

552
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,022
You need strength to be generous.

553
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,274
You're here

554
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:40,278
to convince me, and it proves that notion.

555
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,490
Right, I've run

556
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,824
several sports teams.

557
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,744
I also have experience

558
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,245
of failing to protect my people

559
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,331
even after leading them to victory.

560
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,959
It would've been different

561
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,294
if you made bigger results.

562
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,922
Results better than victory?

563
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,884
Probably.

564
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,052
But here's the thing.

565
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,013
Growth by a certain percent.

566
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,057
Achieving sales worth hundreds
of billions of won.

567
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,767
Have you never felt empty

568
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,520
while repeating these words?

569
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,572
You must all be mistaken.

570
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,866
I'm okay.

571
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,327
I'm doing just fine.

572
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,120
I always thought

573
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,665
I was responsible for someone.

574
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,668
So I always felt that
I was going to take responsibility.

575
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,712
But one day, I realized

576
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,799
that all my colleagues around me
were also taking care of me.

577
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,594
And sometimes when I was arbitrary,

578
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,305
they just went with my opinions too.

579
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,977
I'm sure you also experienced
an argument with your friends.

580
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,522
And was it always you
who persuaded the others

581
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,149
when that happened?

582
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:06,281
Or wasn't it you who wasn't persuaded?

583
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,622
The results tell me I wasn't wrong.

584
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,959
Your friends also might have
anticipated the same results.

585
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,671
But they must've thought
the achievement was meaningless

586
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,632
since you and they hadn't shared
the same values.

587
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,426
"The achievement was meaningless"?

588
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,762
Does it make sense?

589
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,974
We should keep making achievements
even if they're meaningless.

590
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,977
If I had invested in the baseball club,

591
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,770
we would've ended up
like the Dreams by now.

592
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,190
I thought spending
such a large sum of money

593
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,984
just to promote our company was too much.

594
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,613
So many people's livelihood
depends on my decision.

595
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,158
I must protect my workers...

596
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,578
even if it costs losing two friends.

597
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,954
I see.

598
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,498
I used to be very like you.

599
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,751
So here's my offer.

600
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,505
Why don't you forget about the numbers

601
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,633
regarding the company's growth and sales

602
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,800
and...

603
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,637
focusing on the story

604
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,473
about a company
that started to run a baseball club?

605
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,353
You'll be the CEO of a company
that took over the team

606
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,146
that was about to be disbanded.

607
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,608
And by doing so, you let
the league have ten teams.

608
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,362
Isn't it pretty cool?

609
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,490
If I've run my company to look cool,

610
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:36,204
my people wouldn't have been
able to work hard like now.

611
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,083
Looking cool is not everything,

612
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,293
but it'd be good news for your old friends

613
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,965
who must've been watching
your company somewhere.

614
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,383
Gosh.

615
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,259
Mr. Baek.

616
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,138
Watching your presentation,
things must be very urgent.

617
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,100
You even opened up my old wound.

618
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,768
Do you call it a successful persuasion?

619
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,104
Your strategy tells me

620
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,399
that you're still goal-oriented.
You know that, don't you?

621
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,823
Nevertheless...

622
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,243
if...

623
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:23,001
PF takes over the Dreams,
it's just a what-if scenario.

624
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,548
The Dreams would be...

625
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,969
disbanded first and then re-established.

626
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,972
THEN, THE TEAM IS REGARDED
AS A NEW TEAM WITH NO RECORDS.

627
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,851
PF has become one of the largest
web portals in the nation.

628
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,937
So I don't want my team to go
with the history of the bottom.

629
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,189
It'll be no longer the team
that has never won

630
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,400
the championship
since its foundation in 1982.

631
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,569
Instead, it'll have a new name.

632
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:55,199
For the existing fans of the Dreams
to be grateful for PF...

633
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,035
The only goal of investing

634
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,370
tens of billions of won plus
extra billions annually in it

635
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,289
is to promote the company.

636
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,208
No matter
if they feel grateful for PF or not.

637
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,009
NO FANS FORGOT THE HISTORY

638
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,177
Gosh.

639
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,097
Do you have the silk pouches
of Zhuge Liang or something?

640
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,724
Is there more?

641
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,145
Among the existing ten clubs,

642
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,440
there's only one team that was
disbanded and re-established.

643
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,108
The Sabers.

644
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,736
The Sabers, the champion,

645
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,321
became even a stronger team

646
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,239
with the full support
of the parent company

647
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,409
and the active communication
within the club.

648
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,411
Still, they have a concern.

649
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,163
Take a look at this.

650
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,915
THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF SPECTATORS

651
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,084
They're having trouble
attracting spectators.

652
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,212
They've won the championship
for years, but the number

653
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,963
of spectators is stagnant.

654
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,882
You shouldn't be taken in.

655
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,426
But the Dreams

656
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,388
have a lot of sincere fans
based on its home ground.

657
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,933
In 2014 when the Dreams took second place,

658
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,810
they got the most sellouts,

659
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,104
and the average attendance
number was the largest

660
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,605
among non-Seoul-based teams.

661
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,482
It means the Dreams have many fans secured

662
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,985
that are willing to come to watch
games if the team leads the league.

663
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,239
Many baseball fans often say this.

664
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,075
"The team really sucks,

665
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,203
but I can never support another team."

666
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,707
You know there are certain words
used to describe the Dreams.

667
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,709
I'm a businessman to the core.

668
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,378
I don't want such a reputation.

669
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,715
Just like you cherish PF,

670
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,342
there are many fans

671
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,470
who treasure the memories of the Dreams.

672
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,141
It's true that the Dreams lost the most.

673
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:48,938
But they won four out of ten games
on average over three decades.

674
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:55,444
The fans might not remember
if the Dreams won or lost in the game,

675
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,029
but some of them might still

676
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,907
remember the days he visited the stadium

677
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,286
with his father and had fried chicken
when he was little.

678
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,082
I'm not saying PF should take
the Dreams' image as the last.

679
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,334
I'm saying PF can imbue

680
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,712
the Dreams with
its entrepreneurship and passion.

681
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,300
I hope PF chooses the image of a company

682
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:22,972
challenging for a better future
instead of the best IT firm.

683
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,016
Please don't be fooled.

684
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,101
Gosh, you fell for it.

685
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,815
The Dreams...

686
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,777
won't be disbanded.

687
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,117
Thank you.

688
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,745
The takeover fee is
20 billion won, no more.

689
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,875
And it's your job
to cut the membership fee

690
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,335
to join the KPB to three billion.

691
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,670
Okay. It won't be easy,
but I'll do my best.

692
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,714
And the current staff of the Dreams
will remain.

693
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,383
And there will be no relocation either.

694
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,177
And...

695
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,640
I'd like to talk to Mr. Baek

696
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,391
alone.

697
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,955
There's a condition.

698
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,299
MARKETING TEAM LEADER

699
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,678
SCOUT TEAM LEADER

700
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,441
PRO BASEBALL CLUB, DREAMS

701
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,786
Hurray!

702
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,094
-Go, Dreams!
-Go, Dreams!

703
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:29,849
-Go, Dreams!
-Go, Dreams!

704
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,117
It's loud out there.
Why don't we join them and dance together?

705
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,205
You can just compliment me.

706
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,377
Why would you need my compliment?

707
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,130
You're all high and mighty.

708
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,675
It's not that I want your compliment.

709
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,054
It just seems like you're trying to
repress your urge to compliment me.

710
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,680
You got a smart mouth.

711
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,100
You never step back.

712
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,811
Never.

713
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,986
It's not so sweet that it's good.

714
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,757
Jae-hee.

715
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,511
Why do you call a guy
in another team so casually?

716
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,721
Get up, you punk.

717
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,268
I was going to get up. What is it?

718
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,315
Pack your stuff.

719
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,858
Sorry? Why?

720
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,610
There's no desk for you here.

721
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,987
I thought all of us will remain
in the Dreams.

722
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,407
Mr. Jang will come back

723
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,534
as the assistant chief
of the scout team soon.

724
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,828
-Then, what about me?
-You'd better

725
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,080
be prepared for a heavy workload.

726
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,624
Do I return to the operations team?

727
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,044
I can see you smile even from your back!

728
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,505
No way! What are you talking about?

729
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,967
I'm glad that I no longer have
to keep such a traitor in my team.

730
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,593
-Are you that happy?
-Of course.

731
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,182
Should I sit where I used to sit?

732
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,185
You can work like you used to.

733
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,188
But with some things, you shouldn't
deal with them like you used to.

734
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,148
You know that, right?

735
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,360
I just got here,
and you're already nagging me.

736
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,248
The prospects in college...

737
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,002
The prospects in high school...

738
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:04,962
You already have it.

739
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,094
What is it?

740
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,892
We used to get our monthly pay
in an envelope, instead of wiring.

741
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,685
My father went to...

742
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,771
his big brother's factory

743
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,940
and his big brother's baseball club.

744
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,611
The pay envelopes got thicker
as he started working there,

745
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,113
and he brought fried chicken

746
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,742
once a week, not once a month.
And I loved it.

747
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,077
Too much information.

748
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,458
Stop telling us old stories.
It's pathetic.

749
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,089
Kwon Kyung-min!

750
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,592
"I have to do as my older brother says."

751
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,306
That's what he used to say
on his way to work.

752
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,894
And one day, he said it'd be better
to work without his big brother,

753
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,230
and he cried.

754
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,773
Let go of this.

755
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,358
Let go of this.

756
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,984
Let me go!

757
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,530
Since then,

758
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,074
we had fried chicken once a month,

759
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,536
and the envelopes got thinner.

760
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,748
I couldn't understand why his pride
mattered so much.

761
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,792
I studied doggedly,

762
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,919
and I even kneeled with my father

763
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,755
to borrow my tuition from you.

764
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,882
Since when have you been so talkative?

765
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,135
Now I'm finally realizing
what my father figured out then.

766
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,556
You should never work with your family.

767
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,856
The interest is included
with the money I borrowed kneeling.

768
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,775
I can pay you as I'm standing.

769
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,737
Stop being rude to my father. Darn it.

770
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,043
Kwon Kyung-min!

771
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,173
You're quite courageous.

772
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,593
Don't let them know
that you're close to me.

773
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,928
I'm done with promotions anyway.

774
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,139
I'm only holding on until my retirement.

775
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,599
When is your daughter's wedding?

776
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,144
I told her to try and move up the date.
Do kids these days even listen?

777
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,312
They don't.

778
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,982
Are you going up soon?

779
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,151
-Yes.
-Just a moment.

780
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,079
May I see it?

781
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,706
Thank you.

782
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,584
Gosh.

783
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,002
My skin looks fine.

784
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,712
You have to go, Min-ho.

785
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,090
Yes. But you can hear crunchy sounds here.

786
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,176
I'd like to crunch you, Min-ho.

787
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,303
Yes. I'm sorry.

788
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,013
What is it for anyway?

789
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,515
There are a lot of cameras up there,

790
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,810
and I think she applied it
in case my face looks oily.

791
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,230
Min-ho, you're almost
like a celebrity now.

792
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,399
-Stick to your guns.
-Yes.

793
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,986
Actually, I wanted to look good
to Pengsoo.

794
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,112
And my grandmother.

795
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,866
-Who's Pengsoo?
-Peng?

796
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,618
Peng?

797
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,704
-Is it a celebrity?
-He's very hot these days.

798
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,874
He's the celebrities' celebrity.
Don't you know?

799
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,503
-Let's go. It's time.
-Yes.

800
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,213
Right.

801
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,298
Let's go.

802
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,175
-Go ahead.
-Pardon?

803
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,176
Yes.

804
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:40,969
Can I get some of that?

805
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,226
Now I will introduce

806
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,269
the players of the Dreams!

807
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,775
PF DREAMS INAUGURATION CEREMONY

808
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,737
PF DREAMS INAUGURATION CEREMONY

809
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,989
All right. Yes!

810
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,202
Pengsoo!

811
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,835
I will now interview the players.

812
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:16,004
-Everyone, Peng Hi!
-Peng Hi!

813
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,215
Gosh.

814
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,260
Wait. Don't you know my greeting?

815
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,137
Here's a compliment for you, Yoo Min-ho.

816
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,015
All the players of Dreams,
repeat after me. Peng Hi.

817
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,142
-Peng Hi.
-Peng Hi.

818
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,185
-Peng Hi.
-Peng Hi.

819
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,563
No, you have to put your hand up. Peng Hi!

820
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,856
-Peng Hi!
-Peng Hi!

821
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,150
No, put your one hand up, not both hands.

822
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,026
-Peng Hi!
-Peng Hi!

823
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,903
That's very good.
You can put them down now.

824
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,532
I'll ask you the first question now.

825
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,993
What are your thoughts
on the re-inauguration?

826
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,496
I'm overwhelmed, and my heart is full.

827
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,290
Since we're born again,

828
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:54,501
we'll do our best to show you
the new image of the Dreams.

829
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,921
What does the word "overwhelmed" mean?
I don't know well since I'm 10 years old.

830
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,424
-You get overwhelmed by--
-Okay, pass!

831
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,804
I'll move on to the next question.

832
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,222
The Dreams have been

833
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,600
in the last place until now, right?

834
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,102
Do you think you'll be able
to move up the ranking this time?

835
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,938
In this season, the Dreams are

836
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,358
-going for the championship.
-Please give it up!

837
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,905
The championship!

838
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,324
Go, Kang Doo-ki!

839
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,326
Go, Kang Doo-ki!

840
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,120
That was very cool.

841
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,664
Kang Doo-ki, when you say it,

842
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,583
it sounds you'll really win
the championship.

843
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,877
However, wouldn't the world

844
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,963
be a better place when people can
also clap for the team in the last place?

845
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,966
Yes!

846
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,972
This is a question I was
very curious about. Robert Gil.

847
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,642
-Yes.
-If I were to join the Dreams,

848
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,727
which position do you think I'd fit in?

849
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:58,440
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we won't
have a place for you in the Dreams.

850
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,276
Have some wits, Chang-ju!

851
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,543
Mr. Baek.

852
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,658
-What's wrong with her?
-She's fast.

853
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,326
Where are you going, Ms. Lee?

854
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,521
Mr. Baek.

855
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,233
Why did you take out all your stuff?

856
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,487
I have one condition.

857
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,448
In the employment buyout,

858
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,618
you will not be included.

859
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,078
Okay, good.

860
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,543
-Why don't you listen to my reason?
-Right. Yes.

861
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,214
We had a regular general meeting
of stockholders this morning.

862
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,508
There's opposition
against buying the baseball team.

863
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,971
I'm planning to persuade them again
on the social value

864
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,598
and the marketing effect.

865
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,477
Even if I fail to persuade them,
I can still push ahead.

866
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,853
But...

867
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,483
But it seems
that your extraordinary history is

868
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,320
a problem
to the conservative shareholders.

869
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,947
If I were to insist

870
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,992
on buying the team
and guaranteeing your post as well,

871
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,913
I'd probably be the only one
in the company.

872
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,458
I'm used to it.

873
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,004
I'm sorry. We'll see how the public
opinion goes in the future and--

874
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,923
Seeing that the weather is warm now,

875
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,425
the general manager's time has passed.

876
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,096
The coaches and the players will
do a good job now.

877
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,098
The decision you've made today

878
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,059
must have been a tough one for you.

879
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,521
It took a huge load off my mind.

880
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,484
I thought we'd get closer
while managing the team

881
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,111
through thick and thin.

882
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,322
Will you go out for a drink?

883
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,118
I do want to get close to you,

884
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,370
but I don't think I should
at the same time.

885
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,788
What is this feeling?

886
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,958
I also want to get close,
but I don't think I should.

887
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,293
So I decline your offer.

888
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,461
Gosh.

889
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,465
Mr. Baek, you're really charming.

890
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,346
We'll shake hands then.

891
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,396
I've been telling numerous players

892
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,107
that their time as athletes is over
until now.

893
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,360
It's something I could also hear
at any time.

894
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,112
I thought...

895
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,574
you could stay
if the parent company changed.

896
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,451
I'm okay.

897
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,578
Should I try to persuade them again?

898
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,663
No, he's busy.

899
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,916
And he's yielded so many things already.

900
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,517
It's over there.

901
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,269
I'm sure of it.

902
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,191
My dad often worked at construction sites,

903
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,360
but he didn't get paid for his work.

904
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,906
My mom was always frustrated.

905
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,993
But he said those people
had their reasons.

906
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,580
He just smoked cigarettes

907
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,999
and struggled inside.

908
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,128
But when he got money somehow,

909
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,631
he came to a ballpark

910
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,925
with me.

911
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,552
My mom wouldn't come,

912
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,596
so he dragged me instead.

913
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,516
But that day,

914
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,852
maybe he was really short on money.

915
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,981
He didn't buy me hotteok at the ballpark

916
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,691
unlike usually.

917
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,070
He watched the game speechlessly.

918
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,451
I didn't even get to ask him
for some hotteok.

919
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,581
The Dreams were
on their seventh defeat in a row.

920
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,167
But of all pitchers, the Titans sent

921
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,753
Choi Soo-won,
the most-wanted national athlete,

922
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,215
who was like Kang Doo-ki now.

923
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,928
All the teams

924
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,639
wanted to take three wins
against the Dreams,

925
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,226
so they sent good pitchers

926
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,727
on the mound.

927
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,439
It's cowardly to defeat
a weak team completely,

928
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,191
but it's an effective way.

929
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,443
Some men were yelling

930
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,697
to fire the manager.

931
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,741
It was a mess.

932
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,536
But then,

933
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,538
Um Sang Gu...

934
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,624
hit a home run worth three points.

935
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,629
Those middle-aged men who were shouting,

936
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,089
my dad,

937
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,757
and everyone jumped up and down

938
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,677
because of that one home run.

939
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,764
They cried...

940
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,726
as grownups.

941
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,980
It was a nice match.

942
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,232
The next day,

943
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,068
my dad went to his boss
who didn't pay him.

944
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,571
He grabbed him by the collar.

945
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,699
So did he get paid?

946
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,744
I'm not sure,

947
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,413
but I guess he didn't get the full amount.

948
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,082
I remember having braised tofu
for dinner that day.

949
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,169
You even remember the side dish?

950
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,546
Anyway...

951
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,717
I went to a ballpark again with my dad.

952
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,470
I ate hotteok during the game that day.

953
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,222
Sometimes

954
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,601
when it's hard working
for the backmarker team...

955
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,855
I look at that seat at the ballpark.

956
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,733
It becomes bearable then.

957
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,402
You've protected

958
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,530
such a place.

959
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,578
Won't there be any way

960
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,456
for you to stay?

961
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:15,835
I'm used to leaving like this.

962
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,715
It's the first time in my career
that my team will exist

963
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,468
even after I leave.

964
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,097
No one...

965
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,310
got to protect you this time either.

966
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,897
No, for me,

967
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:40,360
I'll remember it as a team
that I protected for the first time.

968
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,197
This will...

969
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,957
give me...

970
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,252
a lot of strength.

971
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,081
Hello, viewers. I'm Jung Woo-Young.

972
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,792
This will mark the best finale
of Korean professional baseball.

973
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,460
It's the 2020 Korean Series.

974
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,629
The Dreams and the Sabers
are up against each other.

975
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,006
The Sabers were the champions last year.

976
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,259
And the Dreams were the last.
The two teams are going to fight

977
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,886
an unprecedented match.

978
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,349
Hello.

979
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,517
-Hello.
-Hello.

980
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,352
-Hello.
-Hello.

981
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,062
Are you nervous, everyone?

982
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,024
Relax.

983
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,692
Jin-woo seems most nervous.

984
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,657
Guys. Are you going to make Jin-woo retire
without a victory ring?

985
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,200
We're not going to!

986
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,827
I haven't decided on retiring yet.

987
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,789
JANG JIN-WOO,
FIVE WINS, THREE LOSSES, 25 HOLDS

988
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,916
Kang Doo-ki, how's your condition today?

989
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,876
Great, sir!

990
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,878
KANG DOO-KI

991
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,256
KANG DOO-KI,
20 WINS, THREE LOSSES, 201 STRIKEOUTS

992
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,590
Gosh, that was loud.

993
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,801
You should become a vocal singer
when you retire.

994
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,594
Doo-ki.

995
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,180
We were strong against the Sabers.
I'm counting on you.

996
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,765
Sure.

997
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,434
Count on me already.

998
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,186
I'll do a great job leading our pitchers.

999
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,649
SEO YEONG-JU,
BA: 0.268, OBP: 0.327, SLG: 0.389

1000
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:25,817
Hey, Lim Dong-gyu.

1001
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,027
That drunk man shook the fence
and was dragged out.

1002
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,654
Really?

1003
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,364
That man should cut down on his drinking.

1004
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,242
LIM DONG-GYU, HOME RUNS: 17, RBIS: 60

1005
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,828
Sorry, Dong-gyu. Your foot.

1006
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,170
KWAK HAN-YOUNG, HOME RUNS: 20, RBIS:101

1007
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,212
Chang-ju.

1008
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,965
Why are you praying so hard?
You're up tomorrow.

1009
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,509
I prayed that we just win today.

1010
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,430
ROBERT GIL,
17 WINS, 6 LOSSES, 179 STRIKEOUTS

1011
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,308
Hello.

1012
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,102
Min-ho. Where have you been?

1013
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,021
I called my grandma.

1014
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,940
She thought I was playing today.

1015
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,402
YOO MIN-HO,
11 WINS, 7 LOSSES, 98 STRIKEOUTS

1016
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,945
-Hello.
-Hello.

1017
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,614
-Hello.
-Hello.

1018
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,990
-Hello.
-Hello.

1019
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,873
We've come this far. You know it, right?

1020
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:25,251
The Sabers are ranked the first
in this season.

1021
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,170
Who is the only team that defeated them?

1022
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,047
-Dreams!
-Dreams!

1023
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,175
Let's show them how determined we are!

1024
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,636
Dreams! Dreams! Dreams!

1025
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,221
All right, let's go!

1026
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,993
JANG JIN-WOO, LIM DONG-GYU

1027
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,414
Whatever I do, wherever I am,

1028
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,333
whatever I eat, or whatever I see,

1029
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,502
I'm good

1030
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,712
as long as I'm with you.

1031
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,424
During this season,
Kang Doo-ki has completely broken

1032
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,801
his image of being weak
against the Sabers.

1033
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,094
Against the Sabers,

1034
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:01,180
he has recorded
an average earned run of 1.31

1035
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,141
and become a Sabers killer.

1036
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,811
According to fans of the Dreams,

1037
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,647
there may be several teams
who could defeat the Dreams,

1038
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,858
but they are the only team
who could defeat the Sabers.

1039
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,819
The third batting.
Starting pitcher Kang Doo-ki

1040
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,238
has caught the starting hitter
with a grounder.

1041
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,323
One out.

1042
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:24,412
Kwak Han-young on the first base
keeps irritating the pitcher.

1043
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,832
Lim Dong-gyu is the hitter,
and fast Kwak Han-young is on the base.

1044
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,001
It must be a nightmare for the pitcher.

1045
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,921
Lim Dong-gyu hits the ball,
and it goes high toward the center.

1046
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:34,881
High!

1047
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,133
-High!
-It went over.

1048
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,260
-It's a home run.
-It went over the fence!

1049
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,095
He hits a home run
and marks the first score.

1050
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,680
He's impressive.

1051
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,849
I can tell he's determined

1052
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,018
not to let the Sabers seize this fall.

1053
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,827
Are you going to be there on time?

1054
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,623
-Yes.
-I told them that you're very rude,

1055
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:11,000
but good at work.

1056
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,043
They liked it.

1057
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,797
They might prefer someone who's only
good at work. What a shame for them.

1058
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,340
Mr. Baek.

1059
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,092
Yes?

1060
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:23,805
Are you sure you can do it?
You barely got used to baseball.

1061
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,056
But another sport?

1062
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,935
I'm not sure.
I might have to give it a go,

1063
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,395
but I'll do my best.

1064
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,315
Isn't it the same...

1065
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,026
for everyone?

1066
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:58,840
You may not be strong, but it's okay
because we'll help each other.

1067
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:01,175
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE JE-HOON, PENGSOO,

1068
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,261
LEE SOON-CHEOL, AND JEONG WOO-YOUNG

1069
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,571
THANKS FOR WATCHING.
