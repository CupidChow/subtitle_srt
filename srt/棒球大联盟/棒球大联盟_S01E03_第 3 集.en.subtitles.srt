1
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,533
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,868
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY

3
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,914
We're all waiting nervously to see
which players will be picked by the teams.

4
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,832
PARENTS' SEATS

5
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,168
The teams that will select
the first-year players

6
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,336
will be in the inverse order
of the teams' results.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,963
Accordingly, for the first round,

8
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,299
we will start with the Dreams.

9
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,802
Just like last year, the Dreams
have priority in choosing players.

10
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,263
We'll have to see which decision
they make.

11
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,348
We request a timeout.

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,896
The Dreams are asking for a timeout
selecting the first athlete.

13
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,606
This is not common to see.

14
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,025
Is it that they haven't settled
between differing opinions?

15
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,443
-Hey.
-Stop it, already.

16
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,197
There isn't much time left out of
the 30 seconds provided for the Dreams.

17
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,908
The Dreams will draft a player.

18
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,826
Myungil High School's pitcher,

19
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,704
Yoo Min-ho will be our selection.

20
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,248
Congratulations, Yoo Min-ho.
The Dreams, who have

21
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,751
requested for more time
in the first round of selections,

22
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,671
have selected player Yoo Min-ho
after a heated discussion.

23
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,716
His main weapon is his fastball.

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,719
The honor of being
the first player selected

25
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,930
goes to Yoo Min-ho!

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,284
Mr. Ko!

27
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,286
What are you looking at?

28
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,247
This apricot tree.

29
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,374
Are you interested in trees?

30
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,793
No, just in apricots.

31
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,504
These guys

32
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,548
prepare really hard

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,633
to blossom first in the cold.

34
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,720
They're just like us,
people working in baseball.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,391
We're the busiest in the winter as well.

36
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,101
Yes, I guess so.

37
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,770
You know that the staff
is eating out, right?

38
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,480
Everyone must attend.

39
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,774
We didn't have a welcome
ceremony for the general manager.

40
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,817
Okay.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,443
-We'll see you later.
-Okay.

42
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,656
My feet are cold.

43
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,075
Match your rhythm!

44
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,994
Attention!

45
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,500
Manager.

46
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,879
Please have a seat.

47
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,469
I came to give you a scolding.

48
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,475
Teams that do not have good results
usually go through rebuilding.

49
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,519
We have to pick young players

50
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,814
that can do better
in the next year or two.

51
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,482
We have to give them a chance.

52
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,319
But our team

53
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,280
has an average age of 31
among the players.

54
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,451
It's a team that's bad at baseball
and also without a future.

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,830
It had the priority in selecting
new players, getting last place

56
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,876
for several years, but all the players
it selected were lousy.

57
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,961
It hasn't been successful
in nurturing new players.

58
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,296
It's my fault.

59
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,298
My responsibility.

60
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,467
Please continue to make an effort.

61
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,848
Are you done?

62
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,229
Whose responsibility is it to choose
the ten new players each year?

63
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,481
I think I need to find out.

64
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,651
This goes for Lim Dong-gyu as well,

65
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,194
but you're only messing

66
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,447
with the stones firmly set in place.

67
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,742
I'm sure it was easier for you
to fire someone like me.

68
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,036
I'm sure stones set in place
have more moss.

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,373
I saw last year's video
of new players being drafted.

70
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,250
General Manager.

71
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,544
No one is here with a single purpose.

72
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,089
First-year player draft, an event
where teams choose new players

73
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,507
You can't be too trusting,

74
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,094
but you also can't be too suspicious.

75
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,428
Who knows?

76
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,581
It's nice.

77
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,045
-What is?
-The dugout for the home team.

78
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,131
Dugout, a team's bench
near the first and third base

79
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,424
At that time,

80
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,342
I just saw you go.

81
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,804
Forget everything else.

82
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,391
I just like the scenery from this angle.

83
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,351
I know

84
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,145
that you felt it was unfair, but--

85
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,148
From the visiting team's dugout,
you can't enjoy this scenery.

86
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,401
That was...

87
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,612
so unfortunate.

88
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,495
I want to continue doing well
as I enjoy the beautiful scenery.

89
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,961
What do you say to Korean beef
for company dinner tonight?

90
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,505
Don't consider your standards.
Go with something cost-effective.

91
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,548
Something cheap.

92
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,593
Shall we always eat pork?
We might turn into pigs!

93
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,887
-What's wrong with pork?
-Nothing.

94
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,929
Hello, I'm Kang Doo-ki.

95
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,768
Nice to meet you all.

96
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,574
It's my first time seeing
Kang Doo-ki this close.

97
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,369
He looks like someone who plays
baseball very well. Don't you think?

98
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,621
Korean beef.

99
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,039
Pork.

100
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,832
Pork.

101
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,834
Enjoy.

102
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,214
No matter how well I pitch,

103
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,466
I get criticized
at least six times a year.

104
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,635
People go, "What's wrong with him today?"

105
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,345
But this year,

106
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,597
I'll reduce that number to four.

107
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,224
And this year,

108
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,267
I don't feel any shoulder pain.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,187
That's why for the next season,

110
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,356
you should look at the big picture.

111
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,485
I'll get going.

112
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,863
Can you reduce it down to three?

113
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,079
You're Kang Doo-ki.

114
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,915
Reduce it to three, not four.

115
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,418
Okay.

116
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,400
Come in.

117
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,163
CHAIRMAN KWON IL-DO

118
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,377
I heard you calculated this year's
hotel management performance.

119
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,046
Yes. We still have a ways to go.

120
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,799
Listen.

121
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,887
If a person isn't a hole
that leaks money, I don't view

122
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,681
that person other than someone
who blocks it from leaking money.

123
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,977
Besides a smart person like you,
everyone else is a hole that leaks money.

124
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,980
How much are the team's deficits
from last year?

125
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,024
Last year, it was seven billion won.

126
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,401
Come on.

127
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,029
I heard you can't even sell it.

128
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,780
We've been trying each year,

129
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,825
but there is no major corporation
from our region, so it's not easy.

130
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,414
Then what should we do about this hole
that's leaking money?

131
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,251
I will break it up
by the end of this year.

132
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,252
Listen.

133
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,963
We started in this region,

134
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,382
and with the supermarkets,
franchises, and restaurants,

135
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,343
50 percent is in here.

136
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,428
Do you know what that means?

137
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,846
Yes.

138
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,016
That means even a kid
could boycott our company.

139
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,519
Make sure people aren't offended.

140
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,062
I'll slowly begin the process.

141
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,149
I set up a company to not care
about what others thought.

142
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,653
But I have to mind what
all these ordinary people think.

143
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,779
Darn it.

144
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,282
Do you like baseball too?

145
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,411
No, I don't.

146
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,790
TURN OFF

147
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,459
Let's go out to eat!

148
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,795
Let's go out to eat!

149
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,964
Let's go out to eat!

150
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,967
-What about the general manager?
-He said he'd go on his own.

151
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,884
He did?

152
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,146
Wait. The general manager hasn't arrived.
Should I call him?

153
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,398
Yes, call him.

154
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,358
-Tell him the location...
-Don't worry.

155
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,359
That was startling.

156
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,864
You came early.

157
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,330
Wasn't it for 7?

158
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,876
I guess we're the late ones.

159
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,088
Why are you sitting there?
You should sit in the middle.

160
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,257
You all should come in.

161
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,925
Everyone should sit comfortably.

162
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,386
-Will you sit around here, sir?
-Yes.

163
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,140
Come in and sit.

164
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,018
-Hello!
-Hello.

165
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,061
Please come in. Can you sit over there?

166
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,355
-No, I'll sit here.
-Okay.

167
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,065
The scout team can sit here.

168
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,233
Let's sit down.

169
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,779
I'm sick of pork.

170
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,449
-I want some raw fish.
-Manager, you're here!

171
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,701
-Hello!
-You're here!

172
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,751
Manager, please have a seat.

173
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,796
Will all the coaches come and sit as well?

174
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,298
Please sit down.

175
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,344
I think everyone's here.

176
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,602
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but please pay attention.

177
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,189
General Manager Baek
will make some remarks.

178
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,857
A round of applause!

179
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,822
I'm General Manager Baek Seung-soo.

180
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,202
I have no intention to disparage
what you've done so far

181
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,745
because of the team's low standing.

182
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,789
However...

183
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,124
we do need changes.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,543
Now Lim Dong-gyu is gone,

185
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,629
and we have Kang Doo-ki instead.

186
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,424
Whatever is good for the team,

187
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,967
I'll do it.

188
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,639
And if there's anything that's
deemed to be bad for the team,

189
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,599
I'll get rid of it.

190
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,729
We'll keep doing what we've done
and try new things simultaneously.

191
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,523
I'd like to kindly ask
for your cooperation.

192
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,674
That was as serious
as a declaration of war.

193
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,509
It was.

194
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,761
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes?

195
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,847
-Let me fill your glass.
-Thank you.

196
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,349
Let me introduce myself once again.

197
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,310
I'm Byun Chi-hoon, the team leader
of Public Relations.

198
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,353
Okay.

199
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,314
The press is all eager to interview you

200
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,400
about what happened behind the curtains

201
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,819
when we traded Kang Doo-ki.

202
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,071
-Is that so?
-Yes.

203
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,198
-Would it...
-Would it...

204
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,284
-be hard...
-be hard...

205
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,786
-for you to do an interview?
-Yes, it'd be hard.

206
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,413
I see.

207
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:33,836
Then, I'll ask Kang Doo-ki directly.

208
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,853
What is he doing?

209
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,397
I don't know.
Maybe it's for his social media.

210
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,399
As a young man, I can explain.

211
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,443
Taking photos of food before digging in

212
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,905
is like a ceremony
to express our condolences

213
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,281
toward the food.

214
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,408
What is that?

215
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,077
Look how serious he looks,
then you'll believe me.

216
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,250
Mr. Ko.

217
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,255
Mr. Ko Se-hyuk.

218
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,469
Mr. Ko.

219
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,025
Yes? What?

220
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,154
Mom, I'll call you later.

221
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,824
What's wrong with you?

222
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,993
Just get out of the way.

223
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,914
-Please sit down.
-Thanks.

224
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,082
It hurts so bad.

225
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,917
I just didn't realize you were here.

226
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,962
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Thank you.

227
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,383
The manager is old,

228
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,134
and the former general manager was old,

229
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,719
and I'm old as well.

230
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,638
It was just full of old men.

231
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,474
But now with young blood,

232
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,434
it's full of vitality.

233
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,520
Full of vitality

234
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,901
How could he think of dancing there?
He's such a genius.

235
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,863
He's very sociable.

236
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,489
Scouting team leader just fits him.

237
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,867
I'm pretty sociable too.

238
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,785
Well,

239
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,371
you got here thanks to connections,
yet got this close to me.

240
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,789
You are very sociable.

241
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,166
So, can you please transfer
to the scouting team?

242
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,211
I feel very shy now.
Please don't talk to me.

243
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,924
I wish I could smash you into pieces.

244
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,509
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,138
By the way,
is Yang Won-sub not here today?

246
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,685
Why do you ask about him?

247
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,855
I just asked because
he's the only one not here.

248
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,274
Won-sub is a bit busy with other things.

249
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,612
-Call him.
-It's all right. I'll call him.

250
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,824
I also wanted to ask you
if you have any suggestions

251
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,410
-regarding our team management.
-Suggestions...

252
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,663
It'd be nice if we had dinner
together more often.

253
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,374
I was just joking.

254
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,463
There's just one thing we'd like to ask.

255
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,593
We take care of all the amateur players

256
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,679
from middle schools to colleges,

257
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,724
and we even know their
pitching styles and characteristics.

258
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,978
And if we are fired

259
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,064
or transferred to another team,

260
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,733
we'll hand over all the data we collected

261
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,444
for a smooth transition and then leave.

262
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,615
But the written data doesn't...

263
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,661
contain everything, especially
the information in our heads.

264
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,746
For example,

265
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,165
the expectations we have
for the young players

266
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,875
or our feelings toward them.

267
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,837
It's just a little suggestion.

268
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,131
I see.

269
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,677
So, you're saying the members
of the scouting team

270
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,929
must not be transferred
to other teams, right?

271
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,848
Oh, if that's how you understood
what I said.

272
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,061
Well, you can interpret it that way.

273
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,024
I'll think about it and also figure out

274
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,444
if that was a suggestion or an arrogation.

275
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,489
Why don't we make a toast?

276
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,032
Sure.

277
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,452
We have a lot of members here.

278
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,122
Sit down. It's okay.

279
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,375
-Are you enjoying dinner?
-They seem to be.

280
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,461
Did we just spoil the mood?

281
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,005
No, sir.

282
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,297
Please have a seat here.

283
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,425
-Excuse me. We have two more!
-It's okay.

284
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,635
We would just pay the bill and leave,

285
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,721
but we came in after hearing big laughter.

286
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,889
I also wanted to laugh out loud with you.

287
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,975
Let me join you for a while.

288
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,101
Sit down.

289
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,732
You two were having a conversation?

290
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,443
-Yes.
-Did you get to know each other?

291
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,694
Well, yes.

292
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,531
I didn't think you two would
have a private conversation.

293
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,952
Mr. Ko is a man
with a great sense of responsibility.

294
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,329
I've been a fan of his
since he was a player.

295
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,248
Honestly,

296
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,127
he deserves a better position
than his current one.

297
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,336
Don't you think so?

298
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,049
So, I asked him if he could
be the team manager.

299
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,264
He said the scouting team leader
must not be replaced too often,

300
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,851
and he thinks his current position
is more important than the manager.

301
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,728
Isn't it really touching?

302
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,024
I was very impressed.

303
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,779
If we all do our best in our own places,

304
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,656
-things will work out well.
-Give it up for him.

305
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,242
-A round of applause!
-Come on!

306
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,874
-That was great.
-Awesome.

307
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,293
Let's give it up!

308
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,670
Unbelievable.

309
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,881
Louder!

310
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,681
-See you later.
-Goodbye.

311
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,308
Actually...

312
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,688
-the manager was with us too.
-I know.

313
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,273
He must have

314
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,819
heard it too when you said
you offered Mr. Ko...

315
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,446
the team manager position.

316
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,578
I see.

317
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,665
He heard it.

318
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,252
Okay. I get it.

319
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,677
So what?

320
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,804
Why did you say that to him?

321
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,764
I thought he didn't realize that.

322
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,019
I'm sure you wouldn't feel stressed
because you never bite your tongue.

323
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,651
MEAT VILLAGE

324
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,659
What's gotten into him?

325
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,497
President Ko.

326
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,875
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

327
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,712
I just took it lightly and left,

328
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,464
but it keeps bothering me.

329
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,343
Did Mr. Baek just try...

330
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,348
to lecture me there?

331
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,350
That is...

332
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,187
It's just my misunderstanding, right?

333
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,980
Yes, I think so.

334
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,902
Baek Seung-soo isn't that foolish.

335
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,572
Then what kind of a guy
do you think Baek Seung-soo is?

336
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,325
-According to his career...
-Forget it.

337
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,202
Do you think he's an obedient man?

338
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,081
"I never back off
even though I have no power at all.

339
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,375
I stick to my own principles."

340
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,837
It'd be fine as long
as he's not that kind of guy.

341
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,423
Those who think like that
always end up beaten.

342
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,884
I like it so much.

343
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,388
They just give up so easily
as soon as they're put to the test.

344
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,733
Sir, you know how I think about you.

345
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,571
-It's all right.
-I'm not even qualified.

346
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,823
He only mentioned it in passing,

347
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,242
so don't mind it.

348
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,910
Why wouldn't you be qualified?

349
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,791
I'm barely in the position of team leader.
I don't even want to be the manager.

350
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,168
We get it. Now stop it.

351
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,547
-What?
-Chul-min.

352
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,800
-Stay out of this.
-What?

353
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,053
He came in here and said something
the director didn't even mean.

354
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,389
You're gabbing on and on here.
Are you enjoying this?

355
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,641
He's just trying
to resolve a misunderstanding.

356
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,434
What's wrong with you guys?

357
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,396
-You stay out of it, you scumbag!
-Quiet!

358
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,483
Fine.

359
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,901
Since we're at it,

360
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,114
has the scout team ever drafted
a player that does his part?

361
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,534
What are you doing
with all those priority draft rights?

362
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,077
Are you boiling soup with those?

363
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,706
Where do you keep finding
those degenerates?

364
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,834
So, you kept losing all those games

365
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,461
to secure the priority draft rights,
is that it?

366
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,882
So, have you ever trained a good player
properly when we brought one?

367
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,386
They say our team is a graveyard
for rising stars.

368
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,346
-Haven't you read the news?
-Hey!

369
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,603
So, are you the one that gets blamed
for the team's rank?

370
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,815
At least we take responsibility
and criticism. Did you know that?

371
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,526
You little scumbag...

372
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,614
That's enough!

373
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,244
The fault is on all of us
when we're in last place.

374
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,371
Who did their jobs well?

375
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,916
Isn't this more embarrassing
than being ranked last?

376
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,049
Dinner's over, right?

377
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,304
All right, I'll be leaving then.

378
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,071
Come on.

379
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,721
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

380
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,517
I accidentally opened up this file.

381
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,853
But there are terms
that you wouldn't understand.

382
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,730
You can ask me if you don't understand.

383
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,359
-What terms?
-Well, baseball terms.

384
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,744
I've made a slip of the tongue.
I meant the statistical terminology.

385
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,038
You have a computer in your own room.

386
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,040
Sorry.

387
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,386
WINS ABOVE REPLACEMENT OF ROOKIES
FROM 2015 TO 2019

388
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,644
LEE MIN-YOUNG, OUTFIELDER,
YESUNG HIGH SCHOOL

389
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,778
You were drinking a lot last night.

390
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,405
Please forget about it.

391
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,952
-Hello, Mr. Baek.
-Hi.

392
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,080
I'll see the operations team in my office.

393
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,833
Yes.

394
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,210
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

395
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,298
I watched the draft video from last year.

396
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,717
Were there any internal
disciplinary actions taken?

397
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,635
No.

398
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,347
So, there was no problem?

399
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,640
No.

400
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,101
No, but Mr. Ko was very upset.

401
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,604
He turned a blind eye to it
by saying it was his fault

402
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,272
for not teaching his junior.

403
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,565
I see.

404
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,734
The player that Mr. Ko
was planning to pick

405
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,986
was Lee Chang-kwon,
the rookie of this year.

406
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,029
Am I right?

407
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,698
Yes.

408
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,879
Yes, this is Baek Seung-soo.

409
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,757
Please send the scout team
to my office now.

410
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,009
DREAMS PITCHER, YOO MIN-HO

411
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,470

412
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,190
Did you get home safely last night?

413
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,650
Yes.

414
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,736
The league gives a priority draft pick

415
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,905
to the team that places last
in the previous year

416
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,157
so that they can do better.

417
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,951
So, I've always wondered.

418
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,539
We place last every year
and get the priority draft pick.

419
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,667
Why couldn't we ever pick
the Rookie of the Year?

420
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,671
That kind of hurt.

421
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,715
It shouldn't hurt just for you.

422
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,385
It's hurting all of us in the Dreams.

423
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,433
So, what happened last year?

424
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,981
The Dreams have the priority draft pick
as they did last year.

425
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,400
Which player will they select?

426
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,944
This is impossible, isn't it?

427
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,365
You can easily predict which team
will take which player in the first round.

428
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,409
We request a timeout!

429
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:21,121
I know that most of the teams
don't request a timeout.

430
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,875
We even had the first draft pick
of the first round.

431
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,628
You could have just called out
the name of the best player.

432
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,964
Why did you call a timeout?

433
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,553
Look.

434
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,599
You should ask Won-sub why
he didn't follow the leader's decision.

435
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,976
Yes, where is he?

436
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,312
This is what I get upset about with him.

437
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,441
The scout team has a plan as a group.

438
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,652
But no one knows
exactly where and what he's doing.

439
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,115
TEAM LEADER KO SE-HYUK,
ASSISTANT CHIEF JANG WOO-SEOK

440
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,950
Won-sub went to work.

441
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,286
And he's a rational person.

442
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:06,666
That's why he couldn't accept
the fact in that brief moment

443
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,545
we'd be changing who we draft
after discussing it for a long time.

444
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,007
In that brief moment,

445
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,135
what is the reason you changed
your mind to draft Lee Chang-kwon

446
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,013
instead of Yoo Min-ho,
who you were decided on for a long time?

447
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,308
Because Lee Chang-kwon
is the better player.

448
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,434
On what basis?

449
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,436
He's the Rookie of the Year,

450
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,356
-Lee Chang-kwon.
-Why are you telling me the outcome

451
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,067
when I'm asking about the process?
You had predicted

452
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,570
that Lee Chang-kwon would be
the Rookie of the Year.

453
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,155
What was your reasoning?

454
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,326
I saw Chang-kwon swing the bat
right before the draft.

455
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,578
So I couldn't draft Min-ho.

456
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,248
But I'm not saying it's Won-sub's fault.

457
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,836
The fault is mostly on me
for not being able to persuade him.

458
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,758
All right. I'll talk to Won-sub too.

459
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,301
Mr. Baek,

460
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,762
is this a disciplinary procedure?

461
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,805
That's enough.

462
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,265
Doesn't this make you upset?

463
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,350
This is...

464
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,395
Come on.

465
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:09,979
Mr. Baek,

466
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,233
if you see Won-sub, please ask him.

467
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,486
Ask him why he tried
to send him to the Major League

468
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,029
right before the draft

469
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,199
if he liked Yoo Min-ho so much.

470
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,827
Major League?

471
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,133
I get it. We'll talk again
when Won-sub gets here.

472
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,512
If there's a problem...

473
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,725
I'll resign from my post.

474
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,521
Yes.

475
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,399
That's if there is a problem.

476
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,495
That was a year ago.
Are you holding him responsible?

477
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,207
Yes. Why shouldn't I?

478
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,669
That happened
before you started your post.

479
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,464
Some might think it's inappropriate.

480
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,717
Rather than penalizing him
for what happened a year ago,

481
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,970
I'd like to make sure
it won't happen again

482
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,848
by looking back on something
that was swept under the rug.

483
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,726
There might be a lack of justification,

484
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,395
or it might not be easy for them
to understand, as it's complicated.

485
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,149
You brought Doo-ki to our team
as soon as you got here.

486
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,026
I admit that was great.

487
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,488
But some could remember you as the person

488
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,657
who kicked out Dong-gyu,
who had played for us for 11 years.

489
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,744
Mr. Ko is someone who has his roots
deep down in our team.

490
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,370
-And you would...
-Ms. Lee.

491
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:50,955
Yes.

492
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,041
Do you trust Mr. Ko?

493
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,459
Yes, I do.

494
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,754
-I've known him for a long time.
-Is that all?

495
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,759
So you think he's not a person
who'd do that without confirmation, right?

496
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,803
Do you call that trust?

497
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,305
You're just being vague
and remaining as a spectator.

498
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,393
As soon as I try to make sure,

499
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,728
I'll doubt him.

500
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,942
I'd rather trust the years I've known him
than uncertain grounds.

501
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,529
Have you ever thought of making
certain those uncertain grounds?

502
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,156
Haven't you ever been doubted before?

503
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,075
Did it feel good at the time?

504
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,788
I'd rather make sure
by being doubted myself

505
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,416
than work with someone unprincipled
and who has no doubts.

506
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,044
If you're not ashamed of anything,

507
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,673
there's no need to be offended
or be afraid.

508
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,058
Hello, Mr. Yang Won-sub?

509
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,686
I'm Baek Seung-soo,
the new general manager of the Dreams.

510
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,688
Right. Hello, General Manager.

511
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,772
Where are you now?

512
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,025
I'm near Wondong-gun Office right now.

513
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,986
I wasn't able to greet you.

514
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,280
-But I'm kind of busy right now.
-No, that's not it.

515
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,614
Let me call you back.

516
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,449
-Hello?
-I'm sorry.

517
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,492
Mr. Yang...

518
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm going on a business trip.

519
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,585
To where? Are you going to see Mr. Yang?

520
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,046
Yes. I'm going to check so I won't doubt.

521
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,007
Nice.

522
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,178
He got better.

523
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,571
Who are you?

524
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,785
What are you writing down?

525
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,581
I guess your office is near here.

526
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,502
Do you know a bit about baseball?

527
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,879
Here.

528
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,341
How long do you think it'll take
for the batter to be on first base?

529
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,760
-About five seconds?
-It takes 4.3 seconds

530
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,762
for the right-handed,
4.2 seconds for left-handed.

531
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,474
If you look, you can tell
who's going to be a professional.

532
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,518
Do you know why?

533
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,562
Because they're fast runners?

534
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,024
Well, you can say that.

535
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,194
That says that they have
a great motor nerve.

536
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,572
But that's not everything.

537
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,909
What about the other players
who've been called out?

538
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,285
That's it.

539
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,498
Some players at least make it
to first base before they get out.

540
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:24,043
They try their best to hit
a single on their next at-bat.

541
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,461
Come on. Run faster!

542
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,048
And those are the players
who do well in a professional league.

543
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,342
Because they put in the effort.

544
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,261
But I've got to say...

545
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,597
that this is just my opinion.

546
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,403
Oh, come on.

547
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,864
Hey! Excuse me.

548
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,826
Why do you let him throw a slider?

549
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,620
Take care of your players!

550
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,248
Also, didn't he keep pitching yesterday?

551
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,126
I've seen him pitching for four innings.

552
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,419
Listen carefully.

553
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,464
Even during the practice game,
if you don't obey the rules,

554
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,259
-I'm going to report you right away.
-This is a total wacko.

555
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:18,389
Why do you care about whether
he throws a slider or curveball?

556
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,061
He may be your player for now,
but he'll be my player later on!

557
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:29,817
-Didn't you say you were taking that guy?
-Him and him! I'll take both of them!

558
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,868
You'd better stop loafing around.

559
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,747
-Aren't you going back to your office?
-Why do you work so hard?

560
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,248
It's my job.

561
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,585
That's not what I meant.
Why are you so eager to butt in?

562
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,841
They're going to be on my team.
You don't call that butting in.

563
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,551
Mister.

564
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,805
What you're doing right now is butting in.

565
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,099
Go away. Just go!

566
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,227
Don't talk to me.

567
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,666
He needs to fix his head to the ball.

568
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,627
For Pete's sake!

569
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,131
Which team are you from?

570
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,966
Geez.

571
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,266
Are you not connected to baseball?
So, why do you keep disturbing me?

572
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,600
Just go, please.

573
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,730
Gosh, that idiot.

574
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,151
Do you put sesame oil
on your hands before batting?

575
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,487
If you grab the bat,
squeeze it until the end!

576
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,322
Goodness.

577
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,869
Darn, the pitcher is being
driven too hard again. Hey!

578
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,706
He needs to be in the Major League
later on!

579
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,541
Why won't you

580
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,585
-protect your players?
-How old are you?

581
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,253
My age has nothing to do with this!

582
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,254
-You little...
-What?

583
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,424
Go ahead if you have something to say!
You've got to take care of his shoulders!

584
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,467
-How old are you?
-That's not important here!

585
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,468
Are you older than me?

586
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,428
Come here!

587
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,387
Let go!

588
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,055
Let go of me!

589
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:27,018
What I'm saying is
you have to protect his shoulders!

590
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,644
Mr. Baek,

591
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,522
if you see Won-sub, please ask him.

592
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,275
Ask him why he tried
to send him to the Major League

593
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,529
right before the draft
if he liked Yoo Min-ho so much.

594
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,916
Mom.

595
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,085
Teacher.

596
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,340
What is so entertaining
for you to not even

597
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,258
look at your precious daughter?

598
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,053
They're looking for their teachers.

599
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,224
How nice.

600
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,685
Mom.

601
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,523
Do you remember
Ms. Jeon Jung-sook from middle school?

602
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,691
Yes. Why?

603
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,194
Come to think of it,

604
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,114
I think she was the teacher
I respected the most in my life.

605
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,199
What do you mean?

606
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,912
I used to goof around with my friends
and hated studying back then.

607
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,123
But Ms. Jeon once said to me,

608
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:38,506
"You're a much better person
than you think."

609
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,263
She even gave me a workbook
so I wouldn't give up on math.

610
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,517
What?

611
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,853
-What's up with your face?
-It was worth the price I guess.

612
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,564
-The price?
-I gave her money.

613
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,067
You did? Why?

614
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,530
It was worth it, so forget about it.

615
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,411
She wouldn't have been nice to you
if it hadn't been for the money.

616
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,291
That's just...

617
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,043
totally ridiculous.

618
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,254
Did you give her much?

619
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,923
Not really.

620
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:26,095
If you didn't give her much,
you should've never told me!

621
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,682
You've completely ruined my memory.

622
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,937
A lot of people used to do that back then.

623
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,441
Geez.

624
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,401
Stop with the nonsense.

625
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:04,467
So, you think he's not a person
who'd do that without confirmation, right?

626
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,427
Do you call that trust?

627
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,679
You're just being vague
and remaining as a spectator.

628
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,440
Where are you going? Hey!

629
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,157
What are you doing?

630
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,992
Didn't you go home?

631
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,203
I've got something to do.

632
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,913
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

633
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,498
Do you need my help?

634
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,086
Please hand me the list of players
drafted during the last five years.

635
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,253
Sure.

636
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:06,946
Who is it?

637
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,823
Hello, miss.

638
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,033
Mr. Yang!

639
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,285
Welcome. Please come in.

640
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,122
Come in.

641
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,301
THE LIST OF NOMINATED PLAYERS

642
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,640
Ms. Lee, I just sent you
the list of new players.

643
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,641
Okay.

644
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,647
Yes, this is Han Jae-hee
of the operations team.

645
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,399
Yes.

646
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:44,984
Right.

647
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,319
Yes.

648
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,405
Okay.

649
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,664
Ms. Lee, it seems like Yoo Min-ho's
chronic injury relapsed.

650
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,999
I'll go to the hospital.

651
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,379
I should go there instead.

652
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,797
But you happen to be busy.

653
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,300
I happen to be busy?
Do you have a death wish?

654
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,259
All right, I'm sorry.

655
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,220
What I'm working on is not urgent,

656
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,181
but I just feel pressed. Sorry.

657
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,017
You don't need to make an excuse.
I'm leaving.

658
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,858
THE DREAMS' DRAFTED PLAYERS
FROM 2015 TO 2019

659
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,028
What is this?

660
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,752
What is this?

661
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,426
Thank you, sir.

662
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,595
You're welcome.

663
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,597
-Don't worry.
-Say thank you.

664
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,599
It's all right. Don't worry.

665
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,184
Please take care, sir.

666
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,144
Who are you really?

667
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,730
What did you do in that house?

668
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,401
-Which franchise are you from?
-What?

669
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,821
-Which club are you from?
-Dreams.

670
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,489
-What?
-Dreams.

671
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,325
I'm General Manager Baek Seung-soo
who called you earlier today.

672
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,410
That's me.

673
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,707
SUJEONG INN

674
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,834
Please come inside.

675
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,503
Come on in.

676
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,423
Gosh. I should've cleaned up.

677
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,972
-Please come in.
-You don't have to do it now.

678
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,769
What do we earn by persuading him
not to go to college?

679
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,398
If the rumor that he'll go
to college spreads,

680
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,483
he won't be drafted,
no matter how good he is.

681
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,528
Then we can scout him.

682
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,530
That's how it works.

683
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,828
Anyway, I apologize for my harsh actions.

684
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,166
Tell me about last year's
first-year player draft.

685
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,543
Sorry?

686
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,184
Goodness. You didn't go home yet?

687
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,062
I just have a lot on my plate.

688
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,731
I see. It's not easy, is it?

689
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,987
-I'll go pick up the phone.
-Go ahead.

690
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,117
Yes, this is the Dreams.

691
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,536
Yes.

692
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,455
Sorry?

693
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,123
Nam-gu Police Station?

694
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,335
Mr. Ko Se-hyuk?

695
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,755
I admit it. He's great.

696
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,216
I even went to see him play

697
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,052
and checked the data over,

698
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,389
but I never thought of
choosing him in the first round.

699
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,515
Really?

700
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,351
So, was drafting Yoo Min-ho a good choice?

701
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,354
Of course. But what was unfair for me is

702
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,981
that Mr. Ko also had Yoo Min-ho
in mind at first.

703
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,983
Then, I was very convinced

704
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,528
because we both had the same idea.

705
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,115
Please take a look at this.

706
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,616
If you look at this,

707
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,411
it has his peer relationship
and how he controls his mind

708
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,620
in the dugout and field.

709
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,747
I checked how many times
he got injured by body part,

710
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,083
and even how many times
he changed his cleats.

711
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,380
There's no one who changed
his cleats more often than him.

712
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,091
-Why?
-Since he worked harder than anyone.

713
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,803
So, do you not regret
not drafting Lee Chang-kwon?

714
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,138
Do I regret it?

715
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,849
Lee Chang-kwon...

716
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,728
He's a good player too.

717
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,522
But Yoo Min-ho is the one
with the greatest potential

718
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,191
among the players I've seen so far.

719
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,570
He's not going to play baseball
just for a couple of years.

720
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:44,199
I might be fired all of a sudden,
but he'd get better and better.

721
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,827
I'm sure of it.

722
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,540
Hello? Please send me the address
of the hospital.

723
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,333
I'll be right there.

724
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,127
Okay.

725
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,005
I should get going now.

726
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,424
Thank you for coming all the way here.

727
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,023
Let go of me.

728
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,065
POLICE

729
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,444
Can a professional baseball player
do this?

730
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,445
Of course not.

731
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,280
Never ever.

732
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,532
We'll do our best
so that it won't happen...

733
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,951
Do you think I'm worried about your team?

734
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:33,791
-He beat me. What are you going to do?
-Until you recover completely,

735
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,126
-we will...
-Enough is enough.

736
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,672
What's wrong with you? Be quiet.

737
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,553
Sorry I'm late.

738
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,096
-Sir.
-Yes.

739
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,975
Hello. It must hurt a lot.

740
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,102
-Who are you?
-I am...

741
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,813
Hold on, please.

742
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,361
I'm the person who looks after him.

743
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,073
I checked the dashcam
and all the security cameras.

744
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,617
It looks bad though.

745
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,661
Was there a dashcam?

746
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,831
Of course, it's the newest version
with 4K resolution.

747
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,625
-It shows even the pores on your face.
-I see.

748
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,589
Lee Yong-jae! You...

749
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,592
I don't care that he hit you first.

750
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,428
Of course, hitting someone first
is not right.

751
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,682
Still, you're a professional player.
You can't get into such a fight!

752
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,309
-That's what I'm saying!
-You...

753
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:35,853
Stop it.

754
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,232
By the way,

755
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,734
you should settle it out with him.

756
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,361
You know,

757
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,530
the public wouldn't blindly criticize him

758
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,824
just because he's a baseball player.

759
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,077
These days, they'd rather withhold
judgment

760
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,371
until they see the CCTV footage
and things are clear.

761
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,875
And in the worst case,
they might find out who you are.

762
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:02,087
I know a guy who had to get plastic
surgery four times because of that.

763
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,381
He no longer looks Korean now.

764
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,258
Here comes our lawyer. Here.

765
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,428
-It's him.
-Okay.

766
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,182
We all make mistakes

767
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,018
when we're drunk.

768
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,317
Does it hurt?

769
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,611
Of course it does.
You're pressing him too hard.

770
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,487
Please be a bit more gentle.

771
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,368
Right. That looks like it hurts.
Press it gently.

772
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,245
You're here.

773
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,415
-This is our general manager.
-I see.

774
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,003
I said it's too early, didn't I?

775
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,382
Both his high school team and the pro team
think about their own interests only.

776
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,884
PITCHER YOO MIN-HO OF DREAMS

777
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,469
I didn't even pitch that much.

778
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,220
Everyone else does the same.

779
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,891
At least, that's what I think.

780
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,061
You pitched both in the President's Cup
and in the Phoenix Championships, right?

781
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,479
How long have you had the issue?

782
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,314
Since the end of the President's Cup.

783
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,066
It's your greed

784
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,944
that destroyed this young guy's arm.

785
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,781
You should be x-rayed today.

786
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,243
-Are you okay?
-I am.

787
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,168
PAIN TREATMENT CENTER

788
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,172
Mr. Baek.

789
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,092
It'll take about 20 minutes.

790
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,051
Okay.

791
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,688
I think I heard you don't
really know about baseball.

792
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,148
Right. I still don't know about it.

793
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,070
Right. I saw you

794
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,823
reading a book about baseball
at dinner the other day.

795
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,366
I see.

796
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,079
So, you don't care what others
think about you at all?

797
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,331
What do you mean by that?

798
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,667
Don't get me wrong.
I never thought this way.

799
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,294
But others were laughing at you,
saying you're learning baseball

800
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,963
through books.

801
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,718
If I don't even read books being
scared of what others think,

802
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,136
who will teach me about it?

803
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,513
Should I just sit and wait
until others come to teach me?

804
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,099
If I still don't know anything
about baseball a year later,

805
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,851
wouldn't it be even more embarrassing?

806
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,104
Well, that's right.

807
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,108
You know I joined
through my connections, right?

808
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,526
Is that true?

809
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,153
What do you mean?

810
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,447
I don't think
that's why you were accepted.

811
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,283
The written test wasn't leaked
beforehand or anything.

812
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:37,701
It wasn't.

813
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,328
Wasn't Ms. Lee one of the interviewers?

814
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,414
She's not such a lax person, is she?

815
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,751
She's not. She's never been a slack.

816
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,463
Then why do you tell people you were
hired through the connection?

817
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,507
Because you're the son of
the chairman of Jinsong Furniture?

818
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,218
It's just...

819
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,388
when people hear
about my family background,

820
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,058
they ask me if I'm working as a hobby.

821
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,895
But this is the first actual job
I've ever had.

822
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,647
So I couldn't say no with confidence.

823
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,150
I don't think you're working as a hobby.

824
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,529
If you were, you wouldn't be
the person to go home last.

825
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,657
How did you know that?

826
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,161
Why wouldn't you request payment
when you've worked overtime?

827
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,623
You still have to claim your right
even if you're rich.

828
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:31,755
Mr. Baek.

829
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,716
The author of the book you were reading
wrote a new book.

830
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,760
Would you like to borrow it?
I finished it already.

831
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,012
No, I'll buy my own book.

832
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,431
Sure.

833
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,770
You're right. That sounds better.

834
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:50,315
NAM-GU POLICE STATION

835
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,192
I apologize.

836
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,986
Why did you do it?
You should have held back.

837
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,989
He asked why I'm so good at drinking
when I'm terrible at baseball.

838
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,783
He kept trying to pick a fight.

839
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,994
Well, he was just laying out facts.

840
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,708
When did you have time
to watch the security camera?

841
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,877
Did you see him punch me first?

842
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,588
We didn't see anything.
It was too obvious.

843
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,465
About the reporters...

844
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,426
Don't worry. I know all of them in there.

845
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,972
I can't ask you not to drink,

846
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,141
but if there's a quarrel,
please leave the place.

847
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,392
Yes, sir.

848
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,185
I appreciate it.

849
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,937
Thank you very much.

850
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,689
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

851
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,651
No more causing trouble
in the Dreams, all right?

852
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,529
Cause problems in another team
if you have to.

853
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,446
Yes.

854
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,909
Hey.

855
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,579
How's your mother?

856
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,331
-Yes.
-Tell her I said hello.

857
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,126
-I will.
-And...

858
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,838
don't go anywhere else.
Go straight home, okay?

859
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,756
-Okay?
-Yes.

860
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,883
Geez.

861
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,050
Go.

862
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,774
Do you also know the mothers
of our players?

863
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,775
Of course.

864
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,404
If a player is short,
you should see his mother.

865
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,156
If his mother's tall,

866
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,326
then I'll know he still has time to grow.

867
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,744
It's something like that.

868
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:32,125
When you pick a player,
what do you judge him on?

869
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,586
First of all, it's the physique.

870
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,631
If he has a nice build,

871
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,966
then I'll see how he is as a person,

872
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,135
-and how diligent he is.
-I see.

873
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:47,515
But among the players you've selected,

874
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,770
wouldn't it be difficult to say
that Lee Dong-sik

875
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,314
and Nam Ki-hyun have the best physiques?

876
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,945
You must have had your standards.

877
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,866
But some people were wondering
why you drafted some of the players.

878
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,204
There are a lot of temptations
for a scout, you know.

879
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,666
When you hear something like that,

880
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,834
it must really hurt your feelings.

881
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,838
-Se-young.
-Yes.

882
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,049
What are you doing?

883
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,135
Pardon?

884
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,638
Even though I won't be praised,

885
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,266
I don't want to be doubted.

886
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:32,978
Pull over.

887
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,781
DAEHAN JEIL HOSPITAL

888
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,075
Why did you come back so early?

889
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,452
You didn't even fully recover.

890
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,538
You drafted me in the first round.

891
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,916
I wanted to earn my keep.

892
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,003
Before we get the result of the scan,
stay away from even running.

893
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,255
I'll go home then.

894
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,759
Did you meet Won-sub yet?

895
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,261
I did.

896
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,389
Have you met Won-sub?

897
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,017
I see.

898
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,227
He and I are very close.

899
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:20,317
I appreciate what he did,
but he's so irresponsible, isn't he?

900
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,777
He even argued with my manager that time.

901
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,822
He was worried I might hurt my elbow.

902
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,491
I didn't have that many records
in my third year in high school

903
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,577
because the manager wouldn't let me play.

904
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,831
So Won-sub came and grabbed
the manager by his collar.

905
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,342
-Mr. Baek.
-I'm going on a business trip.

906
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,969
-I have a lot of reports, though.
-Later.

907
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,013
It's about Mr. Ko.

908
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,975
Yes, I'll listen to you when I'm back.

909
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,269
Mr. Baek.

910
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,730
Can I come with you?

911
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,441
-Did you finish your job?
-I finished everything except

912
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,361
what I need to do during the weekend.
I sent the files through Messenger.

913
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,823
Sure. You can come to the parking lot.
I'll see you later.

914
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,618
I'll see you later.

915
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,203
You...

916
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,040
What on earth...?

917
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,963
Don't you have to stop by the rest area?

918
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,257
It seems that Bongeun Rest Area here has

919
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,135
the best sausages and fried rice cakes.

920
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,556
Won't you protect your players?

921
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,768
Even during the practice game,
if you don't obey the rules,

922
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,103
I'll report you right away.

923
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,272
You can't do that if you know
what's important here.

924
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,442
No, it's not like that.

925
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,236
It's not like I have to eat it.

926
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,239
I was just worried
you might not have eaten.

927
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:52,158
I'm fine. It's bearable. I mean it.

928
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,285
Mr. Ko Se-hyuk?

929
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,121
I admit it. He's great.

930
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,748
I even went to see him play

931
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,750
and checked the data over,

932
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,254
but I never thought of choosing him
in the first round.

933
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,965
Is he fooling me,
or is he fooling himself?

934
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,341
No!

935
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,136
I would never fool you. I'm full.

936
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,013
I've eaten a lot. I'm really okay.

937
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,438
Mr. Baek. What's going on? Hold on.

938
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,983
I wanted to go to the bathroom.
No, wait. Help me!

939
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,945
There isn't much time left
out of the 30 seconds

940
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:32,740
-provided for Dreams.
-The Dreams will draft a player.

941
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:37,370
Myungil High School's pitcher,
Yoo Min-ho will be our selection.

942
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,958
Congratulations, Yoo Min-ho.

943
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,336
The Dreams, who have requested for more
time in the first round of selections,

944
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,339
have selected player Yoo Min-ho
after a heated discussion.

945
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:05,565

946
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,112
Welcome.

947
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,405
Hello.

948
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,492
-This table is warmer.
-Okay.

949
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,537
-Is it just you?
-Yes.

950
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,331
I'll order mine first.

951
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:22,665
Okay.

952
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,543
-I'll have this one.
-Sure.

953
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,796
-One pork rib soup!
-Your son is...

954
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,133
Lee Chang-kwon, right?

955
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,721
-Do you know Chang-kwon?
-Of course.

956
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,015
He's very famous.

957
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,559
You must love baseball.

958
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,812
I'm also in the baseball industry.

959
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,648
What do you do?

960
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,033
Hello, ma'am.

961
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,787
I'm the operations manager of the Dreams,

962
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,914
Lee Se-young.

963
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:06,251
OPERATIONS MANAGER LEE SE-YOUNG

964
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,640
LEE CHANG-KWON'S MOTHER

965
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,642
You know who Ko Se-hyuk is,

966
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,185
right?

967
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,734
Hello.

968
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,153
Thank you so much for last time.

969
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,446
No, please take it.

970
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,323
Thank you again.

971
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,976
This is not what it looks like.

972
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,854
-You're mistaken about this envelope.
-That's not the right answer.

973
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,314
Am I being insulted now?

974
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,108
I've been hearing a negative rumor.
How much did you give?

975
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,318
I said I don't know. Just go.

976
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:58,321
Let's say I do something that tarnishes
the reputation of the Dreams...

977
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,490
I came to report something to you.

978
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,450
Mr. Ko Se-hyuk. Mr. Yang Won-sub.

979
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,619
The penalty will be applied.
Shall we start?

980
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,329
Why do you keep
planting your apple tree

981
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,289
on the earth
that will go to pieces tomorrow?

982
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,875
Our goals are quite high.
Let me schedule a business trip.

983
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:11,876
Let's go.
