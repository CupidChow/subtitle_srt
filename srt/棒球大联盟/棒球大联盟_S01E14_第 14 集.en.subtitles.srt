1
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,575
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND ANY ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,076
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,753
Good.

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,010
Mr. Kang Doo-ki.

5
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,558
I'm going to throw you

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,978
-a tough question.
-Go on.

7
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,106
Can we bring in...

8
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,692
Lim Dong-gyu?

9
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,322
It's not a tough question at all.

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,867
Even if I don't give up any runs,

11
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,163
our team needs to score runs
for me to become a winning pitcher.

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,670
Lim Dong-gyu can play
only from late summer to fall.

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,965
Autumn Dong-gyu...

14
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,303
That's the Lim Dong-gyu we all know.

15
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,440
Hello, I'm Operations Manager
Lee Se-young.

16
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,652
The reason I asked you all here today

17
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,154
is to discuss a trade.

18
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,492
-What about it?
-Have a listen.

19
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,119
Again?

20
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,371
It's not a major trade this time, is it?

21
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,374
There are too many things
to be cautious about,

22
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,459
so it's better to manage
the trade secretly.

23
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,379
But Mr. Baek did not do so.

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,382
When we traded Lim Dong-gyu
for Kang Doo-ki,

25
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,885
he persuaded us
of the necessity of the trade.

26
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,680
Why is she making us all nervous again?

27
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,267
So I gathered you all here
to persuade you once more.

28
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,727
The manager has already agreed to this,

29
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,231
but rather than telling you to agree
because the general manager

30
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,941
and the manager said so,

31
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,069
I wanted to persuade you all
by sharing some information.

32
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,445
I'll begin.

33
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,873
THE REASON WE NEED
TO BRING BACK LIM DONG-GYU

34
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,296
THE REASON WE NEED
TO BRING BACK LIM DONG-GYU

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,051
So,

36
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,180
you didn't come to apologize?

37
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,099
No, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,477
I lost my pitchers

39
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,439
and Lim Dong-gyu can only play
half the season.

40
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,277
-You knew about it, didn't you?
-Yes.

41
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,906
How shameless.

42
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,949
You did know?

43
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,702
To be honest,

44
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,245
when you came to me

45
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,166
saying that you'd help us
knowing my team's situation,

46
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,960
I thought that even though
it's a competition,

47
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,547
there was some comradeship between us

48
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,924
aiming to compete

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,052
in good faith.

50
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,515
That's why I came to make you
an offer, general manager.

51
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,725
A trade.

52
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,185
Geez.

53
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,146
Since I've been conned once,
you want me to be conned again?

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,067
No. It was a trade I prepared
as a way of compensation.

55
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,694
You saw on your way here.

56
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,365
Our fans were protesting
and telling the team to break up.

57
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,784
Only my team has been

58
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,244
caught with both doping

59
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,704
and gambling abroad.

60
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,708
I consider it unfortunate.

61
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,919
You just came to laugh

62
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,921
at the owner of the store

63
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,882
as the store is closing up, aren't you?

64
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,509
No.

65
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,220
As a way of taking moral responsibility,

66
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,806
we will be taking back Lim Dong-gyu.

67
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,474
Look at this guy.

68
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,978
Then, will you return Kang Doo-ki?

69
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,438
-It's not that.
-Then?

70
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,609
Is there another Dreams player
that I can swap with Lim Dong-gyu?

71
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,280
Did the general manager accept?

72
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,615
The general manager and I
are on the same page.

73
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,827
The presentation he gave a while back

74
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,454
was the reason why we should
"let Lim Dong-gyu go."

75
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,582
What was the reason that

76
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,335
we were persuaded by in the presentation?

77
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,837
It was Kang Doo-ki.

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,130
Yes.

79
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,590
You all were persuaded by the idea

80
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,761
that we'd be bringing in Kang Doo-ki
in exchange for Lim Dong-gyu.

81
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,221
But...

82
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:11,519
what if we can bring back Lim Dong-gyu
without sending off Kang Doo-ki?

83
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,523
Go on.

84
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,858
Let's listen.

85
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,776
First...

86
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,905
as you all know, Lim Dong-gyu's record

87
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,825
lands in the top three nationwide.

88
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,120
But if we don't compare the record simply
and find a different...

89
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,706
We all know that Lim Dong-gyu plays well.

90
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,625

91
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,087
If we're going to get him back,
we need a player to trade off.

92
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,508
It's Kim Kwan-sik.

93
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,011
Listen.

94
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,847
When you say you'll take
moral responsibility,

95
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,224
shouldn't my team benefit from this?

96
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,145
How does your common sense
differ this much from mine?

97
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,814
There's one more player.

98
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,775
Tell me. Who is it?

99
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,069
It's Kim Kwan-sik

100
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,237
and Yeon Joong-sub.

101
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,534
Yeon Joong-sub?
So we're going to trade off Yeon Joong-sub

102
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,912
who's called "Little Lim Dong-gyu"
and Kim Kwan-sik

103
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,831
in order to bring in Lim Dong-gyu,
who can't even play half the season?

104
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,503
This is the first time I disagree
with the general manager.

105
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,713
I check my players a lot,

106
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,550
and Yeon Joong-sub is showing a lot
of potential to become huge.

107
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,511
He can grow as big as Lim Dong-gyu.

108
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,055
He's young and doesn't have
to worry about his military service.

109
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,265

110
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,310
because its batting
and outfield defense was weak.

111
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,271
And the player we're bringing in

112
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,484
isn't "Little Lim Dong-gyu"
or a player that will get big.

113
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,155
He's Lim Dong-gyu himself.

114
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,783
I'm sure you'll need some time
to think about it.

115
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,329
Still, he's Lim Dong-gyu.

116
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,624
I know that Kim Kwan-sik and
Yeon Joong-sub are rising stars.

117
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,585
I know they'll grow to be big.

118
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,172
But it's still Lim Dong-gyu.

119
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,843

120
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,681
Kim Kwan-sik could become
a reliever even if he joined today.

121
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,352
You should be well-aware that
unlike last year,

122
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,439
he's had no injuries this year
and his condition has gotten better.

123
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,901
And with Yeon Joong-sub,
he's the future of our team.

124
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,531
They say his outfield defense is
much better than that of Lim Dong-gyu.

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,451
His hitting is becoming that of a slugger.

126
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,119
He's truly a rising star.

127
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,582

128
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,377
Yeon Joong-sub is the perfect present
we can offer you.

129
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,673
There goes your crafty tongue again.

130
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,053
I was aware of Lim Dong-gyu's wrongdoings.

131
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,681
But I thought that
if I kept my mouth shut,

132
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,100
there wouldn't be any problems.

133
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,063

134
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,524
from the Dreams.

135
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,986

136
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,072
Kim Kwan-sik and Yeon Joong-sub
will have grown a lot

137
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,241
and will be the pivotal players
in your team.

138
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,952
And also, Lim Dong-gyu

139
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,040
can't play half the season
because he gambled abroad.

140
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,542

141
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,962

142
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,300
What about the Dreams?

143
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,721
What about the Dreams' fans?

144
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,767
Will they accept Lim Dong-gyu?

145
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,730
He's the unfortunate fourth batter

146
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,233
who used up his youth in a team
that always got last place.

147
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,070
If Lim Dong-gyu's to get a second chance,

148
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,572
that would only come
from the Dreams' fans.

149
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,285
Why are we aiming for win-now?

150
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,162
REORGANIZING THE TEAM
FOR IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT

151
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,706
Because we're trying to get
good results this year.

152
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,668
Isn't it a bit hard this year?

153
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,587
Sending off young players
like Kim Kwan-sik and Yeon Joong-sub

154
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,632
to get Lim Dong-gyu will be a failed trade

155
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,801
unless we have a plan to win.

156
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,221
Well,

157
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,016
who do you think is the best batter
in the country?

158
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,522
It's the Sabers' Kim Won-jae.
Fourth batter of the national team.

159
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,649
Yes, of course.

160
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,278
But what if we say
for the last five years, instead of three?

161
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,240
Has it not been long since

162
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,410
-Kim Won-jae played well? Who is it, then?
-I'm sure it's still Kim Won-jae.

163
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,330
Then, what if I say
for the past seven years?

164
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,626
It's Lim Dong-gyu.

165
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,295
Right.

166
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,047
When we're talking
about the past seven years,

167
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,716
Lim Dong-gyu is extraordinary.

168
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,471
He's always delivered more than
20 home runs with BA over .300,

169
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,224
and has recorded an average 80 RBIs.

170
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,020
He's also shown quite an impact
as a valuable player several times.

171
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,731
Great. I think it's great.

172
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,943
But Lim Dong-gyu isn't good in the summer.
He plays well only in the fall.

173
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,404
I'm sorry to tell you this, but...

174
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,282
No way!

175
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,201
...we're going to be playing
in the postseason this year.

176
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,078
No matter what.

177
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,705
And especially in the fall,

178
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,709
we need a batter that

179
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,669
becomes a monster.

180
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,923
But beyond all this,

181
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,927
do you think Lim Dong-gyu would
gladly come back to our team?

182
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,555
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable
for Kang Doo-ki?

183
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,016
Our team has already become
the team of Kang Doo-ki.

184
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,729
We even made the Doo-ki Dog
instead of Lim Dong-gyu Burger.

185
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,814
It comes with three different sauces.

186
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,985
If he doesn't play 100 percent,
we also won't need him.

187
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,239
We'll have to bring him

188
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,909
when he's desperate.

189
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,079

190
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,164
of great pitchers when they had nothing,

191
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,252
I'm sure you can turn the team
into the fiercest again in two years.

192
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,048
I'll be waiting.

193
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,803
If you make up your mind about the trade,
please call me.

194
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,441
He's talking like his team is
already playing in the postseason.

195
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,610
Seriously.

196
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,031
Jae-hee.

197
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,577
Do well.

198
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,840
Oh, boy.

199
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,967
I was excited to have
a new employee on my team,

200
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,468
but your mind is somewhere else.

201
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,929
Pardon me?

202
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,223
Ms. Lee will do a good job
even without you.

203
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,101
Yes.

204
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,186
I'm the one who needs you, all right?

205
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,565
-Yes.
-Good.

206
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,900
Come somewhere with me.

207
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,194
-Pardon?
-Hurry up.

208
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,655
-Hurry.
-What...

209
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,866
Hurry where? Where are we going?

210
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,626
-Hello.
-Hello.

211
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,712
-You look in shape.
-Thank you.

212
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,630
-Watch out for injuries.
-Okay.

213
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,300
They're college athletes.

214
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,676
Do you come here often?

215
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,428
No, not that often.

216
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,930
Teams don't sign college players often
these days, do they?

217
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,640
You're right.

218
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,392
Our team also doesn't sign them.

219
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,854
Do you know why?

220
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,606
it must be because most talented players

221
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,233
are signed by professional teams
when they graduate high schools.

222
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,610
You have passed.

223
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,737
And once they graduate after four years,

224
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,865
it'll be burdensome for the teams
to sign players with age.

225
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,659
Jae-hee. You've passed in second place.

226
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,621
What do I have to do
to pass in first place?

227
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:12,666
Now, the college players
are student athletes,

228
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,126
so they have to study too, right?

229
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,711
If they have to study too...

230
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,213
The training time decreases,

231
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,509
and the value that the college players
can add to our team goes down too.

232
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,760
Exactly.

233
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,178
So why are we here?

234
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,138
-I told you the reason.
-When?

235
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,266
The scout of a professional team
has to come and watch them properly.

236
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,434
Why?

237
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,273
How sad would it be when you
have to work for something

238
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:41,320
-when no one is ever watching you?
-You still have your humanist in you.

239
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,823
What did Mr. Baek say?

240
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,867
He said, "I don't work with humanists."

241
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,912
We still have a job to do.

242
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,833
I think watching college baseball is
part of our job. Nice pitch!

243
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,377
-Hey!
-It was a nice pitch.

244
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,171
But isn't it more efficient for us
to focus on high school baseball?

245
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,591
Our team needs players that we can
put to use right away anyway.

246
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,178
We should keep our eyes
on both high school baseball

247
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,639
and college baseball.

248
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,475
Is it because our team is weak?

249
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,228
To be precise,

250
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,857
it seems that Mr. Baek and Ms. Lee
are getting hasty.

251
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,325
Thank you!

252
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,703
It seems like they're feeling chased,

253
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,998
and I feel like we have to get
good records quickly.

254
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,544
-Hello.
-How have you been, coach?

255
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,170
I'm doing great thanks to you.

256
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,882
I really appreciate you
coming by every time.

257
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,051
Park Byung-hyun's pitching has
gotten much better.

258
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,428
It has.

259
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,014
We dealt with his balance
and he's a lot better.

260
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,600
Please keep an eye on him
for later in the future.

261
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,564
By the way, is the manager of the Dreams
being replaced this time?

262
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,024
Pardon me?

263
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,776
What do you mean?

264
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,571
I shouldn't have said that.

265
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,991
No, you've done the right thing.
What are people saying?

266
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,329
Then make sure you keep it a secret,
Mr. Yang.

267
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,959
Well, he's my right-hand man.
He can listen too.

268
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:19,919
Yes.

269
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,838
It's probably a rumor.

270
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,466
A match-fixing broker was
arrested recently,

271
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:31,221
and Manager Yoon Sung-bok's name seems
to have come up.

272
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,683
But if there's no problem with him,
it must be false.

273
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,686
It wouldn't be any trouble.

274
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,362
GENERAL MANAGER KIM JONG-MOO

275
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,956
Mr. Park.

276
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,249
How have you been?

277
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,336
Well, I'm dying here.

278
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,423
There was the incident
regarding Lim Dong-gyu too.

279
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,300
Anyway,

280
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,805
since Lim Dong-gyu wasn't even
on our team in the first place,

281
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,224
I'm not sure if we have to keep him.

282
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,184
Yes. You're right.

283
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,105
So I'm thinking of trading him,
but it's not that easy.

284
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,899
Yes, I'm discussing it.

285
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,112
I can't tell you which team it is.

286
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,655
Well,

287
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,324
I'll just say it's a team
not in the capital.

288
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,283
Right. Mr. Park,

289
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,328
make sure not to write a story
about this, all right?

290
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,247
Okay.

291
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,669
What about others?

292
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,504
Were they agreeing with it?

293
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,842
They were curious
about why we're aiming to win

294
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,343
the championship all of a sudden.

295
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,471
However, they know the influence
of Lim Dong-gyu.

296
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,224
So they agreed that it's better to
sign him to strengthen our team now

297
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,227
-instead of the future.
-Good. That's a relief.

298
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,022
But the general manager has
the right to trade players.

299
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,232
Why do you always ask
for their permission?

300
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,237
Think about how everyone reacted
when I said I'd trade him away.

301
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,906
You all swarmed in front of my office.

302
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,620
I was just trying to stop them
at the time.

303
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,084
I'm doing so because I want everyone
to know and understand my plan.

304
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,587
You must have had no faith in me.

305
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,673
You know that we feel
different now, right?

306
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,551
Then we could make things easier.

307
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,179
Now that I think about it,

308
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,431
it's been a long time.

309
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,059
A lot of things happened along the way.

310
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,729
Don't get too sentimental yet.
We still have a lot of work to do.

311
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,773
And we don't have much time.

312
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,073
What I meant was that we don't
have enough time

313
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,200
compared to the work we have left.

314
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,747
You're not having second thoughts,
are you?

315
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,624
Second thoughts?

316
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:07,419
These days, you talk as if you'll
disappear all of a sudden.

317
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,213
Where would I go?

318
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,964
Since we've gotten quite close...

319
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,010
I'm not sure if we have,

320
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,222
but I think we've gotten familiar
with each other.

321
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,434
But you look like someone who's always
ready to leave.

322
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,230
Where would I go with the Dreams
in this mess?

323
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,397
Right?

324
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,275
The Dreams is still in a mess.

325
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,195
Yes, so stop having
those useless thoughts.

326
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,947
You should work hard instead.

327
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,406
Yes.

328
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,914
Mr. Baek, have you seen the news?

329
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,835
-No.
-I feel a bit uneasy.

330
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,641

331
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,989
This is Oh Sa-hoon.

332
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,161
You must be devastated, general manager.

333
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,463
There you are. Have a seat.

334
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,549
It's been a while, Mr. Baek.

335
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,393
Mr. Oh Sa-hoon called me.

336
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,645
He needs Lim Dong-gyu.

337
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,067
Why would the Pelicans need him
when you have no connection with him?

338
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,487
Well, by the rule of negotiations,

339
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,824
I wouldn't have to tell you that
I desperately need Lim Dong-gyu.

340
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,242
But as you know,

341
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,661
I'm forthright by nature.

342
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,082
We need Lim Dong-gyu very much.

343
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,710
Why?

344
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,836
You must know.

345
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,673
Two players of the Sabers were caught.
And we have one player who got caught.

346
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,092
You should be ashamed to have
at least one player do drugs.

347
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,677
I wouldn't recommend celebrating.

348
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,387
I haven't celebrated.

349
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,350
But the Sabers lost a fifth-string player

350
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,268
and a back-up outfielder.

351
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,563
Our team lost a rookie
of little importance.

352
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,233
I'm sure you can guess.

353
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,861
We're the only team who has
a chance to beat the Sabers now.

354
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,867

355
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,955
but considering the existing records
and the leakage in strength,

356
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,124
our team or the Sabers will
win the championship.

357
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,418
We need Lim Dong-gyu
and his strong batting

358
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,713
-against the Sabers.
-That's amusing.

359
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,090
We have the same reason.

360
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,218
What do you mean?

361
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,387
No one got caught in our team,

362
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,431
and we need Lim Dong-gyu
to fight against the Sabers.

363
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,186
Are you joking now?

364
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,479
No, I'm not.

365
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,941
And who needs him more isn't the problem.

366
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,070
We should make a suggestion
that better satisfies Mr. Kim's needs.

367
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,073
Mr. Baek is quick
to understand the situation.

368
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,158
Right.

369
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,202
I'm putting Lim Dong-gyu up
for open auction.

370
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,248
The Dreams suggested
Kim Kwan-sik and Yeon Joong-sub.

371
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,170

372
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,464
Quite?

373
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,300
You mean, "Think ahead."

374
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,887

375
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,348
even though they may not be able
to aim for the championship.

376
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,603
I suggest the number five pitcher
Yoon Sang-min,

377
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,565
who had eight wins last year,
and the key outfielder

378
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,650
Ko Chang-hyun.

379
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,069
Yoon Sang-min and Ko Chang-hyun

380
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,280
might play better

381
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,866
than Kim Kwan-sik
and Yeon Joong-sub this season.

382
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,953
Yoon Sang-min is 34 years old,
and Ko Chang-hyun is 33.

383
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,955
Of course, they're nice players.

384
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,625
But they don't seem competitive

385
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,628
enough to give up
on our two promising players.

386
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,342
That is your problem.

387
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,056
In a giant sport called baseball,
there are only 10 spots

388
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,974
for managers and general managers.

389
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,227
You don't know how precious
a general manager position is.

390
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,688
What do you mean?

391
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,816
You don't have to put it this way.

392
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,487
It could be desperate
for someone, Mr. Baek.

393
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,156
Please continue.

394
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,533
If you were to join
a negotiation like this,

395
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,328
you should think about

396
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,581
what the other general manager
needs desperately

397
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,124
instead of trying to fool him.

398
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,127
His term ends this season.

399
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,421
Goodness.

400
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,966
It's not his fault,
but the biggest number of players

401
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,552

402
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,596
Will he be able to stay in office

403
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,390
if the team fails to play
in the postseason?

404
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,849
There are already so many people

405
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,352

406
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,106
Is that how you've seen Mr. Kim?

407
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,277
What do you mean?

408
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,988
Oh, nothing. I'll stop here.

409
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,284
Or Mr. Kim might say again
that I have a crafty tongue.

410
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,583
Let's not delay this any longer.

411
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,796
Right.

412
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,342
Mr. Oh is right. My term ends this year.

413
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,430
So, I don't want to be humiliated.

414
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,516
This year, I won't go for the postseason.

415
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,934
What...

416
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:00,397
I'll take promising players like
Yeon Joong-sub and Kim Kwan-sik

417
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,566
and win after two years.

418
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,445
Whether I stay or not,
that's the right thing to do.

419
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,491
Mr. Baek.

420
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,411
Let's trade. Take Lim Dong-gyu.

421
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,874
-Okay. I hope it's a win-win.
-Gosh. Drop that nonsense.

422
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,460
Mr. Kim.
Sir, you need to go for the fall season.

423
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,962
You don't know much
about Mr. Kim's records.

424
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,342

425
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,636
He sent off good batters.

426
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,639
He recruited promising pitchers,
which caused a lot of criticism.

427
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,476
He was almost fired.

428
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,396
With a pitchers' kingdom he made like that
in 2014 and 2015,

429
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,732
he led his team to win two times in a row.

430
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,775
Forget it.

431
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,028
I became a traitor in this field.

432
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,448
Let's stop talking about nonsense
and just proceed with the trade.

433
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,956
He worries about the team's future
more than his safety.

434
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,834
You shouldn't make a suggestion
that applies to someone

435
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,628
who cares only about his position.

436
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,755
Please excuse me then.

437
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,759
Thank you.

438
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,362
Lim Dong-gyu!

439
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,333
You forgot to include "mister" there.

440
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,046
-Do you want my autograph?
-Yes, let me have your autograph.

441
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,677
BAEK SEUNG-SOO

442
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,071
Dong-gyu.

443
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,742
Aren't you going to take this?

444
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,372
It's the bat you use to play against
Kang Doo-ki. You got this sponsored.

445
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,416
You can keep it.

446
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,252
Really?

447
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,427
-Hey.
-Yes?

448
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,886
Give it to me.

449
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,396
Don't think about relying
on something like this...

450
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,399
and practice properly, you punk.

451
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,805
I hate the Dreams.

452
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,015
DREAMS

453
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:25,727
-I said I hate the Dreams.
-Okay.

454
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,943
Anyway, Joong-sub and Kwan-sik
left the team.

455
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,279
Kwan-sik was so excited to leave.

456
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,531
If we see him this season,

457
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,575
make sure you hit his balls
with all your might.

458
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,827
-Okay?
-Yes, sir!

459
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,372
And about Joong-sub,
give him some comforting words

460
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,623
if you were close to him.

461
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,542
-He left all excitedly too.
-Hey, pitchers.

462
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,797
When you're up against him,
make sure you throw with all your might.

463
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,881
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

464
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,967
And as you already know,
Lim Dong-gyu is joining us.

465
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,848
You guys all know what he's like.
Don't be fussy and be natural around him.

466
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,685
As if he has never changed teams.

467
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,023
Yes, sir.

468
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,240
It hurts so much.

469
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,954
Good work, guys.
Each of you take this and cheer up.

470
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,622
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

471
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,708
Have some.

472
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,000
RED GINSENG EXTRACT

473
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,995
JANG JIN-WOO

474
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,886
Darn it.

475
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,682
Dong-gyu, Lim Dong-gyu

476
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,559
Welcome!

477
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,436
Goodness.

478
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,444
The coaches told us not to make a fuss.
You little punks.

479
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,488
You put us in shock,

480
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,490
so you should let us do this much.

481
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,700
You're throwing a temper tantrum
as soon as you arrive.

482
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,285
Hey. Put your head on the floor.

483
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,414
-Like this?
-Hey.

484
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,957
On the floor, I mean!

485
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,210
-Okay, I will.
-Gosh.

486
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,714
I wondered
why the place reeked of the sea.

487
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,466

488
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,385
-Well?
-Are you serious?

489
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,804
Jin-woo.

490
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,139
I'm part of the Dreams down to the bone.

491
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,267
What took you so long?
Did you row all the way here?

492
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,271
This punk is hopeless.
Let's teach him a lesson!

493
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,318
-Wait! Hold on.
-Dong-gyu, Lim Dong-gyu.

494
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:26,908
-Dong-gyu, Lim Dong-gyu
-Dong-gyu, Lim Dong-gyu

495
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,212
Anyway,

496
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,758
would it be really okay
to release an article

497
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,969
about this contract
without the president's approval?

498
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,849
Tell him I'm to blame.
I did this without letting anyone know.

499
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,894
The president actually has

500
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,313
nothing he can do about me.

501
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,149
Okay. See you tomorrow.

502
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,165
I can't believe this is the way
you do your job.

503
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,586
Without my permission,
you released an article with the title,

504
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:24,549
"Lim Dong-gyu Is Coming Back."

505
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,468
CONTRACT BETWEEN THE DREAMS
AND LIM DONG-GYU

506
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,388
So you're telling me I must sign this
if I don't want any backlash.

507
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,515
I'd like to apologize for this time.

508
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,143
For this time?

509
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,398
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Baek.

510
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,276
Don't you remember?

511
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,571
I approved of the trade deal
between Lim Dong-gyu

512
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,491
-and Kang Doo-ki, didn't I?
-Yes.

513
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,119
I also gave you an okay
when you fired Ko Se-hyuk.

514
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,164
-Yes.
-I even let you scout

515
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,458
Robert Gil with a $900,000 pay deal.

516
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:02,003
Actually, it was 500,000, but you did.

517
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,423
I also promised to pay you
your full annual salary when you quit.

518
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,759
But you came back and told me
you'd work only until spring

519
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,303
saying you wouldn't need
the rest of your salary.

520
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,305
Listening to what you said,

521
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,183
it feels like you're a good guy
while I'm the bad one.

522
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,517
What's wrong with you?

523
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,856
-I give you as much as I can, but you...
-We will...

524
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,152
never be able to understand each other.

525
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,284
You love to stick to the principles.

526
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,245
And shall I tell you why I can't
approve of this?

527
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,622
What is it?

528
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,836
We signed a 1.2-billion won contract
with Lim Dong-gyu

529
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,424
and sold two players who
we needed to pay only 0.3 million.

530
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,638
I'm sure you cannot afford the difference.

531
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,601
Isn't the amount too big
to just ask me to pay this easily?

532
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,355
You like rationale, don't you?

533
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,653
I have a reason
not to approve of this trade.

534
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,990
It exceeds the club's allocated budget.

535
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,452
I believe...

536
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,415
you won't ask me to request support
from the parent company

537
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,751
to cover what exceeds
the budget, will you?

538
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,678
MEETING ROOM ONE

539
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,929
Ms. Lim.

540
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,598
Yes?

541
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,477
Will our advertising sales
this year be low again?

542
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,564
Oh, well...

543
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,110
It's hard to expect a sudden increase...

544
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,573
I got it.

545
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,042
-Mr. Byun.
-Yes?

546
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,376
Why did we stop releasing

547
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,253
the articles about the Lim Dong-gyu deal?

548
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,213
Actually,

549
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,758
I heard we haven't received
the president's approval yet.

550
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,093
-Why?
-I have no idea.

551
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,638
Is Mr. Baek playing
a power game with him again?

552
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,725
-Isn't it because of money?
-What do you mean?

553
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,394
You know Lim Dong-gyu's
salary is 1.2 billion won.

554
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,271
Right.

555
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:44,832
Did Lim Dong-gyu's trade deal
close completely?

556
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,335
We should start working

557
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,129
on plans to promote the team
using his name.

558
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,341
We need the president's approval.

559
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,634
Is it...

560
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,762
because of his salary?

561
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,516
That's right. So I'll go up
and start thinking about it.

562
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,851
The solution won't come out
by thinking hard.

563
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,563
I don't think

564
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,525
I can achieve something
by pestering others.

565
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,236
What do you mean by that?

566
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,696
There's nothing I can do

567
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,366
if someone chooses not
to confront a problem

568
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,785
when she can easily find an answer
if she does.

569
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,287
It's because I believe

570
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,873
getting herself motivated again is
something that only she can do.

571
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,962
Going up.

572
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,399
This is Lee Se-young,
the operations manager of the Dreams.

573
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,776
Sorry?

574
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,618
Okay. Goodbye.

575
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,968
You're heading
to the police station, right?

576
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,804
-Did you bug my phone?
-Is it because of the manager?

577
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,557
-You really did.
-I'll come with you.

578
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,646
Get off. You belong to the scout team.

579
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,565
The leader of my team instructed me

580
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,025
to go help the operations manager.

581
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,694
You must know something. Let's go, then.

582
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,169
I'm Lee Se-young,
the operations manager of the Dreams.

583
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,963
Our lawyer will be here soon.
We can talk then.

584
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,633
-Sure.
-Can you briefly tell us what happened?

585
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,802
A match-fixing broker has been caught.

586
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,096
And in 2017, he gave money to Lee Dong-gu,

587
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,057
who retired from the Dreams.

588
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,353
And Lee Dong-gu showed up
as a starting pitcher suddenly.

589
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,232
So we're investigating now.
Lee Dong-gu is right over there.

590
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,744
Mr. Lee Dong-gu,
are you really involved in match-fixing?

591
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,666
-It's been a while since I've seen you.
-Just answer my question.

592
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,000
I did nothing.

593
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,878
I said I had nothing to do with it,
but they just believe the broker.

594
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,714
We didn't say you did it.
We still need to look into it.

595
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,761
-When was the game held?
-When was it?

596
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,808
June 4th, 2017. I can never forget.

597
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,560
I had hardly taken the mound
as a starting pitcher back then.

598
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,187
Here's the truth.

599
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,357
Lee Dong-gu was selected
as a starting pitcher unexpectedly.

600
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,026
And he walked the first hitter.

601
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,821
The broker promised
to pay him five million won

602
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,864
if he allowed a walk to the first batter.

603
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,450
And the broker wired five million won
to Lee Dong-gu.

604
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,498
But he claims that it's the manager
who wired money to Lee Dong-gu.

605
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,209
So we need to listen
to their statements first.

606
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,797
Jae-hee,

607
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,675
-get my laptop from my car.
-Okay.

608
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,469
-What is that for?
-To get the manager released.

609
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,846
Okay.

610
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,224
DREAMS VS. TITANS

611
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,229
This is the recording of the game.

612
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,815
Lee Dong-gu is pitching
against the first hitter.

613
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,234
It was on a 3-2 pitch,

614
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,946
and he threw a ball as his eighth
pitch a bit far from the hitter.

615
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,157
I threw nice balls back then.

616
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,743
Come on.

617
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,541
You can easily see
that the two foul balls actually passed

618
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,002
the strike zone, right?

619
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,963
Well, let's say they did.

620
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,633
If Lee Dong-gu was supposed
to walk the hitter,

621
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,928
would he have pitched
with his full ability

622
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,306
when the hitter could've been
struck out?

623
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,474
It wouldn't have been weird

624
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,101
even if the umpire had called
a strike for his last pitch.

625
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,812
Maybe it's meticulously planned.

626
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:21,108
Do you think he's Greg Maddux,
the master of control?

627
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,903
Look. These are the stats of Lee Dong-gu.

628
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,864
He allowed six walks per nine innings
on average.

629
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,407
He was a terrible pitcher.

630
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,285
Do you have to say that here?
I retired a long time ago.

631
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,413
-Don't you think it's too mean?
-I just tried to explain.

632
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,500
I also remember this game.

633
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,295
Han Tae-il, the starter of the game,
got injured,

634
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,548
and Kim Ju-chul, the substitute,
came in as a relief pitcher

635
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,716
in the previous game.

636
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,468
A PITCHER ENTERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME

637
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,762
You can see how Han Tae-il
and Kim Ju-chul played

638
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,264
in the game in many previous articles.

639
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,808
THE SUBSTITUTE STARTER IS LEE DONG-GU

640
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,685
I get what you're saying.

641
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,105
But we had to interrogate
the manager as a witness,

642
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,232
as he wired money.

643
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,491
It was to hold my baby's
first birthday party.

644
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,080
I didn't ask you what you used
the money for.

645
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,499
I don't know how he found out
that the broker contacted me.

646
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,794
At that time, my salary was low,
and my performance was horrible.

647
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,963
So he just gave me the money

648
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,757
saying, "Don't be swayed
by such an offer."

649
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,217
Darn it.

650
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,439
It must have been tough, Mr. Yoon.

651
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,443
I'm sorry for bothering you two
when you're busy.

652
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,489
I was causing harm because I was
a bad player when I was on the team.

653
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,658
And I'm causing harm
even when I'm retired.

654
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,702
Make sure to repay the money
you owe to him.

655
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,870
I should.

656
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,540
But I'm paying bills from when I could
afford to repay him.

657
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,667
Dong-gu.

658
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,212
Forget about that.
Come by and hang out sometime.

659
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,893
It's a relief the misunderstanding
about him was cleared up.

660
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,355
After what happened with Mr. Ko,
I got into a habit of doubting.

661
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:27,693
But when I was in front of him,
I wasn't sure I should doubt him.

662
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,404
He's great in terms of personality.

663
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,157
Just like he took care of
Lee Dong-gu instead of Lim Dong-gyu,

664
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,701
all his favors were bestowed

665
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,622
only on the weak players
who weren't good at baseball.

666
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:43,334
He reaches out his hand to others
rather than trampling on them.

667
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,294
I'll try to live that way too.

668
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,673
-You should try.
-Yes.

669
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,511
Please try to live that way till you die.

670
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,971
What?

671
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,162
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK SEUNG-SOO

672
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,259
Come in.

673
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,309
What are these?

674
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,936
DREAMS

675
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,896
They're the advertising sales contracts.

676
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:47,898
We sold a lot.

677
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,359
Didn't you put the advertising
agencies in charge?

678
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,362
No, I went around on foot.

679
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,240
When people are about to get hungry,

680
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,284
you could naturally expose
the different menus

681
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,661
and delivery applications each time

682
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,122
using our LED billboard
to induce them to order deliveries.

683
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,456
If you see here,

684
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,167
we could assign you a delivery manager.

685
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,338
So, you could use banking services
that guarantee the interest rate

686
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,134
of a maximum of three percent
if the Dreams get to the postseason.

687
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,261
It would leave a good precedent
to show people

688
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,763
that your bank can coexist
with the local companies.

689
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:24,518
But I don't think anyone will expect
the Dreams to play in the postseason.

690
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,437
We have Kang Doo-ki.

691
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,022
But if the Dreams play

692
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,692
in the postseason, we can't raise
our interest rate that high.

693
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,946
How would the Dreams play
in the postseason?

694
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,989
Why don't you sign it?

695
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,160
Why did you do this?

696
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,624
I made money for the team,
so you can spend it as you please.

697
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,334
Not for personal reasons, of course.

698
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,463
I mean, if you could do this,
then why did you...

699
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,717
I wasn't going to do it
because I was worried

700
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,385
you might say so.

701
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:02,014
-I must have lost my mind.
-I was joking.

702
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,519
We used to do it this way in the old days.

703
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,065
I wanted to be of help
by making advertisements

704
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,608
and be recognized.

705
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,152
But at some point,

706
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,155
I decided never to work this way, and...

707
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,367
Why not? Was the company
not motivating enough?

708
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,162
At first,

709
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,707
I couldn't understand why we waste
money on advertising agencies.

710
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,794
And I saw so many openings
to place advertisements,

711
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,128
so I gave opinions and stuff.

712
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,798
And I took over all the work.

713
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,926
So I couldn't see my friends or anything.

714
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,096
Everyone was telling me that I'm good,

715
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,349
and I worked tenaciously.

716
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,064
Then Se-jin, the team leader who
was sitting in front of me,

717
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,233
got fired from her post.

718
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,528
It's all right.

719
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,072
She's doing well now,

720
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,449
though at first she told me
that I was a mean person.

721
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,619
I see. Thank you. It must have been tough.

722
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,288
No.

723
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,082
It was fun.

724
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,461
It felt like...

725
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,089
I devoted myself completely.

726
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,134
You can go home early today

727
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,261
and have a warm dinner with your family.

728
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,471
Your children must be waiting.

729
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,808
What was that?

730
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,229
You must be out of your mind.

731
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,774
Why are you suddenly speaking
in non-honorific?

732
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,236
Whose children are waiting,
when I'm not even married?

733
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,740
You aren't married?

734
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,907
I mean,

735
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,243
why did you think I was married

736
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,995
when you knew that Ms. Lee wasn't married?

737
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,331
It's just that I work
with the operations team all the time.

738
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,500
-Yes.
-You seem

739
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,588
like you're not prejudiced,
but you actually have a lot of prejudice.

740
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,215
Then why do you leave work so early?

741
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,675
I have a lot of hobbies.

742
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,719
Do you?

743
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,055
What else is there in life?

744
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,183
The ballroom dance club, the Lego club,

745
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,143
the debate club of
Romance of the Three Kingdoms,

746
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,186
and the board game club.

747
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,146
I even
sleep less to be in all those clubs.

748
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,607
You're not a stubborn boss who
judges your subordinates

749
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,775
for having a hobby, are you?

750
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,652
I apologize.

751
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,446
That's okay.

752
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,949
I'll get going.

753
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,258
Dong-gyu.
Help me with my batting posture, please.

754
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,302
Go to the hitting coach.

755
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,388
You know better
than when Coach Min was a player.

756
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,892
And the poses they teach me are
all old-fashioned.

757
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,270
Look at you. You're quite skilled
in talking behind people's backs.

758
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:59,107
Once you teach me the batting posture,
I'm definitely getting out of the Dreams.

759
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,776
You traitor.

760
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,111
-Get in posture.
-Yes.

761
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,364
I'll make sure you won't average
over .200.

762
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,953
Your body is too tense.

763
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:17,292
If you don't have plans tonight
and want to go out for a barbecue...

764
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,630
-see me in the locker room at eight.
-I can't miss a barbecue.

765
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,424
Thank you!

766
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,311
Enjoy.

767
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,646
Thank you for the meal!

768
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,106
Gather around.

769
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,316
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work, everyone.

770
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,491
Listen to me.

771
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,161
We have Kang Doo-ki.

772
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,998
Even if the opposing team brings out
the first string,

773
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,083
we just go ahead and win.

774
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,336
He's going to win 20 games.
That sounds good, right?

775
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,255
Am I right?

776
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,341
I heard your shoulder and arm are
better now.

777
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,094
Yes, I'll try.

778
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,846
You should try.

779
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,931
Yes. And...

780
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:17,561
I'll make a caught stealing percentage
of 70 percent.

781
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,563
WHEN A CATCHER THROWS OUT
RUNNERS TRYING TO STEAL.

782
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,524
Isn't 70 percent exaggerating a bit?
I'm going to punch you in your belly.

783
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,111
-Then 50 percent.
-Just get 30 percent.

784
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,071
Nonsense, 45 percent!

785
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,489
I like 45 percent.

786
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,741
And then...

787
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,870
how about Lim Dong-gyu hits

788
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,165
20 home runs in 72 games.

789
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,625
That sounds great.

790
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:41,752
Jin-woo.

791
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,088
-No thanks.
-I'll...

792
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:46,798
also work hard.

793
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,551
I'll work hard too.

794
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,510
You should.

795
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,804
-Good.
-Let's have a drink.

796
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,181
You guys.

797
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,475
If I was five years younger,

798
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,060
-I'd be kicking...
-Let's have a toast.

799
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,104
-Cheers.
-You brat.

800
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,441
This time, we're going to play
proper baseball.

801
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,485
Dreams!

802
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,528
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

803
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,286
The advertising sales are back producing
a surplus of over one billion won.

804
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,997
It'll be enough for you
to pay Lim Dong-gyu's salary.

805
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,375
So what?

806
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,586
Why haven't you when you could have
done this earlier?

807
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,838
Tell me about it.

808
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,840
Others could think that it's a change

809
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,844
that the new general manager brought
with him, and I'm worried.

810
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:37,140
When you were the acting owner
of the club,

811
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,352
we hadn't done it this way.

812
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,105
I have a question.

813
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,149
Do you have an illness

814
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,861
that gives you a rash when you go
home after losing an argument?

815
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,457
Why isn't he coming?

816
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,634
Wait, what's he doing?

817
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,845
Hey! Start running!

818
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,350
What?

819
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,810
Okay.

820
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,646
So I'm not your immediate superior
anymore. Is that it?

821
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,940
Fine. Let's go inside. It's cold.

822
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,693
Gosh.

823
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,072
Hey, pick something.

824
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,700
I have tons of clothes at home.

825
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,954
I'm sure you do, but pick something
that suits you as a scout.

826
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,415
Do scouts have to wear certain clothes?

827
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,001
Of course, didn't you see
Mr. Yang's clothes?

828
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,795
I saw him in something similar
to what we call clothes.

829
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,425
You still badmouth your superior
behind his back.

830
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,469
Come on, this isn't badmouthing.

831
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,636
Anyway,

832
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,307
it will be colder on cold days
and hotter on hot days.

833
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,059
You'll struggle a lot,

834
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,186
so I want to buy clothes for you.

835
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,397
I can't wear clothes you buy for me.

836
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,692
It'll be too heartbreaking. I know
all about your financial situation.

837
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,863
It feels like sending a son to school,
so I'd like to buy something for you.

838
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,157
I'm not your son.

839
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,158
Wait, hey.

840
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,621
-What do you think about these?
-You said you'd buy clothes.

841
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,664
It's not like I'll only buy you
a pair of gloves.

842
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,917
Buy me clothes then.

843
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,128
Should I buy a pair for Mr. Baek too?

844
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,757
-Ms. Lee.
-What?

845
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,426
How long is Mr. Baek working?

846
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,096
What do you mean?

847
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,264
No, it's nothing.

848
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,602
He's quite picky, you know.

849
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,521
I should take a picture and ask him.

850
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,189
Take one.

851
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,401
Click.

852
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:57,197
Hey, take a picture
of these gloves, not me.

853
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,865
Goodness gracious.

854
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,953
NEW MESSAGE FROM MS. LEE SE-YOUNG

855
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,043
OPERATIONS MANAGER LEE SE-YOUNG

856
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,796
I'm going to buy yours
while I'm at it. Do you like them?

857
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,008
You saved her number.

858
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,594
I don't wear gloves.

859
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,641
-Yes, for convenience's sake.
-I see.

860
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,728
Well, I mean...

861
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,898
I saved Mr. Han Jae-hee's number

862
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,693
and also that
of the marketing team leader.

863
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,906
It's because I'm glad.

864
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,370
I don't think anything dangerous
will happen.

865
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:48,415
I don't want to memorize numbers anymore.

866
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,637
I barely got it approved by the president.

867
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,765
Can you come up with a strategy
for the new season?

868
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:10,145
The lineup is much better than I expected.

869
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,231
I'll work hard in coming up
with a strategy for the season.

870
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:17,319
Oh, how is your son's health?

871
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,281
Did you know?

872
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,742
There was an article about it too.

873
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,785
This information can be found
on the Internet.

874
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,538
I wouldn't have renewed
the contract with you

875
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,998
without knowing much about you.

876
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:35,212
It's on your contract that you'll
get an incentive if the team wins.

877
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,047
I hope you make sure to take it.

878
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,007
Thank you.

879
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,345
By the way,

880
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,805
I have a question.

881
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,851
Why did you decide on renewing
my contract?

882
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,731
Other people said I was incompetent.

883
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,776
But a picky person like you...

884
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,655
I did because I disagreed with them.

885
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,992
What made you disagree?

886
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,623
You must've gotten attached

887
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,000
to Mr. Baek.

888
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,545
There's no one else like him.

889
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,132
He still thinks his goal is winning
the championship.

890
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,677
He's a fool.

891
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,889
Why don't you support him

892
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,350
and win the season for real?

893
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,271
Don't be like this.

894
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,023
Are you saying...

895
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,944
you want to protect the general manager?

896
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,367
Instead of your position?

897
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:55,250
I have a question for you.

898
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,252
What is it?

899
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,922
Why do you trust General Manager Yoon?

900
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,967
You trust him too, don't you?

901
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,344
Well, that's right.

902
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,054
Why is that?

903
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,809
Not many people know about this.

904
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:16,271
Mr. Yoon isn't a young manager,
but he was the first

905
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,939
to adapt progressive theories

906
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,735
like the strong second-table-setter theory
before other young managers.

907
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,822
Of course, a lot of people
horned in on him at that time,

908
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,617
so he couldn't do what he wanted
in many ways.

909
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,870
He was also interested in the Major League

910
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:35,165
and wanted to adapt
some of the theories into our team.

911
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,916
I see.

912
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,087
I thought you had a similar reason.

913
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,256
-No?
-No, mine is different.

914
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,216
Then what is it?

915
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,680

916
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,309
he was once a promising player
on our team.

917
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,603
When he took 10 wins steadily?

918
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,857
Yes, at that time,
there was this game against the Sabers

919
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,611
in which their pitcher was
Park Jun-oh, the ace player of the Sabers.

920
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,865
The two pitchers didn't allow any runs,

921
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,451
and the game continued
to the eighth inning.

922
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:16,706
Kang Doo-ki was less experienced
than the other pitcher.

923
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,460
He seemed more exhausted, and the speed
of his pitches was slower too.

924
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,505
-But he...
-He threw until the end

925
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,423
and allowed a home run
in the ninth inning.

926
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,675
Our team ended up losing
with the score of 1 to 0.

927
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,344
That's right.

928
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,430
Shouldn't he have changed pitchers though?

929
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,225
It was bad for Kang Doo-ki's shoulders.

930
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,601
It was too much for him to take.

931
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,396
I didn't think you'd like such a thing.

932
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,441
A general manager is responsible
for a team's performance.

933
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,568
A manager is responsible
for the audience's responses.

934
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,736
That's what I believe.

935
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,698
A general manager has to prepare
so that his team becomes stronger

936
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,284
during the hot stove league
and the new season.

937
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,870
A manager

938
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,498
has to light up the hearts of the audience

939
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,042
who came to watch a game.

940
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,504
Although we lost the game,

941
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,841
it made us cherish
our ace member, Kang Doo-ki,

942
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,468
who fought well against the best pitcher
at that time.

943
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,805
And also for the Sabers,

944
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,684
it made them feel proud of their pitcher.

945
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,394
It was such a great match.

946
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,192
Mr. Baek. Ms. Lee.

947
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,820
We have a big problem.

948
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,030
What is it about?

949
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,657
What's wrong?

950
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,784
Mr. Kang Doo-ki...

951
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,163
What about him?

952
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,957
Then...

953
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:42,834
which one will you choose,

954
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,336
your position or Baek Seung-soo?

955
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,730
He was transferred to the Titans.

956
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,316
Who said that?

957
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,906
Who approved of this?

958
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,449
The president...

959
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,784
and the manager.

960
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,932
A manager has to light up...

961
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,937
the hearts of the audience
who came to watch a game.

962
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,897
WE LOVE YOU, MR. YOON SUNG-BOK

963
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:46,981
That's when...

964
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,984
I thought...

965
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,445
you were qualified.

966
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,943
If you're going to act this way,
just disband us at once.

967
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,278
What were you promised?

968
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,238
-At least say something before you go.
-Sorry.

969
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:38,157
Don't blame yourself and think
that you failed to protect

970
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,284
Kang Doo-ki.

971
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,536
There are still so many players
we must protect.

972
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,413
You can't break down like this every time.

973
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,790
I'm so sick of this baseball team.

974
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:49,460
I will be making the most important
announcement in the history of the Dreams.

975
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,380
I'm trying to protect the Dreams
no matter what.
