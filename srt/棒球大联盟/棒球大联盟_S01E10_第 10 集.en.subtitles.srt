1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,324
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,826
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,123
I imagine it wasn't easy
for you to return.

4
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,126
Well, that is...

5
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,670
I know. It has to do with Gil Chang-ju.

6
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,214
Yes.

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,800
I felt sorry for him.

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,594
Don't be.

9
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,513
It would be better for him too
to live without shame

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,224
after he gets his Korean nationality back
and serves in the military.

11
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,271
Don't stay feeling sorry for him.

12
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,526
You can't stay near someone...

13
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,946
you feel sorry for for a long time.

14
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
We were like that.

15
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,909
Yes. Sorry.

16
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,078
You see?

17
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,632
Do you think...

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,012
I can also...

19
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,559
enjoy working

20
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,979
with a smile and all?

21
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,237
What I mean is...

22
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,034
Can I live like that as well?

23
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,413
Of course.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,069
Young-soo.

25
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:34,988
What?

26
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,200
Are you enjoying it these days?

27
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,952
Yes.

28
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,621
Really? Are you sure
you can continue enjoying it?

29
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,082
Very much.

30
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,336
Okay. Then, let's talk about work
a lot at home.

31
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,464
I guess I didn't put much focus
on the strategy analysis team.

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,466
Yes, General Manager.

33
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,147
Hey.

34
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,650
-Where's Kang Doo-ki going to train?
-I don't know.

35
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,570
-Do you know who he's taking?
-I don't know.

36
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,406
-I hear that he pays all the fees.
-Really?

37
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,617
I heard he doesn't even make you
run errands.

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
I don't know who he's taking,
but I'm jealous of him.

39
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,704
Sir.

40
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,039
-Yes.
-Yes.

41
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,209
Does it feel that much different
to train somewhere that's warm?

42
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,252
-Of course.
-If it wasn't effective,

43
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,755
who in their right mind
would pay to train there?

44
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,516
Don't use rebound.

45
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,060
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,687
Raise it while keeping your waist fixed.

47
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,189
Yes. Thank you.

48
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,984
-Hey.
-Yes?

49
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,695
Why do you run so much?

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,075
It's because I want to throw
with the power of my lower body.

51
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,036
You know your stuff. Keep it up.

52
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,913
Yes.

53
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,722
Good.

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,226
Sir!

55
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,646
Are you not going anywhere
to train on your own?

56
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,523
-I'm not going anywhere.
-Excuse me?

57
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,108
Why not?

58
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,110
I would go if I earned as much as you.

59
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:41,239
-I won't get to play that much either.
-There you go again talking about that.

60
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,078
THE DREAMS OFF-SEASON TRAINING PLAN

61
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,914
Are the players going
to off-season training in advance

62
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,165
using their own money?

63
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,960
Yes, the period in which they choose
to train earlier

64
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,045
is an investment that
the player himself makes.

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,716
We pay for the airplane ticket,
while they pay for lodging and food.

66
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,386
That's why rookie players or players
with a low salary like Jang Jin-woo

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,388
aren't included in this list.

68
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,473
There are still a few players here.

69
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,144
There are instances where players
earning a high salary

70
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,771
take a close junior player
with them as a training mate.

71
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,440
There's nothing else we can do.

72
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,530
To improve Jaesong Hotel's performance,

73
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,491
we focused on the duty-free store.

74
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,079
Apart from the duty-free store
at the airport,

75
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,498
we focused mainly
on improving the performances

76
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,835
of the duty-free store in the city
and the business hotel.

77
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,339
-Great job.
-Thank you.

78
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,800
You've improved the performance
of so many subsidiaries.

79
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,802
I was lucky.

80
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,307
Has the general manager returned?

81
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,643
We changed his contract so that
he leaves when the season begins.

82
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,853
Really?

83
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,024
-Kwon Kyung-min.
-Yes.

84
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,109
You never disappoint, do you?

85
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,211
-Director Kwon.
-Yes, Mr. Chairman.

86
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,797
You know there will be
a shake-up in personnel.

87
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,423
Where do you want to go?

88
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,303
Don't try to be cunning
and tell me what you want.

89
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,598
I want to grow the heavy industry sector.

90
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,226
Why the heavy industry?
That's not our main company.

91
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,020
I want to take responsibility
and allow it to grow

92
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,773
so that we escape being
just a consumer-goods company

93
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,109
and you won't have to mind public opinion.

94
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,152
Hey.

95
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,782
-Sorry.
-Try to learn from Director Kwon.

96
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,995
Let's keep it casual
when it's just between us.

97
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,464
Hey.

98
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,218
-When we're in the company building--
-Darn it!

99
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,471
Stop overdoing it.

100
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,307
You always overdo it.

101
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,943
Great.

102
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,574
Come on.

103
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,367
Stay focused when you practice.

104
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,161
-Yes, coach.
-Take a look.

105
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,498
Your left hip has to push forward
like this,

106
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,168
or you won't have any stability.

107
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,169
Okay.

108
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,129
Try it. Stop!

109
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,257
That's it. Now push your hip.
Push your hip out!

110
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,136
You're not using your waist at all.

111
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,096
-Come on.
-Okay.

112
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,224
Come on, now.

113
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,851
-Let's do it again.
-Coach.

114
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,270
-Yes.
-You can't do this.

115
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,521
What?

116
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,274
Since Min Tae-sung is here too,
ask him to look at your hitting.

117
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,736
You can't be instructing him
when it's off-season.

118
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,864
What?

119
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,993
So,

120
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,205
you're not thanking me
for using my time to help out.

121
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,624
Hey! Am I being paid to work right now?

122
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,835
You're not being paid, so you don't need
to put in the work right now.

123
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,420
You're making a fuss for nothing.

124
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,255
I'm afraid that people
would start talking.

125
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,298
Seo Yeong-ju!

126
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,510
I'm representing the Dreams

127
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,470
at the Players' Association's
board of directors.

128
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,972
I'm afraid that I wouldn't be able
to stand there with dignity.

129
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,807
Seo Yeong-ju.

130
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,435
You've grown up.

131
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,395
-Right?
-I'll get going.

132
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,358
You fool!

133
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,694
You're crazy, aren't you?

134
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,947
You old-fashioned losers.

135
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,115
What? What did you say?

136
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,742
-Come here!
-Stop.

137
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,744
-That jerk!
-Stop it.

138
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,595
The way the baseball franchises
agreed to pay the athletes

139
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,056
is a salary divided into ten months.

140
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,350
But that would mean there are
two months without pay.

141
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,435
So the Players' Association
has continued to argue

142
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,231
that the athletes do not receive
group training during these months.

143
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,527
That means that the athletes
can train during those two months, but...

144
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,364
We'd only be providing the facility.
They'd have to train on their own.

145
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,533
Then, what's the problem
with that situation?

146
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,702
If the coaches instruct the athletes,

147
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,288
it would be hard to call it
voluntary training.

148
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,585
It's a problem, then.

149
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,713
There are many additional problems
that arise with this,

150
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,506
but it is a necessary system.

151
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,674
I understand.

152
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,761
But, General Manager...

153
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,930
Hey.

154
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:03,060
All he said was "I understand,"
but why am I so nervous?

155
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,938
Your nervous hunches
have never been wrong.

156
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,321
The kids these days are...

157
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,447
Back in the old days...

158
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,408
They can't even thank us
for using our time to help.

159
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,327
We're doing this for their own good.

160
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,749
That's hot.

161
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,335
You should make some noise
when you creep up like that.

162
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,797
Without training, I guess this team
is going to get last place again.

163
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,635
-Of course.
-Then, train as you wish.

164
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,596
How?

165
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,348
I'll take responsibility.

166
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,059
However, the coaches are also on vacation.

167
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,102
Will you be okay with it?

168
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,229
There's no such thing for the losing team.

169
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,149
I have a rough idea of how you think
about us,

170
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,068
but we do have a sense of duty.

171
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:57,114
He goes to the Injury Prevention Center
even now at his own expense.

172
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,577
-And he's teaching the players about that.
-When did you get so talkative?

173
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,040
It'll be tough to have
group training altogether,

174
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,250
but do as you want
when it comes to teaching.

175
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:14,298
You may notify the players
of the time you'll be out here.

176
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,926
The players who want to learn
may come to learn from you.

177
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,845
What will you do if the players'
association makes a fuss?

178
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,889
I'll have to talk to them.

179
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,351
Who's the president
of the Players' Association?

180
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,269
They were voting for one a while ago.

181
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,146
Is the result out yet?

182
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,316
Yes.

183
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,902
Yes. All right.

184
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,323
Who's the president?

185
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,337
PLAYERS' ASSOCIATION
PRESIDENT INAUGURATION

186
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:57,174
Hello. I was voted as the president
of the Players' Association.

187
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,051
I'm Kang Doo-ki.

188
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,178
Kang Doo-ki?

189
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,807
That's good.
He's on good terms with Mr. Baek.

190
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,142
He'll let it pass easily.

191
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,853
You say that
because you don't know him that well.

192
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,817
Kang Doo-ki is someone
who does everything properly.

193
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,987
He'll throw the balls hard
as the pitcher of Dreams.

194
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,740
And he'll also risk his neck

195
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,576
when doing his job as the president.

196
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,750
Ball!

197
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,461
Jin-woo.

198
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,672
Can you see how my balance is
when I'm pitching?

199
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,382
Yes.

200
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,844
-Throw one.
-Yes.

201
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,100
Min-ho, when you want to add weight
to the ball,

202
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,353
you have to find the stride
that suits you, but that was too long.

203
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,231
Try taking a shorter stride here.

204
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,816
-Throw another one.
-Okay.

205
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,817
Look at that.

206
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,446
Even Jin-woo can't train because
he's teaching a junior player.

207
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,363
That's good.

208
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,115
One more.

209
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,075
Now...

210
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,411
Attention, everyone.

211
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,496
TRAINING SCHEDULE

212
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,831
Even now,

213
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,959
do you see Jin-woo teaching
Min-ho the fundamentals

214
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,753
when he has to find his balance?

215
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,296
That's just sad.

216
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:21,425
We're giving up our days off
to come to the individual training.

217
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,719
So if you want, you can ask us
about anything.

218
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,805
We all have a hard time during the season.

219
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,223
Coaches.

220
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,059
Why are you doing this
even when I'm right here?

221
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,101
Seo Yeong-ju.

222
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,730
-How much is your salary?
-Do you pay my salary?

223
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,357
You rude scum!

224
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,904
-Min-ho.
-Yes.

225
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,823
Is there anything you want to learn?

226
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,074
There's a lot.

227
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,787
I mean, I have some.

228
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,708
Your competitors are right here,
not on other teams.

229
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,460
The ones who get paid a lot now

230
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,046
go to a warm country
for individual training in a few days.

231
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,799
You have to wake up!
How do you plan to keep up?

232
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,552
Do you think they'll want you
to get better?

233
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,722
Are you trying to make the players
take sides?

234
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,642
Should we also take sides
like you coaches?

235
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,520
That jerk is the problem with our team.
Seo Yeong-ju!

236
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,648
If these were the old days, you wouldn't
be walking after getting hit with bats.

237
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,944
Stop saying that nonsense
and live in the present.

238
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,113
Seo Yeong-ju.

239
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,994
I understand what you're saying, coach,

240
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,453
but for now...

241
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,164
DIRECTOR KWON KYUNG-MIN

242
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,127
Say I'm not here.

243
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,297
Say who's not here? You disappoint me.

244
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,345
Hey.

245
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,557
Did you know there will be personnel
changes among the presidents?

246
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,933
Is that so?

247
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,727
Where do you want to go?

248
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,731
Do you really want to go
to the heavy industry sector?

249
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,692
Yes.

250
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,694
Why would you want to go there?

251
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,321
You're so strange.

252
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,449
Fine. I'll talk to them.

253
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,492
You don't need to.

254
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,828
Jeez.

255
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,497
I'm planning to go
to the department store.

256
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,082
It suits you.

257
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,335
You must be really competent.

258
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,422
All the people I've known keep
asking me if I'm close to you.

259
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,383
The guys who were there
at the presidential board.

260
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,510
Why do they ask me that?

261
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,806
It's because they want to beat you.
You're a cause for alarm.

262
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,850
What about you?

263
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,602
What?

264
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,813
Am I not alarming to you?

265
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,149
What are you saying?

266
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,944
Let's just go for a drink.

267
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,613
I'm fine. I have work to do.

268
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,032
Later tonight.

269
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,952
I have to go see Han Ju-hee anyway.
You remember that hot girl?

270
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,080
It's a meeting for our ad model.
Do you want to tag along?

271
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,000
-Don't cause any trouble.
-You're being so serious.

272
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,710
You're boring.

273
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,712
Women don't like that, you know.

274
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,811
FATHER

275
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,488
REQUEST TO CEASE COACHING

276
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,825
The Players' Association must have
reported to the KPB.

277
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,120
We'll write a report for it.

278
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,415
Are you still planning to keep going
like this?

279
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,625
What's the next step for this case?

280
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,043
There will be a fine.

281
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,629
It could be a few hundred million won.

282
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,924
Baek Seung-soo.

283
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,095
Are you going to pay this fine?

284
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,931
Do you have a few hundred million
extra won?

285
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,267
Would you like a cup of coffee?

286
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,105
It costs a few hundred million won
for you to handle things abnormally!

287
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,857
Have you lost your mind?

288
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,568
The KPB won't impose a fine
of that much money.

289
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,278
And... Right.

290
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,155
You can't drink iced coffee with this.

291
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,199
Why do you proceed with these
without permission from the president?

292
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,743
Am I a joke to you?

293
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,412
I didn't think I'd need
the president's permission for this.

294
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,122
Then whose permission would you get?

295
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,293
Just a moment.

296
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,378
Yes.

297
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,007
Yes. Okay.

298
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,930
-Excuse me.
-Hey!

299
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,058
Where are you going?

300
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,646
What the...

301
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,024
My goodness.

302
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,694
That's the rule.

303
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,905
You're all aware of it, coaches.

304
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,365
Rule? What rule?

305
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,994
What's the rule that's so important
to stop a player from training?

306
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,207
The players can train all they want,
but the coaches can't be involved.

307
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,960
It's also easier for us to not help them.
How dare you report me?

308
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,254
Congratulations.

309
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,803
Kang Doo-ki. You've been working hard
since you became the president.

310
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,181
I know that our coaches work hard,

311
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,350
but you have to stop this.

312
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,267
That's the rule.

313
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,146
Shouldn't that rule be applied
more flexibly?

314
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,608
"No work, no pay" is common sense.

315
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,530
The players have no reason
to work for two months without payment.

316
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,119
Training is work?
That sounds a bit tricky.

317
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,831
I agree that playing a game is work.

318
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,583
But isn't training
more like self-improvement?

319
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,964
How do you treat the coaches
that devote themselves with no pay?

320
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:56,510
I think you're treating them
like villains who broke the rules.

321
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,848
So let's not bother one another,
and stop it now.

322
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,225
Are we a high school baseball team?

323
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,269
-You scumbag!
-We are...

324
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,272
professional players.

325
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,024
If a player lacks effort,

326
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,236
he'll have to pay for it.

327
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,240
If a player

328
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,325
lacks effort...

329
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,494
Come on.

330
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,706
...the whole team pays for it,
not just the player.

331
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,001
The team is important,
but most players are breadwinners.

332
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,004
They must be guaranteed
of the time with their families

333
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,297
who also committed themselves.

334
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,008
That's why we encourage them
to participate only voluntarily.

335
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,135
The players are employees with no power.

336
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,138
Even though you tell them
it's only voluntary,

337
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,390
to meet the coaches' eyes
and get in the starting lineup,

338
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,101
some players will feel forced
to participate.

339
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,228
It's not encouragement.

340
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,731
It's violence.

341
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,650
So you'd also stop the players
from training voluntarily?

342
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,278
That sounds more like violence to me.

343
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,739
And on our team,

344
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,743
there are a lot of players
who need to acquire skills.

345
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,786
I'll suggest that the association

346
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,706
apply your plan next year. But for now...

347
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,083
you'll follow the rules.

348
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:14,087
I hope that rule won't make it
seem like you're kicking down

349
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,840
the ladder to prevent
the development of other players.

350
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,134
Your honor depends on it.

351
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,054
Also, the key players go
to off-season training ahead of time

352
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,931
at their expense.

353
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,017
Some say it's only the rich
that get richer.

354
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,519
Because when other players join
the training later on,

355
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,438
they'll have a hard time due to jet lag,

356
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,774
which leads to lower quality training.

357
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,694
Are you viewing us...

358
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,073
as the evil this time?

359
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,665
How sad.

360
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,876
How can you say that? I'm sure you know
how serious that sounds.

361
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,006
I'm sorry about that,

362
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,716
but...

363
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,052
don't be mistaken

364
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,888
that the Players' Association
is some old-fashioned group

365
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,266
that seeks only the benefit
of well-paid players.

366
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,600
And...

367
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,353
I'll hand this issue to the KPB.

368
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:12,980
I'll be off.

369
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,247
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes?

370
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,626
What if they really issue us a fine?

371
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,839
-I've given it some thought.
-And?

372
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:43,510
I think the worst-case scenario is
our players not being able to train.

373
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,348
We've been concerned about this issue too.

374
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,309
And have you come up with any conclusion?

375
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:56,606
We discussed making a textbook
about how to train during off-season.

376
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,026
We worked on some of it,
but we had to stop

377
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,485
because we didn't have enough time.

378
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,030
How about we have the coaches
do it quickly

379
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,240
and distribute it to the players?

380
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,244
Baseball is a delicate sport.
I think there will be a limit

381
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,204
to learn how to train through a textbook.

382
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,331
You have a point.

383
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,125
Still, it might be better than nothing.

384
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,461
We'll make it way better
if we actually do it.

385
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,420
Right.

386
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,340
You worked hard
even when your team was last place.

387
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,175
What?

388
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,553
Of course we worked hard.

389
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,765
Placing last doesn't mean
our souls are dead.

390
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,683
You're right.

391
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,060
I'll be off.

392
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,812
Oh, Mr. Baek.

393
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,107
Ms. Kim Young-chae of Baseball Is Life

394
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,609
wanted to interview you

395
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,277
regarding our off-season training,

396
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,196
so I turned her down.

397
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,906
Didn't I do a good job?

398
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,574
Tell her we'll do the interview.

399
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,327
-Who will?
-Me.

400
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,085
What?

401
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,893
-What is it?
-What?

402
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,813
Your car is here. Go on.

403
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,233
What was that?

404
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,040
This is Kim Young-chae
of Baseball Is Life.

405
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,252
I have a story about the Dreams
again today.

406
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,505
I must say, the Dreams
are a hot topic in the winter.

407
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:30,802
This time, they're having a problem
with their off-season training.

408
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,596
This is a bit funny.

409
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,014
It's not Manager Yoon Sung-bok,

410
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,933
but Mr. Baek who is
taking the lead with this matter.

411
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,102
A general manager in the center
of baseball management.

412
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,645
It's not looked upon positively here.

413
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,232
Mr. Baek wasn't a baseball player
to begin with.

414
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,277
That's one way to look at the situation.

415
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,158
What brought you here?

416
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,578
You know we're having an issue
regarding training these days.

417
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:01,291
-And?
-Everyone's criticizing Mr. Baek

418
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,835
for acting up
when he isn't even a manager.

419
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,797
So you should make your stance here--

420
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,716
You want me to side with him this time?

421
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,260
That's what you've always done.

422
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,680
We're telling you to do what you've done.

423
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,307
You punks!

424
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,811
Do you think it's right

425
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,064
for you mere punks to tell me
what to do with my stance?

426
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,566
-Mere punks?
-Min Tae-sung!

427
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,154
What are you if not a mere punk?

428
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,366
Mr. Yoon.

429
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,286
We just want you to be our strength.

430
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,623
Get out.

431
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,643
So?

432
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,895
What's your point?

433
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,815
-Don't we have the same opinion?
-What do you mean?

434
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,984
Baseball Is Life covered our issue.

435
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,279
Reporters visit us for interviews,
and you'll have to say something.

436
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:16,866
Let's be honest.
Our opinions are similar enough

437
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,077
that we don't even
have to discuss it out loud. Right?

438
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,537
Hey.

439
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,623
Why do you always create a mess

440
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,418
and come to me and Mr. Yoon
to clean it up?

441
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,461
-What?
-Hey.

442
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,256
All right, let's be honest.

443
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,717
If you guys and the general manager
get fired because of this,

444
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,345
-what will I lose?
-How can you say that?

445
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,347
Without having a word with me,

446
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,975
you picked a fight with all the pitchers.

447
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,144
Now you want us
to take responsibility together?

448
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:53,111
You punk. You haven't changed a bit.

449
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,739
You'll end up doing the same
as what you've done to Jang-geun.

450
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,117
How could you say his name that easily?

451
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,536
Let go.

452
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,997
Let go, you punk.

453
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,293
They've got to rest up while they can
and live a decent life.

454
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,758
This is enough already.

455
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,469
How long do we have to keep doing this?

456
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,938
Come in.

457
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,650
Mr. Baek.

458
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,990
Why do I feel like it's been a long time?

459
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,671
Mr. Baek, you're the star
of this hot stove league in many ways.

460
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,674
From your voluntary resignation
to your flashy comeback.

461
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,718
But it's not easy this time either.

462
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,846
You're having a conflict
with the Players' Association.

463
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,558
Players don't get paid during off-season.

464
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,477
Thus, they shouldn't be forced to train.

465
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,770
Do you admit to this?

466
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,774
In addition to that, they shouldn't
be forced not to train.

467
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,776
That's my point.

468
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,403
The Players' Association claims

469
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,197
that it will mark the start
of coercive training.

470
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,160
Saying that is making an assumption
of something that hasn't happened yet.

471
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,620
However,

472
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,708
players who are willing to train
are forced to stop.

473
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,502
That's happening at the moment.

474
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,132
Since I'm not directly involved,
we better move on.

475
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,719
Then, why don't you watch this video?

476
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,151
Why are you showing me this?

477
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,403
It's simply an online video

478
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,196
that people watch for fun.

479
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:05,493
Why do you think
our players made mistakes here?

480
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,997
Because they lacked focus?

481
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,125
Or because they lacked sponsorship
from the group?

482
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,920
No, because they lacked training.

483
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,215
It's good for teams like us to train.

484
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,843
And for skilled teams like the Sabers,

485
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,428
it's good they take a break.

486
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,473
Some are saying it should be the manager,

487
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,893
rather than the general manager,
in charge of their training.

488
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,853
What do you think about this?

489
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,063
I totally agree with it.

490
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:38,610
People are also questioning
the leadership of Manager Yoon Sung-bok.

491
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,403
That's not true.

492
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,697
Because of the past poor results
of the Dreams--

493
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,617
If he disagrees,

494
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,119
I'll stop what I'm doing right away.

495
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,294
Good work.

496
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,255
Good work.

497
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,437
Mr. Baek, can I have a word with you?

498
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,064
Sure. Have a seat here.

499
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,982
Okay.

500
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:26,491
Why did you have to play that video

501
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,286
-during the interview?
-Guess how many hits it got.

502
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,456
Eight million hits.
That's practically everyone.

503
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,417
The players might be discouraged.

504
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,670
They'll soon depart
for the off-season training.

505
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,046
And before that,

506
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,173
the photoshoot and the fan signing
are scheduled.

507
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,094
What if the players reject
to cooperate with us because of that?

508
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,848
If that happens,
I'll do my best to deal with it.

509
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,017
Don't worry by yourself
and make sure to let me know.

510
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,312
I will.

511
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,252
I've watched your interview.

512
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,924
You always take the hard road.

513
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,551
I'm fine.

514
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:31,347
I hope the paths you take
are the right ones.

515
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,517
Mr. Baek.

516
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:41,316
I've never been able to lead the team
the way I wanted.

517
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,860
I know that very well.

518
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,195
Please guide the team
in your own style this year.

519
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,743
But I think I could still be
in this position

520
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,454
because I'm just a puppet manager.

521
00:31:55,371 --> 00:32:00,585
If you wish to stop the training
in controversy,

522
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,628
I'll do so.

523
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,714
I'll tell you my opinion on it soon.

524
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,927
-I need some time to think about it.
-Sure.

525
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,315
The blue maple!

526
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,359
Goodness.

527
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,152
Awesome.

528
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,323
Se-young, why do you look so worried?

529
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:31,908
I'm fine.

530
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,535
You definitely have a worry.

531
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,121
She's the worry, my worry.

532
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:41,167
Se-young, go get the sikhye
from the fridge.

533
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,757
Mom, if someone on my side
does something wrong,

534
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,217
what should I do?

535
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,511
Tell him he's wrong.

536
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,595
He doesn't listen.

537
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,806
Then make him listen.

538
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,976
I said that doesn't work.

539
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,852
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

540
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,689
Then just take his side
and see what happens.

541
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,482
Even though I think his decision
isn't right?

542
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,693
Are you smarter than him?

543
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,486
-No.
-Seriously!

544
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,781
You should think for one second
at least before you answer.

545
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,661
Then, my daughter, just go!

546
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,289
Take his side this time
and see what happens.

547
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,712
But I still feel reluctant. What do I do?

548
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,006
Poor Mi-sook.

549
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,800
You got no match three times in a row!

550
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,553
Come on. We don't have that rule.

551
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,304
You said we did before we started.

552
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,225
What are you talking about? I've neither
heard nor mentioned it at all.

553
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,895
But you said you'd follow the online
game rule because it'd be easier.

554
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,149
There's the three-no-match rule
in the online version.

555
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,150
See?

556
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,987
I should win money here

557
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,949
so that I can feed you with hairtail
instead of mackerel.

558
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,952
You silly wench.

559
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,121
You don't even know
how good hairtail tastes.

560
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,000
-Let's do it again!
-Gosh!

561
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,851
It's nice to have you here with us,
Kang Doo-ki.

562
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,271
Hello. I'm Kang Doo-ki, the president
of the Players' Association.

563
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,983
You introduced yourself as
the president of the association

564
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,069
instead of as a player of the Dreams.

565
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,614
Right. It's because that's why I'm here.

566
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,451
I assume that it wasn't easy
to come out here

567
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,746
since you have conflicts with
the general manager of your own team.

568
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,705
Not at all.

569
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,750
They are separate matters.

570
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,169
I'm sure he'd understand me.

571
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,799
However, it's quite hard to understand
why he had to display

572
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,676
the video of us making mistakes
to demonstrate that we needed

573
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,220
the off-season training.

574
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,847
I'm worried it might discourage
the players.

575
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,059
That's totally possible for the players.

576
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,437
How does the association plan
to respond to the decision

577
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,732
to proceed with the training
that accompanies coaches?

578
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:15,530
The Players' Association has
officially filed the complaint to the KPB.

579
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,490
And we expect the KPB will impose fines.

580
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:23,788
Then the team might pay the fines and
still carry out the training plan, right?

581
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,249
If they pay the fines,

582
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,585
that would mean they admit
that they did the wrong thing.

583
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,380
And if they keep sticking
to the training plan...

584
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,800
I won't tolerate it.

585
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,260
-I see.
-Come in.

586
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,720
General Manager Baek and...

587
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,139
It's all right.

588
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,642
We'll have our eyes on the following...

589
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,269
Watch it.

590
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,147
General Manager Baek claims
the players have the right...

591
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,940
He's quite competent too, isn't he?

592
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,984
Sorry?

593
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,153
He's the general manager, right?

594
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,904
He always makes a fuss.

595
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,449
Is there any other position
we can give him other than that?

596
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,287
I'll look into it.

597
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,307
Yes?

598
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,998
You don't drink?

599
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,293
Why did you want to see me?

600
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,462
So you can't hold your liquor.

601
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,549
You're still a kid.

602
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,135
It's bitter even if I drink
with someone nice.

603
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,386
Why would I drink here?

604
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,723
I guess your life has been
quite peaceful so far.

605
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,851
How could you think it's bitter?

606
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,020
Life is much more bitter.

607
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,149
If you realized how bitter life was,

608
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,027
you'd find it sweet. You know?

609
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,995
You saw me the other day, right?

610
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,082
-I didn't.
-I didn't even tell you when.

611
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,960
And you just say you didn't?

612
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,254
You really saw me.

613
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,925
Would it make you feel better
if I said I did?

614
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,720
Do you know what I've been
up to until this hour?

615
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,390
-I don't.
-The hotel construction in Jeju.

616
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,977
I was screening the candidate
construction companies

617
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,146
to build a 300 billion-won hotel.

618
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,400
What's funny is that I turned on the TV
after the meeting, and you were there.

619
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,862
You use only 20 billion won
for your budget.

620
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,241
Why do you fight over every matter?

621
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,577
Is it that hard to work in peace?

622
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,624
When you decide what is important or not,

623
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,128
is it only money that matters to you?

624
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,505
You'll even retire soon.

625
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,465
Hey.

626
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,386
Why are you so rude?

627
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,140
How come you never listen to others?

628
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,934
Why do you never listen to me?

629
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,647
If I listen...

630
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,319
would you people treat me differently?

631
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,903
Of course.

632
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,615
But nothing changed
even when I was obedient.

633
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,743
Have you ever been obedient before?

634
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,287
I have, and I regret it.

635
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,914
Bullshit. I know
you've never listened to others.

636
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,833
If I listen to what they say,

637
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,755
they keep having me do something unjust
so that they won't get their hands dirty.

638
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,550
Decent organizations don't bother

639
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,053
their employees
even if they don't listen to them...

640
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,348
as long as they're competent.

641
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,975
That's why you're only
a general manager...

642
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,397
while I manage the hotel
as a director of the group.

643
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,359
Do you know baseball well?

644
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,531
Of course, I've been
the acting owner of the team for years.

645
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,449
How dare you ask that

646
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,077
when you were a general manager
of a handball team until last year.

647
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,624
Some people were born on third base
and think they hit a triple.

648
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,461
There's no need for you to feel shameful,

649
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,798
but it'd be quite embarrassing...

650
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,801
to feel proud of it.

651
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,723
I'm leaving first.
Please take a taxi and go home.

652
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,905
Oh, dear.

653
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,258
FATHER

654
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,345
FATHER

655
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:43,065
Why are Choi Yong-gu
and Lee Chul-min always arguing?

656
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,525
Those two?

657
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,195
There have been misunderstandings
for quite a long time.

658
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,363
So, who's right?

659
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,659
If you and I have a misunderstanding,

660
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,244
-I'm always right.
-No, you're not.

661
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,079
But it's not the same with those two.

662
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,205
They're just different.

663
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,083
They were also arguing
over Min-ho last time.

664
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,960
Coach Choi Yong-gu is worried

665
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,005
that Min-ho's potential
isn't being realized.

666
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:10,593
Coach Lee Chul-min is scared
that Min-ho might get injured.

667
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,846
Are you afraid
something might happen to me?

668
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,766
I'm afraid of you staying
on the operations team.

669
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,311
Tell me about that more specifically.

670
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,273
Did I startle you?

671
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,817
You approached me from behind so suddenly.

672
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,490
YOO MIN-HO

673
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,289
There was a time Choi Yong-gu
and Lee Chul-min were close to each other.

674
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,042
Then there was a player
called Park Jang-geun.

675
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,129
He was part of a dark history
of the Dreams.

676
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,674
It's been over six years already.

677
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,053
His pitching was solid and he had guts.

678
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:57,223
He was so talented, and was even
nominated for Rookie of the Year.

679
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:02,603
But he had problems with his shoulder.

680
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,730
Bench coach Lee Chul-min said

681
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,775
his posture for pitching was bad
for his shoulder,

682
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,444
and he tried to correct him by force.

683
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,823
Coach Choi Yong-gu wasn't
fully aware of the pitcher's condition,

684
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,368
and he kept ordering him to train.

685
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,914
Park Jang-geun was very simple and quiet.

686
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,876
I don't think he's on our team.
Did he move to another one?

687
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,835
No.

688
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,756
He learned how to operate heavy equipment,
and he's doing well.

689
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,217
He's doing well?

690
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,386
He said he's doing well,

691
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,806
and he doesn't want the coaches
to keep visiting him.

692
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,725
He said he wants to live quietly

693
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,936
so that no one can know
he used to play baseball.

694
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,897
Then why are the two like that?

695
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,067
They can probably only bear the truth
by blaming each other.

696
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,195
They're both weak.

697
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,949
Maybe in their minds,

698
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,743
they could be thinking
that it's their fault.

699
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,163
Hey, stop pitching.

700
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,081
Pardon?

701
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,750
If you overwork yourself,
you'll get injured.

702
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,714
-Okay.
-What do you mean, "okay"?

703
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,715
Where is it?

704
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,592
It's nothing.

705
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,637
Do you want to go to Jeju Island
with me? I'll pay.

706
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,098
You have to pitch in a warm area.

707
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,686
-I'm all right.
-Well, Jeju isn't even that warm.

708
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,439
Let's go eat. Wrap it up.

709
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,274
Okay.

710
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,402
Mr. Baek.

711
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,154
Yes.

712
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,157
-The manager wants to see everyone.
-All right.

713
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,470
Come on in.

714
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,557
I have the authority to decide
on the training, don't I?

715
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,101
Yes.

716
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,774
I've been thinking,

717
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,985
and I've decided to follow the rules.

718
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,118
Our club is one of the clubs
that belong to the KPB.

719
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,204
Therefore,

720
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:28,624
I think it's fair to obey the rules
that we all made together.

721
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,878
So I request for Mr. Baek...

722
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,550
to cease the training.

723
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,972
This is how you handle things reasonably.

724
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,350
You must always handle things reasonably.

725
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,703
You shouldn't blame the manager.

726
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,581
Actually, I was opposed to the training.

727
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,961
Since you decided on that,
I was just trying to have faith in you.

728
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,130
Because it seemed like
you were never wrong.

729
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,924
Why wouldn't I be wrong?

730
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,679
Please give my thanks to coaches
Choi Yong-gu and Min Tae-sung.

731
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,222
Okay.

732
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:26,682
Mr. Baek.

733
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,184
Yes, go ahead.

734
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:33,105
It's the brochure containing
the off-season training method

735
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,566
that I told you about last time.

736
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,778
Right.

737
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,031
I made it.

738
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,784
I'm thinking of giving those out
to the players

739
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,162
since they can't get the extra training.

740
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,414
Did Coach Lee Chul-min make this with you?

741
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,416
Yes.

742
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,835
He's a good guy.

743
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,628
He is.

744
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,255
He has his own ways,

745
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:02,301
but he also made time for the team.

746
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,888
He helped us by saying that we won't
be able to break the rules

747
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,556
that all the teams made together.

748
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,975
He was already expecting this.

749
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,394
That's good.

750
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,734
Gosh.

751
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,195
He'll be here at night.
Let's wait in the car.

752
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,405
How long has it been?
What are we doing here anyway?

753
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,365
We can't get a view of here from the car.

754
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,284
You parked the car in a weird place.

755
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,455
What are you doing here?

756
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,875
Coach!

757
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,803
These are my treasured documents.

758
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,971
Thank you.

759
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,141
The most important chapter is
about preventing injuries.

760
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,480
When we can't play in the postseason,
and the records are out, they get regrets.

761
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,065
And the players become overly active.

762
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,234
You must be worried
about the injuries the most.

763
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,445
Of course. No matter how much I warn them,

764
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,656
the players don't get it.

765
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,867
Injuries are
really dangerous and frightening.

766
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,953
You sound like my dad.

767
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,290
-What?
-It's nothing.

768
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,292
Let's see the documents.

769
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:21,296
The horizontal abduction is
a stretch that's good for your shoulders.

770
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,633
First, you place your palm
and elbow on the wall.

771
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,719
You slowly pull this way,
and strain the other way.

772
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,596
Your right arm must be fixed.

773
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,020
Ms. Lee went through a really hard time.

774
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,439
What? You're embarrassing me.

775
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,191
There's a limit to how crazy
you can become.

776
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,277
Give yourself some credit
in a situation like this.

777
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:44,862
Jeez.

778
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,407
I was also expecting this to happen
to some extent.

779
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,284
Pardon?

780
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,120
I expected the manager
to make a rational decision.

781
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,541
-A rational decision?
-I know I was being unreasonable.

782
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,585
If you knew you were being unreasonable...

783
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,378
Then why did you do that?

784
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,424
-Good!
-Good!

785
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,469
Nice pitch!

786
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:13,307
Because of what happened,
the players will probably feel hostile

787
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,144
towards me to train hard voluntarily.

788
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,691
Also, the manager and I
were never divided on any issues.

789
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,195
But some people were displeased by that.

790
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,198
And they also dislike the manager
because they dislike me.

791
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:34,453
So I wanted to add weight
to the manager's leadership.

792
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,080
Gosh.

793
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,458
Was the manager in on this with you?

794
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,501
No, not exactly.

795
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,921
I merely knew he'd make that decision.

796
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,425
Also,

797
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,845
proceed with this, please.

798
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,142
PROPOSAL FOR DISPATCH
TO THE AUSTRALIAN LEAGUE

799
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,162
Yoo Min-ho!

800
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,040
Let's play baseball where it's hot!

801
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,625
Pardon?

802
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,919
You're going to Australia.

803
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,047
You'll throw balls in the Australian
league and join us in the training!

804
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,436
How did you find out
about the Australian league?

805
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,147
I thought it'd be good
for the younger players

806
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,274
to accumulate experience over there.

807
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,944
Exclude the veteran players with money,

808
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,363
and focus on the less experienced
players who can't afford it

809
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,739
as you make the list.

810
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,491
Okay.

811
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,911
But the Australian league began
a long time ago.

812
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,747
They had a lot of players leave
due to injuries or poor results.

813
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,082
They were welcoming.

814
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:06,461
Wouldn't it be good for our players
to experience it a little bit?

815
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,506
For the players who can't go abroad
to train,

816
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,799
it's way better.

817
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,844
They don't have to worry about
getting hurt training in the cold.

818
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,596
Especially Yoo Min-ho.

819
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,058
Yes, I hope he plays...

820
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,603
better this year.

821
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,569
About the brochure
for the off-season training method.

822
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,029
Regarding what we prepared...

823
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,905
What about it?

824
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,325
I think it was a good choice.

825
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,539
The manager, the operations team
and myself all did our jobs.

826
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,209
You said you tried to trust me
even if it didn't seem right.

827
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,378
Good job.

828
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,384
Am I...

829
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,012
cold when it comes to expressing myself?

830
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,182
Yes.

831
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,686
Thank you for trusting me.

832
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,736
Gosh, I'm getting a cough.

833
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,006
Moving on to the next report.

834
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,218
Regarding the issue of banning
group training during off-season,

835
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,637
the general manager of the Dreams
had a conflict with...

836
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,306
He doesn't know that
greatness is comparative.

837
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,059
It's not hard to follow the flow.

838
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,730
Give me some more sausages, please.

839
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,981
Okay.

840
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,948
MOTHER

841
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,288
What?

842
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,415
What?

843
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:11,920
Goodness.

844
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,507
Why did it collapse?

845
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:21,096
Why did Father check the embankment
of someone else's house?

846
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,059
I was in a good mood for a while,
and you just ruined it.

847
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,897
Why can't we live

848
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,818
without giving each other
bad news, just like the others?

849
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:37,863
How much is it?

850
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:43,160
Why do I never get to hear
good news from my family?

851
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,829
You get hurt repairing houses.
You don't get paid for your work.

852
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,623
Why do you always get involved
with scumbags?

853
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,296
I'm hanging up. I'll wire you the money.

854
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,472
The Dreams have announced
that they're dispatching

855
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,142
their promising players
to the winter league in Australia.

856
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:11,313
As it's hard for players to train
in the country off-season,

857
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,481
Mr. Baek Seung-soo...

858
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,028
KWON KYUNG-JUN

859
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,497
Welcome.

860
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,167
You're dead drunk.

861
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,838
Let me pour you a drink.

862
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,423
Sure.

863
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,968
Kyung-min.

864
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,096
You said you want to go
to the heavy industry, right?

865
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,515
My youngest uncle
used to work in that industry too.

866
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,687
Let's dine together sometime.

867
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:54,856
What?

868
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,485
Oh, okay.

869
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,113
By the way, what affiliate
is your father in charge of?

870
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,951
Oh, my father?

871
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,121
Affiliate?

872
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,456
Hey.

873
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,793
His father doesn't work.

874
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,215
Oh, I see.

875
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,133
He even served in the army.

876
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,010
He's not like us.

877
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,180
Right?

878
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,560
We ran out of liquor.

879
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,112
Kyung-jun.

880
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,156
How about we do an arm wrestle?

881
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,202
-What?
-An arm wrestle.

882
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,414
Why?

883
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,624
Do you think you can beat me at that?

884
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,043
Let's do it, you scoundrel.

885
00:54:59,045 --> 00:54:59,963
Are you insane?

886
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,098
Look.

887
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,600
You have...

888
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,354
this sense of rivalry against me
every time.

889
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,568
I think that's so...

890
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,777
presumptuous.

891
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,827
Just do a round.

892
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,663
-I'll be a referee.
-All right.

893
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,083
Let's do it.

894
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,377
I'll do it for you.

895
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,343
Bring it on.

896
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,599
Get ready.

897
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,645
Begin!

898
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,232
Use some strength.

899
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:02,942
Well?

900
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,445
Do it.

901
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,239
Use some strength.

902
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,077
Do it.

903
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,337
Darn it.

904
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,014
Let go.

905
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,974
I said, let go.

906
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,735
You're weak
because you didn't serve in the army.

907
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,821
Right?

908
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,330
Darn you.

909
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:02,961
Are you crazy?

910
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,297
Don't just call him "your father."

911
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,466
He's your uncle.

912
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,219
Right?

913
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,313
If I listen,

914
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,482
will you people treat me differently?

915
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,816
Of course.

916
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,403
But nothing changed
even when I was obedient.

917
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,996
That fool.

918
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,249
What a darn show-off.

919
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,611
We've been too scared
of the worst result possible.

920
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,363
Mr. Baek will make a scene again.

921
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,781
Why was the training canceled?

922
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,200
We're going to cancel off-season training.

923
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,660
Why are you going this far?

924
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,246
Do you still not have any regrets?

925
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,289
We're not training then?

926
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,583
-We'll go somewhere domestic.
-This is crazy.

927
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,918
I promise to give you
the best alternative.

928
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,587
I've arranged a practice game.

929
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,380
-With a college baseball team?
-No.

930
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,923
