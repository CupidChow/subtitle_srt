1
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,575
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION,
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,743
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,206
Why is the PR team leader
under investigation?

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,042
He must have done something wrong.

5
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,835
Are you being serious?

6
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,132
Mr. Byun Chi-hoon.
Do you know of the Anti-bribery Act?

7
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,176
I do! I am very much aware of it!

8
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,386
And I haven't done anything of the sort!

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,682
You're saying that you never met up
with reporters to block an article?

10
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,644
Do you completely trust

11
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,854
the PR team leader?

12
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,065
You've rooted out

13
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,776
some of the bad actors

14
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,694
like the scout team leader
and Lim Dong-gyu.

15
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,408
Your leadership, immediately
bringing in an investigation team...

16
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,079
goes beyond being petty
and is a bit nasty.

17
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,081
Mr. Baek.

18
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,460
Do you know how nasty
the sport of baseball is?

19
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,463
When the pitcher throws
the ball to the batter,

20
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,009
do you know what it's called
when the runner goes

21
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,886
from first base to second base?

22
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,515
They call that stealing a base.

23
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,519
When the ball is thrown,
the runner is stealing something.

24
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,563
The only sport that allows such a thing
is baseball.

25
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,941
Let's say you learned something
about baseball from me.

26
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,486
Call off the investigation

27
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,946
for the sake of communication.

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,990
Didn't you do the same when you came here?

29
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,200
I thought you'd like this.

30
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,244
If something comes out
of the investigation,

31
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,412
I'll take responsibility too.

32
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,413
But...

33
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,792
if this only results
in hurting an innocent individual...

34
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,169
what will you do?

35
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,842
That would be rational suspicion
for the purpose of trust.

36
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,926
Right?

37
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,803
How long are you going to continue?

38
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,596
Until the investigative team calls it off.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,723
Can I keep an eye
on the investigative process?

40
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,686
The PR team leader
used to obey our orders really well.

41
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:30,775
-Whose orders?
-He must have gotten on your side.

42
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,901
Then...

43
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,780
for cooperation between
the new president and general manager,

44
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,325
should I reduce it
to an independent investigation?

45
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,120
It'd be an investigation by the manager.

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes.

47
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
You can do that.

48
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,292
You have to request it.

49
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,963
I request that you do so.

50
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,549
Bow, then.

51
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,061
I ask of you.

52
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,693
Don't bow, Mr. Baek.

53
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,944
What are you doing?

54
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,529
Why should you bend to him?

55
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,200
-You'll only make things worse.
-Still...

56
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,372
You have a passionate follower too.
This is fun.

57
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,003
The apple tree
that the friendless Mr. Baek planted...

58
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,464
has finally born fruit.

59
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,841
Nice.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,177
Let's have a word.

61
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,852
If you keep saying nothing happened,
will it solve anything?

62
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,901
Mr. Byun.

63
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,819
Let's go.

64
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,655
What's your deal?

65
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,990
Can't you tell we're in the middle
of an investigation?

66
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,123
-Let's go.
-Yes.

67
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,133
Here.

68
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,104
Thank you.

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,233
-What's there to thank me for?
-Well,

70
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,611
thanks for taking me out
of the investigation.

71
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,782
This is what has always happened.

72
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,659
What do you mean?

73
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,081
The rapport that surely forms
while working with colleagues

74
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,083
has always come back to bite me.

75
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,587
I'm someone who doesn't listen to orders.

76
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,633
That's why the people near me

77
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,302
always turn out like this.

78
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,726
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,068
All right, everyone. Just a minute.

80
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,862
Just a minute.

81
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,908
Assistant Chief Jang Woo-seok.

82
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,951
Yes.

83
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,078
You will work

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,080
reporting news to the president.

85
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,583
That's all.

86
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,210
I won't be a president that just watches.

87
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,464
I'll be one that is active on the ground.

88
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,381
Yes.

89
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,633
I won't be afraid...

90
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,094
to go through any trouble.

91
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,264
Look at this.

92
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,225
He even knows the old idiom.

93
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,852
If you're well educated like him,

94
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,146
you can become
the president's special assistant.

95
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,774
Then what becomes of the position
of scout team assistant chief?

96
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,651
That position will go to the next in line.

97
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,528
And the empty slot

98
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,864
will be filled by Mr. Han Jae-hee.

99
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,408
Mr. Han Jae-hee of operations

100
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,995
will be moving to the scout team.

101
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,997
That's all.

102
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,931
Mr. Han Jae-hee.

103
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,891
What is it?

104
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,020
What conversation did you have
with the president?

105
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,689
This was the conclusion
of that conversation.

106
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,777
You aren't the type of person
to make this decision on your own.

107
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,117
I made the investigation independent,

108
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,078
so you have to fulfill one of my requests.

109
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,998
I think we need some shifts in personnel.

110
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,917
That young boy.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,961
-You mean Han Jae-hee?
-Yes.

112
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,546
Change his team.

113
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,801
Which team do you want me to move him to?

114
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,094
Home.

115
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,263
That'd be the home
of the CEO of Jinsong Furniture.

116
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,932
What do you mean?

117
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,893
He's the grandson of the CEO of Jinsong.

118
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,397
It's not a company
as big as Jaesong Group.

119
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,608
But I'm sure there are many CEOs
that have ties to it.

120
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,237
Then move him to the scout team.

121
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,781
-He wasn't an athlete.
-Well...

122
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,119
you put your younger brother
on the strategy analysis team.

123
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,497
You brought a Korean as a foreign player.

124
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,083
It's not like you to be so inflexible.

125
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,713
I don't care at all. I'm sending him
to the scout team

126
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,756
and planning change and innovation.

127
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,886
Do you expect the president to stay still
while you innovate the team?

128
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,888
What do you think?

129
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,724
Should we also shake up
the operations team like the PR team...

130
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,894
until we get some dust?

131
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,815
I don't know how you view me,
but it was my decision.

132
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,235
The president only wanted
Jang Woo-seok as his assistant.

133
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,238
Is this because I'm of no help
on the operations team?

134
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,324
Why are you staying still in all this?

135
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,495
Can I ask you why you made this decision?

136
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,039
If it's because of President Kwon,

137
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,833
you know well that
he wouldn't make any decision

138
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,418
for the good of the team.

139
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,755
You also know that the operations team
is the busiest one.

140
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,883
Han Jae-hee's role is not small.

141
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,802
He works harder and later than anyone.

142
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,349
And I hope that you show that passion
on the scout team.

143
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,020
Between the members that haven't forgotten
about the former leader,

144
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,897
you'll be of much help to Yang Won-sub.

145
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,983
Great.

146
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,277
But why didn't you tell me this
in advance?

147
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,906
You're complaining to me because
you think I'm rational, right?

148
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,408
Mr. Han.

149
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,411
You can't be complaining
about your position

150
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,330
in just any company.

151
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,167
How would you feel if I punished you

152
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,669
for your behavior?

153
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,132
Isn't it because you have the idea
that you can always quit this job?

154
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,972
Even if you got this job in a fair way,

155
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,766
as long as people suspect you got it
because of your family ties,

156
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,227
you'll need skills that can exceed this.

157
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,441
I heard you rich boys
practiced catching a lot.

158
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,526
Use that...

159
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,279
as a skill

160
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,822
on the scout team.

161
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,868
I don't expect you to be better
than someone who was an athlete.

162
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,370
Just hang in there.

163
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,707
Thankfully, our country's
best scout, Yang Won-sub,

164
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,542
is the leader of the team.

165
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,421
If you're staying on the operations team

166
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,089
for someone else, it's right you stay.

167
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,175
But if it's all for your benefit,

168
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,512
I think you should experience
being on another team as well.

169
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,724
That's my opinion.

170
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,146
This is enough explaining on my part.

171
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,533
He tried to be mean on purpose.

172
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,576
You know that, right?

173
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,246
But there's nothing false in what he said.

174
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,373
And the thing is that I know this.

175
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,836
Okay.

176
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,380
You'll do well there.

177
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,301
You're even meaner.

178
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,802
What?

179
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,305
Come on.

180
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,931
I'm going to step out.

181
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,643
Okay.

182
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,646
Go and calm yourself down.

183
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,101
It's an anabolic steroid.

184
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,894
If you take this,

185
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,854
you'll become a bit stronger.

186
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,398
ANABOLIC STEROID

187
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,399
Stronger?

188
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,776
A TYPE OF PROHIBITED DRUG FOR ATHLETES

189
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,737
Hitting is the hardest skill

190
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,572
in all sports.

191
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,743
And you're doing something that amazing.

192
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,084
And a drug test?

193
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,212
We adjust your schedule
so that you'll never get caught.

194
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,923
We don't work that sloppily
like in the old days.

195
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,633
Are there any side effects?

196
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,843
Good question.

197
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,722
That's what separates us from the others.

198
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,100
We also sell drugs
that reduce the side effects.

199
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,894
If it reduces them,

200
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,772
it means that there still are
side effects, right?

201
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,773
Listen.

202
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,567
In America,

203
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,527
they asked the track-and-field athletes,

204
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,656
"There's a drug
that guarantees you the gold medal.

205
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,409
Will you take it if that means
dying after seven years?"

206
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,913
Well, 80 percent of them said they would.

207
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,626
It's the same for pro baseball.
You know Lim Dong-gyu, right?

208
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,422
-Lim Dong-gyu's skills are...
-Lim Dong-gyu?

209
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,923
from doping.

210
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,926
I've heard rumors that he does.

211
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,969
How about Kang Doo-ki?

212
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,639
Are there rumors about Doo-ki?

213
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,933
Kang Doo-ki?

214
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,062
-What?
-Get them!

215
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,064
Hey!

216
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,693
-Hey!
-Don't move.

217
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,949
The ambitious New Year's resolution
to become a baseball league

218
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,993
that gives people hope has failed.

219
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,704
This case is about doping.

220
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,247
What happened exactly?

221
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,210
Some main baseball players
have been arrested by the police

222
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,836
while trying to buy anabolic steroids.

223
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,297
In the process, it seems
that a few famous players' names

224
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,508
have been called,

225
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,802
and the whole league's
in a state of tension.

226
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,763
Yes, KPB announced that it's
investigating internally

227
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,765
and discussing the punishment.

228
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,559
It said it will never overlook
this matter.

229
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,604
Hasn't the severity
of the punishments been

230
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,524
lower than the standards
average fans have hoped for?

231
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,608
You're right.

232
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,860
The dominant opinion is that
a 72-game suspension

233
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,862
for a player that disrupted
sportsmanship

234
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,740
is too light of a punishment.

235
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,581
There are rumors that some
of our players had taken drugs.

236
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,416
I heard our company knew, and that's why

237
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,253
they canceled our off-season training
to send us to Jeju.

238
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,838
I heard that too.

239
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,632
But the company could have
wrong information.

240
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:04,885
Mr. Park.

241
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,347
Have you heard any rumors

242
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,849
that specify who it was?

243
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,767
I'm not sure.

244
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,855
There are no players on our team
that have taken drugs.

245
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,314
Well...

246
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,693
there aren't any except for Lim Dong-gyu.

247
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,988
Lim Dong-gyu's case back then was just...

248
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,489
LIM DONG-GYU DOPING

249
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,408
DONG-GYU DOPING

250
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,617
GENERAL MANAGER KIM JONG-MOO

251
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,952
DONG-GYU USES BANNED DRUG

252
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,247
LIM DONG-GYU, DREAMS ROOKIE BATTER,
USES BANNED DRUG

253
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,375
They all say that it wasn't a real drug.

254
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,503
But it only makes things fishy
in this kind of situation.

255
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,224
NUMBER HIDDEN

256
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,279
Lim Dong-gyu.

257
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,660

258
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,997
So what?

259
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,918
Why don't you shut my mouth with money?

260
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,007
How much?

261
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,675
Just as much as you sent last time.

262
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,553
It's not like I'm a dirt bag.

263
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,473
This will be the last time.

264
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,976
Well, you never know
what will happen in life.

265
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,728
Wire the money in cryptocurrency.

266
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,314
I hate it when the police put tails on me.

267
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,543
A HUGE DOPING SCANDAL
IN PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL

268
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,759
Yes.

269
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,938
There are many rumors, right?

270
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,025
HUGE DOPING SCANDAL IN PRO BASEBALL

271
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,153
Yes, there's talk.

272
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,655
Anything I should be interested in?

273
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,824
But they're all rumors.

274
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,744
So, what's the interesting one
among the rumors?

275
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,626
Kang Doo-ki's name...
has been going around for a while.

276
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,545
Kang Doo-ki?

277
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,343
There's talk that there's a reason

278
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,555
Kang Doo-ki suddenly became good

279
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,973

280
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,225
You may leave.

281
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,819
Hey.

282
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,864
If you know anyone in the police,

283
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,159
secure the list of doping athletes
as soon as possible.

284
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,538
Yes.

285
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,836
CEO KWON KYUNG-MIN

286
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,379
Did you want to see me?

287
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,506
You know about the drug rumors, right?

288
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,508
-Yes.
-What about our players?

289
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,177
We're trying to figure it out.

290
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,849
You're the general manager,
and you're still trying

291
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,184
to figure out the situation.

292
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,519
Like you're asking
the general manager as the president,

293
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,897
I'm asking other people.

294
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,943
What do you think?

295
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,863
What if there are players who took drugs?

296
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,948
Think about what? It'd be wrong.

297
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,202
Would you cover up such wrongdoings?

298
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,329
I'd like to know.

299
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,999
You want to win the championship.

300
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,085
Did I say that?

301
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,464
A lot of things must have happened
between us.

302
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,799
Don't you remember?

303
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,176
You said you'd do as planned
to win the championship.

304
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,595
You're saying

305
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,056
you'd plant an apple tree
even if you're leaving.

306
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,517
Yes, I think I did.

307
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,393
You think?

308
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,771
I'm sure I didn't say
that I'd even sell my soul...

309
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,482
to win the championship.

310
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,484
I'll get going.

311
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,741
HUGE DOPING SCANDAL IN PRO BASEBALL

312
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,499
If Kang Doo-ki had taken drugs,

313
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,377
he'll be suspended for 72 games,

314
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,254
which is half of the whole season.

315
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:54,299
If that happens, Kang Doo-ki,
the pitcher who gets 18 wins,

316
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,301
will fall to the pitcher
with only nine wins.

317
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,012
Considering he'll lose
some sense of the game,

318
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,389
it could be worse than that.

319
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,642
That's not all. It'll cause
both concrete and intangible damage

320
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,227
to our team that will be irrevocable.

321
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,980
Yes, it will, since it's Kang Doo-ki.

322
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,858
LIST OF ATHLETES AND DRUG USE, SELLERS

323
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,863
This is the list of the sellers.
And this is the list of the buyers.

324
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,407
The buyers are not confirmed, though.

325
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,324
KANG DOO-KI

326
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,326
These are the ones that I've heard of.

327
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,251
You trust Kang Doo-ki, right?

328
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,211
Yes, I do. But I will still confirm.

329
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,796
Are you going to ask him in person?

330
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,506
No, I'll try a different way.

331
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,591
Like what?

332
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,217
I'm thinking.

333
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,596
If you ever find out...

334
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,975
that he actually took drugs...

335
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,978
would you try to cover it up?

336
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,982
Not everyone I wanted to protect
was worth doing that for.

337
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,650
On the contrary,

338
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,487
I can't protect everyone
even though they're worth it.

339
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,078
Why would you ask
for Baek Young-soo's leave?

340
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,207
Are you going on a family trip?

341
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,000
We can't afford such a thing.

342
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,045
Will it be difficult for him
to take a leave?

343
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,964
No, that's not exactly the reason.
But it's three days.

344
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,425
Will it affect your team's work
if he took a leave?

345
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,969
Of course. Well...

346
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,846
our team could still function.

347
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,015
But still...

348
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,017
I want to give him some work at home.

349
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,478
It's not for the strategy analysis team,

350
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,480
-but it concerns the club.
-Then...

351
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,566
Then it'd be best
to have him off for two days.

352
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:36,944
Okay.

353
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,409
Do you feel better now?

354
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,495
Yes.

355
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,958
Still, it's Mr. Yang.

356
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,127
I don't have to send you to Mr. Ko...

357
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,296
so I won't be worried.

358
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,093
But do help us with our work
this week.

359
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,010
Okay.

360
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,432
Ms. Lee.

361
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,142
Yes? What is it?

362
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,647
Do you feel reassured
to at least have me on the scout team?

363
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,149
What are you saying?

364
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:18,860
Well...

365
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,281
let's say I do.

366
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,908
I'll work hard.

367
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,830
"Se-young did a good job raising him."

368
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,039
Make me hear this.

369
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,874
Okay?

370
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,584
I'm not a child.

371
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,466
So...

372
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,511

373
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,265
It's nice.

374
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,017
Good.

375
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,020
We have better facilities
and stronger players.

376
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,647
With the same salary,

377
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,191
no one would say no to the Seoul team.

378
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,027
You're right.

379
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,865
Well,

380
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,492
do you have any particular concerns?

381
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,121
No.

382
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,125
Please don't get the wrong idea,

383
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,044
but these rumors are created

384
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,340
because your results
are too good sometimes.

385
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,384
So to speak,
it's an honorable misunderstanding.

386
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,970
People are mistaken
because you're way too good.

387
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,890
I didn't do it.

388
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,851
Right.

389
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,980
I wanted to hear you say that.

390
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,774
And I trust you.

391
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,151
But instead of simply saying no,

392
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,403
I want you to explain more

393
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,447
about why you think
there's a misunderstanding.

394
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,657
Then we'll be able to trust you more

395
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,577
and make things work out better.

396
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,875
Please excuse me.

397
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,587
Look, Dong-gyu...

398
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,510
-He's unbelievable.
-Is he really a rookie?

399
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,803
Look how strong his pitch is.

400
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,971
It's insane.

401
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,064
KANG DOO-KI

402
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,863
All his pitches are so powerful.

403
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,657
KANG DOO-KI

404
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,670
Hey. Get lost.

405
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,672
Excuse me.

406
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,384
Doo-ki, you're good.

407
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,927
You're the future of the Dreams.

408
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,762
What should we eat, by the way?

409
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,056
-What do you want to eat, Doo-ki?
-How about pork cutlet?

410
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,641
Let's eat pork cutlet and kkakdugi.

411
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,642
Sir.

412
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,478
I'm sorry...

413
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,772
but could you please throw
a few balls for me?

414
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,357
Are you insane?

415
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,778
You might ruin your body.
Don't practice too hard.

416
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,740
Where are we going?

417
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,908
KANG DOO-KI

418
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,670
Tee batting won't improve your skills.

419
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,839
What?

420
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,841
You aren't a T-ball player.

421
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,260
You're a baseball player.

422
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,186
Are you ready?

423
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,688
Throw.

424
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,534
All right, let's see
what you've got, Robinson.

425
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,705
Sort out the players

426
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,250
who have improved their skills
over the past few years.

427
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,587
Although things like diligent training
and the coaches' leadership

428
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,171
might've played a role...

429
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:34,342
So you want to guess who would be targeted
for the doping test beforehand?

430
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,677
Exactly.

431
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,512
And if you have time...

432
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,389
I doubt that.

433
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,809

434
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,853
But that's not our team.

435
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,988

436
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,706
As for starting pitchers,
fatigue substances pile up

437
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,499
in their shoulder muscles as they pitch.

438
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,835
And the small veins surrounding them
happen to burst.

439
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,296
Of course, it's different
from player to player.

440
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,049
But pitchers can control inflammation

441
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,343
by taking steroids.

442
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,844
It helps them

443
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,097
protect the muscles
in their elbows and shoulders.

444
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,226
Kang Doo-ki has produced good results
for the past two years.

445
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,565
Well, I'm telling you this
because there are such rumors.

446
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,400
You're very good at your work.

447
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,198
I bet the cage called Ko Se-hyuk
was very small for you.

448
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,116
That's not true.

449
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,787
I was happy to have him as my senior.

450
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,081
That's nice.

451
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,958
You may leave.

452
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,394
This afternoon, the manager
of a youth baseball class

453
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,771
confessed that he urged

454
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,356
one of the players to use

455
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,108
-banned drugs continuously.
-Mom.

456
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,110
Your daughter is home.

457
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,029
It's revealed that Mr. Jung Se-ju...

458
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,824
DRUG USE EVEN IN YOUTH BASEBALL CLASS

459
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,368
That's not right.

460
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,204
Doing that will make them mess up.

461
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,332
-What do you mean?
-When I was in school,

462
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,334
I was told to bring rat tails.

463
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,461
Is it about my salary again?

464
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,089
What are you saying?
It's because you're feeling guilty.

465
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,882
That's not it.

466
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,218
In order to catch rats,

467
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,804
they rewarded us a pencil per tail

468
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,348
if we handed rat tails in at school.

469
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,851
So did you hand in a lot?

470
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,144
I handed in the most.

471
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,980
But later on, some guys...

472
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,317
colored squid legs so it wouldn't show.

473
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,822
The school ended up
not giving us any pencils.

474
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,991
Even to me, who handed in real rat tails.

475
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,784
So?

476
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,494
What do you mean, "so?"

477
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,914
Expedients could make you all
go down together.

478
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,791
That's the point, silly.

479
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:16,379
Hold on. Where did I put the squid?

480
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,471
2020 EMERGENCY MEETING OF DIRECTORS

481
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,569
All of you here

482
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,696
are investing a large sum of money

483
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,990
to run your pro baseball club.

484
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:48,870
You must be troubled
to come across something disgraceful.

485
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,500
Yesterday, there was even a news report

486
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,794
about the drug use of youth players

487
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,505
in a youth baseball class.

488
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,799
How tragic.

489
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,427
Regarding this doping scandal,

490
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,304
we must start with the thought

491
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,765
that all of us are victims

492
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,185
and unspecified baseball players
who used drugs are assailants.

493
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,481
I thought we would

494
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,902
only be able to discuss it rationally now,

495
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,530
while no one has been
discovered using drugs yet.

496
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,616
That is why I asked for an urgent meeting.

497
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,326
2020 EMERGENCY MEETING OF DIRECTORS

498
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,997
-Is this really necessary?
-What do you mean?

499
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,708
There are
so many widespread rumors already.

500
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,919
Can we really say

501
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,338
that all the teams
equally have no information?

502
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,382

503
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,050
What?

504
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,386
What rumors are out there now?

505
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,766
I haven't heard of any rumors yet.

506
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,894
Please tell me what kinds
of rumors you heard.

507
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,937
Well...

508
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,274
Some are suspected of using drugs.

509
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,942
If such rumors spread,

510
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,944
innocent players will fall victim to them.

511
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,113
Right. Innocent players must be protected.

512
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,030
And...

513
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,367
those who are caught doping
can play only half of the season.

514
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,286
Isn't that already a heavy penalty?

515
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,538
They built their career
by dishonest means,

516
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,998
but why is the penalty heavy

517
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,750
when they can play
even for half of the season?

518
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,379
Can students get a B if they
get caught cheating on the exam?

519
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,758
If a shot of a drug is worth more

520
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,803
than the hard work and sweat
of the other players,

521
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,264
can you really call this a sport?

522
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,809
Is it a drug contest or something?

523
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,272
Soccer players are suspended
for four years

524
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,858
if they get caught. Aren't you ashamed?

525
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,695
Please say a word
regarding the current situation.

526
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:51,618
The presidential board came up
with a couple of terms of agreement

527
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,953
to fix the damage

528
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,748
caused by the horrible drug scandal
as soon as possible.

529
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,790
First,

530
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,752
the punishment will be increased.

531
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,503
Until today,

532
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,049
the maximum penalty imposed
on players caught doping

533
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,510
has been a suspension
from playing in 72 games only.

534
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,137
However,

535
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,057
just like the soccer league,

536
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,602
the association decided
to increase the penalty

537
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,562
to two years.

538
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,856
Therefore, Kang Doo...

539
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,359
Kang Doo-ki?

540
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,569
-For those who confess--
-Hold on.

541
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,113
Didn't you just say Kang Doo?

542
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,533
Were you going to say Kang Doo-ki?

543
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,161
No. That's not what I was going to say.

544
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,039
I was going to say
the word "confess" instead.

545
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:42,001
I just tend to focus on vowels
more often than consonants...

546
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,128
Anyway,

547
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,507
for those who confess
their wrongdoing first,

548
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,261
the penalty will be relieved
to one year of suspension.

549
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,892
I heard that it was Kwon Kyung-min,
the newly appointed president

550
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,895
of the Dreams,
who called the meeting urgently.

551
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,438
What could that possibly imply?

552
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,525
It can be interpreted that he is confident

553
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,735
that there are no Dreams players
who violated the rule.

554
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,239
There's been no one who's confessed
to using drugs so far.

555
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,865
And if the Dreams turn out clean,

556
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,493
we can say he made such a great move.

557
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,580
If other presidents also didn't know
about the test results yet,

558
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,375
they must've had no choice
but to attend the meeting.

559
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,794
Still, we can't jump to a conclusion

560
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:28,589
that only the Dreams are a clean team yet.

561
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,967
The main brokers have not been caught,

562
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,969
and even the police and the reporters

563
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,847
haven't gotten the list of drug users yet.

564
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,726
In other words, if anyone,
including star players

565
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,563
of the Dreams,
turn out to be on the list,

566
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,566
the choice made by President Kwon can

567
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,193
bring about a strong backlash
against the Dreams, right?

568
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,279
That's right. The privacy of...

569
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,489
I can't stop thinking

570
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,491
that the president didn't do it
for our team.

571
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,495
It seems like he thinks
Kang Doo-ki is on the list.

572
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,372
Kang Doo-ki?

573
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,374
We're not sure of anything yet.

574
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,085
-It's sad.
-Why?

575
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,380
President Kwon thinks
those who get in the way

576
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:14,135
of others who do good jobs
are the competent ones.

577
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,055
You're right.

578
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,644
He's pulling it
until he's blue in the face.

579
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,023
-Goodness.
-Jeez.

580
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,026
He works only on his shoulder.

581
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,863
-That's all he does.
-He has no choice.

582
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,782
Darn it.

583
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,828
Hey.

584
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,915
What did you just say?

585
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,751
Well...

586
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,754
we were talking about
where that immense strength...

587
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,506
must have come from.

588
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,135
You know, I wouldn't be able to
stand myself if I failed to reach .300.

589
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,639
I even considered quitting baseball

590
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,766
when I hit under 20 homers
in a previous season.

591
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,771
Sure. You really are the best hitter,
Lim Dong-gyu.

592
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,298
Lim Dong-gyu.

593
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,760
Who are you?

594
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,804
I'm a fan of yours.

595
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,972
My fan?

596
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,016
I hardly turn out in games.

597
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,729
I'm a fan of the Lim Dong-gyu
who will make 100 runs...

598
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,482
and 30 homers with an average of .330.

599
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,444
Training hard isn't always the answer.

600
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,196
Who are you, anyway?

601
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,200
You know player Kang Guk-ju,
the best hitter these days.

602
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,747
If he hadn't met with this...

603
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,003
no one would know his name now.

604
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,547
Try the sample...

605
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,259
and call me if you need more.

606
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,575
Dong-gyu.

607
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,770
DOO-KI'S PITCHING RECORD

608
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,313
Kang Doo-ki.

609
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,399
What a jerk.

610
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,822
You're really working hard.

611
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,409
I see how diligent one should be
as the president's assistant.

612
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,248
I believe whatever you do
is for the team, right?

613
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,583
Please keep suspecting...

614
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,919
and tracking players.

615
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,797
I know what I'm doing.

616
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,259
You'd better not have a filthy intention.

617
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:46,013
You shouldn't do this
in hopes of getting a specific result.

618
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,940
Please look.

619
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,068
He achieved a shutout on August 4th.

620
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,946
But on August 9th,
he didn't lose a point for six innings

621
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,490
and seven scoreless innings
on August 14th again.

622
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,660
He threw more than 110 pitches
for all three games.

623
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,537
He must have a very healthy shoulder.

624
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,331
The intervals between the games
all are five days.

625
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,293
The baseball fans must be saying this.

626
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,754
"It's almost like Kang Doo-ki...

627
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,759
used drugs."

628
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,721
That's right.

629
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,559
Kang Doo-ki must be using drugs
to enhance his performance.

630
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,979
He is also...

631
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,190
a mere human.

632
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,453

633
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,747
Why would you ask such a question?

634
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,043
You know the penalty is one year
for those who confess first, right?

635
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,758
What is this?

636
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,926
I looked into it on my side.

637
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,180

638
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,267
Why do you analyze our players?

639
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,145
You know, I owe you one.

640
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,566
I also hope what I've found isn't right.

641
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,278

642
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,155
be suspended for two seasons.

643
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,492
We're also working on a plan.

644
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,328
You can just take a look.

645
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:36,040

646
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,333
Okay.

647
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:42,421
I will take your advice only...

648
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,673
but not this one.

649
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,551
Do you think the players
will really turn themselves in?

650
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,389
I won't threaten my players
with a list from another team.

651
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,266
I'll ask them once again.

652
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,184
But...

653
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,770
I need you to take it back.

654
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,313
Mr. Kim...

655
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,942

656
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,985
become a team with the best pitchers,

657
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,947
including two with 15 wins
and one with ten wins.

658
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,827
And all of them even have
their ERA in the twos.

659
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,745
I know that very well.

660
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,707
Jeez. It was possible
thanks to others' help.

661
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,711
If they turn themselves in,
the penalty is only one year.

662
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,798
It's just one season.

663
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,926
You can aim for the championship
next season.

664
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,055
How dare you bring this piece of paper
and stir my mind?

665
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,101
They said they didn't.

666
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,980
I said I decided to believe our players.

667
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,403
I also hope...

668
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,822
this piece of paper...

669
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,409
turns out wrong.

670
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,469
I liked being called

671
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,847
your senior
rather than your general manager.

672
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,683
The young players
were like children to me.

673
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,060
The veterans were like
my youngest brothers.

674
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,770
That's how I coached this team.

675
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,689
But...

676
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,567
right now,

677
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,737
there are others putting pressure
on me to not believe you

678
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,198
and interrogate you.

679
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,408
Drugs.

680
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,079
If you've taken them,
call me up anytime today.

681
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,373
You'll turn yourself in tomorrow.

682
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,752
If no one calls tonight,

683
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,003
I'll believe

684
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,631
that no one used drugs on our team.

685
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,800
Rather than other people...

686
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,720
I trust...

687
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,847
my children more.

688
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,891
Do you understand?

689
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,267
Yes.

690
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:08,400
URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE ON THE DRUG CRISIS

691
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,032
We'll begin the urgent press conference
on the drug crisis.

692
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,620
Our association will give
the players time to report voluntarily.

693
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,705
And to those players,

694
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,707
we've decided to hand down the punishment

695
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,962
of a one-year suspension,
which is half of the two years

696
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,465
that we'd agreed to
as a presidential board.

697
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,883
In that period,

698
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,844
no players have reported themselves.

699
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,015
The players who did not report voluntarily

700
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,685
will be given a two-year suspension.

701
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,105
I will now announce the list.

702
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,774
On the list,

703
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,277
there are two players from the Sabers,

704
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,362
one player from the Pelicans...

705
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,198
two players from the Whales,

706
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,409
three players from the Jaguars,

707
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,411
one player from the Devils,

708
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,538
three players from the Titans,

709
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,790
two players from the Black Wings,

710
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,543
three players from the Red Hawks,

711
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,628

712
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,171
Five players?

713
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,173
From the Dreams...

714
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,721
there were no players using drugs.

715
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:24,393
A total of nine teams and 22 players
were involved in this case.

716
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,478
We realize the magnitude of this incident,

717
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,564
and we'll do our best to prevent

718
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,898
any reoccurrences of this.

719
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,400
There were none.

720
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,736
Yes.

721
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,449
Is it possible that Kang Doo-ki
was omitted?

722
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,742
I'm afraid not.

723
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,203
Then why is Kang Doo-ki...

724
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,914
so good?

725
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,333
To be honest...

726
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,837
he works hard.

727
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,050
Sure.

728
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,260
I'm sure he works hard.

729
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,806
The team that's the worst at baseball

730
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,643
but is the most ignorant on drugs.

731
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,521
They're so greedless and naive.

732
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,108
What an amazing team.

733
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,449
President Kwon. Have you heard?

734
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,993
There were no Dreams players using drugs.

735
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,495
That's what I came to tell you.

736
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,415
Mr. Baek.

737
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,127
-Yes?
-Is Kang Doo-ki...

738
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,796
really clean?

739
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,713
Yes.

740
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,093
Couldn't he have met
a competent drug dealer?

741
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,055
Kang Doo-ki has shown remarkable records

742
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,308
for the last two years,
so we also doubted him.

743
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,143
And we looked thoroughly into it.

744
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,978
How did he become

745
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,439
a pitcher who's expected to win 20 games

746
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,943
from a pitcher who only had ten wins?

747
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,486
There are

748
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,988
quite a lot of factors
that you can't tell just from the number

749
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,990
of pitches and the earned run average.

750
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,617
Keep lecturing.

751
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,744
Yes.

752
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,747
He was a player whose fastballs
were quite good in the beginning.

753
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,915
He also used sliders.

754
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,168
He was a typical two-pitch pitcher

755
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,962
who only relied on those two pitches.

756
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:19,299
But... his types of pitches
started increasing.

757
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,179

758
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,639
of changeups.

759
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,517
He also started using
a wider strike zone.

760
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,520
Naturally, the number
of his strikeouts increased.

761
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,400
And he became a beast pitcher
who could lead the game as he pleased.

762
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,361
It sounds easy, but it must have
taken him arduous training

763
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,655

764
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,324
How graceful.

765
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,163
The Dreams aren't so good at baseball,
but we have relatively fewer problems.

766
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,290
You must be pleased too, sir.

767
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,458
Yes.

768
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,251
Very much.

769
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,670
I'm very much pleased.

770
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:01,008
Seeing you enraged by the foul of doping,

771
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,094
I think it demonstrated the motto of
our team, to play fair even when losing.

772
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,764
So I felt very happy.

773
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,145
I learned from you, Mr. Baek.

774
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,983
When the president and the general manager
are on the same wavelength...

775
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:24,198
people nowadays call it
"having good chemistry."

776
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,784
You and I have...

777
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,369
such good chemistry.

778
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,926
We'll summarize the list that was
announced at the press conference.

779
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,970
-According to the list...
-No players of the Dreams are on it.

780
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,972
Should I write an article?

781
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,099
"Our team was at the bottom,
but it was the cleanest!"

782
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:55,062
At a time like this, people
still recognize it even when we're silent.

783
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:59,233
Yang Jin-ho, 15 wins,
and Choi Woo-hyuk, ten wins,

784
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:00,943
are suspended for two years.

785
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,945
The three winning relievers
with an average ERA

786
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,822
of two points were all caught.

787
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,658
Two players of the Sabers were caught too.

788
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,744
One is a number five starter,
and the other is a backup outfielder.

789
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,621

790
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,957
They'll have to rebuild
the team naturally.

791
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,043
When it comes to rebuilding a team,
General Manager Kim Jong-moo

792
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,419
is the best at it.

793
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,005
Then either the Sabers will win
the championship again,

794
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,715
or the Pelicans will advance.

795
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,635
But the Dreams didn't lose any players.

796
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,304
One player from each team was on the list.

797
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,391
The expectations of our team
have also gone up

798
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,017
without us doing anything.

799
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,687
None of their players were on the list.
The Dreams' fans

800
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,147
-can be proud of their team.
-You're right.

801
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,194
Hey, here comes Lim Dong-gyu.

802
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,322
So it wasn't Lim Dong-gyu.

803
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,449
He does train hard.

804
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,743
It must have been
due to the training, not drugs.

805
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,953
I feel kind of guilty.

806
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,469
Lim Dong-gyu isn't a player
who would use drugs.

807
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,223
Did you already know?

808
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,475
No player has torn his hands
more than Lim Dong-gyu

809
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,936
while practicing batting.

810
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,732
I already knew he's not someone
who would rely on drugs.

811
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,526
His drug test once showed positive
in the past.

812
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,362

813
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,407
He still thinks

814
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,368
that I reported him for a past incident.

815
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,537
That's why he told others

816
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,499
that you're someone who plays
both sides and speaks ill of your coach.

817
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,251
Why didn't you tell me?

818
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,421
It's because it's my fault
for not being able...

819
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,801
to resolve the misunderstanding.

820
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,894
HIDDEN NUMBER

821
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,192
Lim Dong-gyu.

822
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,778
The professional baseball league
seems to be controversial lately.

823
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,327
Why do you pretend
that you're the only clean player?

824
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,208
What do you want?

825
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,877
What?

826
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,712
Is this the first time
we're making a deal?

827
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,589
I'll have the usual.

828
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,857
KANG DOO-KI

829
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:50,529
NOODLES

830
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,033
Welcome.

831
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,549
You can pay tonight.

832
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,802
What are you talking about?

833
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,471
It was always on me for being paid a lot

834
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,265
and drafted in the first round.

835
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,517
Can't you pay for this kind of meal now?

836
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,978
You cheap jerk.

837
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,064
Didn't we use to have a full belly
and train well

838
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:27,899
just with this type of meal?

839
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,153
The first game.

840
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,155
The first home run.

841
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,656
And the MVP of the Week.

842
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,701
We weren't envious of anything.

843
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,996
This place isn't a school.

844
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,332
Don't try to lecture me.

845
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,128
To batters in our neighborhood

846
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,964
and to our juniors
selected in later rounds,

847
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,883
Lim Dong-gyu was the hope,

848
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,510
not Kang Doo-ki.

849
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,809
Can't you live with pride?

850
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,397
When you are at bat,

851
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,692
can you swing your bat
without pride or confidence?

852
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,113
I...

853
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,742
mess up on the mound

854
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,036
when there's something I'm ashamed of.

855
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,621
So I...

856
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,793
try to live properly
even if I'm not good enough.

857
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,295
Are you...

858
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,424
looking down on me again?

859
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,428
I've never done that even once.

860
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,181
You...

861
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,101
may be clean in terms of doping...

862
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,813
but do you really have nothing
to be ashamed of?

863
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,440
If you do, shake it off.

864
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,026
I won't say any more...

865
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,821
my friend.

866
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,454
You put me off my appetite.

867
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,418
Mr. Lim,

868
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,420
you didn't wire the money.

869
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,838
Hey, you jerks.

870
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,591
How dare you threaten me?

871
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,134
You scoundrels.

872
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,179
I'll kill you if I see you.

873
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,264
Stay away from me.

874
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,725
Or I'll kill you for real.

875
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,025
Hey, Lim Dong-gyu.

876
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,864
A national athlete
must watch his behavior...

877
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,533
instead of gambling abroad.

878
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,375
Hey, you coward.

879
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,378
Same to you.

880
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,759
How so?

881
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,427
How dare you threaten me?

882
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,055
You're a dirt bag.

883
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,016
It seems you've made up your mind.

884
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,852
You sound full of confidence,

885
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,938
and I like it.

886
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,066
Hey, Baek Seung-soo.

887
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,489
I'll show you how crazy I am...

888
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,784
about baseball.

889
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,259
I gambled...

890
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,054
in Macau.

891
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,892
If I report myself voluntarily...

892
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,228
will I get...

893
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,691
punished less?

894
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,495

895
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,873
LIM DONG-GYU REPORTED HIMSELF
FOR GAMBLING ABROAD.

896
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,709

897
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,503
LIM DONG-GYU IS SUSPENDED FOR 72 GAMES.

898
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,297
DONG-GYU DOESN'T SHOW UP AT TRAINING

899
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,090
LIM DONG-GYU IN SECLUSION

900
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,973
Several incidents have happened.

901
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,686
Let me say something
which will be hard for you to understand.

902
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,048
Mr. Kang.

903
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,471
I'm here to ask you...

904
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,473
a difficult question.

905
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,266
Go on.

906
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,911
Mr. Lim.

907
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,292
The public has already
turned their backs on you.

908
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,877
I doubt your number will be retired.

909
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,796
RETIRING A NUMBER TO HONOR CONTRIBUTIONS

910
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,422
Considering the past cases,

911
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,758
you won't be able to play
half the games this season.

912
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,596

913
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,600
The Dreams have
to compensate them for it too.

914
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,686
But...

915
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,856
do you remember what you told me before?

916
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,693
Why you wanted to stay in the Dreams.

917
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,657
A man who slipped a 1,000-won bill
in your hand. A woman who...

918
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,159
sold dried filefish.

919
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,703
Children who cheered for victory.

920
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:02,710
These people might still be willing
to smile at you.

921
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,717
Do you want to retire on the Dreams?

922
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,141
Instead,

923
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,518
you need to settle your dark history.

924
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,814
You have to stay away from lowlifes
and respect me...

925
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,818
because I'll respect you too.

926
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,197
-At that time...
-And...

927
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,950
you should not judge your colleagues.

928
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,704
You've also got to do
what you called making friends.

929
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,541
You need to change everything
except for your talents.

930
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,752
It'd be impossible
if you were the same Lim Dong-gyu.

931
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,922
Mr. Lim.

932
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,302
Let me ask you one more time.

933
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,139
Do you want to retire...

934
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,558
on the Dreams?

935
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,440
Retiring...

936
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,735
on the Dreams...

937
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,706
I will...

938
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,711
go to the Dreams.

939
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,757
I will begin...

940
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,719
negotiating with Mr. Kim Jong-moo.

941
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,952
SPECIAL THANKS, KIM HWAN, JUNG GANG HEE

942
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,353
How shameless.

943
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,980
I'm putting Lim Dong-gyu up for auction.

944
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,357
We should make a suggestion
that better satisfies Mr. Kim.

945
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,026
This is the first time
I disagree with the general manager.

946
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,736
-Are you joking?
-No, I'm not.

947
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,363
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Baek.

948
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,198
Is Mr. Baek playing a power game again?

949
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,825
I did this without letting anyone know.

950
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,578
You talk as if you'll disappear
all of a sudden.

951
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,538
Ms. Lee. We have a problem.

952
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,291
We will never be able
to understand each other.
