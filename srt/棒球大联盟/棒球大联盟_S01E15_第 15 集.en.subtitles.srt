1
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,950
This drama is fiction
and the elements of the story

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,326
have no relation to reality.

3
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,713
Is something wrong, Mr. Baek?

4
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,301
If you put pressure on your eyes,

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,511
you'll end up wearing glasses like me.

6
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,346
This has no scientific proof.

7
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,224
If you're going to act this way,
just disband us at once,

8
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,060
instead of making me sick.

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,352
Mr. Baek.

10
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,605
Let's have a conversation
with these doors open.

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,899
You act all rational,

12
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,693
as if your actions are all calculated.

13
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,403
The others should also know

14
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,655
that you're actually a psycho.

15
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,370
You must feel certain
that this trade was problematic.

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,123
Can our team win right away?

17
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,375
Do the experts say so?

18
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,046
We surely could have
without that lousy trade.

19
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,674
Without the hindrance of these buffoons

20
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,135
who don't respect the hard work
of some people,

21
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,554
we could have won a thousand times.

22
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,932
You now talk in non-honorifics.

23
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,850
But that isn't the case.

24
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,019
That's not how you operate
a baseball team.

25
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,897
We have to prepare for the future.

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,650
Can you truly say you care
about the future without shame?

27
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,111
Yes, I can without any hesitation.

28
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,824
Our team's most suited manner

29
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,492
of management is re-building.

30
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,827
PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,246
Between the manager,
who's responsible on the field,

32
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,374
and me, the most responsible
regarding management.

33
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,627
You may ask why you were excluded,

34
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,632
but I felt you wouldn't make
that much of a difference.

35
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,760
You're saying
Song Il-kwon and Lee Chi-sang

36
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,178
can replace Kang Doo-ki?

37
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,265
Their Futures League records are poor

38
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,475
and they're in their early 30s.

39
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,061
How can you call that re-building?

40
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,109
Should I call it extraordinary?

41
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,446
How about this?

42
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,574
The two players' swings

43
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,451
were extraordinary.

44
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,663
If I say this,

45
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,167
I'm sure it can go against
the statistics you're pointing out.

46
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,837
Did you study natural sciences?

47
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,047
I studied social sciences.

48
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,759
One of them is a pitcher.

49
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,928
One of them...

50
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,680
is a pitcher.

51
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,848
Then,

52
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,894
one player's swing and the other's pitch

53
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,104
were extraordinary. Okay?

54
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,065
When it comes to baseball,

55
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,358
you never know.

56
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,904
If Song Il-kwon and Lee Chi-sang

57
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,532
suddenly do incredibly well
and Kang Doo-ki doesn't,

58
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,491
what will you do?

59
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,661
Would you answer the same way
if the fans ask?

60
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,497
Manager Yoon will answer like that.

61
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,625
We're going to focus on playing baseball.

62
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,712
Baseball centered on management
doesn't fit well in Korea,

63
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,506
so I'm going to be supporting
Manager Yoon.

64
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,927
You're going home pretty soon,

65
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,637
so stop trying to interfere.

66
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,390
He's Manager Yoon, who you trusted so much

67
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,017
to sign a three-year contract.

68
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,313
Mr. Baek,
if you have anything to say, say it.

69
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,567
You have nothing to say.

70
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,947
I guess I won today's argument.

71
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,493
You're going to get a rash
when you get home.

72
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,144
What is this?

73
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,150
I guess you and I weren't meant
to play together.

74
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,361
Does someone hate you?

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,657
Does it make sense to trade
those two with you?

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,915
How many players are able
to play on the team they want?

77
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,167
I guess...

78
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,921
I'm just not lucky.

79
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,298
Is it...

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,676
Baek Seung-soo again?

81
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,970
Do you still not know the GM?

82
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,221
Then, who the heck is it?

83
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,560
Lim Dong-gyu,

84
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,397
you should just stick to
batting home runs,

85
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,484
hitting

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,278
and running.

87
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,448
That's all.

88
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,284
What a fool.

89
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,251
I'M STRONGER THAN WHAT I BELIEVE

90
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,677
I made a promise as soon as I came here

91
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,554
to only get criticized three times.

92
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,891
I'm leaving without keeping my word.

93
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,812
I'm the one who couldn't keep my word.

94
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,398
I know that this wasn't

95
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,234
your will.

96
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,739
-Again, I--
-Mr. Baek.

97
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,785
You've already dreamed of so many things

98
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,287
and are fighting to protect them.

99
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,082
It just so happened that

100
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,043
I became one dream that fell off.

101
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,797
Please don't lose the others

102
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,716
trying to pick me back up.

103
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,555
You won't be able to protect
all of your dreams.

104
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,267
You can't break down like this every time.

105
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,103
Thank you

106
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,273
for letting me have my own dreams

107
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,650
even for a little while.

108
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:34,203
AGAIN, NEW DREAMS FOR 2020

109
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,497
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK SEUNG-SOO

110
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,795
Yes.

111
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,932
Are you not going to ask the manager?

112
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:56,893
Ask what?

113
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,353
You said the manager agreed.

114
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,938
It's not important.

115
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,067
Regardless, Kwon Kyung-min wanted
to do it and he had his way.

116
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,697
But shouldn't we still check
the manager's stance?

117
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,367
No.

118
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,369
I don't want to do so.

119
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,248
Then, I'll check myself.

120
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,542
There are some things

121
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,544
even you can't do.

122
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,464
But Mr. Baek.

123
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,717
You can't feel at a loss for long.

124
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,886
Be sad...

125
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,055
only for today.

126
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,491
Did you really agree?

127
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,246
Manager.

128
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,164
Please tell me.

129
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,961
Why are you asking me this?

130
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,630
Kang Doo-ki cannot be replaced
by any player.

131
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,966
Why trade him
for two second-string players?

132
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,301
Was it wrong of me

133
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,015
to use my authority to help form the team?

134
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,393
You know how hard
the general manager worked

135
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,813
to help protect your authority.

136
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,276
If you discussed this even slightly
with the general manager,

137
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,946
I would gladly accept any result, but--

138
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,781
I don't expect you to understand.

139
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,409
Just blame me for all this.

140
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,870
So you expect us to just blame you

141
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,290
and give up on our dreams?

142
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,542
I really felt

143
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,961
that we could win this time.

144
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,463
You felt it when we had the practice match

145
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,756

146
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,384
It's partly the general manager's fault

147
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,512
for appointing an incompetent manager

148
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,806
without any winning experience.

149
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,934
You keep spitting out

150
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,187
words that you don't mean.

151
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,482
It does seem like you agreed to the trade.

152
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,235
I'm now sure that you aren't

153
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,696
proud of your decision.

154
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,950
I have to straighten this out.

155
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,204
PLAYERS OF THE DREAMS

156
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:32,965
Darn it.

157
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,927
Have you had dinner?

158
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,220
Not yet.

159
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,016
I felt too lazy to cook dinner tonight.

160
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,601
So I ordered yours too.

161
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,436
What did you order?

162
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,772
Oh, boy.

163
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,523
The food is here. Oh, boy.

164
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,275
-Enjoy your food.
-Yes.

165
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,613
Here's our food. Here.

166
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,283
They deliver hot dogs now?

167
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,827
Do your knees hurt?

168
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,290
It's about time they hurt.
I haven't felt pain for a while.

169
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
Look.

170
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,927
Right. I bought two pairs of socks for you
on my way home.

171
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,053
They're on your bed.

172
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,639
You should have bought more
while you were at it.

173
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,016
I'm short of socks
and have no time for laundry.

174
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,102
They had a sign in the store

175
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,770
saying, "The boss has gone crazy."

176
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,315
And they were pretending to give
discounts on everything.

177
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,859
But then I thought about it,

178
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,779
and it was way more expensive
than the ones sold on the truck.

179
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,531
They must have better quality.

180
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,699
No. First of all,

181
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,619
the phrase "the boss has gone
crazy" itself is strange.

182
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,871
Our boss has also gone crazy.

183
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,790
Listen.

184
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,835
When your boss is crazy,
shut down the store.

185
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,296
How could they put up
a banner about it and sell more?

186
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,174
Salesmen never go crazy.

187
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,051
They never sell at a loss.

188
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,807
Mom!

189
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,144
-You startled me.
-My boss is probably not crazy.

190
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,186
You said he was.

191
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,814
No, you said salesmen never sell
at a loss.

192
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,067
They don't. You're the one who's crazy,
not your boss.

193
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,028
Mom, I'll be back.

194
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,324
Are you going to see
that unemployed guy again?

195
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,576
Well...

196
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,246
He should at least have a job.

197
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,373
Any job.

198
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,295
Why did you want to come here and meet?

199
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,881
It's about President Kwon.

200
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,466
Yes.

201
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,593
Why would he have agreed to this trade?

202
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,720
To ruin our team.

203
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,180
But...

204
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,933
even though he has
some connection with the Titans,

205
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,520
isn't this trade only favorable
to the Titans?

206
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,857
What do you mean?

207
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,526
Though he's behaving that way
in our baseball team,

208
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,279
he's recognized for his capability
in the head office.

209
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,322
The same person

210
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,782
wouldn't be that generous

211
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,202
to give out Kang Doo-ki.

212
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,164
We were only seeing him
as a piece of trash

213
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,958
and we might have overlooked
his businessman side.

214
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,671
I understand.

215
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,964
It's a good opinion.

216
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,799
You should go home now.

217
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,676
Mr. Baek.

218
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,555
Please

219
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,100
don't blame yourself and think
that you failed to protect

220
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,478
Kang Doo-ki.

221
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,980
Have I protected him then?

222
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,275
For now, we should figure out what to do

223
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,485
with Mr. Kwon's move.

224
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,570
It's already been done,

225
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,697
and what can we do to solve it?

226
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,158
Since what happened is very serious,

227
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,869
let's put our heads together
to come up with a solution.

228
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,497
Kang Doo-ki isn't the only player
on our team.

229
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,625
He's a piece of the numerous
puzzles I've put together

230
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,544
for how we could win the championship,

231
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,587
and he was always the fundamental piece.

232
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,049
So we can't win the championship?

233
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,093
Probably not.

234
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,971
Mr. Baek, we have

235
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,558
Gil Chang-ju who came from America
and faced criticism,

236
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,018
Yoo Min-ho who finally overcame his yips,

237
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,396
Lim Dong-gyu who was born a new person,

238
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,107
Seo Yeong-ju who lives with injuries
every day,

239
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,276
and Jang Jin-woo who pitches
with the thought

240
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,236
that this will be his last.

241
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,780
There are still so many players
we must protect.

242
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,410
I had a goal different from yours.

243
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,954
It wasn't winning the championship.

244
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,123
It was to have a team that hates to lose

245
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,749
then goes out to win the next day.

246
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,294
To become a team
that persistently plays hard

247
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,756
to wear out the opponents
even when it loses big time.

248
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,051
From the experience I've had
in the world of sports,

249
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,636
not many people were

250
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,181
guaranteed their future
even when they won the championship.

251
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,642
When you talked about
your goal for a championship,

252
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,394
I liked your spirit.

253
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,147
But on your view that
other than a championship

254
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,607
is meaningless,

255
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,818
I could never agree with you.

256
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,821
Really? Do you think we'd
have come this far

257
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,364
if I hadn't won any before?

258
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,867
The reason we started having faith in you

259
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,119
is not because of your career
in championships.

260
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,708
It was because of your responsible side
that you've shown us here.

261
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,502
You could drop down

262
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,671
or take a break.

263
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,757
I couldn't change your mind.

264
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,552
I'll just have to work harder.

265
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,021
The Dreams are in agony
because we can't win the championship?

266
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,857
It suffocates me

267
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,568
just by thinking about it.

268
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,851
BAEK SEUNG-SOO

269
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,771
I'm taking a leave today.

270
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,398
Sure.

271
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,149
Take care of your internal injury.

272
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,365
What is that?

273
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,504
Trading for no reason!
Step down, Mr. Baek!

274
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,506
-Step down!
-Step down!

275
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,509
Retract Kang Doo-ki's trade!

276
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,428
-Retract it!
-Retract it!

277
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,304
We miss you, Kang Doo-ki!

278
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,140
-Kang Doo-ki!
-Kang Doo-ki!

279
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,101
An incompetent general manager!
Step down, Mr. Baek!

280
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,894
-Step down!
-Step down!

281
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,149
Trading for no reason!
Step down, Mr. Baek!

282
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,692
-Step down!
-Step down!

283
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,737
Retract Kang Doo-ki's trade!

284
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,572
-Retract it!
-Retract it!

285
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,490
We miss you, Kang Doo-ki!

286
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,492
-Kang Doo-ki!
-Kang Doo-ki!

287
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,244
Mr. Jang.

288
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:18,912
Yes.

289
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,372
How are those people

290
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,960
here on a weekday afternoon?

291
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,629
They could be jobless.

292
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,300
Or they could have taken a leave.

293
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,010
A leave?

294
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,471
Looking at the business trucks,

295
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,182
it seems some of them are self-employed.

296
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,975
But baseball is

297
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,186
only a hobby.

298
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,398
-Pardon?
-Isn't baseball a hobby?

299
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,817
They bet their livelihood

300
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,111
on a hobby?

301
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,363
Director... Excuse me.

302
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,532
President Kwon.

303
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,450
What?

304
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,744
There are some people.

305
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,870
What?

306
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,039
There are such people

307
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,625
who bet their livelihood

308
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,794
on a hobby.

309
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,715
Whatever.

310
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,383
Step down, Mr. Baek!

311
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,427
-Step down!
-Step down!

312
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,180
Mr. Baek who traded...

313
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,121
Stand up!

314
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,290
What?

315
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,458
SCOUT TEAM LEADER

316
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,088
Stand up.

317
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,758
I said, stand up!

318
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,177
Why

319
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,263
are you screaming

320
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,556
-and making a fuss?
-Don't.

321
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,766
Bow.

322
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,936
Who are you?

323
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,692
Who are you to act this way?

324
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,778
What's going on?

325
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,700
You're here.

326
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,204
Tell them who I am.

327
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,999
He's Chairperson Kwon Il-do's son,

328
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,834
Vice President Kwon Kyung-jun.

329
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,460
Goodness.

330
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,009
Stop it.

331
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,386
You don't know how far I can go,

332
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,889
and how far you have to put up with,
do you?

333
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,351
I can do anything I want,

334
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,606
and you have to put up with it
until the end.

335
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,107
Let's go inside and talk.

336
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,483
Is that your wish?

337
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,403
Okay.

338
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,913
This is ridiculous.

339
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,165
There's another crazy jerk.

340
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,752
CEO KWON KYUNG-MIN

341
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,379
I have good news for you.

342
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,341
Take a guess.

343
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,101
First, I might settle old baggage.

344
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,521
As the next chairperson of Jaesong Group,

345
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,651
I may be able to forgive you.

346
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,824
Isn't that great news?

347
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,585
And I'm

348
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,296
hitting you in a way that it won't show.

349
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,175
There's one more great news.

350
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,552
About what you said you wanted to do,

351
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,722
it's going very well.

352
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,979
Do you want to arm wrestle?

353
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,566
As you all know,

354
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,319
a trade which no one is happy about
was made.

355
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,530
Followed by the off-season training,

356
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,573
now we even have to suspect

357
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,285
if President Kwon Kyung-min
from our parent company

358
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,911
wishes to maintain our team.

359
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,289
I doubt he wants to ruin the team.

360
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,581
But the thing is...

361
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,543
he isn't letting the team work properly.

362
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,087
Where is the GM?

363
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,714
He took a day off.

364
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,590
He needs time.

365
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,094
It's obvious he's blaming himself
somewhere alone.

366
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,347
Isn't it better if he just joins us
so we can discuss together?

367
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,975
But why are they doing this much?

368
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,103
The team costs them money,
but it didn't bring results.

369
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,397
We're going to make results
and earn money too.

370
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,400
They think it's too late.

371
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,736
Actually,

372
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,780
there have been rumors
that the team would be sold off

373
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,906
for two or three years.

374
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,744
Since Mr. Kwon became
the acting club owner,

375
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,913
he met with big companies.
Why do you think he did that?

376
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,249
The players and coaching staff

377
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,501
only play baseball.

378
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,588
We're the only ones who can stop this.

379
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,466
We're the management.

380
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,720
Instead of talking
about the current situation,

381
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,388
let's find

382
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,432
what we must do.

383
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,893
It's not that we're forcing you.

384
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,104
Due to the continuous
incomprehensible management,

385
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,607
a few players including me

386
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,817
are going to boycott training.

387
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,402
You're free to join or not.

388
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,782
We never want to force you.

389
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,658
We welcome voluntary participation,

390
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,410
but if you force anyone,

391
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,371
we'll consider you
just as evil as the new president.

392
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,664
You heard him, right?

393
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,500
Like Jin-woo said,

394
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,045
he and I will be absent from the training.

395
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,007
This is never compulsory.

396
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,178
Okay?

397
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,596
-Okay.
-Okay.

398
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,186
It strangely sounds compulsory
when you say it.

399
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,813
What?

400
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,564
The mood was great earlier.

401
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,833
Mr. Yoon.

402
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,960
I heard it was you.

403
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,545
Is it true

404
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,589
you went along with the president
on the trade?

405
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,010
Don't be frustrating and say something!

406
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,387
You see,

407
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,598
players couldn't train off-season,

408
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,643
but we even gave up
our family trips to train them

409
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,019
because we were embarrassed.

410
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,272
We couldn't

411
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,441
rest like the others
when we were that poor at baseball.

412
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,736
How could you trade Kang Doo-ki
for some nobodies?

413
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,029
What were you promised?

414
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,531
What?

415
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,783
Did the president promise you something?

416
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,831
No, Mr. Yoon.

417
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't go like this.

418
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,627
At least say something.

419
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,505
Other teams are training hard
right before the season.

420
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,756
What about us?

421
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,263
I'm disappointed in you!

422
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,897
I worked really hard this time.

423
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,064
I know.

424
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,150
You were back to your old self.

425
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,276
But what?

426
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,739
I worked so hard that we were
able to bring Lim Dong-gyu back,

427
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,782
and they sent Kang Doo-ki off.

428
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,117
This feels horrible.

429
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,622
I'll make more money.

430
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,291
What?

431
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,543
Why would you do something
for the company?

432
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,545
We can let them know

433
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,216
that our franchise is going well
by making better results first, and...

434
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,383
Exactly my point.

435
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,219
And...

436
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,178
Then...

437
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,681
I'll prepare for the press release.

438
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,559
Don't be so worried.

439
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,354
After I was shocked
by the incident last time,

440
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,564
I told them that I'd look for another job.

441
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,609
It'll be cool to get kicked out

442
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,736
for working according to my convictions.

443
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,948
You won't be fired for a press release
on better results.

444
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,949
No.

445
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:39,246
It's going to be a special article
about what Jaesong Group has done

446
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,998
to the Dreams the whole time.

447
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,462
What are you doing,
strategy analysis team?

448
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,797
We are...

449
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,342
preparing materials
for the special article.

450
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,892
What is the article about?

451
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,143
It's obvious.

452
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,481
"How many wins will the Dreams lose
without Kang Doo-ki?"

453
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,983
-Good.
-Wow.

454
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,319
I'm not so desperate about my place,

455
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,071
but when the press release gets out,

456
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,115
I might really get fired.

457
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,325
Then what should I do?

458
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,829
You must have a lot of connections
because you're a scouter, so...

459
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,247
That's not exactly true.

460
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,457
-Hey!
-He's not a friendly type.

461
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,417
You little...

462
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:33,258
Then use all your connections
to spread this.

463
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,678
What we're about to do

464
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,848
may not have any influence
on the president.

465
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,808
But I hope

466
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,811
it makes him reconsider

467
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,897
doing as he pleases, at least.

468
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,403
Mr. Baek.

469
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,905
I thought you took your day off.

470
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,532
I rested a little during the day.

471
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,743
The Dreams

472
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,871
don't work without me yet.

473
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,418
Let me see the minutes.

474
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,544
Okay.

475
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,300
DISCUSSED ITEMS ON THE AGENDA

476
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,389
All of you mustered up your courage.

477
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,141
DISCUSSED ITEMS ON THE AGENDA

478
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,934
For timid people.

479
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,148
It's quite constructive.

480
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,735
First, we need to show them
our determination

481
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,320
so the same thing won't repeat.

482
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:39,616
and take action
based on what you've discussed.

483
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,286
But I'd like us to think

484
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,455
about taking one more step from this too.

485
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,502
It's whether the Dreams
have to be a part of Jaesong.

486
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,446
It's been a while
since I visited the hospital.

487
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,658
Is it still right for visitors
to bring something like this?

488
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,706
From Lim Dong-gyu who was immature

489
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,292
to Ko Se-hyuk and Kwon Kyung-min.

490
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,589
I could put up with all their evil deeds.

491
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,133
But

492
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,303
I'm not okay with the betrayal
of someone I trusted.

493
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,559
I told you it was
for the sake of the team.

494
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,982
I'm sure you're burdened
with your son's hospital fees.

495
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,401
There were times when I thought

496
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,988
I could do anything for my family.

497
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,573
However,

498
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,744
as many different interests
are entangled with each other,

499
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,954
what I did for my family...

500
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,792
ended up harming

501
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,170
someone else's family.

502
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,133
What did he promise you?

503
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,806
I cannot answer.

504
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,977
Jaesong Group seemed pretty busy.

505
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,524
I've dropped the thought
that you'd do me a favor

506
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,860
since you're a good person.

507
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,741
I've come here because I need you
even though you betrayed me.

508
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,245
Instead of depending on the cause,

509
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,040
I came here to persuade you

510
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,375
that your practical interests

511
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,503
will be better met with me.

512
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,404
The Dreams became the heroes
of the stove league

513
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,406
after Mr. Baek's appointment.

514
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,827
Yesterday, they showed
another incomprehensible trade.

515
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,621
They let go of Kim Kwan-sik
and Yeon Joong-sub,

516
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,123
two promising players,
to bring Lim Dong-gyu back.

517
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,335
But trading Kang Doo-ki with
Song Il-sang and Lee Chi-kwon--

518
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,837
It's Il-kwon and Chi-sang.

519
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,296
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,423
Anyway, trading him with such players

521
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,842
is total nonsense.

522
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,135
The Dreams have reduced the total salaries

523
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,637
of the players by 30 percent.

524
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,140
It must be a harsh winter
for the Dreams players.

525
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,518
They're also having
spring training in Korea.

526
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,396
When I heard that, I couldn't believe it.

527
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,273
They should've trained in Jeju Island.

528
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,651
If Jaesong plans not to take
care of the club any longer--

529
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,194
That'd be enough.

530
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,824
Anyway, the Dreams have changed
since the new general manager...

531
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,743
Why does that pretty lady

532
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,829
criticize your company all the time?

533
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,831
Does it bother you?

534
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,499
You don't like my club.

535
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,500
I don't.

536
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,086
But it's a company that hired you,

537
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,673
so watching her speaking ill of it,
I get riled up.

538
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,632
Come on!

539
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,052
You have nothing to do with it!
Why do you hate the Dreams only?

540
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,513
Calm down, Mom.

541
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,932
She's helping our team now.

542
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,351
What are you talking about?

543
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,646
Only I can talk bad about it
for the sake of the team.

544
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,024
No, it's not just you.

545
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,152
The leader of the PR team
asked her to do so

546
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,613
to make the Dreams become
a sound and decent team.

547
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,948
Why? Does he enjoy being backbitten?

548
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,075
Someone would feel guilty by this.

549
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,208
This is Lee Se-young,
the operations manager.

550
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,711
Sorry?

551
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,551
Okay. We'll also try to reach him.

552
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,888
I'll get back to you. Bye.

553
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:21,981
Mr. Baek.

554
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,651
-I got a call from the Titans.
-Okay.

555
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,153
They say Kang Doo-ki has been
out of touch.

556
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,404
Okay.

557
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,198
Wait.

558
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,451
You must know something.

559
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,828
I think there's an article about it.

560
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,288
About what?

561
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,125
About the rumor that Kang Doo-ki
might retire soon.

562
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,585
Why?

563
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,671
It's to make the situation worse

564
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,673
so that everyone can notice what's dirty.

565
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,884
What?

566
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,552
Don't most people

567
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,223
want to share only the good things?

568
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,309
Kang Doo-ki will retire?

569
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,560
KANG DOO-KI MIGHT RETIRE

570
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,437
He's trying all kinds of tricks.

571
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,732
He can never retire like this.

572
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,903
He'd never be able to give up
his salary. Don't you think so?

573
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,156
We never know. It's Kang Doo-ki.

574
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,283
What about him?

575
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,618
Doesn't he like money?

576
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,620
He already earned enough.

577
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,288
It's still chicken feed.

578
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,084
I'm sure

579
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,878
he's got pride too.

580
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,465
What about you?

581
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,010
You don't have it?

582
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,762
Yes, I do too.

583
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,472
Mr. Jang.

584
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,476
Just be honest with me.

585
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,688
I'm quite quick-witted
and can read others' minds.

586
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,648
Why do you lie?

587
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,152
You've lost your pride

588
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,030
since you're working under me?

589
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,490
No, sir.

590
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,083
You used to be very busy working
like the scouting team.

591
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,044
You must feel suffocated now.

592
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,801
I didn't fire you along with Ko Se-hyuk

593
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,847
because I believed you weren't
that filthy-minded.

594
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,770
Ko Se-hyuk isn't a filthy guy.

595
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,521
If you aren't so clear-headed

596
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,566
that you end up believing
Se-hyuk did it all for reason

597
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,777
even if things seemed suspicious,

598
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,239
we can't fire you just because of that.

599
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:40,870
Fidelity is sometimes used
to cover up dirty flaws,

600
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,164
but I don't see it as a bad thing.

601
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:44,916
But...

602
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,002
what about this case?

603
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,466
Is any feeling of loyalty still in you?

604
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,261
Are you telling me

605
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,139
I should betray President Kwon?

606
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,811
You got it wrong. I'm not saying
you should betray him.

607
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,146
But you should report the injustice
you've seen.

608
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,648
Why should I?

609
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,942
How long has baseball fed you?

610
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,444
A year for you.
And for me, I can't even count it.

611
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,030
You do have a passion
and pride for baseball.

612
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:20,243
But why do you help him ruin baseball?

613
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,620
You hate me.

614
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,039
Is that why you sided with him?

615
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,001
You don't know

616
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,005
how frightening the consequences
of whistle-blowing are

617
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,882
because you've gone places.

618
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,425
I do know.

619
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,261
Then, how could you

620
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,555
contact those young boys
including Lee Chang-kwon

621
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,473
and Lee Yong-jae to fire Ko Se-hyuk?

622
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,226
And you should've taken
responsibility for it.

623
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,186
You should've called them.

624
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,523
and checked
if Se-hyuk still bothered them.

625
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,732
But you never do that!

626
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,443
I do.

627
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,903
What?

628
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,946
Stop lying.

629
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,785
Here. I'm doing it.

630
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,913
LEE CHANG-KWON, LEE YONG-JAE

631
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,749
Thank you for your reminder.

632
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,420
I was going to stop it
thinking I've done enough,

633
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,589
but I will keep them in check longer.

634
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,424
You did it.

635
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,845
I hope you can return as
the assistant chief of the scout team,

636
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,222
and for that,
I'll take all the responsibility.

637
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,433
Mr. Jang,

638
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,768
where is the dual contract?

639
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:34,025
Even if President Kwon didn't
really like Kang Doo-ki,

640
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,319
he wouldn't have sold him like that

641
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,821
because he'd known his market value.

642
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,824
He must've received money
using another account.

643
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,869
And he's too loyal to have
gobbled up the money alone.

644
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,997
I'm sure he sent it to the head office.
The dual contract...

645
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,918
Where is it?

646
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,814
Can you swear you'll never tell
I gave you this?

647
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,816
Yes. It's me who stole this.

648
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,619
PLAYERS TRADING CONTRACT

649
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:30,456
THE TITANS SHOULD GIVE TWO BILLION WON
TO THE DREAMS.

650
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,127
PRESIDENT KWON KYUNG-MIN,
PRESIDENT HAN BONG YANG

651
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,050
Kyung-min.

652
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,427
What's the two billion won about?

653
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,182
The team will be disbanded soon anyway,
so I sold a decent item.

654
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,644
It would've been fine
if you took the money.

655
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,771
It belongs to Jaesong.

656
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,064
Good.

657
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,152
You just need to do good work
in whichever position you are.

658
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,988
If you do so,

659
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,990
I'll hear about it.

660
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,785
So you made up with Kyung-jun?

661
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,246
I did.

662
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,998
We resolved a misunderstanding.

663
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,459
You can back down
as an elder cousin, right?

664
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,253
Absolutely.

665
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:21,549
You know he's a stubborn boy
who never gives way to others.

666
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,845
But you'll always yield to him, right?

667
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,389
Yes, I can.

668
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,557
Great.

669
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,310
You're really ready to come back.

670
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,271
Yes. I'm still working hard to do so.

671
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,322
President Kwon!

672
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,035
You look much brighter.

673
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,287
It's all thanks to you.

674
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:56,042
How could you let me work
in the head office

675
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,586
when you were demoted?

676
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,880
It's to establish my connection.

677
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,549
You're not an ordinary young guy.

678
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,137
How is it going?

679
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,266
All that's left is the signing.

680
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,894
I'm glad to hear that.

681
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,523
If we had known it would go this smoothly,

682
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,692
we wouldn't have sold Kang Doo-ki.

683
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,986
We could just disband the team.

684
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:32,244
Baek Seung-soo and Lee Se-young
would make a fuss again. Gosh.

685
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,707
I'm so sick of this team.

686
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,044
Now,

687
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,713
you'll forget about
that sick baseball team

688
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,256
and return to the head office.

689
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,510
I will.

690
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,725
He sold Kang Doo-ki
for two billion won only.

691
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,687
Then, what will you do now?

692
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,564
I'll try to count on KPB.

693
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,567
Mr. Baek.

694
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,530
President Kwon might be dismissed
this time.

695
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,408
But if the next president thinks
you're the whistleblower...

696
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,785
What will happen then?

697
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,081
You might also have to resign.

698
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,127
It doesn't matter.

699
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,003
Why not?

700
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,340
We should at least compare
the losses we'll suffer

701
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,466
and he'll suffer.

702
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,849
As I was returning,

703
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,810
my contract has been revised.

704
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,728
My term in the office is

705
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,439
until this spring.

706
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,406
Mr. Kwon had a strong will.

707
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,117
I hurt his pride a bit,

708
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,161
and tried to disobey
the chairperson's order

709
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,287
to take me back in.

710
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,331
So I made a compromise plan.

711
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,294
What about the salary you were guaranteed?

712
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,548
It's very awkward to get paid
without working.

713
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,470
After I leave,

714
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,513
if anything else seems unjust,

715
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,018
I hope you'll stand up to it

716
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,770
confidently, even on the side of the weak.

717
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,525
You might have to
free up your hands and fight.

718
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,821
It would have been better if we won
the championship before I left.

719
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,327
But for not making a team
that doesn't care

720
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,872
even when the key player is traded,

721
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,373
I'm satisfied.

722
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,880
At least it's a team

723
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,715
that points out problems

724
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,842
if there is one.

725
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,012
That's it for today.

726
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,053
As you see, this is a dual contract.

727
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,643
Kang Doo-ki's trade was
against common sense

728
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,186
in every way.

729
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,649
So I presumed that there would be
a dual contract like this.

730
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,778
I sincerely apologize again

731
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,780
that the Dreams caused another problem.

732
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,908
But...

733
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,661
I wanted to show you all

734
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,122
that we're a team with self-purification.

735
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,749
As the general manager of Dreams,

736
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,545
I request an overall invalidation
of this trade.

737
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,505
Thank you.

738
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,134
KPB will set up

739
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,344
a special investigation committee

740
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,513
with experts of law and accounting.

741
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,559
They will be investigating the trade
between the Dreams and the Titans.

742
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,649
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK SEUNG-SOO

743
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,780
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK SEUNG-SOO

744
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,368
Hello?

745
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,164
Yes, Manager Yoon.

746
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,209
The investigation will begin,
and no evidence will be

747
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,003
stronger than the dual contract.

748
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,422
You're now in a situation

749
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,925
where it wouldn't mean more than
repenting of your wrongdoings

750
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,845
even if you testified. It's too late.

751
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,142
There are talks about Jaesong Group
and Gangseong Group

752
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,144
preparing for a big deal

753
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,521
based on a reliable source
in the stock market.

754
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,775
You must know why it's Gangseong Group.

755
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,903
It's a firm that's strong
in heavy industry.

756
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,530
Jaesong Group wanted to be

757
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,908
more than a consumer goods company
for a long time.

758
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,495
Gangseong Group was very interested
in the shopping business.

759
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:28,916
If this big deal of switching
their main fields of business,

760
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,211
Jaesong Group won't have to be
conscious of public opinion.

761
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:37,007
And then they'll instantly announce
the breakup of the Dreams.

762
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,386
And Mr. Kwon will return
to the head office.

763
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,931
Unlike Mr. Kwon who chose Jaesong Group,

764
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,141
I have no other option.

765
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,894
But during my remaining term,

766
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,604
I've set a goal.

767
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,899
No matter what,

768
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,610
I want to protect the Dreams.

769
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,492
Will you be a manager
who was abandoned by Jaesong Group,

770
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,245
or a manager that stays in the Dreams?

771
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,626
Is it too late now?

772
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,129
Yes, it's too late.

773
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,005
Is it?

774
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,342
Yes.

775
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,928
It must be.

776
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,597
It's too late to restore
my personal trust in you.

777
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,182
However,

778
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,018
it's not yet too late to work with me.

779
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,896
Unfortunately,

780
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,941
I haven't found a better manager
than you yet.

781
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,610
Please come to the KPB right now.

782
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,404
I'll be waiting.

783
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,918
WHERE IS THE TWO BILLION WON
THE DREAMS MADE?

784
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,629
FIRST-STRINGER GETS TRADED
FOR TWO BILLION WON

785
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,131
WORDS RELATED TO JAESONG GROUP

786
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,799
TOP FIVE WORDS JAESONG GROUP

787
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,261
IS KWON KYUNG-MIN OUT OF HIS MIND?

788
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:08,807
APOLOGIZE, JAESONG GROUP.

789
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:13,020
BULLETIN BOARD FOR DREAMS FANS

790
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,190
Okay. I think that's good enough.

791
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,692
Public opinion is now on our side.

792
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,405
Now, there could be

793
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,450
fans complaining that Mr. Baek is
a whistle-blower

794
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,285
or the president could pressure him.

795
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,496
At that moment, we must act together.

796
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,956
If the president gets replaced,

797
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,584
won't they write a new contract for him?

798
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,877
For Mr. Baek?

799
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,794
Yes.

800
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,631
-Why?
-Well...

801
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,382
You all seem to like Mr. Baek now.

802
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,429
What's not to like?
Stop being absurd all of a sudden.

803
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,600
More people are protesting
to invalidate Kang Doo-ki's trade.

804
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,978
The decision of the KPB seems hopeful too.

805
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,564
They must have been surprised.

806
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,443
Jaesong Group isn't even
in financial difficulty.

807
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,696
So no one knew they would run
the team this way.

808
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,284
OPERATIONS LEADER TITANS

809
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,167
Could it be a call of complaint?

810
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,419
They're in no position to complain.

811
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,590
Anyway, I'm answering the phone.

812
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,550
Excuse me.

813
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:27,970
Hello?

814
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,932
No.

815
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:33,850
About that...

816
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,187
Yes, we should.

817
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,648
I understand.

818
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,483
Yes.

819
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,903
Yes, goodbye. Yes.

820
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,455
Hurry up and tell us.

821
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,834
What was it about?

822
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,423
The Titans are...

823
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,977
Before the KPB makes a decision,

824
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,521
they want to...

825
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,860
invalidate the trade.

826
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,740
This is the Dreams!

827
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,286
-This is the Dreams.
-This is the Dreams!

828
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,456
-Well done, everyone.
-That's a relief.

829
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,709
-Nice.
-Goodness.

830
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,337
This turned out very well.

831
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,675
KANG DOO-KI

832
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,063
Hey.

833
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,776
We boycotted our training because of you.

834
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,654
How could you be so shameless
and train by yourself?

835
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,198
Right. It's a bit of a cheap move.

836
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,826
Are you trying to make
30 wins or something?

837
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,620
Welcome back.

838
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,623
Whether I'm here or not,

839
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,334
it's wrong for players to not train.

840
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,836
Why didn't you train?

841
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,129
-We should.
-Yes.

842
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,756
Let's train together.

843
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,257
-Let's go!
-Yes!

844
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,218
Here we go.

845
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,392
Kang Doo-ki...

846
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,977
Doo-ki!

847
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,862
Manager Yoon.

848
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,074
They have to make up for their training.

849
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,702
It's not the time to loosen up.
Where are you going?

850
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,787
I'm sorry.

851
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,871
About what?

852
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,832
You can slowly repay for this

853
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,875
by buying us meat and drinks from now on.

854
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,212
You should learn how to act

855
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,673
like nothing happened, okay?

856
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,674
You should learn.

857
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,176
Get your hand off.

858
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,720
It's gross.

859
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,596
Let's go to training, Mr. Yoon.

860
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,182
Give me a break, guys.

861
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,851
Guys!

862
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,104
AGAIN, NEW DREAMS FOR 2020

863
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,108
Is this how the Titans
usually handles things?

864
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,444
You haven't even called me,

865
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,987
and you're canceling the trade?

866
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,574
But I reported it all to the chairman.

867
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,911
You must've discussed something
with the chairman.

868
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,832
I didn't say I'd take that money.

869
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,002
Jaesong Group and Gangseong Group

870
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,129
have made a big deal.

871
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,922
This deal is worth a trillion won

872
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,883
and mainly focuses

873
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:56,720
on Jaesong's heavy industry
and Gangseong's shopping business.

874
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,514
As the two groups switch
their major businesses,

875
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,433
it's expected to have a great impact.

876
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,561
Oh, right.

877
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,439
Jaesong has a baseball franchise,
doesn't it?

878
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,566
What will you do about it?

879
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,818
Jaesong is based on
the heavy industry now,

880
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,403
so why bother minding people?

881
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,238
We'll disband it.

882
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,866
Please be careful
so that it won't have any effect

883
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,994
on our new shopping business.

884
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,038
Sure thing.

885
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,832
A fish has to be cut
into pieces before being sold.

886
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,754
We'll disband it
under the name of Jaesong.

887
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,298
Don't you agree, Kyung-jun?

888
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,301
Yes, we'll cut it into pieces.

889
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,806
But if you sell it off,

890
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,557
the baseball team could remain

891
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,977
and Jaesong Group could get some money.

892
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,314
For 30 years, I was the only one
who was magnanimous enough

893
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,608
to run the baseball club.

894
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,614
We've made a big deal, so let's stop
talking about petty issues like that.

895
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,036
JAESONG AND GANGSEONG'S BIG DEAL

896
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:15,090
JAESONG-GANGSEONG AGREEMENT CEREMONY

897
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,511
You're always clumsy at what you do.

898
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,430
That money is chicken feed.

899
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,433
You watched the news, so get ready.

900
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,894
Write it neatly for the announcement.

901
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,013
CEO KWON KYUNG MIN

902
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,856
THE DREAMS SHOP

903
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,335
Mr. Jang.

904
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:41,927
That dual contract...

905
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,930
Kang Doo-ki's contract.

906
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,725
How did Baek Seung-soo get it?

907
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,645
I'm not sure.

908
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,273
It means he sneaked into my office
and stole it.

909
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,778
What should we do about him?

910
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,823
I did it.

911
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,618
I knew it.

912
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,083
Mr. Jang.

913
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,796
Remember me
as the most generous president.

914
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,384
It's meaningless now.

915
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:25,679
So just get out.

916
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,723
Excuse me then.

917
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,310
Oh, and...

918
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,398
empty my trash can.

919
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,109
Right now.

920
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,132
OPERATIONS MANAGER

921
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:19,024
Well... It's too much of an applause

922
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,151
for turning what was abnormal to normal.

923
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,318
Go back to work.

924
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,696
OPERATIONS MANAGER

925
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,905
Mr. Baek.

926
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,078
I hear you paid a visit to the KPB.

927
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,621
Right.

928
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,707
It's a shame you didn't report it to me.

929
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,918
If you had told me,
I would've driven you there.

930
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,588
Oh, yes?

931
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,716
Mr. Yoon might feel sad about this.

932
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,803
He was quite willing
to proceed with that trade.

933
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,973
Oh, I resolved the misunderstanding
with him.

934
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:52,974
Please don't worry.

935
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,729
You're concerned only about him,

936
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,066
so I guess there aren't
any more misunderstandings left

937
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,401
in the Dreams.

938
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,035
You guys

939
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,079
worked together

940
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,664
as one this time.

941
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,209
I'm very pleased.

942
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,711
Thanks to upper management.

943
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,384
Look at this punk.

944
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,930
Hey. Guess where I'm headed right now.

945
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,849
To a press conference

946
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,853
to announce the disbandment of the Dreams.

947
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,608
Doesn't it sound fun?
Do you want to join me?

948
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,779
No.

949
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,989
I'll be very busy too.

950
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,516
Mr. Kwon has decided to disband the Dreams

951
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,977
as Jaesong Group wants.

952
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,399
Their shopping business
was based on our district,

953
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,569
but as they handed it all over
to a heavy industry company,

954
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,739
they don't have to mind people
in the district anymore.

955
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,951
Jaesong Group is abandoning us,

956
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,786
so we must...

957
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,913
come to a decision too.

958
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,089
In the history of the Dreams,

959
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,008
Jaesong Group

960
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,052
neither had the will to invest
nor any manners.

961
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:57,098
Now it's time we take them out.

962
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,868
I'm President Kwon Kyung-min
of the Jaesong Dreams.

963
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:22,832
I will be making the most important
announcement in the Dreams' history.

964
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,294
JAESONG-GANGSEONG DINING EVENT

965
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,230
Who are you?

966
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,440
You look somewhat familiar.

967
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,608
Move aside.

968
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,488
I'm the Dreams' general manager,
Baek Seung-soo.

969
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:57,951
Due to...

970
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:03,540
the Dreams' poor results
and worsened business performance,

971
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,668
we have decided...

972
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,711
If you give me time...

973
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,050
to disband the Dreams.

974
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,094
I will sell the Dreams off.
