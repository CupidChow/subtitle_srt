1
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,491
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,868
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,333
Cheers.

4
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,297
I get tipsy.

5
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,761
They're here.

6
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,181
Join us.

7
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,350
We can't talk in this atmosphere.
Let's talk later.

8
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,352
Be considerate of me.

9
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,437
I'm a busy man.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,521
Let's talk here.

11
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,066
Don't you think it's a bit uncomfortable?

12
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,983
Wait outside.

13
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,026
No.

14
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,530
I'm the operations manager.
It's my job to have him sign the contract.

15
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,701
So, what about the contract?

16
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,037
The 500 million won is not an option.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,748
Why are you drinking hard liquor
when you have hemorrhoids?

18
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,671
Take a seat first.
Stay outside for a second, girls.

19
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,234
So 500 million won isn't an option.

20
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,704
Will this help you understand how it feels
to have water on your knees?

21
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:07,127
You might bring me a new contract
if you can emphasize with me.

22
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,555
You're insane.

23
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,639
Hey, you.

24
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,393
-You just crossed the line.
-You are the one who crossed the line!

25
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,731
Negotiations are over.

26
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,693
We don't intend to make more offers.

27
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,579
That's what this has come down to.

28
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,917
Come on.

29
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,305
Seriously.

30
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,816
Even though you're angry, don't do
anything that might hurt an athlete.

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,318
Mr. Baek.

32
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,863
You practically wear
the same suit every day.

33
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,490
So seeing him pour alcohol on your pants,

34
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,576
I just got very angry.

35
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,620
These pants aren't expensive.

36
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,497
I know. You know they're cheap
at first glance...

37
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,962
Are you going to trade him?

38
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,674
Let's go.

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,817
Mr. Baek.

40
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,279
We're going to take a break
from salary negotiations today.

41
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,490
Then, what do we...

42
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,953
The Rule 5 draft is coming up.
Please focus on that.

43
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,121
Do you have other plans?

44
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,123
I'm going to Seoul today.

45
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,877
Is it something important?
We need to finish the contracts.

46
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,004
Some players
haven't signed their contracts.

47
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,968
I'd be going to Seoul
because it's something important.

48
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,561
He just stayed completely still.

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,649
But, sir, regarding your backup catcher...

50
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,150
What?

51
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,236
What about my backup catcher?

52
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,697
He's from Gangwon High last year, right?

53
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,075
He's Lee Kang-sik, right?
You picked him and are training him well.

54
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,829
Don't you think Lee Kang-sik
also needs a chance?

55
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,081

56
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,251
How do you memorize
a second-string player as well?

57
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,796
I should finish and get up quickly.

58
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,965
Do you have any other plans?

59
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,759
Yes, I do. I'm meeting someone important.

60
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,471
Is there someone more important than me?

61
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,098
Is it someone I know?

62
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,144
Just tell me one letter of his name.

63
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,314
Of course you won't tell me.

64
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,940
All right, thank you.

65
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,483
No problem.

66
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,154
-How about we drink?
-Sure.

67
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,575
PELICANS GENERAL MANAGER, OH SA-HOON

68
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,952
Is Gil Chang-ju doing well?

69
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,538
He's not doing as well as Miles.

70
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,667
You're a real trickster.

71
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,504
Who are you eyeing from my team?

72
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,591
You're very straightforward.

73
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,801
If that weren't the case,

74
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,387
why would you come here
and enjoy a drink with me?

75
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,893
-I want your second backup catcher.
-We have a lot of great catchers.

76
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,394
Is that it?

77
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,021
A backup outfielder.

78
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,818
A utility player to play as an infielder.

79
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,240
I guess negotiations aren't going so well
with Seo Yeong-ju, Kwak Han-young,

80
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,533
and the other outfielders.

81
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,577
Well...

82
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,829
This is entertaining.

83
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,375
Then, how about we match up some cards?

84
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,593
The strategy analysis team should make
a 40-man roster before the Rule 5 draft.

85
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,511
Okay.

86
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,971
Take out the common denominator first.

87
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,226
Wait. The general manager has designated
the positions of the players to bring in.

88
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,270
A catcher, outfielder,
and utility as infielder.

89
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,399
-A utility player as an infielder?
-Yes, a utility player as infielder.

90
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,651
A utility player.

91
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,537
What are you doing?

92
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,474
Jae-hee.

93
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,309
Yes?

94
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,438
What is it?

95
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,983
Is what you said about the positions
of the players we're bringing in

96
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,776
that the general manager mentioned
all true?

97
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,030
What, do you think I made it all up?

98
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,909
Did you see Jang Woo-seok
send a text as soon as he heard that?

99
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,619
He made it look so obvious.

100
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,206
Then, should I round him up?

101
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,083
Gosh, no.

102
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,753
Hey.

103
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,257
Aren't those the positions
of the players that haven't signed?

104
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,304
When they hear this,
they might become anxious.

105
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,813
Come on.

106
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,610
You guys could have just waited.
Why did you all gather like this?

107
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,945
Have a seat.

108
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,915
Do you know that they're replacing
our positions during the Rule 5 drafts?

109
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,959
-Where did you hear that?
-The scout team.

110
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,255
Why did you go investigating all this?

111
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,883
And also,
do you know that the general manager

112
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,719

113
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,429
I heard.

114
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,016
I heard he was looking for players
for our positions only.

115
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,270
Open this bottle.

116
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,108
Oh Sa-hoon's not the person
to be tricked by Baek Seung-soo,

117
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,778
and Baek Seung-soo won't
be tricked by Oh Sa-hoon either.

118
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,323
-Do you think they'll manage a trade deal?
-What about Kim Jong-moo?

119
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:56,994
Kim Jong-moo's been getting criticism
for being tricked by Baek Seung-soo

120
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,163
into trading off Kang Doo-ki
for Lim Dong-gyu.

121
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,998
Do you think they'll do a trade deal?

122
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,711
Then, if we accept the price

123
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,090
the general manager is offering,
won't it all be done quickly?

124
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,676
Why? Do you want it to be over quickly?

125
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,262
-That way, I'd be able to train--
-Hey!

126
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,473
That attitude itself
is having a servile spirit.

127
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,309
If you have those thoughts,
you won't get what you deserve.

128
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,605
If we go somewhere else, we won't have
a chance to play in games.

129
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,024
I'm a key player because of the Dreams.

130
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,151
I need one more year
to become a free agent.

131
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,113
It's only been four months
since I signed my apartment contract.

132
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,699
The kids don't want to go
because they have friends.

133
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,243
If I move now,
I'd have to live away from my family.

134
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,288

135
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,291
If I go back, I might have to retire.

136
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,980
Eat a proper meal.

137
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,242
Hey. I'll make sure that people say
we nailed the Rule 5 draft.

138
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,971
GENERAL MANAGER'S OFFICE

139
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,275
What are you doing here?

140
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,695
Mr. Baek had other business
to take care of.

141
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,989
When is he coming back?

142
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,675
You look free. We're quite busy.

143
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,177
Mr. Baek.

144
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,890
Jung Sun-gu. It's hard to see you
because of your representative.

145
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,936
-What brings you here?
-I came here to run

146
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,771
and talk about your salary.

147
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,694
I'm sorry, but even if the negotiation
isn't going well, I can't do this.

148
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,488
He used to be a direct superior
from our team.

149
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,117
Do you know why Mr. Ko is negotiating

150
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,912
for so many Dreams players
instead of other free agents?

151
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,505
This restaurant makes great kkakdugi.

152
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,633
Ma'am, can I order just your kkakdugi?

153
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,468
Ms. Lee?

154
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,221
My gosh.

155
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,473
Yeo Jae-wook.

156
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,186
What brings you here? Let's eat together.

157
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,440
Well, I'm here to eat.

158
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,817
-After training?
-Yes.

159
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,487
Since we've met, I'll pay for your meal.

160
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,698
No, I can buy my own meal.

161
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,578
By the way, how is it going?

162
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,413
What do you mean?

163
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,291
The negotiation.

164
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,049
So 150 million won?
Do you think this price makes sense?

165
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,345
How much is Yoo Sung-kyum getting paid
when he has worse records?

166
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,931
Yoo Sung-kyum did worse
the year before last year.

167
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,517
-Do you realize that?
-You're right.

168
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,394
You're right about everything.

169
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,147
But Yoo Sung-kyum is with the Sabers.

170
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,858
He's given a premium
since it's the champion team.

171
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,028
Why play baseball in the first place
when your team isn't doing well?

172
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:04,074
Does that mean Jung Sun-gu will not stamp
his seal on a contract

173
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,328
for a salary under 150 million won?

174
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,789
We wouldn't even be able to afford it.

175
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,876
BASEBALL PLAYER CONTRACT, DREAMS,
JUNG SUN-GU, 110 MILLION WON

176
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,045
You're really pretty.

177
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,468
JUNG SUN-GU

178
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,599
Then how much are you thinking of
for Yeo Jae-wook?

179
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,811
-Give me that.
-This?

180
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,104
I can't.

181
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,648
Give it.

182
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,943
I shouldn't.

183
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,992
90 MILLION WON

184
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,327
Ninety million won?

185
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,164
This is just wrong.

186
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,211
Do you think this is a cattle market?

187
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,339
BASEBALL PLAYER CONTRACT, DREAMS,
YEO JAE-WOOK, 70 MILLION WON

188
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,014
YEO JAE-WOOK

189
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,601
Your signature is so pretty.

190
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,856
Thank you.

191
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,570
-Here's your coffee.
-Yes.

192
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:29,368
What's this? Don't you know how I like it?
I only drink iced Americano.

193
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,953
Sure.

194
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,081
I was worried you might freeze
to death. You should live longer.

195
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,251
You're all grown up, aren't you?
Are you still eating formula?

196
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,462
The method of calculating
the salaries has changed

197
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,506
-drastically this year, so...
-Hey.

198
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,926
Don't you know the calculation
I've been using until last year?

199
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,264
I knew it. You know everything.

200
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,516
But how did you know
the calculation method?

201
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,435
Jae-hee.

202
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,771
Do you even have the right to negotiate?

203
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,234
Wait.

204
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,153
I apologize.

205
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,867
YEO JAE-WOOK HAS SIGNED HIS CONTRACT

206
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,961
Have some manners in front of your senior.

207
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,215
I have no rights and I have no manners.

208
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,971
KANG TAE-MIN

209
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,682
Who signs a contract
at a Chinese restaurant?

210
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,270
Okay. Let's eat.

211
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,232
You could at least order a meal for me.

212
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,444
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

213
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,529
We'd like
a small-size sweet and sour pork.

214
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,075
KWON DO-YUL

215
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,369
Take it and leave.

216
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,917
-I said leave!
-Okay.

217
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,252
I understand.

218
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,630
Good luck.

219
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,720
Since I have no rights,
we'll meet with Mr. Baek next time.

220
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,016
I'll inform him about today's negotiation.

221
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,936
Now, goodbye.

222
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,525
What do you think you're doing
calling a busy man like me?

223
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:34,994
Mr. Ko.

224
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,042
Though I don't have the final say,
I'm here as a proxy negotiator

225
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,586
for Mr. Baek and Ms. Lee to talk
to the players' representative.

226
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,257
I'll deliver your opinion to them
thoroughly.

227
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,634
Also...

228
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,476
you shouldn't equate
your feelings with your attitude.

229
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,186
What kind of rude behavior is this?

230
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,661
KANG TAE-MIN

231
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,289
I'm sorry, Mr. Ko. I signed the contract.

232
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:26,128
JUNG SUN-GU, YEO JAE-WOOK

233
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,855
Kwak Han-young.

234
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,986
-I'm sorry to bother you so late.
-You should talk to Mr. Ko.

235
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,572
How much more do you want to get paid?

236
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,617
I can't say anything
even if you keep asking me.

237
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,871
Talk to Mr. Ko, my agent.

238
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,585
Has your agent told you
that we offered up to 200 million won?

239
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,632
Yes.

240
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,262
Do you think it was right of him
to reject that offer?

241
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,724
Yes. I want to get paid more.

242
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,894
So it won't do you any good
to come find me.

243
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,189
You want to be compensated
regarding the last contract.

244
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,609
-Is that what you want?
-Who wouldn't want that?

245
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,198
I'm not sure how this negotiation
will end, but from now on,

246
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,243
you should gather your senses
from time to time

247
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,203
before you sign your contract.

248
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,474
-Hello.
-Yes.

249
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,602
All of Mr. Ko's players signed contracts
except for Kwak Han-young.

250
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,230
Has he signed yet?

251
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,189
No.

252
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,317
Kwak Han-young is just being nice
to Mr. Ko this time, right?

253
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,070
I bet he already knows
that everyone signed except him.

254
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,158
Mr. Ko will be even more desperate,
as all he has is Kwak Han-young.

255
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,257
Did Mr. Baek offer 200 million won?

256
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,885
Did he tell you that?

257
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,929
You should get paid
more than 200 million won.

258
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,599
I'm not worth that much.

259
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,933
Han-young.

260
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,771
You should get back everything that
you gave up until now. You deserve it.

261
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,615
What is it?

262
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,200
Are you hurt?

263
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,868
Show me.

264
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,915
-I grabbed the scissors the wrong way.
-You should have been careful.

265
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,208
Jin-woo.

266
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,921
Why are you here?

267
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,217
-I'm trying to learn all this.
-Aren't you playing baseball?

268
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,721
-This is how things turned out.
-Jin-woo. That just sounds wrong.

269
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,641
Haven't you negotiated your salary yet?

270
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,811
He has. But what choice does he have
when they offer him 50 million won?

271
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,854
They want him out.

272
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,024
Do you want me to negotiate for you?

273
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,860
It doesn't matter who does it.
They just don't want me.

274
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:41,156
I heard from those who came here.
They were upset about the salaries.

275
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,491
Financial trouble, I guess.

276
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,576
They should've
spent their money correctly.

277
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,286
Offering you 50 million won is ridiculous.

278
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,831
So work hard
while you have a lot of chances.

279
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,169
You're also the problem. How could you
retire just because your salary is low?

280
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,713
You're Jang Jin-woo,
the pitcher with 19 wins in a season.

281
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,259
Let's say I'm not a baseball player.
Getting 50 million won a year is a lot.

282
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,973
My family isn't going to starve to death
without that money. I know.

283
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,141
But...

284
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,522
a salary can be an excuse to my family.

285
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,860
"I'm earning this much,
so let's bear with this together."

286
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,488
But now,

287
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,783
50 million won as an excuse?

288
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,204
That's lame.

289
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,875
Let me pour you a drink.

290
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,649
Hello?

291
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,737
I wasn't asleep,
but what's the occasion at this late hour?

292
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:06,074
Well, our negotiation
hasn't ended yet, right?

293
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,910
Of course not.

294
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,039
You should be there yourself

295
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:15,876
instead of playing cheap
by sending someone without a say.

296
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,921
I'll see you tomorrow then.

297
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,757
Let's meet up tomorrow.

298
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,316
You're pretty good at your work.

299
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,277
Having that clumsy young man
in front of your desk.

300
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,696
I'm sure he wasn't clumsy.

301
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,907
Where's that clumsy guy?

302
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,201
Let's begin our negotiation.

303
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,829
I made it clear last time.

304
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,459
I'll never make it
more than the amount I've offered.

305
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,589
How much does Mr. Kwak need to get
for you to be satisfied?

306
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,052
And why are you doing this
without taking even a penny?

307
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,763
Between the player
who wants to get paid more

308
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,723
and the club that wants to pay less,

309
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,643
you aren't even willing to take
the commission as his agent.

310
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,438
Do you have a sacred sense
of altruism or something?

311
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,481
Or is it that...

312
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,819
you have ulterior motives?

313
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,239
Are you interrogating me now?

314
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,701
Whatever I have in mind,
your job is to negotiate.

315
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,205
Can I ask that clumsy guy
for a cup of coffee?

316
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,208
That clumsy guy is busy right now.

317
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,762
You're training hard as expected.

318
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,680
What is it?

319
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,974
You know what. I'm here for the contract.

320
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,269
You have my agent,
so why do you keep coming to me?

321
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,274
Because what we want is a talk between
those with the actual intention to sign.

322
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,403
-Raise it.
-Jeez.

323
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,738
-Push it again.
-It hurts.

324
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,283
Push it slowly.

325
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,325
And breathe out.

326
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,620
-Let's stop here.
-Thank you.

327
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,754
Darn it.
Why isn't the general manager here?

328
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,717
He only invests his energy
on what's certain.

329
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,636
I should deal with cases like these.

330
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,392
What? Cases like these?

331
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,771
Mr. Seo.
You cannot change teams for seven years.

332
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,982
And even within that period,

333
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,569
you can't change clubs
without your club's consent.

334
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,946
It's absurd, isn't it?

335
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,824
That's the field you're in.

336
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,954
What's your goal in this negotiation?

337
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,708
Of course, a result
that can satisfy both sides.

338
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,959
Are you sure?

339
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,337
If it's not satisfying for both sides,

340
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,964
then I'd like a deal
that satisfies us more.

341
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,592
How much do you want?

342
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,135
What's your offer?

343
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,721
I clearly told you last time.

344
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,891
I won't raise the amount any higher.
I offered 200 million won.

345
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:26,191
-300 million won.
-Are you sure that's what Mr. Kwak wants?

346
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,234
300 million won.

347
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,819
It's not that
you'll quit playing baseball.

348
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,864
-You need to have your contract signed.
-I need to trust my agent.

349
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,367
Do you think we're trying
to have it signed with you

350
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,911
because it's easier to do it with you
than with the agent?

351
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,414
Let's be honest. Is Mr. Ko
even interested in this contract?

352
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,713
It's not just Se-hyuk.
I want to get paid a lot too.

353
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,049
We know. We know it.

354
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:55,887
And so we'll add 50 million more
to our original offer.

355
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,472
250 million won in total.

356
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,518
Why do you think we didn't offer
this amount to Mr. Ko?

357
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,981
His purpose is to give Mr. Baek
a hard time regardless of the price.

358
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,360
It's your first and last chance
to take this offer.

359
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,406
If you're okay with the amount,
sign it right away.

360
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,829
But a salary can be an excuse
to my family.

361
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,542
"I'm earning this much,
so let's bear with this together."

362
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,045
And now, 50 million won for an excuse?

363
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,338
That's lame.

364
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,050
Let's do it.

365
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,888
I'll ask for forgiveness to Se-hyuk.

366
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,851
KWAK HAN-YOUNG, 200 MILLION WON

367
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,353
-This contract...
-What?

368
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,857
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

369
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,692
I took out the previous one.

370
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,280
250 MILLION WON

371
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,324
You said you didn't have money.

372
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,492
Were you able to raise it
by 50 million won?

373
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,287
No. We had unexpected dropouts.

374
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,957
And we'll reduce salaries of other players
who are less important than you.

375
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,544
-Are you trying to make me uncomfortable?
-Oh, come on.

376
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,756
I'm just saying
you're that important to our team.

377
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,229
KWAK HAN-YOUNG

378
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,357
What is your point?

379
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,903
-200 million won.
-Are you crazy?

380
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,489
-150 million won.
-What are you doing?

381
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,074
I've forgotten.

382
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,368
-Forgotten what?
-That I have the right to do this.

383
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,914
You're a free agent,
so other franchises can't scout you.

384
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,583
Neither can you sign a contract
with another franchise

385
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,835
even if I offer a ridiculous amount
like this.

386
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,381
-Don't you know salary arbitration?
-Among 20 times so far,

387
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,510
there was only one time that a player won
against his franchise.

388
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,428
This is enough.

389
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,848
We could've done this, but we chose not to

390
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,559
because we believed
you had the same goal as ours.

391
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:11,022
The goal for the Dreams to have
better results than the last season.

392
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,482
We thought you were one of us.

393
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,778
But, Mr. Seo,
did you think of us the same way?

394
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,782
You had the manager at your beck and call
and poured liquor on him.

395
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,577
I'm playing baseball while ruining myself.
Can't I even demand my rights?

396
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,039
It doesn't matter how big
of a price difference there is.

397
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,252
But you have such a filthy way
of narrowing the difference.

398
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,295
You can't be considered one of us.

399
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,799
I don't have the will to negotiate nicely
with someone who's crossed the line.

400
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,885
This work is done by people, you know.

401
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,345
What if I retire?

402
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,266
Do you think you can trade someone
for a catcher and fill my void?

403
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,019
You have a quick ear.

404
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:54,023
It's not that our goal
is the championship.

405
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,152
We just need to have it running,
so we can get another catcher.

406
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,946
And stop speaking rudely to me.

407
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,283
You little annoying punk!

408
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,871
Where are your manners?

409
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,124
Reckless punk.

410
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,715
So 300 million won...

411
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,384
MR. KWAK HAS SIGNED THE CONTRACT, SIR

412
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:26,014
Mr. Ko.
Do you know why you didn't give us faith?

413
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,311
If you need faith,
go visit a religious event nearby.

414
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:35,899
-But focus on the negotiation here.
-It's obvious your goal is something else.

415
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,193
What are you saying?

416
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,779
Players aren't interested in your revenge.

417
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,282
The franchise is working on a trade,

418
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,618
and they're worried
it might be their position.

419
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,582
You're getting it wrong again.

420
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,294
You kicked me out
only with suspicion last time.

421
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,172
This time, you're judging things your way.

422
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,674
You just don't understand comradeship

423
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,427
earned through working
and sweating together.

424
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,513
Is it because you're not a former athlete?

425
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,268
Baseball players' price tags
have increased, it's true.

426
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,979
But it's already a red ocean

427
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,315
to be an agent.

428
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:22,695
At most, big FA players' contracts
are worth up to ten billion won.

429
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,490
You better do a good job on that.

430
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,620
Focus on it.

431
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,759
BASEBALL PLAYER CONTRACT, DREAMS,
KWAK HAN-YOUNG, 200 MILLION WON

432
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,177
KWAK HAN-YOUNG

433
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,558
To be honest,
I knew you'd do this in the end.

434
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,686
Still, a part of me didn't want you
to be a nice guy this time.

435
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,397
I know you don't mean it,
so don't say that.

436
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,482
Do you want me to take the contract?

437
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,944
No, I'll just tear it up.

438
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,737
Okay.

439
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,033
Just leave. I'm about to change my mind.

440
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,620
Thank you so much.

441
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,961
BASEBALL PLAYER CONTRACT, DREAMS,
KWAK HAN-YOUNG, 250 MILLION WON

442
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,263
It's all done except Seo Yeong-ju.

443
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,225
Seo Yeong-ju will be here soon.

444
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,310
What?

445
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,687
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

446
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,105
What's the matter?

447
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,401
I lashed out at him
as if I'd never see him again.

448
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,988
Yes, come in.

449
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,627
I was thoughtless.

450
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,592
I admit that I was thoughtless,

451
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,597
but I need you to offer me
a reasonable amount.

452
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,559
Would the first offer we made be enough?

453
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,813
Yes.

454
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,025
You have the contract. Give it to him.

455
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,078
SEO YEONG-JU

456
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,669
Bye.

457
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,146
Is it from Kwak Han-young?

458
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,524
-Yes.
-It was exactly as you expected, Mr. Baek.

459
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,236
I gave him the 200 million won contract
first, and he signed it right away.

460
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,124
What's going on?
Isn't it the last contract?

461
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,750
It is.

462
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,752
Then, what's wrong with him?

463
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,973
How would Kwak Han-young
have thought about us?

464
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,641
Sorry?

465
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,358
He would've thought of us as scoundrels.

466
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,113
We did as we were told. We had no choice.

467
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,161
Then, could we also understand
Director Kwon?

468
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,835
Come on. Stop it.

469
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,756
The whole contract procedure is over now.
Let's go have a drink. It's on me.

470
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,216
That's a good idea.

471
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,676
Sure. Go ahead.

472
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,057
I mean, it's not too bad an idea.

473
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,935
Why? Let's go drink...
Mr. Baek, let's go have some...

474
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,565
You don't want to drink?

475
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,052
Hello. This is Reporter Kim Dae-ho.

476
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,261
GOPCHANG STORY

477
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,972
This is Baek Seung-soo,
the general manager of the Dreams.

478
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,975
The Dreams?

479
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,852
You're the general manager?

480
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,314
Can you write an article
with a moving story about the Dreams?

481
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,361
Let me hear it first.

482
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,710
I want to ask you something
about Jang Jin-woo.

483
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,713
-Yes?
-Is he working here?

484
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,924
Yes.

485
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,509
But he's not here now.

486
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,470
He went to check the site
for his new restaurant.

487
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,264
He's not coming back today.

488
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,891
If he plans to open a restaurant himself,

489
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,186
it means he doesn't have
a serious financial issue,

490
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,940
which would make him decide to retire
because of his small salary.

491
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,441
Well, I don't know everything...

492
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,778
If he retires like this,
the time he played as a baseball player

493
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,822
will remain as a terrible memory to him.

494
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,825
Okay.

495
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,326
Please enjoy.

496
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:15,131
CHAIRMAN KWON IL-DO

497
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,757
Come in.

498
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,273
Kyung-min.

499
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,316
Yes, sir.

500
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,777
Let's say I ordered my servant
to carry a bale of hay.

501
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,488
Is this an important task or not?

502
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,199
It's not.

503
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:46,078
But he failed to do the job properly
and the hay caught fire,

504
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,998
and the house was burnt down.

505
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,626
Tell me what's going on.

506
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,509
JAESONG'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY
WITH THE BASEBALL CLUB

507
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,814
If you keep ruining major businesses
because of minor issues,

508
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,734
is there a reason for me
to keep working with you?

509
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,361
No, sir.

510
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,614
Do you think I came this far
because I trusted people?

511
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,409
I came this far because I never
saw people as humans.

512
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,412
I'll take care of it.

513
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,874
Put everything on the right track
by tomorrow.

514
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,709
I will.

515
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,555
Kyung-min.

516
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,937
You're the servant,
and Dreams is the bale of hay.

517
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,772
You know that, right?

518
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,486
I'm just telling you what Father said.

519
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,239
Gosh.

520
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,075
Even if you make mistakes sometimes,
I can turn a blind eye.

521
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,037
So try to have perseverance
while you're still young.

522
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,419
What are you doing here? Don't you
have to go to straighten things up?

523
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,438
Mr. Baek.

524
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,567
Are you that rich?

525
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,695
You'll give up your pay
for the players' salary?

526
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,990
Please take a look at this.

527

STOCK INFORMATION, JAESONG GROUP

528
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,124
GENERAL MANAGER GIVES UP HIS PAY

529
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,752
Why did you do that?

530
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,799
Mr. Baek, request a correction
on the article right away.

531
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,430
I don't understand
why they wrote it this way.

532
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,599
How come they don't see
my good will as it is?

533
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,229
Ms. Lee, please leave us alone.

534
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,398
Okay.

535
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,281
Does Jaesong even have the right
to decide where to use my pay?

536
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,993
Don't you see that the whole group
has faltered by your trick?

537
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,079
It's faltered by my trick?

538
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,664
Do you know how much loss
the shareholders suffered?

539
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,416
Is it over 30 percent?

540
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,335
Mr. Baek.

541
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:45,883
When you talk to me,
you'd better get rid of your sarcasm.

542
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,011
Or you'll put yourself in a fix.

543
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,806
The stock price dropped
by nine percent when I just checked.

544
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,016
But you cut the players' salary
by 30 percent.

545
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,977
Of course! You guys have been
at the bottom for years.

546
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,356
You just said I played a trick, right?

547
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,026
You kept cutting their pay
even when they didn't get much,

548
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,861
so they vented their complaints on me.

549
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,699
So I gave up my salary to be a little help
even though it's a very small sum.

550
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,537
I rather expected a compliment
as I gave up my annual salary.

551
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,288
But you saw it as a trick?

552
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,875
Is there anyone who neither likes
nor needs money?

553
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,878
Can you work for the company
without getting paid for a year?

554
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,676
If the company falters
because of one person's sacrifice,

555
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:33,013
shouldn't you be reflecting
on your company's financial position?

556
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,724
Then you should have said something
when I first told you!

557
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,643
I thought I made it clear at first.

558
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,022
But it made me even angrier
as I was signing the contracts.

559
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,484
It made me angry
that only the subordinates

560
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,989
are having a mud fight by themselves
and that I had won that mud fight.

561
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:50,948
That's enough.

562
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,285
I'll raise the total salary of the players
as much as your salary,

563
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,828
so request a correction.

564
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,622
I'm telling you to work
while getting paid!

565
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,207
Pardon?

566
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,630
Because of the amount of money that
you can give out so spontaneously,

567
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,260
think hard about how upset we were...

568
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,598
during the negotiation...

569
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,311
and how much it hurt our pride.

570
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,858
How far are you planning to take this?

571
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:37,411
OPERATIONS MANAGER

572
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,664
Are the contracts almost finished?

573
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,957
Yes, of course.

574
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,628
Raise the salaries of the players
with the lowest salaries,

575
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,796
and rewrite the contracts, please.

576

ANNUAL SALARY ADJUSTMENT
FOR DREAMS PLAYERS

577
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,267
THE RATE OF PAY INCREASE: 11 PERCENT

578
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,730
Hello.

579
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,735
Your contract has been changed.
Please read it and sign it.

580
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,322
Is this correct?

581
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,573
Yes.

582
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,033
Thank you.

583
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,201
NO TAE-MOON

584
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,285

Seo Sang-Hoon.

586
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,413
Is this my salary?

587
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,456
Yes, it is.

588
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,749
Thank you.

589
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,793
What?

590
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,211
Thank you so much.

591
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,712
Do you like it?

592
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,298
Thank you.

593
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,841
Don't thank me.

594
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,890
Thank you. I'll train hard.

595
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,980
YOO MIN-HO, 30 MILLION WON

596
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,317
Don't you like it?

597
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,445
I do. But why is it so high?

598
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,407
Have you heard
of the minimum cost of living?

599
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,533
Yes.

600
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:01,495
You could think of it as the minimum
cost of playing baseball.

601
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,206
You'll need to buy your equipment.

602
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,963
Yes. Thank you.

603
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:16,468
I hope you'll be sitting here
asking for a higher salary next year.

604
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,095
Yes.

605
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,889
YOO MIN-HO

606
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,529
BUT IF YOU FOCUS, YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO WIN EVERY GAME

607
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,710
I'M STRONGER THAN WHAT I BELIEVE

608
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:07,186
I don't think they wanted you out
by offering you 50 million won.

609
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,189
If the franchise is going
through a really hard time...

610
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,691
So, what do you mean they're going
through a hard time?

611
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,485
What do you want me to do?

612
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:18,781
I'm afraid you'd resent me in the future.
I couldn't tell you what to do.

613
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,786
But I think what they said was right.

614
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,373
If you quit like this,

615
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:31,543
there will only be regrets
when you think about baseball later on.

616
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:38,592
I told my wife that I was going
to open a restaurant, and she loved it.

617
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,971
Do you think I'm Kang Doo-ki or something?

618
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,057
Why would I regret it?

619
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,567
Hello.

620
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,819
Hi.

621
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,488
Train hard and take care of your health.

622
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,533
-I'm going to go see my grandmother.
-What?

623
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,245
They raised my salary.

624
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,415
So I ordered new gloves
and a pair of running shoes.

625
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,335
I'm going to my grandmother's
with beef and having dinner with her.

626
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:18,173
You once told me I should visit her,
and I wanted to thank you.

627
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,175
Goodbye.

628
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,469
All right.

629
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,389
And...

630
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,601
can you teach me the grip
to pitch a slow curve?

631
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,311
SLOW CURVE, A CURVEBALL AT A SLOW VELOCITY

632
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,771
I thought about it,

633
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,982
and I think I should learn
the slow curve from you.

634
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,866
Show me your grip for a curveball.

635
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,578
Yes. This is how I grip.

636
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,165
I grip the ball like this.

637
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,876
Good.

638
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,462
Now throw it.

639
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,965
If you want it to arc steeper,

640
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:03,385
you should pitch like you're pitching
with the back of your hand.

641
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,512
With the back of your hand.

642
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,266
Good. From here to here. Try again.

643
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,270
Good.

644
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,918
A GENERAL MANAGER WHO TURNED IN
HIS SALARY WITH GOOD INTENTIONS

645
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,799
Yes.

646
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:53,227
I'm here to sign my contract.

647
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,521
Am I too late?

648
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,109
No.

649
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,570
Please have a seat.

650
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,832
JANG JIN-WOO

651
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,515
So Yoon Kyung-jun would
do us the least damage,

652
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,643
but the Dreams want someone else.

653
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,980
I think the Dreams would prefer
a defensive player.

654
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,025
Hold on.

655
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,652
GENERAL MANAGER KIM JONG-MOO

656
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,865
-Hello?
-Are you busy?

657
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,450
You must be busy
with the preparation of the trade.

658
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,995
Yes, I am. Why do you ask?

659
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,997
I wanted to tell you to give up.

660
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,667
Baek Seung-soo signed Seo Yeong-ju
with no problem.

661
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,636
THE DREAMS FINISH THEIR NEGOTIATION
AT SUPER SPEED

662
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,099
Baek Seung-soo, that jerk...

663
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,810
He's a total bully.

664
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,856
The new general manager
of the Dreams, Baek Seung-soo...

665
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,401
Somehow, he managed to finish
the contracts pretty quickly.

666
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,821
That Baek Seung-soo...

667
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,325
He's rude, but he's quite capable.

668
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,703
"He's rude but quite capable."

669
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:40,709
From my perspective, he's capable,

670
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,254
but he's rude beyond belief.

671
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,509
But we don't need someone like that.

672
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,728
So do you think
you failed in the Major League

673
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,605
because of your elbow injury?

674
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,981
No.

675
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:07,110
This is all my fault.
I failed to take care of my health.

676
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,236
Cut it.

677
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,282
Some people say the championship

678
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:16,620
of the youth baseball tournament
cost Gil Chang-ju's elbow in exchange.

679
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,790
The championship was earned with
the abilities of the other players.

680
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,001
-They would have still won without me.
-Cut it.

681
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,545
-Cut it.
-I should accept it, naturally.

682
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,463
Cut it.

683
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,883
Are we allowed to do this?
This is a bit...

684
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,015
Please prepare for the Rule 5 draft
from now on.

685
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,393
The operations team
and the strategy analysis team

686
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,729
may discuss with one another to make
the 40-man roster of our team.

687
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,564
-Okay.
-Okay.

688
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,234
And discuss with the manager

689
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,530
to see if there are players we can bring
from other teams.

690
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:52,990
Okay.

691
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,326
And the interview will be aired today.

692
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,621
The one that Kim Young-chae did
with Gil Chang-ju.

693
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,166
I hope you'll all watch it.

694
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,171
That's the end of our meeting.

695
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,552
Hello.

696
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,639
Who is he?

697
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,726
I heard he was an employee of ours.

698
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,144
Yes.

699
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:26,648
I don't know the details, but I heard
he's in the strategy analysis team.

700
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,566
Does he work?

701
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,984
I guess he will.

702
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,529
Doesn't he look familiar?

703
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,366
I'm not sure.

704
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,243
Go ask him what his name is.

705
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,327
Okay.

706
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,081
Hey, you.

707
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,838
Newbie at the strategy analysis team,
what's your name?

708
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,883
-It's Baek Young-soo.
-Baek Young-soo.

709
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,844
Baek Young-soo?

710
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,005
BASEBALL IS LIFE

711
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,382
Hello, I'm Kim Young-chae
of Baseball Is Life.

712
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:39,429
This week, I visited the Dreams,
the hot team of the Stove League.

713
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,723
Guess who I met. That's right.

714
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,976
It's the returned prodigal player,
Gil Chang-ju.

715
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:50,816
-As soon as he returned to Korea...
-Gosh, she's so pretty.

716
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,734
She's so good at talking too.

717
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,362
She's like the ideal daughter of all moms.

718
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,824
Are you envious as if she's
Grandma's friend's daughter?

719
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,246
Her mom was so lucky
to have a daughter like her.

720
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,456
Goodness.

721
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,668
Your daughter keeps your side.

722
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,336
You decided to do that...

723
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,297
but do you think you failed
in the Major League

724
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,091
due to your elbow injury?

725
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:20,095
I think that was the major cause.
I couldn't throw balls properly.

726
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:23,348
Some people say
the championship of the youth

727
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:27,394
baseball tournament
cost Gil Chang-ju's elbow in exchange.

728
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,396
My family suffered so much.

729
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:34,526
If you could go back in time, would you
agree to be part of the national team?

730
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,654
It's right that I don't,
at least for the sake of the team.

731
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:42,409
Then if you were given another chance,
would you choose to naturalize?

732
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:44,786
Yes.

733
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,330
Could you tell us the reason?

734
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,793
I can't tell you why. It's personal.

735
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,838
Thank you for the interview today.

736
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,633
It seems Mr. Gil Chang-ju
is focusing more on his regrets

737
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,011
about the current situation
than his past glory.

738
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,806
It's Robert Gil, not Gil Chang-ju.
He's a foreign player.

739
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,142
There are no foreign players
with Korean names.

740
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:10,520
But Robert Gil is currently preparing
for the new season

741
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,356
with his trust towards Mr. Baek Seung-soo.

742
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,277
Mom. What do you think
about Mr. Gil's interview just now?

743
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,904
I don't know.

744
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:23,825
It seems he's feeling so wronged.
Were things hard for him?

745
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,077
-Is that how he seems?
-Yes.

746
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,496
I guess he has a lot of regrets.

747
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,999
Poor guy.

748
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:34,002
What's the use in regretting?
He's still young.

749
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,257
Why does it feel so leery?

750
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,430
INCOMING CALL

751
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:50,769
Hello?

752
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,522
Okay. Please hold.

GIL CHANG-JU, ROBERT GIL'S INTERVIEW
BRINGS CONTROVERSY

755
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,831
ROBERT WOULD CHOOSE TO NATURALIZE
EVEN IF HE WENT BACK IN TIME

756
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,336
THIS AMERICAN REGRETS
BECOMING OUR NATIONAL ATHLETE

757
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,965
HOW COULD HE SAY THAT
AFTER AVOIDING HIS MILITARY DUTY?

758
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,676
WHY DID HE CHOOSE GIL CHANG-JU
EVEN AFTER MEETING WITH MILES?

759
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,891
Yes, I checked.

760
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,144
But don't we have
these kinds of comments too

761
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,188
when we have a big defeat during a season?

762
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:40,402
We just have to do a good job
with what we've been doing.

ROBERT GIL'S INTERVIEW
BRINGS CONTROVERSY.

765
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,797
ANCHOR KIM YOUNG-CHAE ASKED

766
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,174
BASEBALL FANS ARE
QUESTIONING THE GENERAL MANAGER

767
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,940
Have you seen the ruckus?

768
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,207
Well,

769
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:42,547
I met Ms. Kim Young-chae in person
and complained about her poor job

770
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,091
with the interview.

771
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,219
-What did she say she'd do?
-She apologized.

772
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,349
That it wasn't her intention. She asked me
to deliver her message to you.

773
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,226
Any apology or explanation to the public?

774
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,438
She suggested that she'd interview
the general manager

775
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,441
and resolve the misunderstandings.

776
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,362
Of course, they will have
the edited version confirmed

777
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,489
by the general manager
before airing it on TV.

778
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,116
You got fooled again.

779
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,451
What did you say?

780
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,413
Kim Young-chae played a trick
to interview Mr. Baek.

781
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,582
No way.

782
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,461
If it's uncomfortable for you,
I'll go with you and...

783
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,837
When I started working here,

784
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,173
I thought I'd feel at ease
with one thing, at least.

785
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,261
That everyone would be
used to getting criticized.

786
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,679
I guess you aren't.

787
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,100
You get criticized and feel horrible
after the end of a season.

788
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:38,853
And if we have good results,
the public results will change anyway.

789
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,647
Let's not get bothered by it.

790
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,982
-Mr. Yoo.
-Yes?

791
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,276
Did you come up
with a 40-man roster of our team?

792
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,696
First off, we've sorted out about
34 players on whom everyone would agree.

793
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,116
I'll share this with you right away.

794
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,325
Good.

795
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,703
Won't you need more labor force
on your team?

796
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,292
No.

797
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,630
I have enough employees
to keep things going.

798
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,509
Okay.

799
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,557
It's crazy. Does the CEO know about it?

800
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,977
-Jae-hee.
-Yes?

801
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,439
-You know about that wheelchair, right?
-Wheelchair?

802
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,233
Don't talk about him that.

803
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,194
Anyway, he's the younger brother
of the general manager.

804
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,531
Never mind. We just heard it from someone.

805
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,867
What? Gosh, why?

806
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:43,001
This is the 40-man roster
of the Rule 5 draft. It's been completed.

807
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,921
I see. Did you prepare it well?

808
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,215
Well, yes.
It'll be ready without any trouble.

809
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,468
-By the way, Mr. Baek.
-Yes?

810
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:56,306
Why does everything you do
create commotion and gossip?

811
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,644
-Is it about Gil Chang-ju's...
-Because of Gil Chang-ju,

812
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,315
the franchise staff had to deal
with hundreds of calls today.

813
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,984
But that isn't what I'm talking about.

814
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,528
He's in a wheelchair,
so he should stay at home.

815
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,530
He's Mr. Baek's younger brother.

816
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,408
I'm disappointed in Mr. Baek.

817
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,203
I didn't think he was this kind of person.

818
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,664
-Was it employment corruption?
-Probably.

819
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,791
HE PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERVIEW HIMSELF

820
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,421
This doesn't make any sense.

821
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,383
Mr. Baek.

822
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,930
We have great news.

823
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,681
Listen.

824
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,852
We've signed a two-year contract with you.

825
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,898
But even without having to work
in the office,

826
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:51,402
we will pay you the promised
amount of salary for those two years.

827
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,948
I don't understand what you mean.

828
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,951
Should I do a briefing on this?

829
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,287
Why I must fire you
from your general manager position.

830
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,124
One.

831
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,462
You insisted on scouting
that player named Gil something

832
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,090
when he betrayed the country
to avoid his military duty.

833
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:15,426
It disgraced the franchise,
whose image was already bad.

834
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,013
That was the best option we had.

835
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,557
Two.

836
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,227
Your incompetent younger brother
couldn't get a job anywhere,

837
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,731
and you hired him
on our strategy analysis team,

838
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,109
which caused an unjust result.

839
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,989
You even took part in it
as an interviewer.

840
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,955
-He's my younger brother, but--
-Three. You're rude.

841
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:52,380
You're way too rude.

842
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,260
This is off the record.

843
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:02,390
So for the two reasons, I've decided

844
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,519
on your voluntary resignation.

845
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,734
Go to your office
and pack your stuff, you scumbag.

846
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,404
Why did you give us hope to begin with?

847
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,698
I think I should've done this
from the start.

848
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,492
It's you who's the most pathetic.

849
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,994
I'm sure you'll return
and surprise everyone.

850
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,913
No one ever defended Mr. Baek.

851
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,374
Ms. Lee, you're
the temporary general manager.

852
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,417
Are we supposed to listen to her orders?

853
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,420
-Coaches. Please leave.
-You're crossing the line.

854
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,547
It's already over
because Baek Seung-soo left!

855
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,133
I don't know what humiliation is
since I have no honor.

856
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,928
Who do you think will see
the most damage if you do this?

857
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,346
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

858
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,140
Do you even know what's going on?

859
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:29,310
-Please come back.
-Thank you for seeing me out.
