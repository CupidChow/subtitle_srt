1
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,366
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,576
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,080
-Thank you so much for last time.
-No, please take it.

4
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,665
Thank you again.

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,184
This is not what it looks like.

6
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,648
-You're mistaken about this envelope.
-Mistaken?

7
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,611
What am I misunderstanding?

8
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,574
It's not money.
It's not that kind of money.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,541
It's only 83,000 won.

10
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,544
She was a parent.

11
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,255
Her son went to the emergency room
in the middle of a game

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,091
and I lent her some money.

13
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,010
Then what about Yoo Min-ho?

14
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,807
Is it true that you introduced him
to the Major League

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,226
even before drafting him
as you had planned?

16
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,645
General Manager.

17
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,146
That's not true.

18
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,399
But when he did a test in the US,
he had an injury.

19
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,613
You gave priority to a player that
couldn't go to the Major League

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,325
because of an injury.
What am I supposed to think of that?

21
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,915
A pro baseball scout yells
at a high school team manager

22
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,127
for making the juniors participate
too much.

23
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,589
But once that player becomes a senior,

24
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,176
you grab him by the collar for not
letting him participate enough.

25
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,555
Aren't you interfering too much?

26
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,184
If you knew

27
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,437
how much Yoo Min-ho was exploited
in his junior year,

28
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,730
you wouldn't be saying this.

29
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,862
The exploitation is their problem.
You're a third party.

30
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,577
Do you know how much high school students
have to pay for their team fees?

31
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,622
Min-ho, who lives with his grandma,
can't afford that.

32
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,125
The manager there didn't receive
any money from Min-ho.

33
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,086
But that was to send him and three
other students to college together.

34
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,130
But Min-ho can't go to college. Why?

35
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,549
Because he has to go pro and earn money!

36
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,803
That's why he doesn't let Min-ho
play in his senior year.

37
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,182
He might be rotten to the core,
but it's still in his authority.

38
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,312
He's not letting someone who made
waves in his junior year play!

39
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,148
Even if it doesn't concern you,
doesn't that make you angry?

40
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,942
It does make me angry.
He is a piece of trash.

41
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,990
So, he goes to Min-ho
and demands that he pay his fees.

42
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,452
He tells him to pay his fees
so that he can compete in games.

43
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,995
But how can he?

44
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,335
I did that not as a scout, but as someone
who's been working in baseball before him.

45
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,671
Okay.

46
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,507
What a good man you are, Mr. Yang.

47
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,304
You've been a good figure to Yoo Min-ho.

48
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,015
At the same time,
you have been harming the team.

49
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,728
You will not be able to work
as a scout for the Dreams.

50
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,316
I don't work with humanists.

51
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,533
SUJEONG INN

52
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,994
Pack your bags and come out.

53
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,708
You should come in for some tea
as I pack my stuff.

54
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,294
-Okay.
-No, I'll just be waiting here.

55
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,596
Still, it's a relief.

56
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,723
What's a relief?

57
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,935
At least the envelope was not a bribe.

58
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,272
Do we live in a world where we're
thankful for the bare minimum?

59
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,234
No.

60
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,909
Do you agree to us taking all
of these achievements and records

61
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,495
that were achieved while you were
working with the Dreams?

62
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,843
OPERATIONS MANAGER LEE SE-YOUNG

63
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,553
You know...

64
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,471
Mr. Ko Se-hyuk, right?

65
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,600
-Why do you ask?
-There's no need to be defensive.

66
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,311
We're not here to do harm

67
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,438
to Lee Chang-kwon in any way.

68
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,441
Then what is it that you want
to talk about?

69
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,701
Hello? This isâ€¦

70
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,419
Yes.

71
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,384
I'm sorry,

72
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,678
but you have you leave now.

73
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,888
What?

74
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,390
-Why?
-I don't care if you're a customer.

75
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,310
-Get out.
-You know Mr. Ko.

76
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,438
How am I supposed to know him?

77
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,900
A moment ago, you acted
like you did know him.

78
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,568
The pork rib soup is ready!

79
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,320
Get out.

80
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,156
-Wait.
-I'm home.

81
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,496
Go into the kitchen.

82
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,208
Hurry up and go!

83
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,014
When parents try to do
everything they can for their children,

84
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,976
of course, not everything
is going to lead to the right path.

85
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,062
Lee Chang-kwon

86
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,148
worked so hard that he was
selected by a pro team.

87
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,028
Even after he's become Rookie of the Year,

88
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,740
why should you have to continue
being worried?

89
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,623
Excuse me.

90
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,543
CHANG-KWON'S HANGOVER SOUP

91
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,649
I did...

92
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,943
wrong.

93
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,826
MYUNGIL HIGH SCHOOL

94
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
YOO MIN-HO

95
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:33,870
Nice.

96
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,091
Min-ho.

97
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,597
Are you okay? Let me take a look.

98
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,310
Min-ho.

99
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,187
Sir.

100
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,356
I don't...

101
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,028
have to go to the Major League.

102
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,072
I really don't have to go.

103
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,832
But what if...

104
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,670
I can't play baseball?

105
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,717
Hey.

106
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,053
What are you saying? You can do it.

107
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,891
You can do it. You've worked hard.
It's going to be okay.

108
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,064
Do you regret it?

109
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,025
I don't regret it.

110
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,527
But I won't...

111
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,405
do that ever again.

112
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,126
You don't receive any more calls
from the police station, right?

113
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,337
No. Everything got resolved thanks to you.

114
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,550
It was all thanks to Mr. Ko.

115
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,682
The athletes trust him so much, right?

116
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,016
You can say that.

117
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,354
But I've been hearing a negative rumor.

118
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,192
Have you not heard anything of that sort?

119
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,283
Mr. Lee Yong-jae.

120
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,497
How much did you give

121
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,791
to Mr. Ko?

122
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,264
I've...

123
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,726
shut my ears out focusing only
on baseball, so I don't know anything.

124
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,686
Please just go.

125
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,690
But this can't continue.

126
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,526
I promise that no harm will come to you.

127
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,904
You're already doing harm
by interrupting me when I'm practicing!

128
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,948
I don't know! Just go!

129
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,513
Can you deal with it?

130
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,892
If I open my mouth,

131
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,312
the scout team leader might be replaced,

132
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,522
or I'd have to give up my career.

133
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,027
Can you take responsibility for that?

134
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,002
It's true that my mother
contacted him first.

135
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,672
She must've been afraid
that I might have to give up

136
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,965
on baseball after having
worked on it for over ten years.

137
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,260
We thought we needed to pay him
just once when I joined the team,

138
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,513
but he keeps calling me.

139
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,683
He doesn't directly ask for money.

140
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,351
But...

141
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,145
I know very well why he's calling me.

142
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,818
What's that?

143
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,697
-Where have you been?
-I had a business trip.

144
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,949
That's right.

145
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,292
Jae-hee.

146
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,254
Yes?

147
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,714
Let's say I do something...

148
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,509
that tarnishes the reputation
of the Dreams.

149
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,011
-Like what?
-For example,

150
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,431
I take a bribe.

151
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,599
How much did you take?

152
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,978
No. It's just an example.

153
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,274
What if you're the only one
that knows that I took a bribe?

154
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,859
What will you do?

155
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,155
I've been with you for a long time.
I trust you.

156
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,531
Why?

157
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,869
What's going on with you?
Why should I not trust you?

158
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,039
Darn it.

159
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,087
Ms. Lee.

160
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,590
Do you trust Mr. Ko Se-hyuk?

161
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,716
Yes, I do.

162
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,718
I've known him for a long time.

163
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,596
So you think he's not a person who'd do
that without confirmation, right?

164
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,015
Do you call that trust?

165
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,142
You're just being vague
and remaining a spectator.

166
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,687
Tell me what happened.

167
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,314
Jae-hee,

168
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,110
if something like that happens,
trust the evidence, not me.

169
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,448
Then, find the truth first
before you decide to trust me.

170
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,492
Got it?

171
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,046
Mr. Ko, did you get home safely?

172
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,758
Actually, Iâ€¦

173
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,724
Never mind.

174
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,643
Yes.

175
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,269
See you tomorrow.

176
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,439
Okay. Bye.

177
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,834
Who is it?

178
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,086
Pardon?

179
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,964
It's nothing. Let me fill your glass.

180
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,344
How do you like this place?

181
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,138
Yes, it's nice and neat.

182
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,311
Eat up.

183
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,146
Yes, sir.

184
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,369
Wellâ€¦

185
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,248
How was your business trip?

186
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,250
It was okay.

187
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,670
Did I make any mistakes?

188
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,005
No, you didn't.

189
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,132
Just cut to the chase.

190
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,341
Okay.

191
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,220
I know it's late at night,

192
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,973
but I came to report something to you.

193
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,860
Wait. Yang Won-sub!

194
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,196
You littleâ€¦ What brings you here?

195
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,116
Why are you standing here so stiffly?

196
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,827
-Have you been well? Hold on.
-Yes.

197
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,457
Hello?

198
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,959
Okay.

199
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,463
I'll see all the scouting members
in the meeting room.

200
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,381
Let's go.

201
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,763
You still often go
to that restaurant, don't you?

202
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,682
I told you to not go alone
and call me when you go there.

203
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,546
I'll begin now.

204
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,428
-Mr. Yang Won-sub.
-Yes.

205
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,640
He said we needed Yoo Min-ho,
who he was personally close to,

206
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,352
because our team's pitching
performance was poor.

207
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,230
And at the same time, he introduced him

208
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,273
to an MLB scouting staff secretly.

209
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,153
Yoo Min-ho even went to the States
to take a pitching test.

210
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:33,033
But he had a pain in his elbow
and came back to Korea.

211
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,706
Mr. Yang was the only one

212
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,875
who knew about Yoo Min-ho's condition.

213
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,171
Nevertheless, he insisted
that we select Yoo Min-ho,

214
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,589
and we drafted him

215
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,675
as he intended.

216
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,679
Isn't that so strange and awkward?

217
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,349
Mr. Yang.

218
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,936
Is there anything that's not true?

219
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,490
It wasn't just because I was close to him.

220
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:19,496
I hoped and believed
he'd be a great player.

221
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,624
It's true that I was aware

222
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,253
that he might not do well
in the first few years.

223
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,337
But...

224
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,758
I still thought it was not a big deal...

225
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,596
since he'd play for our team
for more than ten years.

226
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,347
Actually,

227
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,349
I knew it, too.

228
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,897
Won-sub, you don't have
to take the blame all by yourself.

229
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,568
Still, we both agreed

230
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,821
that he was worth drafting.

231
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,656
I see.

232
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,535
This isn't the penalty for having
lost the Rookie of the Year.

233
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,870
However,

234
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,789
Mr. Yang didn't keep the process

235
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,666
of selecting Yoo Min-ho transparent,
thus ruining the system.

236
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,963
He'll get a reduced salary
for three months.

237
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,888
The penalty will be applied.

238
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,933
And...

239
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,522
-Mr. Ko.
-Yes.

240
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,609
Shall we begin?

241
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,078
LEE YONG-JAE

242
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,257
Are you on your way here?

243
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,011
Are you on your way here?

244
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,103
What do you mean?

245
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,648
There are 77 high school baseball
teams in the country.

246
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,775
And the Dreams drafted

247
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,486
55 rookie players

248
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,614
under Mr. Ko's stewardship
over the last five years.

249
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,740
And...

250
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,328
do you know how many players we picked

251
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,166
from Jindeok, Hwajeon,
and Yesung High Schools?

252
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,004
-How many were there?
-There were 15.

253
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,464
Okay. And what about it?

254
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,260
Manager Kim Myung Il
of Hwajeon High and you

255
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,054
-graduated from the same school, right?
-Right.

256
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,848
We graduated from the same high school.

257
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,476
What about Manager Sung Moon-hyun
of Jindeok?

258
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,188
We graduated from the same college.
Is that a problem?

259
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,441
Then what about the manager
of Yesung High?

260
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,195
What does he have to do with me?

261
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,785
You're in the same alpine club.

262
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,666
Goodness. You haven't gone home yet?

263
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,130
-I just have a lot on my plate.
-I see. It's not easy, is it?

264
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,882
BASEBALL LOVERS' ALPINE CLUB
8TH ANNIVERSARY

265
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,550
BASEBALL LOVERS' ALPINE CLUB

266
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,846
BASEBALL LOVERS' ALPINE CLUB

267
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,434
BASEBALL LOVERS' ALPINE CLUB
EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY

268
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,771
A shot with Mr. Ko of the Dreams
and the manager of Yesung High

269
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,855
Right.

270
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,565
I heard about him.

271
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,486
We've met a couple of times. So?

272
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,073
You've selected 30 percent
from your acquaintances' schools

273
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,366
with low-ranking players.

274
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,534
That way you won't be blamed

275
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,328
even if they don't see
the light as players.

276
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,126
Stop beating around the bush
and tell me your point.

277
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,546
You're incompetent, to say the least.

278
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,346
What's likely is
an irresponsible dereliction of duty.

279
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,891
In the worst case,

280
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,813
I think it's an unprecedented
pro team scouting scandal.

281
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,171
Goodness, what an absurd man you are.

282
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,265
Let's say it's a dereliction of duty.

283
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,767
An irresponsible dereliction of duty.

284
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,104
If you admit your dereliction
of duty, you shouldn't...

285
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,647
I'm not talking about me.

286
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,065
I'm talking about those managers.

287
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,818
Those three managers irresponsibly
neglected their duties.

288
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,279
Why do you think I selected them?

289
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,489
Even though it doesn't say on the records,

290
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,950
there are things you have to watch
from the side.

291
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,118
Sincerity,

292
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,953
relationship with peers,

293
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,665
whether he's strong in action,
his physical condition, and so on.

294
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,668
They only tell me
because they're close to me.

295
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,672
That's what I'd call irresponsible
dereliction of duty. Am I wrong?

296
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,926
The people who've gone to the
same school as me and the alpine club.

297
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,931
You've discovered
some incredible things about me.

298
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,808
Right?

299
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,685
Is this the Major League or something?

300
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:40,400
You wouldn't know wellÂ because
you haven't been in this field for long.

301
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,737
But try being around for 30 years.

302
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,030
You know everyone.

303
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,116
Out of the players you chose
with such high-quality information,

304
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,701
who was able to achieve something?

305
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,662
Should I call out names?

306
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,417
These selected people would've
quit baseball if it hadn't been for you.

307
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,545
Kim Il-hyung, No Tae-moon,

308
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,880
Song Hyun-soo,

309
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:06,176
Lee Yong-jae, Nam Ki-taek,
Park Heon-young, Song Woo-jinâ€¦

310
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,803
What are you doing?

311
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,096
Among these people,

312
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,557
has anyone gotten actual results
except for Lee Yong-jae?

313
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,187
Big success doesn't usually occur early,
don't you know?

314
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,190
You can't tell anything
from just a few years of records!

315
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,902
Why would a team in need
of immediate strength want a late bloomer?

316
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,407
Didn't the team request
someone with strength?

317
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,452
Fine.

318
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,249
Let's say I was incompetent.

319
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,502
Mr. Ko.

320
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,838
What?

321
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,758
I don't think
that's the right answer either.

322
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,687
Hey.

323
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,981
The Dreams will draft a player.

324
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,318
Myungil High School's pitcher,
Yoo Min-ho will be our selection.

325
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,237
Congratulations, Yoo Min-ho.

326
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,449
The Dreams, who have requested for more
time in the first round of selections,

327
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,160
have selected player Yoo Min-ho
after a heated discussion.

328
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,662
If you watch this footage,

329
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,832
you look pretty bewildered
by Mr. Yang's sudden act.

330
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,461
But at this bewildering moment...

331
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,757
why are you looking that way,

332
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,634
where the parents are?

333
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,975
You'd know where the general manager was
on the opposite side.

334
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,524
Am I being insulted now

335
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,862
because I was confused about
where the general manager was

336
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,530
during last year's draft?

337
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,996
The mother of player Lee Chang-kwon
was sitting back there.

338
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,457
You promised to draft him,

339
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,418
so weren't you bewildered that you
couldn't select him because of Mr. Yang?

340
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,669
What are you talking about?

341
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,800
-What is he doing here?
-Is he here for someone?

342
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,719
I told you I saw him.

343
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,181
It was because I knew
how talented Lee Chang-kwon was.

344
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,808
Why would I be bewildered?
You call this proof?

345
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,728
Don't try to set me up.
I was just looking the wrong way.

346
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,317
I didn't notice
what a character you were, Mr. Baek.

347
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,113
I don't think I can make it today.
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,297
I have nothing more to say.

349
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,134
Bring me the proper proof.
Then we can talk again.

350
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:56,888
Se-young.

351
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,809
Are you waiting for someone?
You sure look like it.

352
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,021
Mr. Baek,

353
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,441
I get you're working hard,

354
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,736
but try not to harm anyone
while you're at it.

355
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,241
And what was it? Disciplinary action?
Good luck with that.

356
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,451
I wonder how I'll be punished

357
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,955
for turning my head
in the wrong direction.

358
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm leaving.

359
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,476
How have you been?

360
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,190

361
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,988
A year ago,
I paid 50 million won to Mr. Ko...

362
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,783
and he promised to select me at the draft.

363
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,120

364
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,414
What a total lunatic!

365
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,210
I recorded his call.

366
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,588
In this file, he assures me
he'll select me before the deal

367
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,216
and refuses to give the money back
after the deal.

368
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,552
Hey, you punk! Are you crazy?

369
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,262
What is this lunatic saying?

370
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,847
Shall we...

371
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,058
listen to this file entirely?

372
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,186
That little punk!
Do you want to ruin your career?

373
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,937
-Come here, youâ€¦
-Mr. Ko!

374
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,485
You've done nothing right!

375
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,654
The one who gave the money
isn't the only one to blame!

376
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,490
-What's the point of all this?
-Of course,

377
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,827
we were wrong because we didn't
notice the money exchange.

378
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,705
You were also wrong to give money to him,

379
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,375
and the one who received money
is the most to blame.

380
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,876
However...

381
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,214
after you became the Rookie of the Year,

382
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,300
were you simply happy,
without any uncomfortable feelings?

383
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:58,927
So...

384
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,513
are you trying to fix the barn

385
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,682
-after the horse is stolen?
-We should.

386
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,144
We've lost a horse.
Why wouldn't we fix it?

387
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,605
If we don't, we wouldn't be able
to raise horses anymore.

388
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,484
Mr. Lee Chang-kwon.

389
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,320
You've got a younger brother
who plays baseball, right?

390
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,199
Are you going to let that
happen to your brother, too?

391
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,786
Rather than thinking
about how to get better control

392
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,373
or how to get the ball farther,

393
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,626
do you want him to think about

394
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,254
whether he should give money
to someone like Mr. Ko or not?

395
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,216
Are you going to
let your brother worry about that?

396
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,018
Mr. Ko.

397
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,772
Give 50 million won...

398
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,151
back to Mr. Lee.

399
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,739
Also, Mr. Ko...

400
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,075
you're fired.

401
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,527
Mr. Yang.

402
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,946
Yes.

403
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,323
A reduced pay for three months.

404
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,576
I think that should be enough.

405
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,039
And Ko Se-hyuk.

406
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,916
-Yes.
-Why did you do such a thing?

407
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,170
-How could you make such a mistake?
-A mistake?

408
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,423
There's no one here
that Mr. Baek can rely on right now.

409
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,635
You're the man of dignity and connections.

410
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,388
You should've helped Mr. Baek.
How could you cause this trouble?

411
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,224
I apologize.

412
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,768
Haven't you learned anything
as you've gotten older?

413
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,562
You're supposed to be
the legend of the Dreams!

414
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,776
I'm going to keep my eyes on you.

415
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,736
Yes.

416
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,739
Mr. Baek.

417
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,201
If Mr. Ko makes another mistake like this,

418
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,119
fire him no matter what.

419
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,331
What are you doing?

420
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,083
What do you mean?

421
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,252
We're punishing him.

422
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,382
Even though it happened last year,
we're punishing him severely

423
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,634
because we respect your opinion so much.

424
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,847
Well, will you only punish him properly

425
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,850
when I find out if it was just last year,

426
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,060
or if he's been doing this
for a long time?

427
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,315
Are you saying you will have him
in charge of choosing rookies again?

428
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,859
Mr. Baek.

429
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:05,363
What he did was wrong,
but let's think about our situation.

430
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,533
Who can replace Se-hyuk's position?

431
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,701
No one can.

432
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,163
-We have no one else...
-Mr. Yang can replace him.

433
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,299
You want to fire Ko Se-hyuk,
who suggested to choose the best rookie,

434
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,801
and make Yang Won-sub a scout team leader

435
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,846
when he selected Yoo Min-ho,
who had an injury?

436
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:35,560
Why would you keep mentioning
that lucky result?

437
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,147
I'm going to straighten out the system.

438
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,148
So, you are saying

439
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,651
that guy became the best rookie
out of luck. Is that it?

440
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,696
Lee Chang-kwon told me

441
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,408
that he saw his parents cry
after the rookie draft.

442
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,953
It gave him the strength
to go through extreme training.

443
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,582
You say he would've been the best rookie

444
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,752
even if he had joined our team because
you're focusing only on the result.

445
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,963
You need to select a player...

446
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,883
through meticulous analysis.

447
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,470
That's the way to build up
a proper system.

448
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:14,599
And it will be possible
if Mr. Yang becomes the scout team leader.

449
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,726
Mr. Baek.

450
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,313
-Yes?
-That was a nice speech.

451
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,777
It's nothing,
so, there's no need to drag this out.

452
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:27,820
Mr. Ko.

453
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,531
Do you have any last words?

454
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,911
-Your last chance to defend yourself.
-I will not let this happen again.

455
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,081
Okay. What about you, Mr. Yang?

456
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,209
I am sorry.

457
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,213
Three months
of salary reduction for Mr. Yang,

458
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,799
and dismissal for Mr. Ko?

459
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,100
Okay, let's do that.

460
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,358
-Sir.
-Why did you take that money?

461
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,403
Well, it wasn't much.

462
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,155
I would've at least commended you
if you had taken a lot of money.

463
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,573
Why did you put yourself

464
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,993
in this resentful situation
over that mere amount of money?

465
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,077
It breaks my heart.

466
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,083
Get out.

467
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,604
I'll leave too, then.

468
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,984
Mr. Baek.

469
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,947
I need to talk to you for a moment.

470
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,588
About what we talked about the other day

471
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,965
after we kicked out Lim Dong-gyu.

472
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,010
Do you remember?

473
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,304
I told you.

474
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,099
I hired you
because of your unique experience.

475
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,351
Win,

476
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,103
then disband.

477
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,024
Win and disband.

478
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,069
Just do what your experience says.

479
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,821
I'm not asking for much.

480
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,283
I thought you understood.

481
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,788
-I did.
-So, why do you keep

482
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,832
planting your apple tree on earth
that will go to pieces tomorrow?

483
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,170
Why are you smiling?

484
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,007
You told me to do the same as I have done.

485
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,300
Right, disbandment.

486
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,262
Just disbanding the team isn't
what I have done.

487
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,265
Victory.

488
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,937
And then disbandment.
I thought that was the deal.

489
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,484
I was trying so hard for victory.
Wasn't that what you wanted?

490
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,568
Mr. Baek.

491
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,612
I'm hearing that you took money

492
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,322
after the disbandment
of the handball team.

493
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,950
It's a filthy rumor
created by filthy punks.

494
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,913
What is the actual reason that
you hired me despite hearing all that?

495
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,209
You're going too far.

496
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,839
I hope the Dreams play well enough
for you to change your mind.

497
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,719
So, you will make this team win for real?

498
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,933
Only by scouting a skilled pitcher
and changing the scout team leader?

499
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,020
Yes, so I'll be very busy from now on.

500
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,891
Mr. Ko is a former franchise player,

501
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,352
but I'm not even from here.

502
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,772
I failed as a player.

503
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,901
So your salary has been reduced
for three months.

504
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,864
I'm not changing people.
I'm only changing the system.

505
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,203
Will I be able to do a good job?

506
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,455
I don't expect you
to do a good job all of a sudden.

507
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,832
I just want you to do what you always do.

508
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,004
Okay.

509
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,549
And I'm going to have confidence
that you won't do anything

510
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,426
that harms the team again.

511
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,636
Yes, sir!

512
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,434
That startled me.

513
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,606
Do you remember?

514
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,818
It's already 15 years ago.

515
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,406

516
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,701
Bases were loaded with 2 outs
in the bottom of the 9th inning.

517
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,081
You were the one who was at-bat.

518
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,794
At that time,

519
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,297
when the umpire was about to say
you were hit by the pitch,

520
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,842
you told him that it was a foul ball.

521
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,845
That the ball hit the handle of your bat.

522
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,810
The game could've ended,
but it continued thanks to that.

523
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,813
I thought it was so cool.

524
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,982
The game was almost over.

525
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,193
You were the only person I became a fan of

526
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,364
because of how you struck out...

527
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,659
rather than hitting a home run.

528
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,126
That's because...

529
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,421
I was young then.

530
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,051
No.

531
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,140
Because you were righteous.

532
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,438
Baseball was...

533
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,400
so fun back then.

534
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,458
Good work.

535
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,257
What kind of man was Mr. Ko Se-hyuk?

536
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,932
He had his own theory of hitting.

537
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,603
He was sociable

538
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,440
with everyone who knew him
for a long time on his side.

539
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,526
People still recognized...

540
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,863
that he had an eye for good batters.

541
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,448
But...

542
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,118
he has to step down now.

543
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,330
Someone once said...

544
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,043
no one has only one side of themselves.

545
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,962
We need to see both sides.

546
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,091
Like what you did just now.

547
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,594
Is that a compliment?

548
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,393
Oh, how did you find out
about the alpine club?

549
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,145
That's justâ€¦

550
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,772
You did well.

551
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,946
He's commending me a lot today.

552
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,036
If you're a fan of the Dreams,

553
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,455
this news report
might make your heart drop.

554
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,458
Andy Gordon has been the ace of the team
for three years.

555
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,877
It's said the Japanese franchise
named Yokohama

556
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,379
has him on the scouting list

557
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,673
to strengthen their starter
for the next year's season.

558
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,341
-Will the Dreams keep him?
-What?

559
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,384
Isn't that your team?

560
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:30,928
Right.

561
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,847
You know what?

562
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,724
Sorry for not finishing the meal.

563
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,727
Gosh. Hey, stop!

564
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,731
Geez. She didn't even have a bite.

565
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,900
I'm screwed.

566
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,827
About Andyâ€¦

567
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,957
Mr. Baek.
Did you watch the news about Andy?

568
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,043
I did. Is the data I asked you for
the other day ready?

569
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,212
Yes.

570
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,047
PITCHER ANDY GORDON

571
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,259
Andy isn't a first-class player,
so I never thought

572
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,136
the Japanese teams
would be interested in him.

573
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,974
What do you think?
Will we be okay without Andy?

574
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:21,020
There are some indicators
that are hard to explain.

575
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,855
Do you mean the ball-to-strike ratio,

576
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,317
the double play rate,

577
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,360
and the rates of fly-outs
and ground-outs?

578
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,863
There are more, but it includes them.

579
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:34,241
Now we can't say he knows
nothing about baseball.

580
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,911
You're the only one who doesn't
know baseball now.

581
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:39,914
Manager Yoon.

582
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,750
What do you think about Andy Gordon?

583
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,545
It depends on the goal you have.

584
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,214
It's about my goal?

585
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,261
Andy showed his best performance
only in the first year out of three.

586
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,055
Right, but there's no big difference.

587
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,557
This year's performance
is slightly worse than in other years.

588
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,602
Still, it's hard to say
he's on the decline--

589
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,272
The WHIP went up notably.

590
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,775
And he threw 89 pitches on average.

591
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,695
He played his role as the ace
starting pitcher of the bottom team.

592
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,367
But he's not better than the
second-best pitchers of the leading teams.

593
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,913
I'm with Manager Yoon.

594
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,085
We willâ€¦

595
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,922
ANDY GORDON, PITCHER

596
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,091
...give up Andy.

597
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,305
We have quite a high goal.

598
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,516
It's hard to scout pitchers
on Andy's level.

599
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,311
We prefer predictable players
on the field,

600
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,772
and Andy is one of them.

601
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,358
We can expect that he'd get about 12 wins.

602
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,319
Andy isn't asking
for an unreasonable price.

603
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,655
Assuming he'd do the same
as previous years--

604
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,284
Does that mean we'll be
in last place next year, too?

605
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,414
-No.
-We'll release Andy.

606
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,626
Let's watch the video
of the foreign players on the list.

607
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,511
How much is he? He's got a good pitch.

608
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,680
It's 1.2 million dollars.

609
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,056
Geez.

610
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,142
Move on. We can't hire him anyway.

611
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,435
Okay.

612
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,317
What about him?

613
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,694
-He's cheaper, right?
-Sure.

614
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,237
He's 1.12 million dollars.

615
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,034
Shall we move on to the next one?

616
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,588
What's the point of watching this?

617
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,216
-Sorry?
-The other two cost more than a million.

618
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,843
How much is he, then?

619
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,555
He asked half a million.

620
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,978
He's a free agent now.

621
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,606
Due to his injury,
he couldn't advance his career,

622
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,691
and he played only in the AA league.

623
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,568
And we're very lucky.

624
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,778
AA: SECOND-HIGHEST MILB LEVEL

625
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,614
He didn't get the injury
while playing or training,

626
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,282
but while mountain biking.

627
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,870
We can include in the contract
that he won't go mountain biking.

628
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,498
Okay.

629
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:31,085
Then we'll make the list
and plan our trip to the States.

630
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,804
Anyway, who will be
on the trip to the States?

631
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,225
The operations team
is in charge of foreign players.

632
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,061
The general manager will go there,

633
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,854
so I think I'll accompany him.

634
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,940
Just the two of you?

635
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:57,277
Are you saying the whole operations
staff should go together?

636
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,780
A grown man and womanâ€¦

637
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,035
Do you really have a death wish?

638
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,120
Sorry.

639
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,248
I just think I need to experience
as many things as possible

640
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,999
as a future leader of the operations team.

641
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,086
You can go later. We scout
foreign players every year.

642
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,963
What are you talking about?

643
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,757
What if our new foreign player plays
well and stays here for ten years?

644
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,220
We have a limited budget.

645
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,140
I'll pay for my own flight ticket
and hotel.

646
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,810
I'll also upgrade your tickets
with my own money.

647
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,354
Hey.

648
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,484
Didn't I say I'd crush you

649
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,071
if you try to use your own money
for the company's work?

650
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,573
Gosh, wait. Let me go!

651
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,283
You're totally out of your mind.

652
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,668
Thank you.

653
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,422
When we arrive at the airport,
the local guide will be there.

654
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,090
-Let's go.
-Okay.

655
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,138
General Manager Baek?

656
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,974
-Hello.
-Hi.

657
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,851
Mr. Kim Jong-moo.

658
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,478
What are you here for?

659
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,106
You know we always go to the States
by this season every year.

660
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,317
Oh, to scout foreign players?

661
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,443
Yes.

662
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:25,199
By the way, which player
are you going to meet there?

663
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,161
What about you?

664
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,289
Fine.

665
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,709
Let's just say the first letter
of the name.

666
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,461
On the count of three.

667
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,379
-Sure. Let's do that.
-Okay.

668
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,508
In one, two, thâ€¦

669
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:48,096
We'll really say the first letter
of the players' names on three.

670
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,640
Okay.

671
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,435
Good. In one, two, three.

672
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,147
You tricked me.

673
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,525
You didn't say it either.

674
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,527
Fine.

675
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,946
Let's just say which state we're going to.

676
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,699
Come on. Let's be honest and say it.

677
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,494
-Let's do that.
-All right.

678
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,205
In one, two, three.

679
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,164
-California.
-America.

680
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,416
You're going to California.

681
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,419
-You're such a crook.
-Let's go.

682
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,091
I'm sorry.

683
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,554
What a crook he is.

684
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,183
Gosh.

685
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,067
Well, we're in the business class.

686
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,195
Yes. Team leaders and those higher
than them get business class tickets

687
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,488
according to the company rules.

688
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,784
-Is it the same when we return?
-Gosh.

689
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,287
We can afford this much.

690
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,581
Sure.

691
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,547
Mr. Baek, do you speak English?

692
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,756
I do.

693
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,258
Really?

694
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,803
What the fuâ€¦

695
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,180
What the...?

696
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,892
What the funny friendâ€¦

697
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,145
I can speak quite well.

698
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,189
Okay.

699
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,044
Mr. Baek! Ms. Lee!

700
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:48,425
You're late, Mr. Baek and Ms. Lee.
I came here first by parachute.

701
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,803
Didn't you submit your request
for a vacation yesterday?

702
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,513
What are you doing here?

703
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,057
Have you really lost your mind?

704
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,602
Along with having a vacation here,

705
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,856
I thought I could be of help,
so I used my money

706
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,232
to come here.

707
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,736
Is it okay to spend
your days off like this?

708
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,530
I'll learn the work, and you'll earn
some help. I speak English well,

709
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,866
-but Ms. Lee's pronunciation is a bitâ€¦
-Come here.

710
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,576
-Why?
-I said come here.

711
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,411
-No.
-Hello.

712
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,375
I'm Robert Gil and I'm here
to serve as a guide.

713
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,336
You're Ms. Lee
and General Manager Baek, right?

714
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,254
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

715
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,885
-There is one moreâ€¦
-Don't worry about him.

716
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,555
This must be unexpected. I'm sorry.

717
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,724
You don't need to worry about me.

718
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,602
-I'm Han Jae-hee from the operations team.
-I see. It's good to meet you.

719
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,021
It's all right for me.

720
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,274
Will you go to the field right away
or stop by the hotel first?

721
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,361
-Let's go directly to the field.
-Okay.

722
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,905
Wait.

723
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,615
Why is the schedule so tight?

724
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,119
The reason why you feel that way

725
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,831
is that you're here on vacation
while we're here for business.

726
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,792
If you don't like it,
get away and go to Disneyland.

727
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,880
You just spat in my ear.

728
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,693
I like the American West so much.

729
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,487
Look at the clear blue sky!

730
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,491
On a day like today, we should
go camping at the national park.

731
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,035
Don't you agree?

732
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,327
Right.

733
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,620
Hey.

734
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,205
Be quiet. He's driving.

735
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,876
Can't I enjoy a vacation mood
at least on our way?

736
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,920
It's you who took a vacation.
Don't expect the same from us.

737
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,174
He is here to help us,
not to be your tour guide.

738
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,009
We've got to help each other.

739
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,719
I'll be quiet.

740
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,388
I'm glad to hear the Korean language, too.

741
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,432
You may keep talking.

742
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,684
See? He missed hearing Korean.

743
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,936
He must've wanted to do it so much.

744
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,314
I'll speak Korean as much as you want.

745
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,848
It's worse than you thought, isn't it?

746
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:46,436
It might be hard for people to visit him
no matter how good he is.

747
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,147
No one would expect

748
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,942
a great pitcher to be hidden
in a place like this.

749
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,922
Hi.

750
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,843
He's indeed our priority.

751
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,427
He's tight,

752
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,138
and flexible.

753
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,819
I saw his pitches in videos,

754
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:39,322
but can you ask him to try doing it
even if it's not his full power?

755
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,332
He says we don't have a catcher
to catch his pitches.

756
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,750
Should Iâ€¦

757
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:55,922
Hold on.

758
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,644
You see,

759
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,982
I've practiced catching balls. I've taken
professional players' pitches, too.

760
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,192
But it might be

761
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,444
a little different from the ones
you've caught.

762
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,237
It'll be okay if I catch it from afar.

763
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,421
So you're good at something.

764
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,715
How did you catch that?

765
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,477
This is crazy.

766
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,855
His pitch is weaker than we thought.

767
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,733
One more?

768
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,027
Why is that a question?

769
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,988
Hold on.

770
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,406
Hey, can you handle it?

771
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,910
Of course.

772
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,259
Goodness gracious.

773
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,505
I could've handled that pitch.

774
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:06,011
-Say it in English.
-Forget it. There's no need.

775
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,476
Are there a lot of Koreans
living in this neighborhood?

776
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,022
It's rare to find a place
without Koreans in the world.

777
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,781
Thank you.

778
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,826
The schedule starts
at 2 p.m. tomorrow, so rest up.

779
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:33,079
-I'll pick you up at around 11 a.m.
-Okay, thank you.

780
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,167
There will be a catcher tomorrow,
so you'll get to see more of him.

781
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,337
-Please go in.
-Okay.

782
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,890
Are you sure it's not uncomfortable?

783
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,516
I could get my own room.

784
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,812
You're working hard. I shouldn't
make you pay for that, too.

785
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,648
I didn't do anything though.

786
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,276
Since when did you start practicing
catching pitches?

787
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,073
It's been two years,

788
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:11,368
-even though I wasn't much help.
-No, it was better than not having you.

789
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,372
And you can drop out at any time
if you want to enjoy your break

790
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,165
since you're supposed to be on vacation.

791
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,208
It's okay.

792
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,919
I'm a man who is passionate
about work and love.

793
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,257
I see.

794
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:33,890
The agent is sly like a fox,
so I'm worried a bit.

795
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,852
He's a double A player, so I didn't think
he'd have an agent.

796
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,647
But it also means
he proved that much of his value.

797
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,650
He's worth more than
just being a double A player.

798
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,571
Even if he were a triple A,
his skills would be considered superb.

799
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,783
You know, I've caught
pro players' pitches in Korea,

800
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,077
but his were on a different level.

801
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,871
It wasn't that I caught it.
He threw the ball into my hands.

802
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,165
Are your hands okay?

803
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,335
If you need me today,
I can catch it up to two times.

804
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,213
No thanks. We'd like to see
100 percent of him.

805
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,553
It has never been this easy

806
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,264
to sign a contract
with a non-Korean player.

807
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,766
So I'm rather anxious about that.

808
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,907
It's 146.

809
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,499
It's 149 this time.

810
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,755
He's way better than Andy.

811
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,174
Awesome.

812
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,259
He's like Kang Doo-ki.

813
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,315
He says the price went up overnight.

814
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,746
152.

815
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,956
Double the price all of a sudden?

816
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,416
No way.

817
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,152
It's 155 km/h.

818
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,045
I'm telling you how determined we are.

819
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,755
-Did you give up?
-If we make excuses,

820
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,716
we'll lose in the same way again.

821
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,259
Ms. Lee, let's get to work.

822
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,510
Let's go big. 900,000 dollars.

823
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,471
If you want, we'll add
the clause in your contract.

824
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,140
100,000 dollars isn't too much, right?

825
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,850
For foreign players, it's all about money.

826
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,184
You picked a really good player.

827
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,145
Did you know from the start?

828
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,688
I don't know what to tell you.

829
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,482
I told you I could bet
that we would be the ones to smile first.
