1
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,324
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,826
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,092
How long has it been?
It's so uncomfortable.

4
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,763
Well, it's like a servant
beat the master's son.

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,556
It's fine.

6
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,730
Are you crazy?

7
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,025
Don't just call him "your father."

8
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,528
He's your uncle. Right?

9
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,131
It isn't that hard
to get you on your knees.

10
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,387
Come in.

11
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,153
You're older than him.
Why couldn't you get along with him?

12
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,988
I apologize.

13
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,532
Are you worried?

14
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,244
I won't fire you.

15
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,997
Your father...

16
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,377
used to steal dried persimmons

17
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,463
that are kept to serve the relatives
during national holidays.

18
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,800
So your grandfather
beat your dad terribly.

19
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,555
I was worried how that little kid
would deal with all those beatings.

20
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,851
I tried to protect your father
and I got beat for an hour myself.

21
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,147
I made your dad the president
of the baseball team.

22
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,067
I thought he was doing a good job
and checked up on him.

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,528
The employees weren't
treating him like a president.

24
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,363
He was changing a light bulb.

25
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,491
They looked down upon him
for having a country accent

26
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,993
and being uneducated.

27
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,037
I fired all the employees.

28
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,833
That's how much I cared for your father.

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,835
Yes.

30
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,507
After that happened,
I never gave your dad work.

31
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,345
I'd only go visit him to see if he was
living like an ordinary person.

32
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,183
He couldn't even resist
the dried persimmons.

33
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,059
His older brother was the chairperson,

34
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,687
but he couldn't even be respected
on the baseball field.

35
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,524
But you're different from your dad.

36
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,361
That's why I'm giving you work.

37
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,864
You work well.

38
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,991
I will...

39
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,202
do better.

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,622
If you work any better,

41
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,833
I guess the baseball team
will soon be disbanded.

42
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,878
Yes.

43
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,554
LET'S GO, DREAMS!

44
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,819
KANG DOO-KI! THE DREAMS!

45
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,950
Sir. You should have
told me you were coming.

46
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,245
-What is Baek Seung-soo doing these days?
-He's just...

47
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,082
I think we're being too nice to him
since his remaining time is limited.

48
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,501
Who is it?

49
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,504
He's the facility administrator here.

50
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,131
Are you...

51
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,342
-Sir.
-Yes.

52
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,596
-Why are you working at this late hour?
-I'm retiring tomorrow.

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,431
So I was just taking pictures
of the place.

54
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:26,933
Do you know me?

55
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,144
Aren't you the son
of President Kwon Jae-woo?

56
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,981
Right?

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,276
How do you know him?

58
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,361
I've worked here for a while.

59
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,825
You haven't changed from the kid that
used to follow his dad to work here.

60
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,412
I saw you at the baseball field
here as well.

61
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,124
President Kwon Jae-woo

62
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,711
administered the facility himself
despite his high position

63
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,546
and was a great person.

64
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,155
THE DREAMS SHOP

65
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,200
Weren't you a fan
of the Dreams back in the day?

66
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,536
I remember you being a fan of Um Sang-gu.

67
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,429
Such nonsense.

68
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,277
How are preparations
for the off-season training going?

69
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,239
We're in talks with a travel agency
to host a fan event.

70
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,867
We need to put extra focus
on preventing any injuries.

71
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,411
We need to be in talks with the venue.

72
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,747
Any other things to report?

73
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,501
There aren't any major issues.
The athletes are used to the place.

74
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,961
The chef at the training area
is an old man,

75
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,838
and he makes great fried rice.

76
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,799
If you taste it, you'll...

77
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,056
Let's end the meeting.

78
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,270
Find it delicious.

79
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,278
Sir, you're being called
to the president's office.

80
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,906
-By the president?
-No.

81
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,618
-If it's not the president...
-It's the director of Jaesong Group.

82
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,414
What are the important events
remaining on the schedule?

83
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,627
Well, the most important one now
is the off-season training.

84
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,630
-The period is long.
-It's very expensive as well.

85
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,217
But it's money that will be spent anyways.

86
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:11,556
We should find a way to make changes
so that the money is not being wasted.

87
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,269
But, sir, we're leaving the program intact
because of regional public opinion.

88
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,313
-If we get rid of that...
-Now that I think about it,

89
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,733
we've been too scared
of the worst-case scenario.

90
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,112
Mr. Baek will make a scene again.

91
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,157
Let's not be afraid
to get our hands dirty.

92
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,161
If we don't disband the team,
we can avoid a boycott.

93
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,455
All right.

94
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,849
I had something important to say.

95
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,853
Are preparations
for the off-season training going well?

96
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,939
Well, pretty much.

97
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,859
"Well, pretty much"?

98
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,739
-How disrespectful.
-It's fine.

99
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,742
We'll feel less sorry since he's so rude.

100
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,040
To make things short,
we're going to cancel off-season training.

101
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,379
What is this? Cancel what?

102
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,089
I canceled it.

103
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,008
You already did?

104
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:30,885
He just did.

105
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,640
Why are you doing this?

106
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,559
The costs for the training
are way too expensive.

107
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,189
It's not easy sending
that many people to another country.

108
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,359
I'm sure you came here driving a car
despite high oil prices.

109
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,027
What did you say?

110
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,074
What kind of professional team
doesn't do off-season training?

111
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,579
You seem to do things that other people
wouldn't dare to do.

112
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,832
But you always seem to follow others
when it comes to good things.

113
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,668
Who told you not to go?

114
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,878
You want us to go somewhere
within the country?

115
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,921
That is it.

116
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,512
Why are you going this far?

117
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,559
You've pretended to be reasonable,
rational, and not a dirt bag.

118
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,981
You at least made it seem
like a normal organization.

119
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:31,988
Baek Seung-soo.

120
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,079
I'll be very frank.

121
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,333
The reason why I'm going this far...

122
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,880
is because I can.

123
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,884
I thought about it, and I realized
that I can do this.

124
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,975
You shouldn't disagree with me,
but do things just I do.

125
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,895
Just tell the people that this is how
things turned out and to do as such.

126
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,403
It's easier to suppress your inferiors
than to go against your superiors.

127
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,865
You will be leaving soon,

128
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,909
but I hope you learn this lesson
before you go.

129
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,664
I know exactly why you still haven't
disbanded the team.

130
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,877
Aren't you going to take care
of the company's image?

131
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,796
Are you blackmailing me?

132
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,007
No.

133
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,468
That's your problem.

134
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,513
If we fail to manage our public image,

135
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,391
we have no reason
to keep running this team.

136
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,601
We'd get rid of it instantly.

137
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,647
It's your job to manage
public opinion too.

138
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,232
Mr. Baek.

139
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,488
Do you still not have any regrets?

140
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,617
Even when you're making it harder
for everyone around you?

141
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,792
That brat.

142
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,961
You're going to regret this!

143
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,803
Why was the off-season training canceled?

144
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,138
It's the parent company.

145
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,059
Then where do they want us to go
for off-season training?

146
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,230
-We can go anywhere within the country.
-But we're going to a warmer country

147
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,399
since the players might be injured.

148
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,984
Should I check the fields in Jeju Island?

149
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,778
I already checked.

150
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,281
They're all fully booked on Jeju Island.

151
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,785
Should I look into the places
to the south?

152
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,912
But it's not that different
even in the southern area.

153
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,749
We'll be considered incompetent
wherever we choose to go,

154
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,543
but it'd still be different.

155
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,008
Oh, come on in.

156
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,430
-Hello.
-Hello, have a seat.

157
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,022
We're having problems
with the training site.

158
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,275
The site we booked
for the off-season training

159
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,569
was canceled before we knew it.

160
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,739
Then where are we going?

161
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,450
-Aren't we going to the training?
-We are.

162
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,035
-We'll go somewhere domestic.
-It'd be Jeju Island.

163
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,371
Jeju Island was fully booked already.

164
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,958
-Then we should prepare measures.
-Where are we going then?

165
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,755
It's so tough to work with
a general manager who's being hated.

166
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,299
We shouldn't be blaming
our general manager for this.

167
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,051
We should agree to something
and talk to the president or--

168
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,220
Well, there's no room
for compromise with them.

169
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,223
There's also nothing I can do
if you blame me.

170
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,102
But we tried to book a site
that's located as far south as possible.

171
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,228
Please read these.

172
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,779
This is the best one
of the options we have left.

173
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:05,159
Since we'll be training somewhere cold,
I've prepared a lot of other things.

174
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,328
INDOOR FIELD AND FACILITIES FOR RAIN

175
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,664
I get your decision on the location.

176
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,334
But how are we going to have
practice games?

177
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,711
The players can't keep
playing against each other.

178
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,006
-We're liaising with the college teams.
-College teams?

179
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,801
It's meaningless
if it's not against a professional team!

180
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,344
Do you have any alternatives?

181
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,806
This is driving me crazy.

182
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,769
Don't you know the players' muscles
will stiffen and lead to more injuries

183
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,937
in cold weather?

184
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,775
Think about why the other teams
would spend money to go overseas.

185
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,236
Do you...

186
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,905
still not have any regrets?

187
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,784
You're making it harder
for everyone around you.

188
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,422
Yes. I admit.

189
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,301
If we get poor results this season,

190
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,513
you may think it's because we didn't
have proper off-season training.

191
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,308
I promise to give you
the best alternative.

192
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,852
I apologize.

193
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,614
I'm going to a meeting
with general managers tomorrow.

194
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,617
I'd like to talk to Jang Jin-woo.

195
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,202
Jang Jin-woo?

196
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,329
Yes, I want to hear from him

197
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,124
what it was like when our team
finished in second place.

198
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,375
I'll get going.

199
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,002
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

200
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,423
I think I know what it is.

201
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,884
-Me too.
-I think I figured it out first.

202
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,135
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

203
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,679
That's the non-honorific.

204
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,223
-Isn't it?
-That was smart.

205
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,020
It's been a while
since you took a beating.

206
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,109
Today's meeting
with the general managers was held

207
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,112
because General Manager Baek Seung-soo
submitted a questionnaire.

208
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,532
We'll talk about organizing
the regular-season schedules.

209
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,327
Yes. It's simple.

210
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,039
Since a lot of teams are located
in the Seoul metropolitan area,

211
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,667
when the teams in the provinces
travel for matches,

212
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,670
they spend a lot of time on the bus.

213
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,214
I feel that it'll be unfavorable to them.

214
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,967
Let me talk.

215
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,930
Did the Dreams play badly because of that?

216
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,891
No, that's not true.
We were bad at baseball.

217
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:39,521
Are you claiming favorable terms
until there's equality of outcome?

218
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,149
I'm claiming fairness, not equality.

219
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:46,612
I'm asking for your consideration
for the provincial teams

220
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,614
when it comes to the training.

221
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,699
Why?

222
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,619
Please consider the difference
in the distance.

223
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,080
Even if you become very considerate
all of a sudden,

224
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,457
the provincial teams
will take the top three places

225
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,125
in terms of the travel distance.

226
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,420
It sounds like you want to say
that you play badly

227
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,756
because you're on a bus for too long.

228
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:12,304
You can now forget about the fact
that my team is bad at baseball.

229
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,640
We'd like to get results
that match our skills,

230
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,726
not lose because we're tired
from the long-distance travel.

231
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,980
I knew you'd say that,
so I've brought some materials

232
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:25,025
on the correlation between travel distance
and championship numbers on each team.

233
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,568
-Please turn it on.
-Yes.

234
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,280
Let's see.

235
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,829
The teams with the longer travel distances
are ranked first, third, and fourth

236
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,248
on the number of championships in history.

237
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,044
Why are you laughing?

238
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,631
In 1985, the average starting salary
of the geography majors

239
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,050
at University of North Carolina
was $100,000.

240
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,388
With the current exchange rate,
that's over 110 million in Korean won.

241
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,265
Do you know why it's so high?

242
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,769
Among the graduates,
there was Michael Jordan.

243
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,982
Don't be fooled by the average number.

244
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,693
How old are these statistics
on the number of championships?

245
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,820
Wow.

246
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,705
That's it for today's meeting.

247
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,665
-Good job, everyone.
-Thank you.

248
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,167
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

249
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,543
Let's go together.

250
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,215
Hey. You can't surprise me like that.

251
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,926
What do you mean?
Was there a problem during the meeting?

252
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,303
No, you were fire...

253
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,516
-You were fired.
-Were you surprised?

254
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,479
We've become quite attached.
It gave me a heavy heart.

255
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,947
Mr. Baek. Congratulations on your return.

256
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,700
Yes, are you saying that with sincerity?

257
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,664
The Dreams aren't even our match.

258
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,293
And you signed with Gil Chang-ju
because we took away Miles.

259
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,046
I thought that was the reason
that happened to you.

260
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,422
So I felt really bad.

261
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,008
I would have still
signed with Gil Chang-ju

262
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,510
even if I could hire Miles.

263
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,346
-My gosh.
-Seriously?

264
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,684
Mr. Baek, your pride is going to
get you in trouble again in the future.

265
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,354
Where are you going
for off-season training?

266
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,773
We usually go to Arizona in America.

267
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:32,194
We would train for two weeks
in Florida and move to Japan.

268
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,197
It'll probably be the same this year.
What about the Dreams?

269
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,075
We're looking into it.

270
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,244
Wait, you're looking into it now?

271
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,372
Didn't you sign the contract in summer?
What's your plan?

272
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,792
Goodness.

273
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,753
By the way, have you heard of any rumors?

274
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,339
What rumors?

275
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,759
-It's nothing.
-Come on.

276
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,011
What is it?

277
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,724
Drugs. They're planning to tighten control
on drug tests.

278
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,685
I heard a lot of players will be caught.

279
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,105
The KPB says it's better to catch them
before the season begins.

280
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,316
Why would they cover it up until now,
and not deal with it right away?

281
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,944
No reason.

282
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,530
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

283
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,033
Gosh.

284
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,663
How is Lim Dong-gyu doing?

285
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,417
-Kang Doo-ki is--
-Kang Doo-ki must be doing great.

286
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,961
He wanted to go to your team so badly.

287
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,589
Is Lim Dong-gyu...

288
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,842
usually like that?

289
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,678
He's so gloomy. He doesn't talk to anyone.

290
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,681
He wasn't usually like that.

291
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,352
But I can't say anything to him
because he trains so hard.

292
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,649
Almost too hard. I've never seen a batter
that trains harder than him.

293
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,698
It's been a while, Heung-man.

294
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,035
Are you investigating the things
I asked you last time?

295
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,455
Okay. Thank you for your effort.

296
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,123
Bye.

297
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,845
Mr. Baek.

298
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,514
Can you come here for a second?

299
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,893
Ball.

300
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,479
It's about the players
playing in the Australian league.

301
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,649
They're fortunately showing
good performances except for Yoo Min-ho.

302
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,734
It's saying he can't pitch at all.

303
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,570
-He made three balks and got switched.
-What is it?

304
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,864
A PITCH THAT VIOLATES
PITCHING PROTOCOLS

305
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,205
-Did he injure himself?
-No.

306
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:53,585
They did a medical test on him,
but it seems to be psychological.

307
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,088
It might be the yips.

308
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,131
AN ATHLETE FUMBLING
DUE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS

309
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:02,010
Mr. Yoo. You were a pitcher
when you were in high school.

310
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,722
How do you overcome the yips?

311
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,684
It's different case by case.

312
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,770
Were there more pitchers
who couldn't overcome it?

313
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,105
Right.

314
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,238
Mr. Baek. We're ready for the meeting.

315
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,407
Okay. Let's watch him for now.

316
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,371
I've given some thought
about the off-season training.

317
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,332
That's why I invited Jang Jin-woo
to the meeting.

318
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,129
To ask him the difference between now
and when the team won second place.

319
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,339
There are some differences.

320
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,010
First off, there was a pitcher
who won 19 times in a season.

321
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,596
Are you talking about yourself now?

322
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,682
Just stay still.

323
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,060
Now we have Kang Doo-ki.

324
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,064
Why do you think you could
pitch so well at that time?

325
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:02,237
It's very important for pitchers
to control their mind in the bullpen.

326
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,658
Do you know Ki-bum? The owner
of the restaurant near the stadium.

327
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,660
He used to be a bullpen catcher.

328
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,163
A CATCHER WHO HELPS A RELIEVER
WARM UP BEFORE A GAME

329
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,539
Go!

330
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,588
Your pitches are wonderful today!

331
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,301
I gained confidence by warming up
with him before a game.

332
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,512
He helped check my condition too.
It was very helpful.

333
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,514
Nice pitch.

334
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,769
And we had skilled hitters at that time.

335
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,646
Right, they were good.

336
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,484
They were especially strong
against left-handed pitchers.

337
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,403
Among our batting practice pitchers,

338
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,781
there was a great left-handed pitcher.

339
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,992
His nickname was
the Kim Kwang-hyun Off-the-mound.

340
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,872
Maybe it was because of that guy.
It's Heo Jin-wook.

341
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,959
I tested him because he was known
for his pitching,

342
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,212
but he was bad on the mound.

343
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,216
If he's slightly off the mound,
he's as good as Kim Kwang-hyun.

344
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,260
Why did he leave the team?

345
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,639
If you want to scout him,
I'm against the idea.

346
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,142
-Why?
-He threw a bean ball during a practice.

347
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,478
-To whom?
-To a hitter.

348
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,521
Why?

349
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,358
He had a conflict with the hitter.

350
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,236
He was said to be as strong
as Kim Kwang-hyun down the mound,

351
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,322
but he used such a scary pitch
to be threatening.

352
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,157
That's too dangerous.

353
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,409
He has a problem.

354
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,412
Still, we'll need to check
what the conflict was about.

355
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,040
The hitter was Lim Dong-gyu,
as far as I remember.

356
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,546
Then I'll need to check this even more
about Heo Jin-wook.

357
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,341
But about this issue, shouldn't we focus

358
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,844
on the person who threw a bean ball
to the key hitter

359
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,346
and left the team
instead of focusing on Lim Dong-gyu?

360
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,684
I didn't say I'd bring him back,
but I'll go ask him what happened.

361
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,688
Will his strength
be bigger than his weakness?

362
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,943
What's our batting average
with left-handed pitchers?

363
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,196
Our team's batting average is .262.

364
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,117
So .269 with right-handed pitchers
and .239 with left-handed pitchers.

365
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,618
When other teams are up against us,

366
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,954
a lot of left-handed pitchers
played on the mound.

367
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,457
They indeed sent those pitchers out
on purpose.

368
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,668
SENDING A PITCHER WITH A HIGH WINNING RATE
AGAINST THE OTHER TEAM

369
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,170
Oh, there's one more.

370
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,507
Players didn't suffer
a lot of injuries at that time.

371
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,302
How are we doing
with conditioning our players?

372
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,346
Our team has the highest number
of injuries.

373
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,516
Who's responsible
for a lot of injured players?

374
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,603
The manager.

375
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:45,901
That's right, but the next person
is the conditioning part, right?

376
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,908
-Why are you looking at me?
-That doesn't make sense.

377
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,950
What doesn't?

378
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,953
Guess who was the conditioning coach
at that time.

379
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,955
-Who?
-Lee Jun-mo.

380
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,874
IN CHARGE OF
THE PLAYERS' NUTRITION, REST, SLEEP

381
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,002
Search his name online.
You'll get all the information you need.

382
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,505
Lee Jun-mo?

383
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,965
Breathe out on the count of three.

384
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,593
In one, two, three. Breathe out.

385
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,595
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

386
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,725
-Your diet is out, so please check.
-Okay.

387
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,810
Did he cause trouble too?

388
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,438
He's a personal trainer for celebrities.

389
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,649
He earned a lot
because he's a star trainer.

390
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:30,362
-I doubt if he wants to come back here.
-Will it help if we scout him?

391
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,240
He could tell the players'
physical problems

392
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,991
just by looking at the way they walked.

393
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,827
He was the specialist
in terms of preventing injuries.

394
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,040
But we don't even know where they are.

395
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,459
Even if we do,
who's going to persuade them?

396
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,219
Mr. Heo Jin-wook.

397
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,221
Mr. Heo...

398
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,266
Wait, Mr. Heo?

399
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,769
-Who?
-Mr. Heo Jin-wook.

400
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,646
Go inside there.

401
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,605
Inside?

402
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,774
Thank you.

403
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,824
Are you Mr. Heo Jin-wook?

404
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,413
-What is it?
-When do you finish work?

405
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:23,999
Who are you?

406
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,043
Well, I'm from the operations team
of the Dreams. I'm Han Jae-hee.

407
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,673
-Do you have a death wish?
-No.

408
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,175
Get lost. I won't pitch.

409
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,849
I wonder if there's a story behind that.

410
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,271
I'll never do it if it's with the Dreams.

411
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,148
Get lost.

412
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,284
Keep your shoulders steady.

413
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,911
One more time. Raise it.

414
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,830
Hello.

415
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,375
What brings you here?

416
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,421
I'd like you to be my trainer, Mr. Lee.

417
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,800
-There are other skilled trainers.
-The Dreams want to learn from you.

418
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,303
The Dreams?

419
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,808
Guess how I feel when I hear that name.

420
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,186
Longing?

421
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,898
Bad. I feel horrible.

422
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,443
Keep your shoulders down.

423
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,656
Why are you so negative?

424
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,325
-Excuse me, miss.
-Sure.

425
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,583
No one wants to improve there.

426
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,212
Do you want the Dreams to be strong?

427
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,297
Of course.

428
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,716
Will everyone think the same?

429
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,638
-What if that's not true?
-Is there anyone else other than you?

430
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,847
Yes.

431
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,975
-Then you don't need me.
-We need you so that we can be better.

432
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,939
I was young
and enthusiastic about work once.

433
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,066
I was so passionate.

434
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,528
It's true things went well
for the team when I was there.

435
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:21,491
At that time, you even checked
the players' fluid intake.

436
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,370
I tried to check their urine color,
and they got the wrong idea.

437
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:30,125
It was meaningful even though it was hard.

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,211
But they didn't even mention
a contract renewal.

439
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,589
I wouldn't have done that
if I had been the team leader then.

440
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,009
I hear the general manager
is causing all the commotion.

441
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,137
So you kept track of us.

442
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,265
I need to continue training
my client for now.

443
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,060
Oh, and search my name
with my salary on the Internet.

444
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,438
It'll make you go straight home.

445
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,191
I know you get paid a lot, Mr. Lee Jun-mo.
Everyone does.

446
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:02,031
I came because I remembered your passion.

447
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,452
Money isn't everything.

448
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,122
Money is everything.

449
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,526
What? What's this reaction?

450
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,279
You brought the snack, so put it here.

451
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,741
Why are you smiling?

452
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,830
I was surprised at first because I'm still
not used to having you come into my room

453
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,874
when I'm looking
into baseball information.

454
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:57,086
Then I smiled because now
it doesn't matter to have you see it.

455
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,756
-Okay?
-Okay.

456
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,925
What are you doing?

457
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,512
I have a lot of things to prepare
for our players' training.

458
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,850
It'll be nice to have them say
things have changed with the new analyst.

459
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,604
It's weird for them to train
in a place like that as it is.

460
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:19,359
What? A place like that?
Are you criticizing the general manager?

461
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,321
That's not what I meant,
but you could feel guilty, I guess.

462
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,324
You better not run into me
in the office tomorrow.

463
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,117
Seung-soo.

464
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm so happy to be able to work at home

465
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,958
without any worries
about getting caught by you.

466
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,670
Your plan failed, so I'll make
the team be the champion.

467
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,674
How can you make that happen all alone?
Anyway, you'd better be prepared.

468
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,385
The off-season training will be
way harder than you think.

469
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,621
Please enjoy.

470
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,388
COACH CONTRACT

471
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,808
This is the best condition
we can offer you.

472
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,229
It's our team's business
that we can't pay more than this.

473
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,399
Still, we're not asking you to work
just as much as the amount.

474
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,485
I know how much you usually get paid.

475
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,116
But I heard that your dream
was to work for a baseball team.

476
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,830
If your desperation is bigger
than the difference in the amount,

477
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,832
please work with us.

478
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:04,380
And I will never come visit you again.

479
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,581
What's wrong?

480
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,042
Tell me what's going on.

481
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,835
Just sit down.

482
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,713
Look at this.

483
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,466
It turned golden so well
that it looks super tasty.

484
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,926
You really know how to grill it.

485
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,053
Come on.

486
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,139
You've tasted it so many times.
What's with you?

487
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,309
Gosh. It's so aromatic and chewy.

488
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,061
Give it to me. I'll do it.

489
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,065
Wait. Let me see your hand.

490
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,738
Looking at your hand,
I see that nothing is easy.

491
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,241
All he'd been doing in his life
was throwing balls.

492
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,994
But he's now struggling with knife work
unfamiliar to him.

493
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,578
What's that out of the blue?

494
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,623
Hey, I worked as a bullpen catcher
to help you with your pitching

495
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,417
even after I retired.

496
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,211
I did such a thing
even though it didn't pay me much.

497
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,923
Right. You're completely fed up
with baseball because of me.

498
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,800
That's too much, though.

499
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,594
Did you take the position because of me?

500
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,929
Of course.

501
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,349
You were totally uncontrollable
without me, so I had no choice.

502
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,728
So I achieved 19 wins that season.

503
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,316
What's this strange conversation
between you two?

504
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,360
What do you want to say?

505
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,320
Well, Ki-bum.

506
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,365
-Get me some water.
-It's right in front of you.

507
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,658
It's not cold.

508
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,453
I want cold water.

509
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,625
Ki-bum.

510
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,882
You psycho.

511
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,509
You're still sharp.

512
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,345
Let's do it together.

513
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:22,143
We need a veteran bullpen catcher
who can encourage our pitchers.

514
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,021
No way!

515
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,939
But...

516
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,442
It's not because of the restaurant.

517
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,653
It's unbelievable.
You guys are so shameless.

518
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,823
I know he's working really hard
at this place now.

519
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,534
But I can no longer see him
striving so hard to catch

520
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,204
the balls the young pitchers throw
with his callused hand.

521
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,497
It breaks my heart!

522
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,042
Goodness.

523
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,021
Throw it here.

524
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,983
Do you have a death wish?
Did you play in the pro league?

525
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,735
No.

526
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,781
Although I didn't do well as a player,
you might really get hurt.

527
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,951
Then you should just throw the ball
right into the glove.

528
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,079
If you couldn't do so,
I wouldn't be following you like this.

529
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:29,168
Of course, it's a piece of cake for me.
And I said I won't.

530
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,212
I know, but just do it.

531
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,923
Come on.

532
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,994
You have such great control.

533
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,496
-But you said you were not a player.
-See?

534
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,125
-This is how competent the Dreams are.
-Did you get training or something?

535
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,503
I did. If we can't find bullpen pitchers,
I should do it.

536
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,629
Look at you.

537
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,883
Then I'll keep doing this. You do that.

538
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,304
Wait. What are you talking about?
That's not what I want to ask you.

539
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,807
Why did you do that to Lim Dong-gyu?

540
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,268
What a wacko.

541
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,355
-So you don't want to tell me?
-I want to hit you first.

542
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,484
But we don't want a violent pitcher.

543
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:40,031
No matter what I do, I won't work
with someone like you.

544
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,325
Someone who looks down on me.

545
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,454
-Did Lim Dong-gyu do the same to you?
-Gosh.

546
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,793
I'm General Manager Baek. I came
because I seriously want to know.

547
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,880
Why would a general manager come here?
Are you guys all insane?

548
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,051
That's what general managers do.

549
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,808
Se-young also won't be able
to persuade the guy, right?

550
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,853
-He's already making a lot of money.
-She's still the team leader.

551
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,313
Why don't we trust her?

552
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,609
By the way, if we hire bullpen pitchers
and a conditioning coach,

553
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,903
will our team really become strong?

554
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,073
Why do you raise such a question
all of a sudden?

555
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,992
You weren't the same
when we signed with Kang Doo-ki.

556
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,119
You know, he's a top-tier pitcher.

557
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,624
I'm just not so sure if a coaching staff
can change the team.

558
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,209
If that's what you think,

559
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,920
can a general manager
make a change in a team?

560
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,964
It's a totally different story.

561
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,299
-It's not the same.
-I neither...

562
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,136
hit nor throw the balls.

563
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,807
So I do everything that can help our team.

564
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:53,145
You'll also go to pick Yoo Min-ho up
right after you get to the office.

565
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,563
Right.

566
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,901
The young pitcher couldn't throw much
and returned because of the yips.

567
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,445
You're going all the way there
to encourage him.

568
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,615
We might not be able
to make a huge change,

569
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,326
but we just do our thing.

570
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,957
You're right.

571
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,337
It was a nice finish with awesome putting.

572
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,511
Gosh, you scared me!
Knock before you come in.

573
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,603
Will it change anything
if we hire these guys?

574
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,317
We expect it to change something
and we also hope so as well.

575
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:44,447
By the way,
since when did their pay rise this high?

576
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,116
We're paying them as much as we need them.

577
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,329
Do you think our team is that well-off?

578
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:56,083
I thought it'd be enough with the money
we saved from the flight tickets.

579
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,252
You're making me sick.

580
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,673
Just leave it here.

581
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,263
Right. You need to get
Director Kwon's approval, right?

582
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,432
What did you say? How dare you...

583
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,477
Why would I need his approval?

584
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,937
Do you think I'm his sidekick
or something?

585
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,650
Why are you not answering? Say no!

586
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:23,986
Come on!

587
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,364
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

588
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,328
So we succeeded in recruiting
Heo Jin-wook, right?

589
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,163
Yes.

590
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,458
Jae-hee told me why he threw a bean ball
at Lim Dong-gyu.

591
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,669
So you no longer oppose it?

592
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,464
Sure. You were right this time too.

593
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,594
I worked so hard
as a scorekeeper to join a baseball club,

594
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:52,056
but compared to you who claims
to know nothing about baseball...

595
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:52,973
Stop it.

596
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,143
Why do you say that?

597
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,773
Although it's quite tiresome,
we need someone like you.

598
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:05,111
If you oppose something, I reconsider it.

599
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,613
But you've never changed your mind.

600
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:11,909
I reconsider it and become convinced
that I was right.

601
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,461
Of course, there must be times
you are right.

602
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,841
I'm sure Heo Jin-wook will do well.

603
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,476
INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT ARRIVAL

604
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,478
Min-ho!

605
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,481
Min-ho!

606
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,154
What brings you here?

607
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:52,116
Hey. Everyone has been talking about
what a crybaby you've become.

608
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,325
That's why we came.

609
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,704
You must be hungry.

610
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,292
Do you eat tteokbokki when you
come back to Korea or not?

611
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,506
You eat.

612
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,844
Is this the nation of tteokbokki?

613
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,721
Let's go.

614
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,395
I just made a joke.
Try to laugh, will you?

615
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,028
Enjoy your meal.

616
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,449
But we ordered the deep-fried squid.
What is this?

617
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,951
This must be the deep-fried squid, right?

618
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:41,916
Min-ho!

619
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,668
This is good. Throw a ball.

620
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,587
I'll...

621
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,840
hit a home run with this.

622
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,760
Open your mouth.

623
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,682
Is it good?

624
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,518
Yes, it's good.

625
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,270
You still have a lot of time
to play baseball.

626
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,315
If you're tired, you can take a break.

627
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,901
-Yes.
-He's right.

628
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:12,655
We have a bright future,
the Dreams have a bright future, okay?

629
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,491
Here. Promise us you'll take
good care of your health.

630
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,450
Here.

631
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,038
Is this how you do it?

632
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,959
You're the super rookie.
You learn pretty fast.

633
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,044
Now, Dreams!

634
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,462
-Dreams!
-Dreams!

635
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,298
Excuse me.

636
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,385
I'll take the deep-fried squid
and tteokbokki for two people to go.

637
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,015
-Are you bringing them for Ms. Lee?
-Yes, no one hates tteokbokki.

638
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,184
Your grandmother.

639
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,063
Can I take some to go for my grandmother?

640
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,691
Order as much as you want.
They're all on me today.

641
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,734
We'll take 40 servings just in case!

642
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,698
I'm ready.

643
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,826
Are you taking those shoes out again?

644
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,453
I should at least have these out
to feel relieved.

645
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,454
Put them back in.

646
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,582
It reminds me of your dad,
and it's distracting.

647
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,502
The off-season training is long.

648
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,255
Leave those there so I can feel
at ease, all right?

649
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,842
You only want yourself to feel at ease.

650
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,177
Mom.

651
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,309
Stay healthy while I'm gone.

652
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,689
Sure.

653
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,747
Darn it.

654
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,792
-What's wrong?
-Do you think it makes sense to go

655
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,086
to the off-season training on a bus?

656
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,796
I heard the Dreams was also a team.

657
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,923
But how is this
a professional baseball team?

658
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,133
Who said so?

659
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,177
Kang Doo-ki.

660
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,684
-Do you think this is a team?
-It is a team, you brat.

661
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,063
Even though the club lacks the support,
we're all professional players.

662
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,232
-Isn't this a professional team?
-Sure.

663
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,525
Hello, fellow players!

664
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,861
I'm your senior, and I'm here to work
part-time as the bullpen catcher.

665
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,321
I'm Kim Ki-bum.

666
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,703
I'm trying to help Jin-woo.

667
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,331
But I don't know what else to do
in terms of economic sense.

668
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,376
Darn it.

669
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:17,297
Just for the off-season training,
I'll work part-time over there.

670
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,397
I'm Heo Jin-wook,
I used to be the batting practice pitcher.

671
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,857
It's nice to see you again.

672
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:41,905
I brought him because we might require
a specialized batting practice pitcher.

673
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:46,452
He'll pitch the ball to every corner
of your choice with his left arm.

674
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:51,206
You begged him to let you go
because your friend got in an accident.

675
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,916
But Lim Dong-gyu told you to pitch

676
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,961
100 more balls before you leave,
so you threw a bean ball at him.

677
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,338
That's a bit iffy.

678
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,049
It wasn't such a good decision,

679
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,511
but I don't think it'll be a reason
for me to never work with you.

680
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,597
He should make a promise
not to do it again.

681
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,598
Yes, he should.

682
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,975
Here. It's your contract.

683
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,942
You're crazy. You'd pay me this much?

684
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,572
You wouldn't come if I just told you
the team is like your family.

685
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,744
May I sign it? I didn't bring my seal.

686
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,829
Are you using the honorific
all of a sudden?

687
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,415
Thank you.

688
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,376
It's good to meet you.

689
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,087
I'll be your conditioning coach,
Lee Jun-mo.

690
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,508
I'll help you prepare for the season
while maintaining your condition.

691
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,802
You all know he's
the best expert in this country

692
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,889
-on preventing injuries, right?
-Also, I'll make the delicious shakes

693
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,600
that you all used to like
during the training period.

694
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,643
Thank you!

695
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,270
Thank you.

696
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,274
I'll try, and if I feel like
it's not going to work,

697
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,318
-I'll quit whenever I want.
-Sure.

698
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,029
You can irresponsibly quit
whenever you like.

699
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,408
I'm the only one allowed
to use the word irresponsible.

700
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,412
-Yes.
-And there will be no contract extension.

701
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:14,915
Sure thing.

702
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,585
I also prefer not to be treated
as someone useless after I've worked hard.

703
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,129
We would never.

704
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,007
LEE JUN-MO

705
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,803
They're all competent people who were
on our team until we won second place.

706
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:31,557
I've brought them so that we can get help
at least for the off-season training.

707
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,394
Listen. You should be dealing with
the problems of the practice games.

708
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,485
I apologize once again
for the poor training environment.

709
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,862
We're really sorry.

710
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,491
Now, here are some red ginseng drinks

711
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,369
to supplement your strength
before the training.

712
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,495
Here.

713
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,583
Think of it as a small token
of sincerity from the operations team.

714
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:01,003
-You prepared these for us?
-Let's all cheer up,

715
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,505
and finish our training without injuries!

716
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,015
Ready.

717
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,057
Stretch.

718
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,145
Go further.

719
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,855
-Okay, one, two.
-Next!

720
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,523
-Next!
-Next!

721
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,774
Stretch.

722
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,323
Go.

723
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,534
Go.

724
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:52,387
Kang Doo-ki's RPM is over 2,600
when he's throwing a slider.

725
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,305
Of course.

726
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,558
-Did you say 2,600?
-Look.

727
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,698
It's all right. Cheer up!

728
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:18,372
Min-ho. Just a moment.
Will you try pulling your elbow inside?

729
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,583
Keep going. Tell me if it hurts.

730
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,336
-It's fine.
-Rotate it this way.

731
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,922
HEO JIN-WOOK

732
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,717
All right.

733
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,180
Okay. That's good.

734
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,768
Lower.

735
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,570
-Are your knees all right?
-They're okay.

736
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,287
Every player has his own pain.

737
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,294
That must have been true.

738
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,548
And I have more body parts that hurt.

739
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,759
Take it.

740
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,720
What is it?

741
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,516
-It's medicine for hemorrhoids.
-I brought mine already.

742
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,686
It's from America.
The catchers in the MLB use this.

743
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,603
MLB?

744
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,647
Throw it.

745
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,824
Does it look like
I'm sick again this year?

746
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,701
I'm not.

747
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,537
It's much better this year.

748
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,873
From my perspective,

749
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,585
the Dreams had quite a lot
of dirt bags who needed to be dealt with.

750
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,546
Lim Dong-gyu, Ko Se-hyuk,

751
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,883
-Seo Yeong-ju.
-What?

752
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,385
I kicked Lim Dong-gyu and Ko Se-hyuk out.

753
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,263
But I won't kick you out.

754
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,640
Because I'm the only catcher you have.

755
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,976
Right.

756
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,688
-Right?
-You're one of the best defense catchers.

757
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,317
-You're unrivaled.
-What? Do you need money?

758
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,320
And I'm not one of the best.
I'm just the best.

759
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,948
I don't know how you would think of me,

760
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,578
but I'm not the kind of person
who feels excited after punching someone.

761
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:25,499
When I realize good things about those

762
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,544
who I had a conflict with,
I feel a little uncomfortable.

763
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,382
Seeing you training hard
and enduring your pain, for example.

764
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,468
So, what is your point?

765
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,386
Don't injure yourself.

766
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,973
Just that itself will raise your salary.

767
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,185
Are you worried about me now?

768
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,438
You're temperamental,
wild, and thoughtless.

769
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,192
I don't want you to act up
and feel left out in the end.

770
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,278
There's no need for it.

771
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,240
You just need to work hard.
That's my point.

772
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,504
How is our team's strength this year?

773
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,257
First off, Kang Doo-ki is with us.

774
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:20,053
Gil Chang-ju
is doing better than his heyday.

775
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,471
It's worth fighting.

776
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,891
I've arranged a practice game.

777
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,853
With a college baseball team?

778
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,770
No.

779
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,814

780
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,567
How did you arrange it with them?

781
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,278
I looked into the team
who booked a place on Jeju Island.

782
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,488

783
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,118
I thought you were going to Japan,
so why Jeju Island all of a sudden?

784
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,788
Our parent company was suddenly
against us training abroad.

785
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,374
They reserved a place on Jeju Island
and told us to go there.

786
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,006
Mr. Baek.

787
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,383
Be honest with me.

788
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,261
About what?

789
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,512
Lim Dong-gyu.

790
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,640
-I'm listening.
-Does he have a problem or not?

791
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,439
He has.

792
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:16,318
-Jeez.
-What is it? What is it? Tell me honestly.

793
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,238
-He can't even hit 50 home runs.
-What?

794
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,366
What's wrong with you?

795
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,664
Tell me honestly.

796
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,292
Did Lim Dong-gyu...

797
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,880
use drugs or not?

798
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,675
Hey, Lim Dong-gyu.

799
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,519
I've never heard of this.

800
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,149
If he can't play properly
in our games because of doping,

801
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,860
I'll make you pay for it.

802
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,488
Why are you telling me this
all of a sudden?

803
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:06,117
After the doping issue, the parent company
has changed its attitude.

804
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,621
Don't worry too much.

805
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,918
I'm sorry about grabbing you
by the collar just now.

806
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:19,130
I'm not sure if we can let it slide
just by your word of apology.

807
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,886
-Why don't we talk about a practice game?
-A practice game?

808
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,264
Between us and the Dreams?

809
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,932
Yes, I suggest two games.

810
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,226
If you come to where we are,

811
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,229
we'll provide you with food
and a place to sleep.

812
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:37,065
We've traded each of our players.
If we hold a practice game,

813
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,192
reporters will crowd in

814
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,113
to gossip about which team
was wiser with the trade.

815
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,200
A match between Kang Doo-ki
and Lim Dong-gyu.

816
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,328
I thought you'd be curious about it
as someone in the field,

817
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,746
not as the general manager.

818
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,796
We'll play two games,
and I hope we win both.

819
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,215
Experts analyze whose strategy
has been strengthened

820
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:06,511
and whose teamwork has gotten weakened
during the hot stove league.

821
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,306
But nothing turns out to be
right after the season.

822
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:14,311
I ran around here and there
to make our team stronger.

823
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:18,273
It's my first time in the baseball trade,
and I'm not sure if it'll bring results.

824
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,026
We aren't sure about that either.

825
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,487
I guess you wouldn't know
until you actually play a game.

826
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,448
I'm having a lot of thoughts.

827
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,411
Please check for me.

828
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,123
Okay.

829
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,625
Okay.

830
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,268
Lee Min-woong has become muscular.

831
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,604
He's the starting pitcher
now that Doo-ki is gone.

832
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,232
And Yang Jin-ho is the second pitcher.

833
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,983
There's Choi Woo-hyuk too.

834
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,737
Even without Kang Doo-ki,
they have two pitchers with 15 wins.

835
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,740
LIM DONG-GYU

836
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,328
Hey, Baek Seung-soo.
