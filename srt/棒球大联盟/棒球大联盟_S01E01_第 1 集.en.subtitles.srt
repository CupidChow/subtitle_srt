1
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,836
He's an artist that demonstrates

2
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,464
great music as he gets on a flow.

3
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,176
I hope that
we're able to end the year safely.

4
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,093
Yes.

5
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,261
That's great.

6
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,640
Continuing with the offense by the Dreams.

7
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,560
It's the fourth hitter, Lim Dong-gyu.

8
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,812
The first batter's box
is covered by the left fielder.

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,524
The second batter was once called out
near the third base.

10
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:11,029
The previous batting was excellent.

11
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,615
-Yes.
-It was caught by the defense, so…

12
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,378
Cold beer and lamb skewers!

13
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,589
-I'll make a call.
-Great.

14
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,549
What's going on?

15
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,676
It's ridiculous.

16
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,598
And so, I did call.

17
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,016
OPERATIONS MANAGER

18
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,603

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,773
their path to the playoffs.

20
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,942
They're facing the Dreams,

21
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,112
who scored last
for the fourth year in a row.

22
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,197
-They don't even come close.
-No.

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,116
Second place versus last place.

24
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,536
It looks like
the Dreams are in a tough situation.

25
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,996
LIM DONG-GYU

26
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,127
Lim Dong-gyu!

27
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,713
Run like the wind!

28
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:16,010
The Dreams' fourth batter,
Lim Dong-gyu, is entering.

29
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:20,932
Him walking out into the field
is enough for the fans to go wild.

30
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,644
Will he be able to hit
Kim Kwan-sik's ball?

31
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,396
-He's a sidearm pitcher.
-We'll see.

32
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,316
So far, he has a score
of two bats and one hit.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,402
TWO BATS AND ONE HIT

34
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,114
Lim Dong-gyu, home run!

35
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,700
It's Kim Kwan-sik's first throw.

36
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,161
The ball was kept close to the body.

37
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,998
I feel like Kim Kwan-sik's throw
toward the batter's body

38
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,708
was done on purpose

39
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,544
in order to put more emphasis
on the ball going to the side.

40
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,628
Yes.

41
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,338
It's his second ball.

42
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,592
He hits the ball,
and it is flying high in the air!

43
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,303
It goes…

44
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,723
-It flew out.
-beyond the field!

45
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,350
It's Lim Dong-gyu's 40th home run!

46
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,185
Lim Dong-gyu is surely good…

47
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:30,126
Since Kim Kwan-sik is a sidearm pitcher,

48
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,836
and Lim Dong-gyu bats on the right,

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,797
so you said
it'd be difficult for him to hit it.

50
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,427
But Lim Dong-gyu
made use of his smooth swing

51
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,929
and pushed it to the right.

52
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,764
-It was his 40th home run.
-Yes.

53
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,474
When the ball came toward his body,

54
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,643
do you think
he expected it to fly to the side?

55
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,103
If it's an athlete of his caliber,

56
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,981
I'm sure he expected
the second ball would go to his side

57
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,150
after the first one flew right toward him.

58
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,235
That's what I think.

59
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,321
He's basically the foreman of the Dreams.

60
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,949
He's really amazing.

61
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,033
Hello.

62
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,786
LIM DONG-GYU

63
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,120
THE LIM DONG-GYU BURGER

64
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,207
-I'll have a Lim Dong-gyu Burger.
-Okay.

65
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,379
Seriously.

66
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,385
Hey. Were you trying to hit me?

67
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,262
It's not like that.

68
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,973
-I'm sorry.
-Never mind.

69
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,518
How could I get mad at your team?
I pity your team.

70
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,104
Excuse me?

71
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,939
Lighten up.

72
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,692
Do you not know your manners
when you're in last place?

73
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,740
Here.

74
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,992
Are you going to give up?

75
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,493
The game isn't over yet.

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,040
Well, would you like to put Kang in?

77
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,918
Hey. Show some respect to the manager.

78
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,257
BENCH COACH LEE CHUL-MIN

79
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,135
You should speak out
when it's time to talk.

80
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,889
Our manager must be very tired.

81
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,893
Hey! You fools.

82
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,606
Let's go!

83
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,734
Choi Woo-hyuk is in position.

84
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,738
Jang Jin-woo is getting ready.
The runner is at first base.

85
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,699
The outer ball is coming from the right.

86
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,369
He's running up front and going back.

87
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,996
But the ball!

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,289
It falls in front of him.

89
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,332
Come on.

90
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,628
His first bat was executed in a wrong way,

91
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,964
and that's why
he's running all over the place.

92
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,883
-Yes.
-He made the wrong first decision.

93
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,052
Let's go!

94
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,137
The batter is Lee Bo-sung.

95
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,140
The ball is being caught by Jang Dong-min!

96
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,643
The ball fell after it hit his palm.

97
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,977
The second base!

98
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,106
But the ball doesn't go where it should.

99
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,024
This round of batting
leaves much to be desired.

100
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,859
This shouldn't have been difficult.

101
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:46,155
This round of batting
should have made the right mark.

102
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:57,125
At the batter's block is Choi Jun-sun.

103
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,669
It's going to the first base,

104
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,337
but to no avail!

105
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,589
The ball did not land.

106
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,099
The ball lands between the right fielder
and the center fielder!

107
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,018
We can see at this very moment

108
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,730
why the Dreams is in last place.

109
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,524
-Yes.
-Seriously.

110
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,123
SEO YEONG-JU

111
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,459
JANG JIN-WOO

112
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,486
The last match is approaching.

113
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,156
The fans are slowly getting up
out of their seats.

114
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,992
You can understand
how the fans are feeling.

115
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:13,910
Yes.

116
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:19,499
The fans don't want to pay a lot of money
to see such an underwhelming match.

117
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,378
The mascot seems to be tired as well.
I've never seen this happen before.

118
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,547
Is he serious right now?

119
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,301
I'm heading out into the field.

120
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,350
The Dreams!

121
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,520
The Dreams!

122
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,106
The Dreams!

123
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,527
The Dreams!

124
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,197
The Dreams!

125
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,076
The Dreams!

126
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,497
The people I know
who had connections help them get jobs

127
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,542
work harder to strip off that image.

128
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,961
This is not my role!

129
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,297
-The intended person called in sick today.
-Sick? I'm sick, too!

130
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,676
What's the point of sweating this much?
We're losing.

131
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,386
Is the match over?

132
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,845
The Dreams!

133
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,766
The Dreams!

134
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,228
-Hi.
-The Dreams!

135
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,606
The Dreams!

136
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,943
The Dreams!

137
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,237
DREAM MAN

138
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,613
The Dreams!

139
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,076
What is this?

140
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,996
What's going on?

141
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,583
Stop it!

142
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,334
What is that? Look!

143
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,044
What do we do?

144
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,380

145
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,591
What's happening in this situation?

146
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,719
There seems to be a conflict

147
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,431
between the coaches and the players.

148
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,599
Yes.

149
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,768
This is not the image
that the Dreams wants to portray.

150
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,729
AGAIN, NEW DREAMS FOR 2019

151
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,732
This is messed up.

152
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,816
What do we do?

153
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,444
Where are you going? Wait!

154
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,118
Ma'am! Wait up!

155
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,703
Don't go without me! Wait!

156
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,996
Don't go without me!

157
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,638
Wait for me!

158
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,316
AGAIN, NEW DREAMS FOR 2019

159
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,073
Yes.

160
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,575
I'll leave soon, in ten minutes.

161
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,292
Stop!

162
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,794
Please stop!

163
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,712
-Stop!
-Come on!

164
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,339
Stop fighting!

165
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,140
Stop already!

166
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,818
Kids are watching this, too!

167
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,947
Is this really all we've got?

168
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,243
This is the last game of the season.

169
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,585
Let's clean up.

170
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,090

171
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,731
You'd better find another job
if that's all you got!

172
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,442
You can't call it baseball!

173
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,945
Quit, you punks!

174
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,241
Please give it up for them!

175
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,743
Give them a round of applause
so they can do better next year.

176
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,580
That's scary.

177
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,539
Gosh.

178
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,875
-Who is it today?
-I don't know.

179
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,552
Go for it! You can do it!

180
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,594
The time when a baseball club

181
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:27,306
reinforces their players
during the off-season

182
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,019
-I really want to go.
-Come with me.

183
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,270
Sure. Let's go.

184
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,481
-What is that?
-That's not how you do it.

185
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,399
-That's not it.
-That's weird.

186
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,318
-Who dances like that?
-Watch me.

187
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,244
What's so funny?

188
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,205
Are you the champions?

189
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,331
-No.
-No.

190
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,251
Did you make it to the postseason?

191
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,046
Or have we won the last game at least?

192
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,009
Didn't I tell you that
you can't laugh out loud all the time?

193
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,556
I know you've worked hard
during the season.

194
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,100
But you should be full of fight

195
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,726
to at least take ninth place next year.

196
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,311
No one asks us to win the league.

197
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,398
-Am I wrong?
-You're right!

198
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,860
Nagging at you
is a bother to Jin-woo, too.

199
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,408
If he married his first love,
he'd have a son at your age.

200
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370
He's saying this all for your sake.

201
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,084
Meet me at the main gate
if you want to have a drink.

202
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,129
Okay!

203
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,213
Dismissed.

204
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,972
Is that okay?

205
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,600
Sure.

206
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,767
Do as you want.

207
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,352
Dismissed.

208
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,034
You're a handball team's general manager.
Why did you go to the baseball stadium?

209
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,243
Just because.

210
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,538
Congratulations
on winning the championship.

211
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,540
Thanks.

212
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:18,959
Right.

213
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,211
I made yuzu jam.

214
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,796
Your mother likes it.

215
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,008
I plan to visit her this weekend.

216
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,677
Use a delivery service. It's too far.

217
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,388
If I leave in the morning,
I can come back by the evening.

218
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,474
She'd find it weird and be worried.

219
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,184
She'd be like that
even if I go to see her.

220
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,355
You know,

221
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,650
you can just give her a call
and say hello from time to time.

222
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,947
Will it be really impossible

223
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,116
for the unpopular sports leagues
to survive in the Korean sports world?

224
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,286
Although Youngjin,
a handball team in the women's league,

225
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,081
won the national championship
for the first time,

226
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,666
it announced its disbandment.

227
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,212
You didn't tell me again
that your team is getting disbanded.

228
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,507
It claims that
the disbandment was unavoidable…

229
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,926
Nothing would've changed
even if I told you.

230
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,013
Did you get a new job?
Any offers from other handball teams?

231
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,060
I'm sure there will be a team
that'd need me.

232
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,312
Now, on to the professional
baseball league.

233
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,731
The last game of the league
was held today.

234
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,692

235
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,151
an unprecedented incident occurred.

236
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,069
Guys!

237
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,239
You all worked hard this season.
Let's go for it!

238
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,865
Dreams!

239
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,785
-Good job.
-Thank you.

240
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,121
Good job.

241
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,834
Thank you for working hard this year.

242
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,628
Next year, let's take the ninth place.

243
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,713
Ninth.

244
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,883
Right. We did our best.

245
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,304
It's the players who play baseball,
not us.

246
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,099
There's really nothing to promote about.

247
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,143
How can the team become strong
without money?

248
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,103
You all did well this year.

249
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,396
Let's fill our glasses.

250
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,400
Everyone, from now on--

251
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,985
Still,

252
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,070
they can't laugh like that
after losing a game.

253
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,906
I know the operations team
worked the hardest. Let's drink.

254
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,325
They let the opponent score more than ten.

255
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,412
How could they say goodbye
to the fans while laughing?

256
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,289
This year,

257
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,458
the Dreams won 43 games.

258
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,128
And last year, they got 46 wins.

259
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,048
It got three fewer wins this year.

260
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,841
I'd like…

261
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,386
to resign as general manager.

262
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,679
-Sorry?
-Pardon?

263
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,097
Why?

264
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,725
-I'll take the responsibility--
-Sir.

265
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,187
You don't have to take all the burden
by yourself.

266
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,189
It's not your fault.

267
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,106
Then…

268
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,650
who should we blame?

269
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,735
Well…

270
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,279
There's the manager…

271
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,407
It's the players who play baseball.

272
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,867
What have we done wrong?

273
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,952
We fed them well
and did everything for them.

274
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,622
All the other teams spend a lot of money.

275
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,541
With no money,
any team would end up in last place.

276
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,836
We all are to blame.

277
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,173
Se-young, what would you blame me for?

278
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,009
Frankly speaking,

279
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,222
I think I'm just as competent
as the marketing team head of the Sabers.

280
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,934
He's doing his job on the winning team.

281
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,395
And I'm just doing my job on this team.

282
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,900
Any team

283
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,487
can scout good players
from home and abroad with money.

284
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,072
HEAD OF THE SCOUTING TEAM, KO SE-HYUK

285
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,616
Let's not be too drastic.

286
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,578
Sir.

287
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,871
I just want to say…

288
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,875
you just need to work a bit harder.

289
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,881
I'm leaving.

290
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,091
-Sir.
-Wait, sir.

291
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,219
Sir…

292
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,471
Sir!

293
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,768
Why would he leave so bitterly?

294
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,936
Sit down.

295
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,563
Have a drink.

296
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,316
Our get-together is messed up
all the time.

297
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,777
Let me fill your glass.

298
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,790
Awesome.

299
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,880
Although your team ended the season
at the bottom,

300
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,632
you had to hit the bottle
to celebrate the end of the season.

301
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,678
Stop going on
about us being at the bottom.

302
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,266
Even the newlywed bride next door
knows that your team is the bottom.

303
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,394
Not everyone does the best at work.

304
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,646
Mother,

305
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,316
you know things don't always go
as we want.

306
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,234
No one forced you to work for the team.

307
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,528
You traveled all around the country

308
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,240
holding the scorekeeping part-time job
to join the team.

309
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,536
Should I quit?

310
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,122
It's hopeless.

311
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,125
Go ahead if you can.

312
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,490
Okay.

313
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,659
I won't quit.

314
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,873
I will not quit.

315
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,724
HOW TO PASS THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAM

316
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,055
Hello.

317
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,474
Hello.

318
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,893
-Hello.
-Hello.

319
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,061
Hello.

320
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,609
I told you to stop
watching variety shows at work.

321
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,695
I was watching because I was sleepy.
That's all.

322
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,405
Don't talk like I watch them all the time.

323
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,407
-Grab your chair.
-Okay.

324
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,660
Manager Yoon.

325
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,788
Manager Yoon.

326
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,334
What brings you here?

327
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,255
By any chance,

328
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,091
was there any news?

329
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,886
No.

330
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,431
We will give you a call.

331
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:33,894
Thanks.

332
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,604
I'll be off.

333
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,772
Thank you

334
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,316
for your hard work this year.

335
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,832
It's like having false hopes.
Why won't he give us a notice?

336
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,504
It's because we need to hire
a general manager to hire a manager.

337
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,838
That's why it's getting delayed.

338
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,174
Gosh, there are articles
talking about manager candidates

339
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,592
for our team already.

340
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,845
Whoever comes, we won't…

341
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,557
Gosh, no.

342
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,602
Let's not be pessimistic.

343
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,271
Let's not give up.

344
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,774
That voice from your heart is the answer.

345
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,361
Oh, right.
The president wanted to see you.

346
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,904
Why?

347
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,074
PRESIDENT KO KANG-SUN

348
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,039
When will our new general manager come?

349
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,916
Is it Mr. Ko Se-hyuk?

350
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,628
Ko Se-hyuk? Why him?

351
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,131
Well, he's the most experienced front.

352
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,632
All the fans know him, too.

353
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,218
"It'll be Ko Se-hyuk this time."

354
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,886
That's what everyone says.

355
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,889
I sounded him out a little,
but he said he didn't want to.

356
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,601
He likes discovering good players
in the scout team.

357
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,148
It's time for interviews now.
Prepare some questions to ask.

358
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,065
Me?

359
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,609
I thought it was decided.

360
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,028
The candidates have been narrowed down.

361
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,281
I need to hear your opinion, too.

362
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,826
You want me to interview
my future direct superior?

363
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,952
Hey,

364
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:18,498
you guys always say what you want
at gatherings as if you're drunk,

365
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,418
but neither you nor I can remember.

366
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,921
I got sick of it
that I recorded our conversation one day.

367
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,799
Goodness, without our consent?

368
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,134
Guess what you said.

369
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,888
-Did we swear?
-You said you hate nonprofessionals.

370
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,473
You are not a nonprofessional.

371
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,727
You even know what it means
to hit for the cycle now.

372
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,811
Forget it.

373
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,521
This year is my last term.

374
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,150
I'm sure you'll work
at least a year longer than I do.

375
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,944
Right.

376
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,656
Then I'll be strict with the interviews.

377
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,035
Starting today,
let's meet them one by one.

378
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,081
No, starting now.

379
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,752
Having general managers
who used to be players

380
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,129
is outdated in the major league.

381
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:10,300
A lot of their duty
has nothing to do with baseball.

382
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,093
The Dreams

383
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,388
actually has a lot of potential.

384
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,099
A lot of it.

385
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,935
It has many promising players, too.

386
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,271
Only if you support
what they need properly

387
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,565
will they have a chance at the postseason.

388
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,069
You think so?
Our team has some strength, right?

389
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,155
There's something that hits me
whenever I see your team.

390
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,950
They just need to break the egg just once.

391
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,786
Then they will be different.

392
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:43,416
There's a term called front-baseball.
You need to watch out for it.

393
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,709
But that doesn't mean

394
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,921
you can leave everything
up to the people in the field.

395
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,424
I'm not saying this
because I'm a former manager.

396
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,592
On the field,

397
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,427
everyone says…

398
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,222
How about your communication skills
in the field?

399
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,392
That's just one of my basic skills.

400
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,977
For smooth communication,

401
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,729
each person has to do their duty well.

402
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,022
But as for the Dreams,

403
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,066
such division of labor

404
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,403
has not been established yet.

405
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,532
Both of them have their strengths.

406
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,826
I'm so torn. And excited.

407
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,789
It hasn't been a while since Mr. Kim left.

408
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,624
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

409
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,044
Don't overreact.
The interviews haven't ended yet.

410
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,505
Come in.

411
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,467
Welcome.

412
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,637
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

413
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,898
You used to be the general manager
for a handball team.

414
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,109
Do you like baseball, too?

415
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,654
Yes, I know about the rules.

416
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,364
Only the rules?

417
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,374
Have you watched the games of the Dreams?

418
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:07,917
Yes.

419
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,713
There were quite a lot
of their video clips online.

420
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,176
Those videos were edited
with bad intentions.

421
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,471
Last year's games were edited
as if they were this year's.

422
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,015
The nice plays aren't included at all.

423
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,268
And people will keep posting
those kinds of videos.

424
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,396
What do you mean?

425
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,774
The Dreams might place last
for more than ten years

426
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,609
even with new teams in the league.

427
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,444
Oh, my goodness.

428
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,654
What an outspoken remark.

429
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,740
Why do you think so?

430
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,909
What does the company think?

431
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,703
Why do you think I think so?

432
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,747
Look.

433
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,626
We are the ones who are interviewing you.

434
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,046
There's more than just one reason.

435
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,762
How about you tell us just a few of them?

436
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,057
The power struggle among the coaches.

437
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,851
They can't be settled with talks.

438
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,022
And the powerless manager
ignored by both factions.

439
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,318
We, the Dreams,

440
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,363
choose Yoon Jung-seok
of Jindeok High School.

441
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,447
Congratulations.

442
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,909
Yoon Jung-seok is the pitcher
of Jindeok High School,

443
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,869
chosen first.

444
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,704
Your image as the last-place team

445
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,623
makes players ashamed of being a member.

446
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,792
I regret becoming a baseball player.

447
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,793
Cheer up.

448
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,924
What is this?

449
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,635
The poor facilities
demotivate your players.

450
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,556
You've done a lot of research.

451
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,645
And you want to work
with an awful team like us?

452
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,481
I knew you'd feel offended,

453
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,193
but I thought it'd be way better

454
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,614
than being seen as someone
who doesn't know what the problem is.

455
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,700
Of course.

456
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,953
I guess I was wrong.

457
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,083
Thank you for joining this long interview.

458
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,710
Well,

459
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,296
we need some time to think.

460
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,886
This is never because we're offended.

461
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,770
I understand.

462
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,079
Goodness, that was a waste of time.

463
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,500
Gosh.

464
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,503
What's with that man?

465
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,439
JANG JIN-WOO

466
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,693
JOY

467
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,778
ACHIEVEMENT

468
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,073
That psycho is unbelievable.

469
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,158
What does he know about baseball?

470
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,244
How annoying. How irritating.

471
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,768
Sir?

472
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,524
Are there any positive attributes

473
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,151
to our company?

474
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,196
I guess there are always bigger problems.

475
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,407
What would they be?

476
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,538
Do you hope for the Dreams
to get stronger?

477
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,998
Of course.

478
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,708
Would everyone want the same?

479
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,085
What do you mean?

480
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,798
That's all I'm saying.

481
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:43,234
Why are you constantly talking about
that weird man and criticizing him?

482
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,320
He's just really weird.

483
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,781
He was a former general manager
for a handball team.

484
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,033
What about its scores?

485
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,578
He has scored wins,
but it's different from handball.

486
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,999
-Se-young.
-Yes?

487
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,085
Even if you fail again,
I hope you do so in a new way.

488
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,046
Not in the same old way.

489
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,509
Let's not be persuaded by this.

490
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,973
Why are you butting in
when you already quit?

491
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,143
I have no authority anyway.

492
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:22,815
Yes.

493
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,819
All right. I'll go there now.

494
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,698
-You have to go, right?
-Yes.

495
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,534
They already picked the general manager.

496
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,120
I haven't heard who.
I was only told to come and find out.

497
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,289
That's great news.

498
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,083
To me,

499
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,710
you were the best general manager.

500
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,671
Thanks.

501
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,257
Keep up the good work.

502
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,805
You might be unfamiliar
with this new face.

503
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,308
But those who do well do well at baseball.

504
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,726
That's what people say.

505
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,020
I think that goes
for the general manager as well.

506
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,273
Those who do well
do well as general manager.

507
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:08,152
He might not be as well-versed as us
regarding baseball,

508
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,906
but he has won at other sports.

509
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,491
What?

510
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,247
What?

511
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,587
Funny friends.

512
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,506
What is she saying?

513
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,425
Move back.

514
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,262
This is Baek Seung-soo,
the new general manager.

515
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:47,150
This is Lee Se-young,
the operations manager.

516
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,235
-You know her.
-Yes.

517
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,528
She might look this way,

518
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,363
but she's the first
female operations manager

519
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,656
in professional baseball.

520
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,324
I'm sure you didn't know that.

521
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,701
How young.

522
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,912
I'm Han Jae-hee of the operations team.

523
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,205
Nice to meet you.

524
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,082
Let's see. Where was I?

525
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,168
That he's young.

526
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,088
Mr. Baek is young,
and he's called Winning…

527
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,715
Killer?

528
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,051
I'm Winning Hitman.

529
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,638
He says he's Winning Hitman.

530
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,308
He's saying that he's here to win.

531
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,934
Am I right?

532
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,519
Yes, something like that.

533
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,563
-Say a remark.
-Yes.

534
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,151
I got a handball, Korean wrestling,
and ice hockey team to win.

535
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,570
I'm not entirely well-versed in baseball,

536
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,781
but I'll continue to learn.

537
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,159
I'm going to have a look around today,

538
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,578
and we'll have a meeting
starting tomorrow.

539
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,747
I'm aware that
there's a lot of work to be done.

540
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,503
Applause.

541
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,303
Sir!

542
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,513
What?

543
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,098
Why did you…

544
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,808
I wanted to consider your opinion.

545
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,644
But my superior recommended him.

546
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,604
Your superior?

547
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,522
Yes.

548
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,609
Have you been well?

549
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,862
Yes. What about you, director?

550
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,030
I've been busy.

551
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,575
I knew that
the baseball team does well on its own,

552
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,202
so I guess I've been a bit neglectful.

553
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,121
It was the director's decision.

554
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,873
He said that there wasn't another person
with that many wins.

555
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,042
It's truly a golden career.

556
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,044
Yes…

557
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,963
I understand.

558
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,841
I thought that he was a true talent
that our team needed.

559
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,635
-Yes.
-Just accept it.

560
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,389
Come in.

561
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,478
General Manager,
it's our first time meeting.

562
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,647
My name is Kwon Kyung-min.

563
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,110
This is the director and…

564
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,195
-The cousin of the owner of the team.
-Yes.

565
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,031
He's also the cousin.

566
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,869
Don't get mistaken.

567
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,622
I'm not trying to stay here
solely because of my familial ties.

568
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,003
People think weirdly of someone so young
being on such a high horse.

569
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,089
So, if I say that,
everyone understands clearly.

570
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,217
Do you understand?

571
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,055
I'm just someone who values efficiency.

572
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,184
Forget that I'm the owner's cousin.

573
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,852
Just think of me

574
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,271
as the owner.

575
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,150
My name is Baek Seung-soo,
and I'm the general manager.

576
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,917
There's nothing to change
with the facility.

577
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,880
The previous general manager did all of it
despite the economic hardships.

578
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,802
Because of the lack of funds,

579
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,720
he had…

580
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,681
the repairs done himself.

581
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,267
He must be a great person.

582
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,895
I'm going to go eat.

583
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,335
OX BONE SOUP

584
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,382
How long has it been
since your handball team won?

585
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,217
We won this year.

586
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,136
You must know a lot regarding handball.

587
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,723
I know a lot about
Korean wrestling and ice hockey, too.

588
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:52,311
What made you move over
from Korean wrestling to ice hockey?

589
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,772
It got disbanded.

590
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,820
The ice hockey team as well?

591
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,905
But didn't you win?

592
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,409
That's right.
It was disbanded after the win.

593
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,536
I see.

594
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,955
There's no chance of that
happening with baseball, right?

595
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,583
You don't starve
even though you get last place.

596
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,798
We don't work while believing
that it's okay to get last place.

597
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,591
Okay.

598
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,013
Then is your goal
winning this time as well?

599
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,265
It can't be, can it?

600
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,666
The president asked us to prepare
a list of the players to be removed.

601
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,168
It's quite sad, but oh well.

602
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,921
This is the thing
I hate doing the most during the year.

603
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,256
But we have no choice.

604
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,175
I'm preparing the list.

605
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,803
What should we do about Jang Jin-woo?

606
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,681
We can't consider him a star player.

607
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,892
Two wins
and an earned run average of 6.78.

608
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,978
Whether you like him or not,
he's our franchise player.

609
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,897
He's the longest-serving player
in our team.

610
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,648
He's not a franchise player.

611
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,567
He was pretty good at one point,

612
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,821
but the reason why we didn't win
was because he slipped at the end.

613
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,032
Let's give it some more thought.

614
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:33,621
There are many fans
who are hoping for his comeback.

615
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,206
Just look around.

616
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,793
There are so many college players
who've thrown at a speed of 145km/h.

617
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,631
Is it hard for us
to name Jang Jin-woo as a coach?

618
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,554
I guess so.

619
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,641
He has to have a good record
for the players to follow him.

620
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,561
Who would follow a pitching coach
who played worse off

621
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,147
considering the society
in which we live in today?

622
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,977
How much more
do you want to earn to do this?

623
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,895
I need to practice hard

624
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,355
and make you…

625
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,276
the winning pitcher.

626
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,530
Is that why you get struck out
whenever I'm on the mount?

627
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,867
Strangely,

628
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,452
when I see you there…

629
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,538
my arms feel loose.

630
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,374
Take good care of your arms.
Where does it hurt the most?

631
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,625
Here, my elbow.

632
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,627
This side here?

633
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,921
This will soothe your pain, you punk.

634
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,214
How does it feel?

635
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,215
It hurts.

636
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,925
Goodness.

637
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,344
-That really hurt.
-Oh, gosh.

638
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,267
Hey.

639
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,269
I wish…

640
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,980
we retire together later.

641
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:27,026
What are you saying all of a sudden?
You should retire a lot later than I do.

642
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,071
-You punk.
-It hurts.

643
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,035
Ms. Lee.

644
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,829
What brings you here?

645
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,332
You shouldn't have pressed that button.

646
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,626
You're drinking something worth two cents.

647
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:47,046
I ran over here to treat you
to something worth four cents.

648
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,340
You earn a lot of money.

649
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,134
You should buy me something
worth four dollars over there.

650
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,596
Is our new general manager

651
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,431
here now?

652
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,058
I don't know.

653
00:41:59,141 --> 00:41:59,975
Well…

654
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,437
Are we going with the same manager?

655
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,523
We don't know about that either.

656
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,360
Who will know about it
if the operations manager doesn't?

657
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,529
I've been part of this team for 11 years.

658
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,448
I can ask you that much.

659
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,033
I'm Lim Dong-gyu.

660
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,244
But I really don't know.

661
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,955
Even if I do,
that's not something you should know.

662
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,083
Just like how we don't tell you
to train more

663
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,418
because you're going through a slump.

664
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,128
Well, that's because

665
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,924
I'm the best player in this team
even if I'm in my slump.

666
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,510
Sure.

667
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,222
Enjoy your drink. Good day.

668
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:39,974
Bye.

669
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,478
He's so spiteful.

670
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,150
-Goodness.
-Be careful.

671
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,860
-I'm sorry.
-Me too.

672
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,696
Here.

673
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,906
Well, I have mine here.

674
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,824
Exactly.

675
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,617
Goodness.

676
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,912
What brings you here, by the way?

677
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,418
When will the list of the dropout players
be announced?

678
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:12,047
I'm not sure. It's still under discussion.

679
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,883
Is my name there?

680
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,386
I cannot tell you.

681
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,346
By any chance,

682
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,392
will it be impossible for me
to be trained as a coach?

683
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,187
We have to talk with
the new general manager about it.

684
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,939
Things will be more certain then.

685
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:31,859
I understand.

686
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,776
Okay.

687
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:36,989
But…

688
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:37,906
Yes?

689
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,288
I started my training earlier
to work harder this time.

690
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,541
You can do it.

691
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,293
I can do it.

692
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,638
Come in.

693
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,018
Hello.

694
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,896
You're working hard.

695
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:10,856
I need to make…

696
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,401
better results next year.

697
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,111
I hope you do.

698
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,529
How may I help you?

699
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,658
You might have a lot of questions
about our team.

700
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,620
The list of dropout players isn't out yet.

701
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:30,167
I thought I should brief you
about the players.

702
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,170
Is that so?

703
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,256
Have a seat then.

704
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,220
Since it's about dropouts,

705
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,722
I don't have to mention the key players.

706
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,768
How is Jang Jin-woo?

707
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,853
Jin-woo?

708
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,523
He works really hard.

709
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,026
He works harder than anyone else.

710
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,654
He works hard.

711
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,448
But he won't be any better.

712
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,620
He can't throw as fast
and allows more home runs than before.

713
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,372
But still,

714
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,542
he keeps the other pitchers disciplined.

715
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:17,506
Do you mean the type of senior
who passes down bad traditions?

716
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,424
No.

717
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,301
Not exactly.

718
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,265
Well, how should I explain?

719
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,935
It's true the other guys feel
a little uncomfortable around him.

720
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:34,440
Among newbie members,
Min-jun's throw is getting faster.

721
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,442
He has a nice posture
and a good mentality.

722
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,570
In the long term,
these kinds of guys make good results.

723
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,739
He can manage crises
without causing any injuries.

724
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,451
Keep players like Lee Ju-ho
among mid-term players.

725
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,745
He isn't a good hitter,
but he has swift legs.

726
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,542
-Good work.
-Good work.

727
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,544
-Let's drink.
-Give that to me.

728
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,426
Does he know about baseball?

729
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,970
It seems
he had nothing to do with baseball.

730
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,014
He will figure it out himself.

731
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,641
We're the ones who play baseball anyway.

732
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,644
So, is he coming?

733
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,563
He said he'll give a call when he arrives.

734
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,274
He is coming?

735
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:20,486
Chul-min and his guys
are holding a welcome party for him, too.

736
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,779
This punk knows who's got the real power.

737
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,573
It'll be good for us if he behaves.

738
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,491
Hey.

739
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,951
-Why do you think he's coming?
-Why?

740
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:32,664
-The future manager is here, so he better.
-Hey, it's gross.

741
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,752
Whoever becomes manager…

742
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,878
PITCHING COACH CHOI YONG-GU

743
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,463
…we need to do a good job now.

744
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,466
We've been at the bottom for too long.

745
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,509
Let's drink.

746
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,177
-Dreams!
-Dreams!

747
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:48,805
Oh, it's bitter.

748
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,518
I heard Coach Choi and his guys
are throwing a welcome party

749
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,894
for the new general manager, too.

750
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,563
But he said he'd come here.

751
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,066
I guess he can make sensible judgments.

752
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,068
Too bad for Coach Choi.

753
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,737
He might wait
for the general manager there.

754
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,656
Should we call them over?

755
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,074
Since the general manager is here,

756
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,660
they should eat some roe rice
or something down the table.

757
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,831
Stop talking about the losers.

758
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,085
Let's be dignified
and talk about our season next year.

759
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,378
Yes, Manager Lee.

760
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,630
Pour me a drink, Manager Lee.

761
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,216
Manager Lee.

762
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,470
Don't count your chickens first,
you punks.

763
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,224
Goodness.

764
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,934
Welcome.

765
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,978
Hello.

766
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,854
-Have a seat.
-It's nice to see you.

767
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,147
-Please sit down.
-Okay.

768
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,195
-Let me.
-Sure.

769
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,698
It's nice to see you.

770
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,618
Is this Manager Lee's bandwagon?

771
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:58,000
What do you mean "bandwagon"?
There's nothing like that.

772
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,753
Be friendly with each other.

773
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,463
I would've done this just once

774
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,757
if you had invited me over
when you were all together.

775
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,511
At the same time on the same day,
two coaches invited me separately.

776
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,804
That's called factions.

777
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:13,890
We didn't know
that those guys invited you, too.

778
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,853
Those guys?

779
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,235
I'm also going to meet with them.

780
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:29,364
I've come here first
because you're the bench coach.

781
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,826
What will you say to them?

782
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,537
I haven't said anything here yet.

783
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,709
But you're already worried about
what I'll say to them?

784
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,217
You're here.

785
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,054
Well,

786
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,347
should I sit here?

787
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,848
-Yes, please.
-Come this way.

788
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,977
It's nice to see you.

789
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,690
Let me pour you a drink.

790
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,530
You're very late.

791
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,699
Yes, I needed to stop by somewhere.

792
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,701
To see the bench coach?

793
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,037
Yes.

794
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,831
You must be busy jumping back and forth
between the two sides

795
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,124
as soon as you got appointed.

796
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,002
The two sides?
I thought you were the same team.

797
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:28,757
Aren't you busy
studying baseball and learning work

798
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,217
these days?

799
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,553
You're the former general manager
of the winning handball team.

800
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,349
It's not important
that you don't know much about baseball.

801
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,143
We watch handball games
during the Olympics.

802
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,061
Sometimes.

803
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,776
I guess you know very well about baseball.

804
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,737
What book do you recommend?

805
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,267
How dare you.

806
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,741
What's he doing?

807
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,956
Let me explain about the decisions
that were made yesterday.

808
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,001
Some of them
earned the president's consent

809
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,794
while others didn't.

810
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,881
Although I have no intention
to change my mind,

811
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,342
feel free to tell us
if you have a different view

812
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,762
so that I can understand
how you think about the matter.

813
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,640
I'll start.

814
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,478
First, the manager will remain.

815
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,232
We'll have a three-year contract,

816
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,235
and the president approved it already.

817
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,616
Gosh.

818
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,495
Who made the decision?

819
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,246
I did.

820
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,956
I do like the manager, too.

821
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,709
But what about the fans' demand?

822
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:31,713
The fans won't take any responsibility
while I do by having my career at stake.

823
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,675
It must be eight, eight, nine, two, nine,

824
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,386
ten…

825
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,763
It's right, isn't it?

826
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,099
It's not

827
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,769
an account number.

828
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,731
You were in the eighth, eighth, ninth,
second, and ninth.

829
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,109
And after the expansion,
you were the bottom for four years.

830
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,278
And all of you here wrote
this history yourselves.

831
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:59,449
You coaches are like public officers
in this field.

832
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,538
Did you say he'll remain?

833
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,581
A contract for three years
instead of one year?

834
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,209
Right. None of the managers
signed a one-year contract.

835
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,503
It should be at least 3 years
to give him full support.

836
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,754
Wait.

837
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,631
So the president approved of this?

838
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,469
Did you really watch
the games of our team?

839
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,305
If you let the manager
fully display his ability,

840
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,391
it'll be much better
than scouting a new manager.

841
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,894
And I'm sure
our club can't afford a new manager.

842
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,896
Or we can promote someone…

843
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,357
Who between the bench coach
and the pitching coach?

844
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,733
Anyone.

845
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,820
You want a manager
that only half of the players support?

846
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,283
Second.

847
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,077
I heard that
there are factions in coach staff.

848
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,291
We won't remove any side from the team.
We go together.

849
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,882
Go ahead and fight against each other.

850
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,802
How could I stop
the fight of the grownups?

851
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,220
You even use violence.

852
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,056
But compete with each other
through your performance.

853
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,397
What's most embarrassing
is to be a good fighter in a losing team.

854
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,359
I heard you were pretty good
when you were players.

855
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,407
What's that look on your faces?

856
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,951
That's how you've been doing up to now.

857
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,872
I'm just telling you
to do as you've always done.

858
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,172
I'll move on. Third.

859
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:41,676
I haven't obtained the approval
of the president yet regarding this.

860
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,597
I need your help. It seems quite tough.

861
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,394
I want to trade Player Lim Dong-gyu.

862
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,980
TRADE: AN EXCHANGE OF PLAYERS
BETWEEN FRANCHISES

863
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,899
Did he just say Lim Dong-gyu?

864
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,193
-That's ridiculous.
-What?

865
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,445
-Lim Dong-gyu?
-Yes.

866
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:05,700
But Lee Dong-gu retired two years ago.

867
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,869
You should've checked…

868
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,579
He said Lim Dong-gyu.

869
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,289
-What about him?
-It's Lim Dong-gyu.

870
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,207
Lim Dong-gyu?

871
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,669
Do you mean Lim Dong-gyu?

872
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,213
The clean-up man of the Dreams?

873
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,422
Isn't it Lee Dong-gu?

874
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,175
I plan to trade Lim Dong-gyu.

875
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,972
Don't you know what Lim Dong-gyu
means to the team? No way!

876
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,683
-Nonsense.
-How ridiculous.

877
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,105
Is he a psycho?

878
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,866
Dong-gyu, the general manager…

879
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:07,721
The most competitive part
of the Golden Glove was the outfield.

880
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,431
Although it's awarded to three players,

881
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:12,267
great players
with hitting and defending skills

882
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,019
competed fiercely.

883
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,730
I'll announce the first winner.

884
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,441
Dong-gyu, the general manager says
he chose you as a trading card.

885
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,192
The award goes to…

886
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,029
-That jerk…
-Lim Dong-gyu!

887
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:24,946
Congratulations!

888
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,912
Despite the low standing of the team,
he showed a great performance

889
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,958
with an average of 0.337, 40 home runs,
and 114 RBI.

890
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,919
He even showed off
his powerful and sharp throw.

891
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,631
He's been the only joy
for many fans of the Dreams.

892
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,843
It's his sixth Golden Glove.

893
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,642
LIM DONG-GYU

894
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,729
Please give us remarks briefly.

895
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,571
OUTFIELDER CATEGORY, LIM DONG-GYU

896
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,741
LIM DONG-GYU

897
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,409
Actually…

898
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,747
I kind of expected this.

899
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,709
So I brought the list of people
that I'm grateful to.

900
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,463
Many were disappointed about
having been missed out last year.

901
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,092
But…

902
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,762
I…

903
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,933
no longer need this.

904
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,024
There's something I must say here
no matter what.

905
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,859
So I'll just say that.

906
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:52,117
I can play baseball
because the fans of the Dreams are there.

907
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,827
I can't even imagine myself

908
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,246
playing in other teams.

909
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,206
Mr. Baek, hold on.

910
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,499
Sure.

911
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,583
Lim Dong-gyu is…

912
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,421
I don't see
why I have to explain this to you.

913
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,217
He runs for the national team
as the fifth batter.

914
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,386
It's not Lee Dong-gu.

915
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,930
I know.

916
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,433
I'd like to promise one thing here.

917
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,687
The only goal of my life

918
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,065
is to have my back number
retired by the Dreams.

919
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,652
I want to play for the Dreams
until I retire.

920
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,071
And…

921
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,323
you plan to export him?

922
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,076
Yes, I do.

923
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,870
No matter what.

924
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,498
No matter what.

925
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,850
OUTFIELDER CATEGORY, LIM DONG-GYU

PRESIDENT SHIM DONG-YUN

927
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,288
OUTFIELDER CATEGORY, LIM DONG-GYU

928
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,132
Special thanks to the sports announcer
and the commentator

929
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,862
Hey. Do you leave your home
when your housekeeper tells you to?

930
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,865
It would sound more realistic
if he traded the general manager.

931
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:01,908
It won't be easy.

932
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,868
Will you be against it?

933
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,495
I'll tell the president to approve it.

934
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,705
I'll probably keep being on your side.

935
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:11,042
He's doing this to trade me
with a guy like Kim Kwan-sik?

936
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,003
What's with Kim Kwan-sik?
We can't trade Lim Dong-gyu with…

937
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,130
Why do we have to clean up his mess?

938
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,507
I'll go to the general manager.

939
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,550
Does Lim Dong-gyu even tell you
to do this?

940
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:20,468
Mr. Baek.

941
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,887
It's not hard
to kick out someone like you!

942
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:23,971
Hey, Lim Dong-gyu.
