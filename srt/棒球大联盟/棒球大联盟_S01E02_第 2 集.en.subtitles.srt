00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,761
OUTFIELDER CATEGORY, LIM DONG-GYU

2
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,701
-We've been doing this every year!
-That's what we're supposed to do!

3
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,286
I see.

4
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,788
We'll contact Lim Dong-gyu.

5
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,084
I'll buy drinks, so stop worrying.
All right?

6
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,754
All right. General manager?

7
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,715
General manager!

8
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,217
General manager!

9
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,430
Did you see the Golden Glove Awards
last night?

10
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,142
Our very own Lim Dong-gyu
received two awards.

11
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,563
-Yes.
-That's why there is so much buzz.

12
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,025
He donated the prize, worth 3 million won,
to his colleagues

13
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,693
and Dreams Baseball Club.

14
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:18,531
He even donated his Fair Play Prize,
worth 4 million won, to homeless shelters.

15
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,075
He even received the Fair Play Prize?

16
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,829
That's the kind of player Lim Dong-gyu is.

17
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,665
About the trade negotiations…

18
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,085
The prize winner, Lim Dong-gyu, is here.

19
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,962
Hey!

20
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,714
Lim Dong-gyu!

21
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,676
Are preparations for the interview
going well?

22
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,555
Why do you keep making me
do all this work?

23
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,432
It's not like you have
anything else to do.

24
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,269
I get my pay even if I don't work.

25
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,064
All right, everyone.

26
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,734
For tonight's dinner,
we're all going to eat out

27
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,653
thanks to Lim Dong-gyu, who is paying!

28
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,576
General manager.

29
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,371
Do you like lamb?

30
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,002
I do not.

31
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,812
Come in.

32
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,028
I have a question.

33
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,826
-Is it regarding Lim Dong-gyu?
-Do you know him well?

34
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,203
I don't know him personally.

35
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,456
I don't know him personally either.

36
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,295
Do you know what WAR is?

37
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,422
Doesn't it stand for wins
above replacement?

38
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,548
Yes.

39
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:05,054
Lim Dong-gyu's WAR
is top five in the entire league,

40
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,223
even when you include the pitchers.

41
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,476
You're right. He must be a great athlete.

42
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:16,107
I'm talking about Lim Dong-gyu,
the Dreams' franchise star

43
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,067
to the Dreams' new general manager.

44
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,946
Did you hear the speech Lee Dong-gyu
gave while accepting his prize?

45
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,867
He said he wanted to retire
while still a member of the Dreams.

46
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,911
I heard him speak of him wanting
to have his number retired.

47
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,124
If he plays for a few more years,

48
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,626
he will be qualified
to have his number retired.

49
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,840
His uniform sales alone make up
70 percent of sales.

50
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,634
Out of all the fans who come
to see the games,

51
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,762
70 percent have his name
on the back of their shirts.

52
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,057
Are you aware of the weight
he carries while you carry this out?

53
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,354
I'm very curious to know
how much you actually know

54
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,731
about the Dreams.

55
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,866
I'm trying to know more,

56
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,786
and I'm sure that I know more
than you're worried about.

57
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,042
-But Ms. Lee?
-Yes.

58
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:21,589
Did the previous general manager have
to get your approval as he did his job?

59
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:23,925
No.

60
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,178
Then, do I have to persuade you
as I do my job?

61
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,475
It's just because
it's an important matter.

62
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,310
If it is such an important matter,

63
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:40,233
why do I have to get your approval
as I do my job?

64
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,657
Are you demanding of me something
you didn't of the previous general manager

65
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,661
because you think I don't know baseball?

66
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,385
Are you going to stay here?

67
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,139
I'll get going.

68
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,545
Mr. Lim Dong-gyu.

69
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,841
-What?
-What?

70
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,676
You can talk casually to me as well.

71
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,185
This is my home.

72
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,437
The Dreams is my home.

73
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,150
There is just so much that I've done here
for the past 11 years.

74
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,529
But one day, a crazy fool
who knows nothing about baseball

75
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,531
decides to come and take away my home.

76
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,078
I guess you don't know your real place
because everyone's sucking up to you

77
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,413
and calling you general manager.

78
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,374
Hey.

79
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,793
Do you leave your home
when your housekeeper tells you to?

80
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,047
I don't have a housekeeper.

81
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,761
I've hit 270 home runs on this team
during the last 11 years.

82
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,973
How many hits do you think
I have under my belt?

83
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,104
Do you know how many wins
we achieved thanks to me?

84
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,564
Do you know how messed up…

85
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,445
your plan and what you're saying are?

86
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,781
Mr. Lim Dong-gyu.

87
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:58,120
Your job is hitting home runs
and running around.

88
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,834
My job is to reorganize the team
and negotiate trades.

89
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,088
Is it just our places that are different?

90
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,091
No, our positions
are completely different.

91
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,931
Enough. I'll show you.

92
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,476
I'll show you just what kind of strength

93
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,895
someone who's played baseball well
for 11 years has.

94
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,023
Just watch and see.

95
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,820
Are you training at this late hour?

96
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,497
You must be tired with all the work.

97
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,302
I've made the decision on my own
without discussing it.

98
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,469
DREAMS MANAGER YOON SUNG-BOK

99
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,929
Are you going to carry this out?

100
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,223
Are you going to be against it?

101
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,392
It won't be easy.

102
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,728
But you know that it must be done.

103
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,149
I'll get going.

104
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,630
What is this?

105
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,673
Sorry.

106
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,675
I don't know how important you are,

107
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,720
but don't you think you should walk
with more care?

108
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,181
-Answer me!
-What are you doing?

109
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,072
-What would you like to have?
-Ma'am, two servings of Korean beef

110
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,949
Just give us two servings of pork neck
and a bottle of soju.

111
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,369
-And a beer each, please.
-Okay.

112
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,580
Come on. Let's eat beef today. It's on me.

113
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,332
Not yet.

114
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,000
What do you mean?

115
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,711
I'm not that pathetic
to fawn over a young boy

116
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,422
who joined the company by nepotism
just to eat beef.

117
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,675
But I want to eat beef.

118
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,219
I'll practice noblesse oblige.

119
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:22,098
If you wanted to eat beef,
you should've gone home, you bourgeois.

120
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,725
Don't try to stimulate the appetite
of the humble class.

121
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,852
I'll live without remembering
what beef tastes like.

122
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,647
Humble people also should enjoy
some luxury from time to time…

123
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,606
Wait.

124
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,568
Isn't he Lim Dong-gyu?

125
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,697
He is. Just pretend we didn't see him.

126
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,282
Why do we have to do that?
It's not us who decided on the trade.

127
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,576
-He's coming this way.
-Don't look at him.

128
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,996
-Hello.
-Hi.

129
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,915
You're here.

130
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,628
They're my friends.

131
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,088
It's good to see you.

132
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,715
I see. Nice to meet you.

133
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,218
I should treat you to some meat.

134
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,262
It's all right.

135
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,140
Meat tastes better when I pay for it.

136
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,934
Have a good time.

137
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,771
I can see you don't really want
to talk to me.

138
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,817
-Then, have a good time.
-Thank you.

139
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,455
Hello?

140
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,834
Who?

141
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,794
EMERGENCY ROOM

142
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,883
Hello.

143
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,386
I'm here to see a patient
named Baek Seung-soo.

144
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,472
The one who was assaulted?

145
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,099
Yes. How is he?

146
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,268
He's getting some rest right now.

147
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,604
May I ask what your relationship
with him is?

148
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,981
We work at the same company.

149
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,819
-Why did you call me, by the way?
-His phone had no saved numbers.

150
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,447
-And you were in the recent call history.
-Sorry?

151
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,326
-Why?
-We don't know that either.

152
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,830
What? Why didn't he save any numbers?

153
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,559
Yes. I think he got into a fight
and got beaten.

154
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,729
Does he think he's still a kid?

155
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,066
You should be a decent old man
as you grow older.

156
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,653
Can you stop backbiting me?

157
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,450
I should go. Bye.

158
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,039
And am I an old man?

159
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,334
You can go home.

160
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,044
Stop. Don't move yet.

161
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,463
I'm fine alone. Move.

162
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,049
We got a report call.

163
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,759
You got suddenly assaulted?

164
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,888
Please tell us about his appearance.

165
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:14,436
He had a big body
and was wearing loose pants

166
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,772
and a flowery shirt.

167
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,442
I think you can check the security camera
in the alley.

168
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,003
It's Lim Dong-gyu, right?

169
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,006
What do you mean?

170
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,342
I ran into him at a restaurant
before I came here.

171
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,053
And he came with someone

172
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,725
who looked exactly the same
as the one you described.

173
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,728
Isn't it just your assumption?

174
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,858
He's such a scary guy.

175
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,485
Is this because of the trade?

176
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,573
What he thinks regarding it
is not important.

177
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,967
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

178
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,019
As for Lim Dong-gyu…

179
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,275
I'm not telling you that you need
my permission or anything.

180
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:48,364
Do you have to trade him no matter what?
What if he attacks you again?

181
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,407
That's my job.

182
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,161
Then I'll report him instead
for hiring a man to assault you.

183
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,914
-Never do that.
-Why?

184
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:01,251
Only a silly general manager would report
the most expensive player to the police.

185
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,256
I'd rather remain silent and sell him
at a high price.

186
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,468
Gosh. Is it that important…

187
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,222
I know it's important.

188
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,598
Still…

189
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,359
Seriously.

190
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,823
Welcome back…

191
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,703
Who did that?

192
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,580
Pretend you saw nothing.
Then I'll raise your allowance.

193
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,834
Who did that to you?

194
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,424
You know I wouldn't just let him
get away with it.

195
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,175
Then?

196
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,594
Don't you remember?

197
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,930
I even held out
in the Korean wrestling team.

198
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,141
Compared to that, it's nothing.

199
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,102
-Are you really okay?
-I am.

200
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,813
It's easier to deal with this kind of guy.

201
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,606
We both are just getting used
to each other.

202
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,617
BATTING AVERAGE

203
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,828
BY LOCATION, PITCH, SITUATION

204
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,056
HELLO SPORTS

205
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,945
Heung-man, it's me.

206
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,830
Here's your coffee.

207
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,005
The life of a young general manager
is very dynamic.

208
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,257
MMA teams would fit him better.

209
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,885
I would've taken a day off if I were him.

210
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,097
Look at him.
He letting everyone know he got beat up?

211
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,600
He's from a small league, he doesn't know
the importance of maintaining authority.

212
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,728
I don't think he'd last long here, anyway.

213
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,440
The proposal to trade Lim Dong-gyu
wouldn't even get permission.

214
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,858
-That's what I think.
-Never.

215
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,528
-The coffee you make is the best.
-It's my pleasure.

216
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,910
The guy you met last night

217
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,538
seems to be fine.

218
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,456
Thanks.

219
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,208
Should I take care of him again?

220
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,670
No, you don't have to.
I know you're tired too.

221
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,423
I guess you were too tired
to give him a good blow.

222
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,511
Sir, I'll call you again
when I get it done properly.

223
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,282
Is he out of the office?

224
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,452
HELLO SPORTS

225
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,832
It's Kim Kwan-sik.

226
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,174
What are you doing here?

227
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,260
I'd like to take you home today.

228
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,471
Don't make a fuss over nothing.
It'll be awkward on the way.

229
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,075
Did you think of anything to talk about
on our way home?

230
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,912
-No.
-Then I'll go by myself.

231
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,749
-Twenty minutes is too long for me.
-But I have a lot of topics to talk about,

232
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,334
so I can just pick some from them.

233
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,881
Don't worry. It's all about our work.

234
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,014
Are you still figuring out
what topic to talk about?

235
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,515
What?

236
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:33,023
Did you decide to trade Lim Dong-gyu
because you knew what kind of guy he was?

237
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,901
No, I didn't know he was this bad.

238
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,613
I'm not trying to oppose trading him
while I'm aware of the situation.

239
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,448
But…

240
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,827
when I try to come up with a player
that can replace him,

241
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,746
I feel frustrated.

242
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,040
Yes, I'm preparing for that.

243
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,464
Can't you prepare for that
with the operations team?

244
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,549
This is also our job.

245
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,010
-Do you know whose car that is?
-Pardon?

246
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,471
It's been following us for a while.

247
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,571
HEUNG-MAN…

248
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,508
Get out.

249
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,386
-Hey.
-Get out of the car.

250
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,221
I don't feel good about this.

251
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,890
I told you to get out!

252
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,518
-Get out.
-Get out of the car!

253
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,938
112…

254
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,315
-I said get out.
-112…

255
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,649
Don't call the police.

256
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,860
-What are you doing?
-Get out.

257
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,154
Get out now!

258
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,115
Yes, Heung-man.

259
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,660
Who on earth is Heung-man?
We should be calling the police!

260
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,412
We can't call the police.

261
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,164
-Get out.
-Get out of the car.

262
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,665
-Get out, you scumbag!
-Hey!

263
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,000
Open the door!

264
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,844
That's my car.

265
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,849
No.

266
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,810
You hit my car.

267
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,491
Why did they stop?

268
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,463
Who are you?

269
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,508
I'm Cheon Heung-man,
a former Korean wrestler.

270
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,717
Who are you supposed to be?

271
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,845
I even won the championship and all.

272
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,889
Is he on our side?

273
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,891
Enough about me.

274
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,310
I have a few friends in this town.

275
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,355
So we should have a lot of mutual friends.

276
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,274
Wouldn't it be awkward
when we meet at a bar later?

277
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,111
I'll give you a chance to quietly leave.

278
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,655
You freak.

279
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,365
Come here!

280
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,120
How dare you?

281
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,001
You little jerks.

282
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,473
Why did you do it?

283
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,142
We were driving, and…

284
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,018
We often do it.

285
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,480
-It's called driving for revenge.
-Hey.

286
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,401
Just because I've been obeying the law
by being an athlete,

287
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,153
do I only look like a good citizen to you?

288
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,321
It's called retaliatory driving,
not revenge driving.

289
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,407
Yes, retaliatory driving.

290
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,993
Were you really not told
by someone to do this?

291
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,035
What?

292
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,204
No.

293
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,457
If someone did order you to do this,

294
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,960
tell the person that this will be
the last time I'm tolerating it.

295
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,463
Yes, I will.

296
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,345
You're badly injured.

297
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,223
Is this from when you were beaten
yesterday?

298
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,642
Well…

299
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,270
I'm fine now. Thank you.

300
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,608
That piece of trash.
Do you want me to talk to him?

301
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,320
But they say his uniform takes up
70 percent of the sales.

302
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,448
-Excuse me?
-What?

303
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,660
It means that
he's a very important person.

304
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,745
But thank you.

305
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,422
This is exactly why I said
I'd get home myself.

306
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,885
This is also why I was driving you home.

307
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,346
Would they have done it
on public transportation?

308
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,269
By the way, who was that?

309
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,647
When I was the general manager
of a Korean wrestling team,

310
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,606
he was the captain.

311
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,402
He found the perfect time to come in.

312
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,529
He did.

313
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,407
-I'll be coming in late tomorrow.
-Okay.

314
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,869
On what occasion?

315
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,628
How frustrating.

316
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,604
Play, play!

317
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,485
You've come so far in this cold weather.

318
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,989
-Who are you?
-Right. Hello.

319
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,157
Wait.

320
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,493
I'm the general manager of the Dreams,
Baek Seung-soo.

321
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,619
You're Kim Jong-moo,

322
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,330

323
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,873
Wait.

324
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,709
No, I'm not.

325
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,926
Yes, you're right. What do you want?

326
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,599
Are you here to observe Son Seung-Min,
the third baseman?

327
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,519
-He's a prospect we're keeping an eye on.
-Come on.

328
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,732
Is this tampering here or what?

329
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,191
It's really not.

330
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,777
I just wanted to see his face.
What's wrong with you?

331
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,862
Sure.

332
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,407
Have you heard the rumor about us?

333
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,743
What rumor?

334
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,245
You must have heard.

335
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,456
You're quick with all the news.

336
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,836
So, why are you selling him?

337
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,007
-You can't find a power hitter like him.
-I'm not. It's not that I'm selling him.

338
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,345

339
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:24,100
Seriously.
I just got out of that noisy Seoul.

340
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,977
Now you want to cause me trouble.

341
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,106
What do you say we make it
a win-win situation by negotiating?

342
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,236
That's good!

343
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,328
Is he here?

344
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,664
-He's not.
-What?

345
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,417
I don't know what his deal is,

346
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,795
but why does he want to trade
Dong-gyu all of a sudden?

347
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,005
If we take him out of the team now,
they'll freak out.

348
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,132
We have pictures of him
everywhere in our building.

349
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,678
How ridiculous would it seem
from his perspective? Seriously.

350
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,640
It would sound more realistic
if he traded the general manager.

351
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,849
I don't know anymore.

352
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,061
As I get older, words like passion
sound burdensome

353
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,604
because of people like him.

354
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,190
It's because
he was never a baseball player.

355
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,818
Would he really sell Dong-gyu?

356
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,736
He says he's going to.

357
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,572
"No matter what."

358
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,075
Didn't you hear him say that?

359
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,328
If he does,
we'll see who he trades him for.

360
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,996
It doesn't matter who he trades him for.

361
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,792
In this town, Dong-gyu
is the president of baseball.

362
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,795
But it's not like he needs
our permission to do so.

363
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,010
But as someone new in his post,

364
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,513
he's a little reckless,
wouldn't you agree?

365
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,974
He's still the general manager
even if he's new.

366
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,153
OPERATIONS MANAGER

367
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,700
Kwan-sik.

368
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:08,079
To play in a team
that desperately wants you…

369
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,122
Listen.

370
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,916
I am in ninth place for holds this season.

371
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,711
You're going to regret doing this.

372
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,505
That's my record when I haven't
played much because of my injury.

373
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,008
I'm confident I can make
at least 20 holds.

374
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,177
Yes, I know you can.

375
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,388
But rather than being traded
all of a sudden,

376
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,433
I'm saying this for your sake.

377
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,813
-Kwan-sik.
-Come on.

378
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,690
The Dreams? Are you kidding me?

379
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,493
Hey, do you think this makes sense?

380
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,370
No matter how much
I've contributed during this season,

381
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,748
they're doing this
because they're short on batters.

382
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,458
And who goes to play for the Dreams?

383
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,336
-Is that even a team?
-The Dreams are also a team.

384
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,964
I apologize.

385
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,435
Whether you pitch well here
or pitch well there,

386
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,688
people will always clap for you.

387
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,315
Yes.

388
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,653
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

389
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,157
He's the one
that was kicked out of the Dreams.

390
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,451
He wouldn't like someone
badmouthing his former team.

391
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,513
What is it?

392
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,431
Hey, are you joining our team?

393
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,145
Who said that?

394
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,147
Was it your team?

395
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,734
They're saying you and Kwan-sik
will be traded. He's all mad.

396
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,902
What?

397
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,197
What a lunatic.

398
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,368
He's causing this mess to trade me
for a guy like Kim Kwan-sik?

399
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,120
He's good too.

400
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,496
I'm hanging up.

401
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,264
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

402
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,765
It's good to see you.

403
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,062
Reporters.

404
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:43,234
I might change teams.

405
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,778
Golf teams? Did you get into a fight?

406
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,365
-Who did you fight with?
-No.

407
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,911
-Baseball teams.
-What are you talking about?

408
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,995
Stop kidding around.

409
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,540
I've dedicated myself to the Dreams,

410
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,878
but they're trading me for Kim Kwan-sik.

411
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,256
I can't even cry about it.

412
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,425
Your general manager is crazy.

413
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,136
Why would the Dreams trade
Lim Dong-gyu for anyone?

414
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,682
It's not certain yet,
so please keep it a secret.

415
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,100
Let's drink.

416
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,686
My goodness.

417
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,854
Let's drink.

418
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,362
-The drinks tasted sweet like honey today.
-I know, it was so sweet.

419
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:28,988
-All right.
-What?

420
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,782
Thank you, everyone.

421
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,367
-Don't mention it.
-No problem.

422
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,327
-Go home safely.
-Bye.

423
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:35,995
Let's go.

424
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,045
Dong-gyu. Let's go for another round.

425
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,673
I'm sorry. It's too late.

426
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,011
Please support me
so I can keep thanking you.

427
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,429
Sure thing.

428
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,640
In that sense,

429
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,268
I prepared this for you.

430
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,647
You shouldn't do this.

431
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,484
Okay, you can count on me.

432
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,735
See you around.

433
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,445
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

434
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,874
I mean, Ms. Lee was siding with him,

435
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,460
so I thought he promised
to recruit someone great

436
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,129
in exchange for Lim Dong-gyu.

437
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,589
But what is this?

438
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,969
I couldn't help but think
that Ms. Lee changed too.

439
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,180
I have to call someone.

440
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,975
She has no one to call.

441
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,399
What's with this mood?

442
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,194
Come here for a second.

443
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,613
Come here. I have something to tell you.

444
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,158
What is it?

445
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,619
Are you going into some kind
of an affectionate relationship

446
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,872
-with the general manager?
-What?

447
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,750
You know, like carefully getting
to know each other

448
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,043
as a man and a woman.

449
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,129
What was that for?

450
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,258
Right, you uncivilized people!

451
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,887
I did try to have
some friendly communication

452
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,097
with the general manager!

453
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,642
Good. There's no way
you can communicate with him.

454
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,355
-You badmouth me when I'm not around!
-Stop hitting me already.

455
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,441
He wants to trade Lim Dong-gyu
for Kim Kwan-sik.

456
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,235
-What?
-I mean…

457
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,988
It's true Kim Kwan-sik had good results
this year, but he lacks ground

458
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,491
and is a middle relief pitcher.
We need a starting pitcher.

459
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,870
Come in.

460
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:55,426
You're working on something, aren't you?
I'm interested in it very much.

461
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,845
Interested in what?

462
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,014
Lim Dong-gyu.

463
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,853
He indeed is influential here and there.

464
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,647
What do you mean?

465
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,066
Didn't you call me in
to say I can't proceed with it?

466
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,070
Mr. Baek, I hired you.

467
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,990
Don't I look like I'll support you
with a sense of responsibility?

468
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,079
Anyway, will it work?

469
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,084
Is that the look of caution
that I'm seeing?

470
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,673
I was just asking
how you'd wield your authority.

471
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,677
Okay. I'll try to wield my authority well.

472
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,762
I think I did a great job hiring you.

473
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:44,100
I mean, what kind of lunatic
would think of trading Lim Dong-gyu

474
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,852
with someone else in the Dreams?

475
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,689
I'll tell the president to approve it
no matter what.

476
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,816
I'll probably keep...

477
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,986
being on your side.

478
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,575
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

479
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,202
What's that with Kim Kwan-sik?

480
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,622
It's pending.

481
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,795
I'll ask if any other teams
want to trade a player for him.

482
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,963
We can't trade him for…

483
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,883
Who told you that?

484
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,634
That's not important right now.

485
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:22,054
-Everyone knows about it.
-You don't even know where it started.

486
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,973
Must I resolve that misunderstanding?

487
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,185
It's because I didn't hear anything
from you.

488
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:31,731
-Because nothing has been decided.
-You can't even share what's pending?

489
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,024
Can't you trust me?

490
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,525
You don't work with trust.

491
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,361
I'm just saying
we should do our jobs properly.

492
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,500
THE DREAMS'…

493
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,629
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK'S OPINION…

494
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,926
SEND

495
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,803
THE ARTICLE HAS BEEN SENT

496
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,097
IS THE TOP STAR OF THE DREAMS
CHANGING TEAMS?

497
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,724
THE FACE OF THE DREAMS
SAID TO BE MOVING.

498
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,976
GEN MANAGER'S OPINION
WAS GREATLY REFLECTED ON THE ISSUE.

499
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,229
-Is he out of his mind?
-Who else could be their star

500
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,356
-other than Lim Dong-gyu?
-Why can't that new manager

501
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,691
-do a better job?
-He's so frustrating I may have cancer.

502
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,693
BAEK SEUNG-SOO, DREAMS
BAEK SEUNG-SOO, NEPOTISM

503
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,113
SEARCH KEYWORD LIST OF THE DREAMS

504
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,574
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK, OUT!

505
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,660
FIRE THE GENERAL MANAGER.

506
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,496
That's not true. We aren't trading
Lim Dong-gyu with anyone.

507
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,666
That article is wrong, so ignore it.
I told you that it's not true!

508
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,459
Yes, goodness.

509
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,088
I told you. It's a false report.

510
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,257
We know nothing about it,
so how can we trade him?

511
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,424
-No, we don't!
-Yes.

512
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,593
Of course. We will announce it
as soon as it's decided…

513
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,972
Hey. Where's the general manager?

514
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,807
I don't know. Where on earth is he?

515
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,601
Why do we have to clean up his mess?

516
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,729
I'm going to the general manager's office.

517
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,106
Really? I'm going with you.

518
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,649
-Good. Let's go.
-Gosh.

519
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,859
-Are you really going? Don't.
-We have to.

520
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,861
Let's go then.

521
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,281
Hey.

522
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,575
-Where are you going?
-Well…

523
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,286
-To the general manager's office.
-Why?

524
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,662
To make a statement.

525
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,707
"Not Kim Kwan-sik. There's nothing left
to ruin in this team."

526
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,292
Why didn't you tell me?

527
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,668
You're almost like his lackey…

528
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,133
Hey, he hates me the most
because I complain most often.

529
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,593
Why are you acting
like you're all active now?

530
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,973
Where are you going? Go with me.

531
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,762
Mr. Baek.

532
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,388
We need your explanation.

533
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,769
Why must we send Lim Dong-gyu out
by trading him for Kim Kwan-sik?

534
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,066
Does Dong-gyu even tell you
to do something like this?

535
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,525
Mr. Baek.

536
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,033
I want everyone to gather
in the meeting room in an hour.

537
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,955
-In an hour?
-That's it?

538
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,962
All right.

539
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,757
Let's return to our desks first

540
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,759
and gather again
in the meeting room later.

541
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,056
Let's go back. Let's go.

542
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,355
How is he going to persuade us?

543
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,148
Lim Dong-gyu doesn't
even have any injuries.

544
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,820
I'm afraid I won't be persuaded either.

545
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,504
Let's begin.

546
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,924
WHY LIM DONG-GYU
MUST LEAVE THE DREAMS

547
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,350
FIRST, HE'S A COWARD.

548
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,560
He's a coward.

549
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,317
You must be familiar
with his home runs and batting average.

550
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,236
It makes you think he's valuable.

551
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,697
His batting average with RISP is 0.307.

552
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,615
Even though it's lower
than his batting average,

553
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,034
-that doesn't make him a coward.
-But…

554
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,412
he's ranked third in game-winners.

555
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,038
Park Jung-chan is ranked first.

556
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,207
He's also a good player,
but in second place,

557
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,294
we have Jang Dong-soo
with a batting average of 0.270.

558
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,629
He averages 0.330,
but he has fewer game-winners

559
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,506
than a player who averages 0.27.

560
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,759
He's not a hero
when it comes to winning the game.

561
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,846
Didn't you say he doesn't know much
about baseball?

562
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,139
We'll see.

563
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,186
People often say his only weakness
is that he's easily affected by heat.

564
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,771
But the rankings
in professional baseball are…

565
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,858
decided in the summer.

566
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,067
POOR RECORD IN JULY, AUGUST

567
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,447
He's not a player who's weak against heat,
he's just a player who can't contribute

568
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,781
when we compete for the ranking.

569
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,995
Why do we need him so desperately
when he hits numerous home runs

570
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,997
after we're set to be in last place?

571
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,504
Our general manager did his homework.

572
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,465
THE BALLPARK IS CHANGING

573
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,675
Let me calculate which team
has hit the most home runs.

574
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,804
We have allowed the most home runs
and hit the least home runs.

575
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,058
Only Dong-gyu and the opposing batters
have taken advantage

576
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,768
of playing in a smaller field.

577
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,067
So, we've begun extending the fence
by seven meters,

578
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,237
and this decision was made
by both myself and the manager.

579
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,488
With the extended fence,

580
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:18,077
he loses 12 home runs
considering his hitting distance.

581
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,997
He's actually not a slugger.

582
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,459
He's a batter of middle and long distance.

583
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,588
With a small number of batters
with precision

584
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,049
and a slugger or two on our team,

585
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,221
the player who has nowhere to stand
if we extend the fence is Lim Dong-gyu.

586
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,937
The fourth reason.
This will be the most important.

587
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,438
It's his…

588
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,440
personality.

589
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,112
Hey, pitchers. Get in line in front of me.

590
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,198
I told you to turn the game around
and you didn't!

591
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,452
Baseball is played by the whole team.
Show some respect.

592
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,371
You scumbag!

593
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:04,999
-Stop!
-Hey!

594
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,209
-Stop him!
-What did you say to me?

595
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,379
You must remember Kang Doo-ki,
who was on our team two years ago.

596
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:14,133
He was a pitcher with ten wins,
and he had a conflict with Dong-gyu.

597
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,720
I heard that he left our team
as recommended by Dong-gyu.

598
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:23,017
There was not a piece evidence
of his comments,

599
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,812
but Doo-ki had left our team
with no excuses.

600
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,857
Even now, Dong-gyu demands

601
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,611
that we form the team with players
that he likes.

602
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,572
Mr. Ko, am I wrong?

603
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,366
Please go on.

604
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:47,082
Now, Kang Doo-ki currently has 18 wins
with an earned run average of 2.28.

605
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,877
He's now one of the top starting pitchers
in the league

606
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,005
and is a player who beats the ace players
of the opposing team.

607
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,175
It was Dong-gyu
who made Doo-ki leave our team.

608
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,802
He is ruining our team.

609
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,768
Now, the fifth reason
is the shift in generations.

610
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:09,021
Dong-gyu is a veteran who won't be able
to lead our team for ten years.

611
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,397
But fortunately,

612
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,276
we have prospects on our team
who can replace him

613
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,944
just waiting for the opportunity.

614
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,029
OUTFIELDER LEE JAE-HYUNG

615
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,155
Right?

616
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,367
An average of 0.420 and 14 home runs.

617
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,161
It's his record in the second-string team,
and at the end of last year,

618
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,497
he played 20 games
in the first-string team,

619
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,999
and he averaged 0.350
with 4 home runs.

620
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,710
He has also shown his potential
as a center fielder.

621
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,337
It's Yeon Joong-sub.

622
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,840
It's time we let him experience
and train in a first-string team.

623
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,635
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes.

624
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:44,139
But still, Dong-gyu
is the star of our franchise.

625
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,725
As an employee of the marketing team,

626
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,520
I know that most fans of our team
come to watch Dong-gyu.

627
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,188
And without him, we won't know what to do

628
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,357
with the uniform sales
and the ticket sales.

629
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,651
You want to throw out a player like him.

630
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,155
Have you thought about how it will
affect the image of our franchise?

631
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,116
Right.

632
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,952
We need a star of the franchise.

633
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,040
A player that can surpass his presence

634
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,959
doesn't exist on our team now.

635
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,088
That's why we should
bring a franchise player.

636
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,049
I don't think you know well
about what a franchise player is.

637
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,552
How and where are we going to find
someone like that?

638
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,222
Last year,

639
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,934

640
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,854
-I've negotiated--
-I'm saying...

641
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:37,443
we can't bring Kim Kwan-sik,
general manager.

642
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,407
Excuse me.

643
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,704
-Yes.
-Say something.

644
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,664
Have you thought about this enough?

645
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:57,004
All right, then, we'll also get permission
from our employees and proceed.

646
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,090
Yes, I hope
this will be a win-win situation.

647
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,427
Who was that?

648
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,305
-What have you done?
-Let me continue.

649
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,390
We're in need of a starting pitcher,

650
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:12,519
so we need a pitcher who can be a match
for the opponent's ace player, right?

651
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,354
What if a pitcher like that said

652
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,902
that he won't come back to our team
if Dong-gyu is still with us?

653
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,243
What if he's a player who's able
to boost our players' morale,

654
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:33,081
has the most number of fans on our team,
is from our region,

655
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,418
and is a Golden Glove winner
who used to be on our team?

656
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,925
No way.

657
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,220
Nice!

658
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,638
Good.

659
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,940
Good.

660
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,986
What a pity.

661
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,907
Doo-ki!

662
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,410
It's been decided. I'm sorry.

663
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,537
You've done great.

664
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,834
Thank you for sending me to the Dreams!

665
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,711
Ms. Lee.

666
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,422
Please prepare a uniform for Kang Doo-ki.

667
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,425
Kang Doo-ki?

668
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,095
He's coming to our team?

669
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,930
Yes, I just got the call.

670
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,599
He will be joining our team now.

671
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,896
Wasn't it Kim Kwan-sik?

672
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,567
Right. You should prepare
another uniform for him, too.

673
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,028
Kim Kwan-sik, too?

674
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,156
Yes, we'll be handing over the draft right
of Son Seung-min,

675
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,451
the high school player
who most likely will have priority.

676
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,078
It's a two-for-two trade.

677
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,873
Seung-min's position is third baseman.

678
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,916
I've made this decision because
I heard Park Wan-gu

679
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,377
will be discharged from the army
two months later.

680
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,472
I heard Wins Above Replacement
is important nowadays.

681
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,517
Considering WAR,

682
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:21,106
Doo-ki is ranked number 1
in the whole league with the WAR of 7.5.

683
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,984
Dong-gyu has a WAR of 6.2.

684
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,369
We're at the bottom with 14 more defeats,

685
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,622
so we'll still be at the bottom
with Doo-ki.

686
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,206
Let's all work harder.

687
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,669
Is there anyone
who still opposes this trade?

688
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,047
Yes.

689
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,843

690
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,096
But Doo-ki is the starting pitcher
of the national team.

691
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:54,973
Is the trade even possible?

692
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,643
Yes. Why?

693
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,728
I don't care if it's Lim Dong-gyu.

694
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,939
I'm not giving you Doo-ki.

695
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,649
He's the ace player of the national team.

696
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:09,446
Doo-ki has the earned run average of
over 4.00 against the Sabers, doesn't he?

697
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,324
If we're looking at it that way,

698
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,744
why don't you check Dong-gyu's records
in the summer?

699
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:19,331
He's trying to maintain his stats.
He's only good in the fall.

700
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,377
Exactly. We don't need a player
who's only good in the fall.

701
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,089

702
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,467
You should be playing well consistently.

703
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,387
What was Dong-gyu's batting average
against the Sabers?

704
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,098
Yes, it was 0.420.

705
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,225
Yes.

706
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,061
Instead,

707
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,898
you must turn over Son Seung-min to us.

708
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,733
Yes, if you give us Kim Kwan-sik.

709
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,987
What? Seriously?

710
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,700
Yes.

711
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:59,788
Is it a shame that I've managed
something so difficult?

712
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,378
That's just how it is now.

713
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,256

714
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:15,220
If you still oppose it,
please call out my name before I leave.

715
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,807
I'll walk out slowly.

716
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,240
Goodness.

717
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,242
He recruited Kang Doo-ki?

718
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,994
When did he…

719
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,706
This doesn't make sense.

720
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,350
Is it true?

721
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,145
You'll approve, right?

722
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,328
Pack up.

723
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,590
Now.

724
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,593
And take this with you.

725
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,768
About the car repair,

726
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,646
I just paid for it.

727
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,400
Hey.

728
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:54,986
Drop this nonsense.

729
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,327

730
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,371
You'll trade me for Kim Kwan-sik?

731
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,748
The fans won't let that happen.

732
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,877
I'm the only one
about to be a retired number here.

733
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,004
Do you want to see everyone up in arms?

734
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,799
Why would everyone be up in arms?

735
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,177
Everyone was happy
to have Kang Doo-ki on the team.

736
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,726
Kang Doo-ki?

737
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,564
A player like him gets his number retired.

738
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,983
He's good at baseball.

739
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,069
He's respected by his colleagues.

740
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,198
Of course, it was impressive
to see you donate gear

741
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:46,830
and pay for the get-together,
knowing you'd be traded.

742
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,376
Thanks to that, the club doesn't know
about our bad relationship.

743
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,962
You did well until the end.

744
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,050
The first-line national athlete
is joining our team thanks to you.

745
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,389
Why would Kang Doo-ki…

746
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,861
You.

747
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,949
This isn't the end
of my 11 years on this field.

748
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,829
It's not even hard
to kick someone like you out!

749
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,875
Don't you dare take a step from here.

750
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,961
Hey, Lim Dong-gyu.

751
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:36,922
What, you punk?

752
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,396
Just go.

753
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,127
You approved of the trade.

754
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,047
Yes.

755
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,800
Why?

756
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:23,969
You know.

757
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,555
We need Kang Doo-ki a bit more than you
right now.

758
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,683
There's nothing we can do about it.

759
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,268
Play well there.

760
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,814
This is insane.

761
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,983
Mr. Lim.

762
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,735
Let me tell you
about the current situation.

763
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,531
No one is sad to have you leave.

764
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,574
You know why?

765
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,620
Because Kang Doo-ki is joining
in exchange for you.

766
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,082
Ask anyone on the street
about who's better.

767
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,918
Be honest with me.
You'd agree it's Kang Doo-ki.

768
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:58,712
Right?

769
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,800
Thus, the general manager has reason.

770
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,886
I'm a rational person,
so I had to approve of it.

771
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:11,057
You should've found reason

772
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:12,934
like he did.

773
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,606
KANG DOO-KI RETURNS TO HOME TEAM

774
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,150

775
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,361
-I was happy to have Lim Dong-gyu.
-Is Kang Doo-ki joining the team for real?

776
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,405
I'm excited to have Kim Kwan-sik as well.

777
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,824
Thanks for your hard work, Dong-gyu.

778
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,950
I hope you win there.

779
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,328
SEARCH KEYWORD LIST OF THE DREAMS

780
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,417
The Dreams.

781
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,170
I've come!

782
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:43,298
PRESS CONFERENCE
WELCOMING KANG DO-KI TO THE DREAMS

783
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,345
-Kang Doo-ki!
-Kang Doo-ki!

784
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,972
The two traded players showed
different expressions.

785
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,767
Lim Dong-gyu seemed sad

786
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,269
to leave his home team
on which he played for a long time.

787
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,772
Isn't that your company?

788
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:00,899
Mom.

789
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,361
Our team…

790
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,487
What?

791
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,988
If we're lucky…

792
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,911
If we're really lucky…

793
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,120
Gosh, what?

794
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,710
Our team might not place last next year!

795
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,629
What are you saying?

796
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:59,290
I signed and approved your work this time.

797
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,835
-You know that, right?
-Yes.

798
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,045
Seeing how you work,

799
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:08,508
I couldn't help but root for you
as another man.

800
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,469
Mr. Baek.

801
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:16,975
In the past two years,
we finished with 43 wins

802
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,644
and 46 wins.

803
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,147
Right.

804
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,940
We won too many times.

805
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,484
Don't you think?

806
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,157
Why do you think I hired you?

807
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,494
I told you.

808
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,539
I hired you
because of your unique experience.

809
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,876
Win…

810
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:44,711
then disband.

811
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,590
Win and disband.

812
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,342
Win…

813
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,471
and again,

814
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,265
disband.

815
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,480
Just do what your experience says.

816
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,399
I'm not asking for much.

817
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,242
Yes, sir.

818
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,287
What kind of a guy
do you think Baek Seung-soo is?

819
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,039
I don't work with humanists.

820
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,291
It's a team that's bad at baseball
and has no future.

821
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,251
We do need changes.

822
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,919
Who's responsible for choosing players?

823
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,837
I think I need to find out.

824
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,507
Has the scouting team ever drafted
a player that does his part?

825
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,926
They say our team is a graveyard
for rising stars.

826
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,053
What're you doing
with those priority draft rights?

827
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,180
-You boiling soup with those?
-It's an unprecedented

828
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,765
pro-team scouting scandal.
