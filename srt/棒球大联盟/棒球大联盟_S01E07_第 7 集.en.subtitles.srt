1
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,241
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,993
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:58,141
Don't tell me you're flustered.
Is the topic a little too difficult?

4
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,060
-Yes, it is.
-To have their salaries cut

5
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,061
by 30 percent...

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,105
The total of the salary budget
for players has been reduced,

7
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,193
and you want me to negotiate
and sign contracts with all the players.

8
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,028
Is that it?

9
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,946
Right.

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,032
I suggest you make it 10 percent.

11
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,243
Stop talking about money
as if you're bargaining at a market.

12
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,914
It's you who decided on the price
like it's some kind of bargaining.

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,709
Do you want me to tell you the reason?

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,253
We are...

15
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:29,923
bad at baseball.

16
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,425
There's more.

17
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,345
We've been horrible at baseball for years.

18
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,472
And one more thing.

19
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,143
We're losing money on this team.

20
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:46,272
Right. We were bad at it last year
and the year before.

21
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,858
That's why our players have
the lowest salaries.

22
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,945
It's neither an opinion or a suggestion.

23
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,572
It's a decision.

24
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,368
And the resolution of our group.

25
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,721
Prepare for the salary negotiations
as fiercely as you always have.

26
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,764
Okay.

27
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,059
-That's what we always...
-We have a drastic cut.

28
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,394
How much?

29
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,479
It'll be 30 percent.

30
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:32,569
We have to complete contracts
with all players with this amount.

31
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,946
There will be a lot of opposition.

32
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:39,784
They might argue that
baseball players need to buy equipment

33
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,744
and would need more pay.

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,414
Not realizing the harsh reality

35
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,916
and caught up in the glory
of the old days,

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,252
some might bring out their egos.

37
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,214
That's because their salaries
are revealed to the public.

38
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,716
But in reality,

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,052
there are many reasons for the salary cut.

40
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,889
They've been finishing in last place
for a while now.

41
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,349
Did you accept that?

42
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,518
Even the players that do not
have a good record

43
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,688
won't react well when they hear
about a 30 percent reduction.

44
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,983
It's natural for different parties
to fight during salary negotiations.

45
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,568
Of course, I'm aware of that.

46
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,446
Everyone has different interests,
and that's why we get angry.

47
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,949
Off-season training gets delayed
due to this. I've been through it all.

48
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,203
But with those reductions,
we can't do negotiations.

49
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,247
The Dreams have been last place
for four years in a row.

50
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:31,336
Do we have to accept the bad results

51
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,631
while they get the same pay
as everyone else?

52
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,674
Isn't this a professional league?

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,552
I think there's enough justification.

54
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,850
So you're agreeing
with these cuts?

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,145
It's a difference in values.

56
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,105
There's a much easier way too.

57
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,525
NUMBER, NAME, POSITION

58
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,818
Could this be...

59
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,529
Yes, that's the list of players to be cut.

60
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,616
But we already had some players released.

61
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,494
This is the easiest way
to reduce labor costs.

62
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,165
Ten people. There are too many.

63
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,960
There will be a meeting
regarding salaries tomorrow morning.

64
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,379
Anyway, you guys discuss your opinions.

65
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,509
Does this even make sense?

66
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,636
How are we going to release
10 more players?

67
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,305
It was hard choosing the players
to release in November.

68
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,058
Has everything we've done so far
made sense?

69
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,228
But there hasn't been a time
with this much nonsense going on.

70
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,940
Let's be quiet.

71
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,693
Goodness.

72
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,362
Hey.

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,322
Organize this again.

74
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,283
Okay.

75
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,161
And you should stop watching videos
and focus on the numbers.

76
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,371
Okay.

77
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,582
And I'm not sure if you'll still be here,
but once the season begins,

78
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,585
there's a thing called an
away game scorekeeper. You can't do it.

79
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,422
-I can do it.
-No. You just look at the numbers.

80
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,133
A PERSON WHO TAKES RECORDS
AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE GAME

81
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,222
But all the names are whited out.

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,851
Just look at the numbers!
I said, just look at the numbers.

83
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,770
Statistics analysts
only need to look at numbers.

84
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,022
Okay.

85
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,440
Thank you.

86
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,818
No problem.

87
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,198
What brings you here?

88
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,369
My name is Baek Young-soo
of the strategy analysis team.

89
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,788
I see.

90
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,135
I gathered you all here
despite your busy schedules

91
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,345
because of the salary negotiations.

92
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,099
Funding from our parent company
has been immensely cut.

93
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,978
Compared to the total sum of last year,
we have to cut the sum by 30 percent.

94
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,481
-By 30 percent?
-By 30 percent?

95
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,193
With that sum, we have to proceed
with the salary negotiations.

96
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,569
It's not easy,

97
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,364
so I gathered you all here
to listen to your opinions.

98
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,868
This is the list of 10 players
to release from the team.

99
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,499
Ten?

100
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,541
Ten players?

101
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:25,004
If the manager, the team leaders,
and the assistant chief of the scout team

102
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,090
can give your opinions
regarding this list, that'd be great.

103
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,385
Well, if all these players are released,

104
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,180
the journalists would be inquiring
and there would be an uproar.

105
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:38,017
-How would we answer?
-I don't understand this list.

106
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,143
Why not?

107
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,562
Kim Chan-hee, Jung Bae-yong...

108
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,315
They're not players
that I picked casually.

109
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,902
They're growing and getting better.
Why are they included in this list?

110
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,488
I picked them
looking 10 years into the future.

111
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,491
It's extremely difficult
to get into a professional team.

112
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,161
Who can we say does badly when
we give a good outlook in 10 years?

113
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,581
Who made this list?

114
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,833
Was it you?

115
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,001
It was not me.

116
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,380
If it were someone who knew
at least a little bit of the Dreams,

117
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,298
he wouldn't have done such a terrible job.

118
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,637
What is it?

119
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,642
If we release 10 players,
the team is reduced to 40 players.

120
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,728
-Can the team even function?
-I'm sure it would last

121
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,313
at least one season.

122
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,776
We can't do with this list.

123
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,196
Instead of Lee Kyung-seok,
how about we release Kim Jong-yoon?

124
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,700
But Kim Jong-yoon isn't a player
we should release either.

125
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,161
If we release Lee Chan-joong,
another team will take him right away.

126
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,497
We can't release Kang Han-bae.
He's handsome.

127
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,291
What?

128
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,877
He's not a main player,
but his uniforms sell!

129
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,755
If Kang Han-bae is out,
ticket sales will plummet!

130
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,969
Why are you all looking at me like that?

131
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,598
Do you think we can afford
to play baseball with mere dirt?

132
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,474
We're a professional baseball team.

133
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:05,855
But we already released players
in November.

134
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,399
We released 11 players then.

135
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,985
It wasn't any less than before.

136
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,572
It's unfortunate, but if we do
release another 10 players...

137
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,407
In other words,

138
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,537
if all the 10 players are released,
our team will be reduced to 40 players.

139
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,873
If some players deal with injuries,

140
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,292
will the team be able to function?

141
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,589
No.

142
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,009
And so,

143
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,886
Kim Chan-hee, Jung Bae-yong,

144
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,181
Lee Kyung-seok, Lee Chan-joong,
Seo Ki-yeol, and Yoo Won-jae.

145
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,724
We need them, right?

146
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,186
The player we can remove is

147
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,146
Song Myung-jun.

148
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,398
Who thinks we need him?

149
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,529
Okay. Then how about Sung Min-jae?

150
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,577
These players run around the field

151
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,664
to catch the fungoes I hit,
and they bunt

152
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,375
in the games when I tell them to.

153
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
I can't...

154
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,963
raise my hand in this meeting.

155
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,469
I feel quite uncomfortable.
May I leave the room?

156
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,264
Yes, thank you for your effort.
You may leave.

157
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,146
We'll continue.

158
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,899
Who thinks we need Jang Jin-woo?

159
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,153
No one? Can we remove him?

160
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,953
But Jang Jin-woo had 19 wins in the past,

161
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,540
which is the highest
within a decade of Dreams baseball.

162
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,376
If we were to remove him,
we should have notified him

163
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,545
and held him a retirement ceremony.

164
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,090
If you think we need Jang Jin-woo
for our postseason,

165
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,260
then please raise your hand.

166
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,097
Can I remove Jang Jin-woo?

167
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,476
-I'm home.
-Dad's home, Ha-yoon.

168
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,103
-Let's eat.
-Dad!

169
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,813
Ha-yoon.

170
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,691
What have you been up to?

171
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,901
Welcome home.
Go wash up so we can eat.

172
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,154
Sorry, I have to go to Ki-bum's house.

173
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,616
You should have told me earlier.
I made all this.

174
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,370
-He called me all of a sudden.
-Are you going to eat meat without us?

175
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,872
I want meat too!

176
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,168
I'll buy some meat
back on my way home. All right?

177
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,627
Enjoy your dinner.

178
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,212
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

179
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,256
When is it?

180
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,554
-When is what?
-Your salary negotiation.

181
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,017
It's still a long way off.

182
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,728
Will it be reduced?

183
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,190
I think it will.

184
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:56,984
Still,

185
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,404
you know that no one in our building
earns more than you, right?

186
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,575
-I'll be back.
-Yes, come home safe.

187
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,495
Can we remove Jang Jin-woo?

188
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,372
I have an opinion.

189
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:17,004
Although I haven't been an athlete,
I've started observing pitchers

190
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,215
since I learned how to catch balls.

191
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,510
I think he can still pitch.

192
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,597
Should I say his pitches are nasty?

193
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,349
It's tough to hit his pitches.

194
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,852
The record also says he hasn't
given up many extra-base hits.

195
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,979
EXTRA-BASE HIT,
A HIT BETTER THAN A SINGLE

196
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,110
Then we'll negotiate
with all of our players.

197
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,947
Mr. Baek won't release any players.

198
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,367
Do you know how cold-hearted he is?

199
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,452
You'll see.

200
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,750
What?

201
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,629
They're signing contracts
with all of them.

202
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,381
I've seen many like that.

203
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,425
People who want to look like
they have principles.

204
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,012
-Should I tell him to remove the players?
-For what?

205
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,891
It was his choice to turn his back
on the important players

206
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,894
to mind 10 mediocre athletes.
It's a good thing.

207
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,188
I know it won't happen,

208
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,358
but even if they all
sign the contract, it's a win for us

209
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,318
-since we get to save money.
-Right?

210
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,195
If things go wrong...

211
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,031
The moment he started the meeting
with the team leaders,

212
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,993
it meant that he had accepted
our absurd proposal.

213
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:33,539
He started it by blowing the whistle.
If he fails, he'll break down.

214
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,668
He gives them false hope
by making them think

215
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,587
he could make it work.

216
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,674
Baek Seung-soo's fake leadership
will be revealed.

217
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,392
We'll re-sign with all of our players
rather than releasing them.

218
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,939
Are we getting an additional budget?

219
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,274
I don't think so.

220
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,613
So you plan to re-sign all of them
with that budget?

221
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,285
But the players are already saying
that our franchise is being cheap.

222
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:17,374
Are we equally cutting
all of their annual salaries?

223
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,878
We have a lot of players who receive
minimum salaries, don't we?

224
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,382
We're going to completely change
the method of calculating salaries.

225
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,093
What is this about?
Why haven't I even been notified?

226
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,013
-I have no clue.
-There will be a backlash.

227
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,223
Since I joined this team,

228
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,518
unless I'm changing the location
of the vase in my office,

229
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
I remember always being opposed anyway.

230
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,150
Please continue.

231
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,947
I deleted all the data on how much
they received last year,

232
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,866
and then did the calculation.

233
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,911
So they all start on a zero base,

234
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,956
and it'll be calculated according
to last year's records only.

235
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,166
This is too...

236
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,501
We're in trouble.

237
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,420
I'll give you an example
so that you may understand.

238
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,216
Let's look at Park Jung-chan
in his third year this year.

239
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,052
He's ranked first in the number
of game-winners in our team.

240
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,471
His annual salary was
80 million won last year.

241
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,765
We can offer him
150 million won this year.

242
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,188
This year is Jang Jin-woo's
16th year on our team.

243
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,857
And he didn't play well last season
as you all know.

244
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,821
He received 130 million won,
and we can offer him 50 million won.

245
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,202
A player can play well
for one season, and he can get

246
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,038
a higher salary than a veteran
with 16 years of experience.

247
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,582
That's our new method
of calculating the salaries.

248
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,502
There will be some serious opposition.

249
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,630
It's professional baseball,
not sandlot baseball.

250
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,968
If they don't want to be treated according
to how they contribute, they should quit.

251
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,804
Why do we have a seniority
system in the professional league?

252
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,057
A SENIORITY SYSTEM GIVES PREFERENCE
ACCORDING TO LENGTH OF SERVICE

253
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,601
Okay, should I prepare
a briefing with the players?

254
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,519
Yes.

255
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,066
Kwak Han-young is

256
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,610
good at defending the infield
wherever he is,

257
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,404
so he plays in numerous games

258
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,614
as a key player free of positions.

259
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,743
His batting average is 0.262,
and he also has batting power.

260
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,786
He hit 15 home runs too.

261
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,831
The manager also likes him
since he doesn't have to worry

262
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,499
even if an infielder gets injured.

263
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,628
Next up, I think he'll be the person
of interest in this negotiation.

264
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,673
It's the starting catcher of our team,
Seo Yeong-ju.

265
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,093
The word "if" always follows him.

266
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,929
Some people say
if Seo Yeong-ju were healthy,

267
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,975
our team would have been ranked
in ninth place, not in last place.

268
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,312
Every time he plays full time,
he's one of the top defensive catchers

269
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,273
in our country
according to general opinion.

270
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,777
And he's the best at blocking
balls in our country.

271
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,154
He's ranked second
in stopping stolen bases.

272
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,282
And he's reliable in terms
of leading our pitchers.

273
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,542
Yeong-ju. I heard they'll be cutting
our salaries this year.

274
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,922
Aren't you on our team?
Everyone knows the Dreams are cheap.

275
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,715
But it's the new general manager.

276
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,927
He claimed that we should be paid
based on our records.

277
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,640
I don't care. I'll get paid based on
my skills, not my records.

278
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,557
NUMBER OF GAMES

279
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,645
He couldn't play in a lot of games
last season due to his injury.

280
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,773
So it's inevitable his salary will
be immensely reduced this year.

281
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,899
But...

282
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,947
I'm not sure if he will accept it.

283
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,366
He's always been tough to negotiate with.

284
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,910
-Yes. Who's next?
-Yes.

285
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,204
It's Jang Jin-woo.

286
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,582
He used to be an ace player who had
19 wins when we went to the finals.

287
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,418
But his pitching speed plummeted
after his shoulder injury.

288
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,755
He's been allowing a lot
of home runs and extra-base hits.

289
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,633
It's difficult for him to become a coach,
as his stats

290
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,343
have been very poor after that.

291
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,804
He's not thinking of retiring
any time soon,

292
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,599
but I'm not sure if he'll accept
this new calculation method.

293
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,978
He has become a good example
to the younger players

294
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,272
since he's an earnest player.

295
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,857
A good example?

296
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,819
Is there a younger player
who wants to be like him?

297
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,905
There won't be any for now.

298
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,825
Whether he's earnest or not,
he can't be a good example.

299
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,995
We already have Kang Doo-ki
who's a successful model.

300
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,748
Doo-ki works hard and he has good results.

301
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,917
That's a good example.

302
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,254
You can't compare him to Kang Doo-ki.

303
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,299
I'm only telling you to state
the accurate value of a player,

304
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,427
because we all know that Jin-woo is
a player we need.

305
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,554
Pardon?

306
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,767
He produced 10 double plays
with a runner on first base,

307
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,937
and seven of those failed
due to errors by our defense.

308
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,399
If we exclude the mistakes
of our team, he's the best in the league.

309
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,861
He has the best IRA percentage
among our middle relief pitchers.

310
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,863
THE PERCENTAGE OF INHERITED RUNS ALLOWED

311
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,449
Then you can't be offering
him 50 million won, can you?

312
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,205
Why would we acknowledge his value
when he's not aware of it himself?

313
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,593
Mr. Jang.

314
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,053
What?

315
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,971
"What?"

316
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm not from the Dreams,

317
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,436
-and the former team leader, Mr. Ko...
-Hold on.

318
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,525
-The former team leader?
-Then is he the current team leader?

319
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,154
-You must be out of your mind.
-Anyway,

320
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,865
I wasn't as good as you two
when I was a player,

321
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,743
but if you insult me and look down on me

322
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,329
-like this...
-Then, what?

323
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,334
-I'll have to swallow it.
-What's with you?

324
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,337
Whether people will criticize me
for my lack of leadership

325
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,840
or criticize you for being nasty
and arrogant,

326
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,592
I know the answer already.

327
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,639
I will respect you
since you made your debut before me.

328
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,810
And I need you to respect me
as the team leader.

329
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,396
Only then will the scout team work well--

330
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,522
Hey.

331
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,692
I picked up a bat

332
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,903
many years earlier than you, you brat.

333
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,949
What does the fact that you
picked up a bat earlier than me

334
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,368
have to do with the job we're doing now?

335
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,955
Violence,
unnecessarily strict hierarchy...

336
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:36,253
It's disgusting.
Why don't we just get rid of such things?

337
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,011
What the... Hey!

338
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,806
Darn it! The scum...

339
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,309
Shoot.

340
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,146
Isn't he a psycho?

341
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,899
GOPCHANG STORY

342
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,157
I heard you eat ramyeon after training,

343
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,493
so I brought you here.

344
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,622
By the way, this place is quite crowded.

345
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,793
It wasn't easy in the beginning,
but it's gotten much better now.

346
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,213
I play in an amateur league
to promote this place,

347
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,050
and they often have dinner together here.

348
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,469
Is it good?

349
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,678
It's really tasty.

350
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,430
Looking at you,

351
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,892
I can tell you're feeling
very comfortable now.

352
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,894
Playing in the next season too?

353
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,980
-Of course. What else would I do?
-How much will they pay you?

354
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,275
I haven't had a meeting yet,
but it'd be less than the last season.

355
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,819
Didn't you get about 140 million won
last season?

356
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,577
You should also work harder
and get more than him in three years.

357
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,289
Actually, I'd be happy
if they raised my pay even a little.

358
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,335
Gosh. I'm already happy thinking of it.

359
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,753
Jeez.

360
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,382
But it'd be less
than 130 million won next season.

361
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,468
-It doesn't matter.
-If they cut 30, it'd be 100 million.

362
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,930
-Why don't you open a place like me?
-I still can throw balls, you know.

363
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,516
Come on. I can throw balls too.

364
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,017
Honey!

365
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:22,025
Even my wife can catch that well.
What's the point of just throwing balls?

366
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,694
The problem is that you no longer
can throw balls well.

367
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,824
Come on. I'm happy that I still receive
100 million won. I'm doing fine.

368
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,991
Are you joking?

369
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,993
Honey, come here.

370
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,415
I'm busy.

371
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,251
When we close the place,
let's drink together.

372
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,128
Tell him.

373
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,588
He still wants to play even
for only 100 million won.

374
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,383
That's not a small amount.
It's too early to retire.

375
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,678
-You saved some money, right?
-It wouldn't be that much.

376
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,971
Still,

377
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,849
I feel much better
after we opened this place.

378
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,185
If he just warmed the bench and
didn't get to play when he was a player,

379
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,147
the whole house was gloomy
like a funeral home.

380
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,858
And if he messed up a play in the field,

381
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,860
it was even worse.

382
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,280
Moreover, if the team lost
no matter how well he played,

383
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,614
it was still a bad day.

384
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,783
The whole family had to be sad
almost every day.

385
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,872
He'd rarely been at home
because of training and away games.

386
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,916
Money isn't everything.

387
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,671
-Excuse me. Can we have a bottle of soju?
-Okay. I'll be right there.

388
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,516
-Are your knees okay?
-Yes. They're fine now.

389
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,060
I walked to Cheongsan Park today.

390
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,520
Mom!

391
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,023
-Stay home on cold days.
-I'm okay.

392
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,445
You know Seung-mi's mom, right?

393
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,198
She's working as a cashier
in the supermarket in town.

394
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,533
And I heard she'll quit soon.

395
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,536
You know the supermarket owners
are really nice.

396
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,622
They always give leftovers for free.

397
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,332
You can't!

398
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,752
I can't live as a housewife forever
when I don't have a husband.

399
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,587
I'm healthier than you.

400
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,423
Say that after your knees recover.

401
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,886
I'm cleaning the same places at home
over and over again.

402
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,971
So only you can be a career woman?

403
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,062
Mom.

404
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,064
Is my pay too little?

405
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,568
What is it this time?
Did salary negotiations begin?

406
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,987
It must not be enough for both of us.

407
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,448
It's as little as a rat's tail, right?

408
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,909
You always say that
during salary negotiation season.

409
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,995
Do you know what functions
a rat's tail has?

410
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,624
It detects the temperature
and the environment.

411
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,585
-What are you saying out of the blue?
-Thanks to your small pay,

412
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,129
I'm sensitive to the price change.

413
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,049
I could also learn to save money
while spending less.

414
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,384
What are you saying?

415
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,177
Stop reading weird books.

416
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,889
Don't worry.
It's not because your pay is too little.

417
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,058
-Then?
-Well,

418
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,978
both Seung-mi's mom and the owner

419
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,814
want me to work there.

420
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,732
No way.

421
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,901
No matter what decision I make,

422
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:10,860
I just...

423
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,365
feel good that they said
they want me to work there.

424
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,328
Although the job doesn't require
a certain certificate. Wait.

425
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,457
I feel even happier because the job
doesn't require any skills. Listen.

426
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,793
Everyone can do the job.

427
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,796
And someone said to me,

428
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,549
"I want you to do the job."

429
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,634
So I just...

430
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,971
felt so great.

431
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,899
Hello.

432
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,160
Yes.

433
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,204
Good afternoon.

434
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,914
Hello.

435
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,630
Please read the terms

436
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,632
and sign on it if you agree.

437
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,383
Okay.

438
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,011
BASEBALL PLAYER CONTRACT

439
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,018
WAGE: 27 MILLION WON

440
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,946
Yoo Min-ho,

441
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,658
please work hard next season.

442
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,618
Then, you'll get much more next year.

443
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,620
Okay.

444
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,581
Do I sign here?

445
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,336
You didn't play for many games.

446
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,590
So we couldn't find any ground
to raise your pay.

447
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,258
Cheer up.

448
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,303
Thank you. I'm fine.

449
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,265
YOO MIN-HO

450
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,898
Here.

451
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,985
-See you later.
-Thank you.

452
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,744
-Hello.
-Hello.

453
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,382
Hello, Grandma.

454
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,593
Yes.

455
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,431
It's cold there, isn't it?

456
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,601
It's quite cold here too.

457
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,191
We'll mainly meet with pitchers today.

458
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,737
Pitchers tend to be
pretty individualistic.

459
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,905
They don't easily sign the contract.

460
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,117
-They also prepare their own documents.
-There's Kwak Han-young

461
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,120
-among hitters we'll see today.
-Yes, the nice guy.

462
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,581
Oh, you are close to him.

463
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,499
No.

464
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,376
It's his nickname.

465
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,921
He understands the team's situation
and signs his contract right away.

466
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,175
I'm sure he'll easily sign
the contract today as well.

467
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,434
Ko...

468
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,102
Ko...

469
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,438
Jeez.

470
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,274
-Goodness.
-What's going on?

471
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,693
Welcome. Long time no see.

472
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,487
How have you been?

473
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,310
I've worked my entire life,
so I was going to rest a bit.

474
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,438
But the players seem
to have a lot of difficulties

475
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,482
when they get to signing the new contract.

476
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,151
No matter how hard they collect
and prepare data,

477
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,403
it can never be enough
compared to the data you prepare.

478
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,282
Once they sit at this table,

479
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,036
their mind goes blank,
and their mouth gets frozen.

480
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,205
So when they come to their senses,

481
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,916
all they see is a contract
with their signature on it.

482
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,754
All they know is baseball,

483
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,507
so they can't deal with sly people.

484
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,803
My juniors were
looking for a trustworthy agent

485
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,973
who's good at negotiating
with a big circle of acquaintances.

486
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,976
So I'm here
with a sense of responsibility.

487
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,936
Since we're acquainted,

488
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,230
let's talk with reason,

489
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,274
so that we don't hurt
each other's feelings.

490
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,692
Sure.

491
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,361
What is the amount you offer?

492
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,698
As you're aware,
the team got the lowest results

493
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,534
-for four years in a row. So...
-Wait.

494
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,996
We're negotiating
his personal salary here.

495
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,957
Why are you mentioning the team's results?

496
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,462
-This happened every time, didn't it?
-Yes.

497
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,841
This needs to be fixed.

498
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,052
I know your circumstances,

499
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,974
but don't tell me
you're offering 160 million won.

500
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,561
OFFER, 160 MILLION WON

501
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,439
What's with that specific amount?

502
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:43,568
I thought that'd be the amount,
considering the result scoring criteria.

503
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,821
You got it wrong.

504
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,489
Right? I thought so.

505
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,493
Kwak Han-young was always nice
when signing his contract.

506
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,246
As his senior, I felt so bad.

507
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,208
I'm here to help him sign
with the proper amount this time.

508
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,586
But 160 million won?

509
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,837
That's a no.

510
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,548
Then what is the amount you have in mind?

511
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,593
I was about to say

512
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:13,348
that 160 million won is
unacceptable for certain.

513
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,893
The team got the lowest results
for four years in a row,

514
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,270
so naturally,
the budget has been cut down.

515
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,649
To fix his salary
in a more reasonable way,

516
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,735
we've only evaluated him
with his results from last year.

517
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,614
As his legal agent,

518
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:35,703
I've searched all the data about
his plays, contracts, and everything.

519
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,957
Do you know what his nickname is?

520
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,502
Don't you know?

521
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,172
The nice guy.

522
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,925
You see,

523
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,760
it breaks my heart.

524
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,514
-We can't offer him 160 million won.
-He won't take 160 million won.

525
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,433
Every sports newspaper mentions his name

526
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,560
for being highly effective
compared to his salary.

527
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,480
He's been the top player on the team
three times for five years.

528
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,524
Among the players
with nine-digit salaries,

529
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,442
he signs his contract
after only two meetings.

530
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,402
He's the nice player.

531
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,447
You shouldn't treat him poorly like this.

532
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,033
Consider how deprived he must've felt.

533
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,163
I had no idea

534
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,666
the Dreams would offer
this shameless amount.

535
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,003
You must offer another amount.

536
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:31,384
Let me tell you a secret.
I'm not getting any commission from him.

537
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,761
Why?

538
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,307
Why? Because I feel bad for him.

539
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:45,148
Our discussion might take some time.
Have you all eaten?

540
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,774
We haven't eaten yet.

541
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,529
It's a chicken sandwich.

542
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,157
Let's see.

543
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,701
Jae-hee.

544
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,453
Will you go buy two cups of coffee?

545
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,538
-Make them iced Americanos.
-What?

546
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,290
What are you doing?

547
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,045
Sorry. What do you want to drink?

548
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,048
All right.

549
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,842
I told you about our new way
of calculating his salary.

550
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,178
And we're well aware of his circumstances.

551
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,348
We both don't think we can narrow
the gap through this meeting.

552
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,519
Let's talk later.

553
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,772
You may leave.

554
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,360
I just opened this though.

555
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:37,867
Oh, right. I'm telling you this
in case you get the wrong idea,

556
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,789
but I'm not here with immature grudges
against my wrongful charge.

557
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,875
I'm here with a sense of duty.

558
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,376
We won't get the wrong idea.

559
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,004
And it wasn't a wrongful charge at all.

560
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:56,761
I don't believe you're pathetic enough
to waste your life on revenge.

561
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,265
Now, please leave.
We have other players waiting.

562
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,024
Oh, right.

563
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,609
I forgot this.

564
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,197
"Jung Sun-gu, Yeo Jae-wook,
Kang Tae-min, Kwon Do-yul."

565
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,242
THE DREAMS, SALARY NEGOTIATION PLAN

566
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,660
Are these the players too?

567
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,162
JUNG SUN-GU, YEO JAE-WOOK,
KANG TAE-MIN, KWON DO-YUL

568
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,333
I'm a legal agent of these players too.

569
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,378
We can also discuss their salaries now
while we're at it.

570
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,756
I need to take it out again.

571
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,762
Eat.

572
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,641
Jae-hee. Why are you still here?

573
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,937
Eat.

574
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,192
Do you want some? It's delicious.

575
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,328
-Thank you.
-No problem.

576
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:05,997
Han-young.

577
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,041
Would you have signed it
if it hadn't been for me?

578
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,127
-Yes.
-They should've been better

579
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,712
to the nice guys

580
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,672
instead of using them.

581
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,008
Jerks.

582
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,470
Do you still drive that car?

583
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,474
-Yes.
-You need to get a new car.

584
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,019
I'll work harder.

585
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,855
-Trust me.
-It works just fine.

586
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,107
-Just trust me.
-Okay.

587
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,151
-Bye.
-Bye.

588
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,033
Bye.

589
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,846
Write one decent article for us.

590
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,561
I'll call you back.

591
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,778
What is it?

592
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,950
I think the worst kind
of human being in this world...

593
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,619
is someone who reacts

594
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,914
to submission due to power
instead of reason.

595
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,834
If this continues,

596
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,797
I won't treat you like a human.

597
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,885
What is he saying?

598
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,725
You know.

599
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,576
Darn it. Bring a tissue.

600
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,078
Darn it.

601
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,206
Bring a tissue.

602
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:25,177
He talked as if he knew
our method of calculating the salary.

603
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,430
Is that why you did that?

604
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,308
-Yes.
-He couldn't say anything. It means...

605
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,601
It's all in the past now. Ko Se-hyuk...

606
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,981
Let's not be swayed by that one agent.

607
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,316
Here.

608
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,235
We need to get all these people
to sign their contracts.

609
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,236
Okay.

610
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,864
Tomorrow's negotiations
are with middle-ranking players.

611
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,451
Their past contracts
have some things slightly in common.

612
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,287
Most of the players with a family

613
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,206
got more than their original offers,
even if by a slight bit.

614
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,960
It's doesn't matter why
because it won't happen this year.

615
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:02,256
Even if you know those players have
a family to support, we'll evaluate

616
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,344
their weaknesses and values thoroughly.

617
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,974
Be strong. It'll be hard even if you're
prepared to get cursed out.

618
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,810
I hope there are no humanists

619
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,480
at this year's negotiating table.

620
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,110
We're meeting Seo Yeong-ju tomorrow.

621
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,530
The affordable amount for his salary
is 300 million won.

622
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,949
But we must settle it
with 200 million won.

623
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,952
You know who he is, right?

624
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,163
Yes, he's the key catcher
who's known to be

625
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:38,626
-most fastidious in terms of contracts.
-He could behave rudely.

626
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,171
It's his attitude that's rude,
not the results, so I don't care.

627
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,507
Just let him.

628
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,139
A RELATIONSHIP AT THE DREAMS,
NOW TOGETHER FOR THE SAME DREAM

629
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,147
LIM DONG-GYU HAS REUNITED
WITH KO SE-HYUK

630
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,577
Next is Seo Yeong-ju.

631
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,206
Come in.

632
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,625
Hello.

633
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,377
Hello.

634
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,046
Do you know this saying?

635
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,716
Pitchers are noblemen,
outfielders are merchants,

636
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,593
infielders are slaves,

637
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,804
and catchers are beggars.

638
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,891
Being a catcher is the toughest.
Please be generous.

639
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,603
You missed quite a lot of games
during the last season.

640
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,064
As we've told you last time,

641
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,860
your salary will be calculated based
on your records from last year.

642
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,487
You should prepare yourself for a cut.

643
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,572
Why?

644
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,866
During the last season...

645
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,703
Shouldn't you be paying
for the expectations you have

646
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,872
of the player for this season?

647
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,956
Mr. Seo Yeong-ju.

648
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,251
Then why would people negotiate
based on the records of a season?

649
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,712
Because it's the most appropriate basis

650
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,882
on which to base your expectations,
on how good a player will play.

651
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,802
Although I haven't played in that
many games because of my injury,

652
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,138
you should see my records
of the second half of the year.

653
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,681
Look at the average.

654
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,934
Don't you see I'm ranked first
among the defensive catchers?

655
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,479
I wasn't planning on saying this,

656
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,107
but do you know what the fans
of the Dreams are saying?

657
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,860
"At least we have Seo Yeong-ju."

658
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:33,657
-That's what they all say, all right?
-Yes, you spoke well on the matter.

659
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,495
As you missed the first half
of the year due to your injury,

660
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:41,081
we expect that you won't be playing
full time in the coming season.

661
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,753
Mr. Baek.
It's the first time we're meeting.

662
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,963
I heard you weren't a player.

663
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,049
Why are you bringing that up?

664
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,802
I was worried you might not
be aware of it. I wanted to explain.

665
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,097
It's not like I have a chronic disease.

666
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,226
I was injured
due to an unexpected incident.

667
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,230
So, this year...

668
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,482
That incident was caused
by your play style.

669
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,694
And we merely evaluate by
considering all those probabilities.

670
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,656
Your habit of blocking
home plate entirely

671
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,491
when you defend it,

672
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,703
your habit of tagging a runner
when he's running for home.

673
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,206
TAG OUT, A FIELDER TAGS
THE RUNNER WITH THE BALL

674
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,541
You should correct those.

675
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,722
I say 500 million won.

676
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,560
I don't want to agonize
over something like this.

677
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,313
I'm afraid we have
very different opinions.

678
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,566
I don't usually make
an unreasonable demand.

679
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:53,612
To have the best defensive catcher
of this nation play full time

680
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,447
after he's healed,

681
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,866
I think that's not expensive at all.

682
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,537
You'll be upset if we tell you
our calculation of your salary.

683
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,665
I'm leaving.

684
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,934
Mr. Jang Jin-woo.

685
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,894
Let's go in.

686
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,941
I'm aware that you're the player
with the most experience,

687
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,151
but in this year,

688
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,778
we've calculated your salary
based solely on your records

689
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,031
-of the last season.
-Yes.

690
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,951
My salary has been adjusted every year.

691
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,871
Our calculation of your salary
is 50 million won.

692
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,760
BASEBALL PLAYER CONTRACT

693
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,803
ROLE: PLAYER, PAYMENT: 50 MILLION WON

694
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,518
Is there an offer you'd like to suggest?

695
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,229
No. Just a minute.

696
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,608
I need some time to...

697
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,407
So 50 million won?

698
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,411
If they're paying you 50 million won,
that means they want you out of the team.

699
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,876
I had the second location planned
in Jungang-dong.

700
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,045
You should take that spot.

701
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,130
You can get a loan to afford it.

702
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,757
You can manage the restaurant,

703
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,842
give private lessons as a part-time job,

704
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,553
and you'll make way more
than 50 million won.

705
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,599
Your body will wear out eventually.

706
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,518
It's time to quit.

707
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,578
Ha-yoon.

708
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,583
I brought fried chicken for you.

709
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,252
You smell like alcohol.

710
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:17,881
Honey.

711
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,928
-Yes.
-It must have been a tough day today.

712
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,932
You must have been scrutinized

713
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:31,019
for every single record
when you've worked hard all year.

714
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,154
We can open a barbecue restaurant,
or a dumpling restaurant.

715
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,658
Or you can keep pitching.

716
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,245
Thank you.

717
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,459
-Which one do you want to do?
-Mom.

718
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,544
I want to eat meat.

719
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,505
A barbecue restaurant.
We should open a barbecue restaurant.

720
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,091
Dad's going to open
a barbecue restaurant, Ha-yoon.

721
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,259
All right?

722
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,178
You smell like alcohol.

723
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,475
Let's go eat fried chicken.
I bought it for you. Let's go.

724
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:14,938
Doo-ki!

725
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,442
It's been a while, Doo-ki.

726
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,486
What's the occasion?

727
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,738
I heard you became an agent.

728
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,407
You're keeping up with the news,
aren't you?

729
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,369
Doo-ki, we should be in the same boat.

730
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,581
Is your current agent okay?

731
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,501
The salary negotiation
doesn't apply to me.

732
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,753
I get paid according
to the free agent contract.

733
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:42,466
Yes. I heard the younger pitchers
all look up to you already.

734
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,134
Are they?

735
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,845
Introduce me to some
of the younger pitchers.

736
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,599
Is there a single pitcher
that you don't know on our team?

737
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,642
I know.

738
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,811
I know them all,

739
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,023
but it's different
when you introduce me to them.

740
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,149
Right?

741
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,111
I was falsely accused
when I quit the team,

742
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:07,282
-a lot of people still misunderstand me.
-As you know, none of our pitchers can

743
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,077
afford to pay a commission
from their salary.

744
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,414
The commission would be too much for them.

745
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,252
You can tell them I'll get them
higher salaries by negotiating well.

746
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,378
Right?

747
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:24,383
-Are you close to Mr. Baek?
-I've met him just a few times.

748
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:27,094
It's a good thing
that he brought you here.

749
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,470
But...

750
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,850
look at the way he handles things
right now.

751
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,894
Mr. Baek can evaluate my records,

752
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,647
but I'm in no position to evaluate him.

753
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,275
Are you a robot or something?

754
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,195
Why are you so tight?
Your name should be Tight Doo-ki!

755
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,321
I know...

756
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,409
that you've partnered
with a few players on our team.

757
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,661
Is it out of pure intentions?

758
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,833
Are you sure you're not just trying
to hinder his work?

759
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,710
What are you saying?

760
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:05,757
I forgot that you were close
to Lim Dong-gyu.

761
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:11,096
Mr. Ko, didn't you often go
to the makgeolli restaurant

762
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,682
next to the beef rib restaurant
in Jungang-dong?

763
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,559
That's my father's restaurant.

764
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,978
When I was in middle school,

765
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,481
I remember you took
the players with poor records

766
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,027
to buy them beef ribs,
and then you came to our restaurant.

767
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:29,281
You barely drank alcohol,
and you only talked about baseball.

768
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,409
You sat down the young players
who didn't even understand,

769
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:35,579
and told them how to hit a ball
or how to defend on the field.

770
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,165
You were talking for hours.

771
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,001
What are you trying to say?

772
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,842
What happened to you, Mr. Ko?

773
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,636
You little...

774
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:57,351
-Is this your way of showing leadership?
-Let go of my hand, you brat!

775
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,649
I'm going to pitch in the postseason
at any cost.

776
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,777
Do not shake up the Dreams.

777
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,506
Mr. Baek.

778
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,801
We just got a call from Seo Yeong-ju.
He wants to meet right now.

779
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,261
-Where is he now?
-He said he's in the hospital,

780
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,056
but I have players whose contracts
I need to get signed.

781
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,557
I'll go with you.

782
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,020
And, Mr. Baek, about Jang Jin-woo...

783
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,981
Can I talk to him in person?

784
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,359
Yes, you can.
We'll get ready to leave then.

785
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,153
CLINICS

786
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,239
ORTHOPEDICS, PROCTOLOGY CLINIC

787
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,830
Why would you bring
a female employee in here?

788
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,002
What do you mean a female employee?
I'm the operations manager.

789
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,378
Get out right now!

790
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:17,848
-Why did you want us all the way in here?
-Every catcher suffers from hemorrhoids.

791
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,057
I wanted you to look.

792
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,861
Why do you keep looking?
Stop watching now.

793
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,614
I told you to stop.
Why do you keep looking?

794
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,991
Cover it now.

795
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,414
Table seven has become
a negotiating table.

796
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,958
It's hot even without fire.

797
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,217
BASEBALL PLAYER CONTRACT, 50 MILLION WON

798
00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:00,348
It's just our circumstance that's bad.
It doesn't mean we don't need you.

799
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,103
You're in too good of a condition
to retire, to be honest.

800
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,273
Every player is sick.

801
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,652
We just don't show it
because we won't be used otherwise.

802
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,947
I only learned about baseball
and the Dreams recently,

803
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,951
but I study its history
to know more about the team.

804
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,954
Remember when the team won second place?

805
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,167
You were behind its heyday.

806
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,668
You see,

807
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:33,590
it'll be a shame if people remember you
as a nine days' wonder.

808
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,970
It would've been nice
if I had retired after then.

809
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,056
What?

810
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,267
It's true I'm not like how I used to be.

811
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,355
I think I've come to my end.

812
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,610
I'll retire.

813
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,962
Why don't we treat your thumb next time?

814
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,132
-Come after a week.
-Okay, thank you.

815
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:21,012
After one season ends, I get treated
and start training again...

816
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:26,184
because I have to put up
with my pain next season.

817
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,813
This is why I'm demanding 500 million won.
Make a new contract.

818
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,985
Mr. Seo, let's go talk at a cafe
or something.

819
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,487
Sorry. I have a family meeting to attend.

820
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,949
We can have a drink later if you'd like.

821
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,285
You shouldn't drink
when you're under treatment.

822
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,369
You're frustrating.

823
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,038
I need my heart treated too.

824
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,124
See you later.

825
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,380
That jerk.

826
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,467
Hi.

827
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,471
Yes.

828
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,225
Okay, Jae-hee. You made an effort.

829
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,895
Go back safely to the office.

830
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,651
Mr. Jang Jin-woo wishes to retire.

831
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,740
I see. Let's go.

832
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,378
Let's have all your players
sign their contracts today.

833
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,216
-I guess you're in a rush.
-We can't put this off forever.

834
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,762
Then tell me how much you offer.
The gap was just too big last time.

835
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,680
Okay.

836
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,699
Well,

837
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,786
it's not easy to narrow the gap.

838
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,123
Is that right?

839
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,001
You must be confused,

840
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,212
having to negotiate
with other players too.

841
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,090
Finalize your negotiations
with them first.

842
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,008
Let's talk again then.

843
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,222
Mr. Ko...

844
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,142
Se-hyuk.

845
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,816
If you decline this offer,
I won't ever offer the same amount.

846
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:40,860
Don't skip any meals.

847
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,457
If the players saw this amount,

848
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,376
they would've agreed to it.

849
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:00,880
Now I know what his intention is
and just how to deal with him.

850
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,549
Yes.

851
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,050
Oh, right.

852
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:11,016
I got a text from Seo Yeong-ju.
He wants to have a drink with us later.

853
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,393
Come in.

854
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,359
Have you been well?

855
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,570
-Yes, thanks to you.
-Have a seat.

856
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,121
Mr. Ko, you've always been...

857
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,333
like clear water.

858
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,667
Me?

859
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,337
When you were the scout team leader,

860
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,382
people said that you deserved
to be a coach

861
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,592
or a general manager.

862
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,680
You hurt our feelings and left.

863
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,849
Now you've become an agent?

864
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,770
Come to think of it,

865
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:01,649
you're like water
because you suit any position.

866
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,819
And you're like clear water

867
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,946
because you're transparent.

868
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,117
About the salary negotiations,

869
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:15,580
Mr. Baek won't back down
that easily, right?

870
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,210
You just have to insist on not signing
your players' contracts.

871
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:26,299
I injured my finger when I was a player,
so I'm bad at signing.

872
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,846
People will start talking
if the negotiations don't go smoothly.

873
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:37,435
What will happen if the negotiations
aren't finalized until spring training?

874
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,773
People will lose faith in Mr. Baek.

875
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,943
He will try to take responsibility
and resign.

876
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,319
In that case,

877
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,905
we will need someone

878
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,324
to fill his place.

879
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,576
Someone...

880
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,745
like clear water.

881
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,874
You must be going through a lot
in order to cleanse the Dreams.

882
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,394
Cheers.

883
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,695
They're here.

884
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,322
Come join us.

885
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,908
We can't talk in this atmosphere.
Let's talk later.

886
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,286
Be considerate of me.

887
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,621
I'm a busy man. Let's talk here.

888
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,332
Don't you think
it's going to be a bit uncomfortable?

889
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,834
-Wait outside.
-No.

890
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,630
I'm the operations manager.
It's my job to have him sign the contract.

891
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:53,928
-What about the contract?
-The 500 million won is not an option.

892
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,306
Why are you drinking hard liquor
when you have hemorrhoids?

893
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,813
Take a seat first.
Stay outside for a second, girls.

894
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,375
So 500 million won isn't an option.

895
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,262
Will this help you understand how it feels
to have water on your knees?

896
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,227
You might bring me a new contract
if you can emphasize with me.

897
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,696
You're insane.

898
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:58,952
-Hey, you. You just crossed the line.
-You are the one who crossed the line!

899
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,118
What are you trying to get
out of the negotiation?

900
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,329
His purpose is to give Mr. Baek
a hard time regardless of the price.

901
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,998
A deal that satisfies us more.

902
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,918
-We don't intend to make more offers.
-I guess negotiations aren't going well.

903
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,379
-Who are you eyeing from my team?
-He's desperate.

904
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,715
Why does everything you do
create a commotion?

905
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,883
-Is it about Gil Chang-ju's...
-He's capable.

906
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,554
You're way too rude.

907
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,764
But we don't need someone like that.
