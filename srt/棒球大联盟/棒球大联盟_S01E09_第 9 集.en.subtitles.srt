1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,324
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,492
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY

3
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,832
All right. Attention.

4
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,418
Stop what you're doing and gather around.

5
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,878
Hurry!

6
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,382
Director Kwon.

7
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,389
Everyone.

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,895
A colleague who occupied that room
in the corner over there

9
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,314
has left our company.

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,236
But Mr. Baek didn't lose face.

11
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,409
The process of recruiting Mr. Gil,
who tarnished our club's reputation,

12
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,872
and using his position to facilitate
corruption in recruitment

13
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,042
provide enough grounds for his dismissal.

14
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,877
Later. Go protest later.

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,462
There was no corruption involved.

16
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,631
Why is he bringing up
Gil Chang-ju's recruitment now?

17
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,258
Are you going to fight the owner's nephew
in front of everyone?

18
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,928
But this is all wrong.

19
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,013
Is justification more important?

20
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,933
The process is more important
at the company.

21
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,811
But we worried about Mr. Baek's future.

22
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,230
We allowed him to resign voluntarily

23
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:49,192
and will give him his pay
until he finds another job.

24
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,611
He's quite a character.

25
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,655
Why is he saying that here?

26
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,865
Before we find a new general manager,

27
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,201
I'm sure your workload
will be more demanding,

28
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,912
but I ask of you to continue working hard.

29
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,668
We can fill in
the empty space of one person.

30
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,672
Where is the general manager?

31
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,383
I wouldn't know.

32
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,723
It's unjust to hold him responsible

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,475
for Mr. Gil at this point.

34
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,396
And also, the recruitment process
of Baek Young-soo was fair.

35
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,897
Even Yoo Kyung-taek

36
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,732
knew him beforehand.

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,570
-They did know him, but--
-I understand, Ms. Lee.

38
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,157
Worry about getting the team
back on track.

39
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,286
I don't exactly know
what you say you're understanding.

40
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,999
I understand what you're feeling
about Mr. Baek.

41
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,503
So get out and worry about getting
the team back to normal.

42
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,507
Ms. Lee, you're
the temporary general manager.

43
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,718
Why me?

44
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,058
If I leave without being
able to understand what's going on,

45
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,977
I can't serve as interim general manager

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,313
or worry about getting
the team back on track.

47
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,108
Mr. Baek agreed to this compromise,

48
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,861
and we are allowing
his brother to work here.

49
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,738
If you start to act like this,

50
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,200
who do you think will see
the most damage if you do this?

51
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,996
What are you going to do
if his brother gets fired as well?

52
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,212
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

53
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,548
MR. BAEK

54
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,973
Your call could not be connected and...

55
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,108
Hello?

56
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,528
What?

57
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,157
No, it's not determined.

58
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,951
I'm going to handle it.

59
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,580
How did you know about what's
going on in our club?

60
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:10,959
What?

61
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,588
-Sir.
-Why?

62
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,841
Don't you have any companionship
for a colleague?

63
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,595
What kind of power do I have?

64
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,223
How does an article regarding
his voluntary resignation come out

65
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,975
ten minutes after he left?

66
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,774
-Unless you prepared it in advance.
-That's what we do with the athletes.

67
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,985
That's what we do with the athletes.

68
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,195
Why can't we do that
with the general manager?

69
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,117
We can also be fired like this.

70
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,745
If I didn't spread the news,
it could have happened to me.

71
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,708
Yes.

72
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,752
So you did it...

73
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,755
because they told you to.

74
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,485
I'm going back to tell him.

75
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,448
Firing the general manager
like this is unjust.

76
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,951
The rest of you...

77
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,748
are going to stay still, right?

78
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,837
I know the general manager isn't kind.

79
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,632
But when it came to his attitude
and skills,

80
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,676
is there anyone here who was disappointed?

81
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,219
Or...

82
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,140
does anyone think this is just?

83
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,611
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK SEUNG-SOO

84
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,746
I'm busy.

85
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,628
You were here.
Why haven't you answered my calls?

86
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,213
Because I was busy.

87
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,007
Do you know what has happened?

88
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,848
You knew, but why are you here?

89
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,184
I'm trying to let go of what's on my mind.

90
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,730
Are you going to accept all of this?

91
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,483
You can leave or stay here quietly.

92
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,527
What do you want to do?

93
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,803
In this flash drive, I've put some data

94
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,597
because I thought
I'd be working here for a long time.

95
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,891
Please deliver it
to the new general manager.

96
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,979
Are you just going to quit like this?

97
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
To be honest,

98
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,455
seeing the Dreams get last place
without any awareness

99
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,124
of the severity, I once thought
of the team as fat pigs.

100
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,794
But I don't think they go that far.

101
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,005
At times,

102
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,424
they work hard,

103
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,678
compared to what I expected
looking at them always getting last place.

104
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,679
Also, at times...

105
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,852
they showed that they were
willing to sweat and work hard.

106
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,689
And it was good to see.

107
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,319
And please be the interim general manager.

108
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,696
I don't want to.

109
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,408
You aren't my superior anymore.
Why should I listen to your order?

110
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,869
-You'll just be an interim one.
-Still.

111
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,581
If Director Kwon Kyung-min gives an order,
am I not allowed to even say no?

112
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:23,294
The only thing that I agreed on
with Director Kwon as I left was this.

113
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,964
It's Director Kwon's order.

114
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,384
It's also my last authority.

115
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,729
I have no feelings and attachment
to the Dreams.

116
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,232
I just worked hard because it was my job.

117
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,983
Now that I see it,

118
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,029
I think I should've done this
from the start.

119
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,118
He has done nothing wrong.
Why is he being relegated?

120
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,828
To a Korean wrestling team at that?

121
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,998
They thought that he messed up
after his brother got injured.

122
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,166
He doesn't even have
any relation to sports.

123
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,251
Exactly.

124
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,753
I heard the Korean wrestling team
is breaking up soon.

125
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,067
You have other measures planned, right?

126
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,904
You have other plans, right?

127
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,241
I'm sure you'll return
and surprise everyone. Right?

128
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,911
I have no reason to do that.
I'll get my pay even without working.

129
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,830
You're not working just because of money.

130
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,082
I work because of money.

131
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,544
A person who works only for money
wouldn't work this hard.

132
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,547
Why did you give us hope
in the first place then?

133
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,472
There are people who do everything
to the extreme.

134
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,894
And I don't think I'll get a good result
just by working hard.

135
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,398
It never happened.

136
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,568
There have been good results.
You've been winning all this time.

137
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,785
Thank you for seeing me out.

138
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,012
The way the general manager handled things
was a bit rough.

139
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,597
What's rough about it?

140
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,642
He should know how to conform
to things in life.

141
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,520
He can't talk that way
in front of the director.

142
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,817
But does he work all right?

143
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,027
Yes, he's good.

144
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,322
If he's good, he should be
working in another franchise.

145
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:42,451
-We knew about it when we hired him.
-Yes. Even so,

146
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,870
when things turned out to be like this,

147
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,998
shouldn't they have
decided to quit together?

148
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,252
Let's get back. We should get to work.

149
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,171
I mean, what's the reason he's still here
when he knows

150
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,466
-how we feel about this?
-I said, let's get back!

151
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,592
Let me get to work.

152
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,762
You...

153
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,975
We're here to discuss the Rule 5 draft.

154
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,977
As you all know,

155
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,020
Mr. Baek has quit.

156
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,858
Poor guy. Why did he have
to deal with it that way?

157
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,317
He started all of this.

158
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,902
What do we do now?

159
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,571
My gosh.

160
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,283
I'll be in charge of the matter
temporarily.

161
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,453
I brought the coaches to hear
about the players.

162
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,664
You should decide
on the 40-man roster first.

163
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,709
Here's the list of our players I've made.

164
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,546
Why isn't Yoo Sung-gu on the list?
He's been first string for years.

165
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,674
He took an active part
as a mop-up player last year.

166
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,176
His ERA has been similar every year,

167
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
whereas his left on base percentage
increased.

168
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,889
Among the candidates
to make it to the list,

169
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,516
the strategy analysis team recommends
these players.

170
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,435
This is a bit strange.

171
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,686
Hey, Kyung-taek.

172
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,564
Are you trying to show
that you're working?

173
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,733
This goes against common sense
in the field.

174
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,527
No, it goes against the opinions
of the coaching staff.

175
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,364
And please refrain from speaking
so casually if you're not the manager.

176
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,617
You don't get to do that
just because you're my superior.

177
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,661
But you...

178
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,413
Who are you?

179
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,499
He's in charge of data
in the strategy analysis team.

180
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,334
Oh, the general manager's brother?

181
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,420
His name is Baek Young-soo.

182
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,214
He's worked
for a baseball column website...

183
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,548
That's all right.

184
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,008
I'm sick of hearing that.

185
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,470
Then he should keep writing columns.

186
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,848
Are we supposed to listen to
his orders then?

187
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,145
This is a mess.

188
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,188
Excuse me.

189
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,107
I don't think even Mr. Baek
would have done this.

190
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,277
I like that you're trying new things...

191
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,030
but I'm not sure about this.

192
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,950
Good meeting, everyone.

193
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,341
You must be taken aback
by what happened suddenly.

194
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,011
My brother called me.

195
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,681
He said he'd kill me if I quit.

196
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,517
Does he say those things to his brother?

197
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,521
In situations like these, I feel
like he still doesn't know me yet.

198
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,981
Why would I quit?

199
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,027
If we were to both walk out of here,

200
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,279
we'd look like trash.

201
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,576
A guy who hired his younger brother
and quit after he got caught,

202
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,288
and another guy who coveted
someone else's position.

203
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,540
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

204
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,335
ROBERT GIL

205
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,047
The president left work.

206
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,466
-When?
-Just a moment ago.

207
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:09,950
Mr. Gil?

208
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,745
-Yes?
-It is you.

209
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,496
The one who was naturalized.

210
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,832
-Who are you?
-I'm the acting owner of the club.

211
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,127
-Are you the one that fired Mr. Baek?
-Yes.

212
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,879
Please retract it.

213
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,131
Oh, my.
With what authority do you say that?

214
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,716
It was all my fault.

215
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,552
I was careless during the interview and...

216
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,888
And?

217
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,724
I've lived a wrongful life.

218
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,310
I've lived a wrongful life...

219
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,522
and Mr. Baek is paying for it.

220
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,819
It seems like you're indebted to Mr. Baek.

221
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,072
Let me suggest a better way.

222
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,034
When the season begins,

223
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,787
play baseball really well.

224
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,914
That's how you repay it.

225
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,248
Then...

226
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,709
will you bring back Mr. Baek?

227
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,753
No.

228
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,965
In the future,

229
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,510
you can look back and think, "He was...

230
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,013
a pretty good general manager."

231
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,182
Wouldn't that be enough?

232
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,351
Let's go.

233
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,296
In this flash drive,

234
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,634
I've put some data, because I thought
I'd be working here for a long time.

235
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,137
Please deliver it
to the new general manager.

INCOMING CALL

242
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,894
What's up?

243
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,187
What is it?

244
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,442
I almost gave up...

245
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,654
but when I opened this flash drive,

246
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,822
I had to come.

247
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,367
Is there a problem with it?
You may just refer to it.

248
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,328
For someone to quit so easily,

249
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,830
you had a dream too big.

250
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,833
It's a plan to win.

251
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,003
Everything in that USB stick...

252
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,004
Yes.

253
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,924
Is there anyone who works
without establishing such a goal?

254
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,676
I know we don't speak kindly
to each other,

255
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,180
but I thought we had built camaraderie.

256
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,266
We'll work with you.

257
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,560
Resume your seat, General Manager Baek.

258
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,231
Don't call me the general manager.
Just call me Baek Seung-soo.

259
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,318
Just ask for our help, please.

260
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,530
We can only do something
if you have the will.

261
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,948
No.

262
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,325
Do what you can for the Dreams.

263
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,536
You're so...

264
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,416
I have been guaranteed my salary.

265
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,211
Why would you say something so pathetic?

266
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,588
It's the perfect time
for me to look for other jobs

267
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,632
while being guaranteed my salary.

268
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,969
The Dreams is a team that you love.

269
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,972
You once called the Dreams
fat pigs, right?

270
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,348
Don't be ridiculous.

271
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,434
That was when I...

272
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,854
I know you're a capable man.

273
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,857
But you're only good at solving
problems before your eyes.

274
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,360
A pig can also
eat the food before its eyes well.

275
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,238
Insulting me won't change my mind.

276
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,615
I wasn't capable of doing so,

277
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,828
but I had a certain goal
of making the Dreams a strong team.

278
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,122
What is your goal?

279
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,416
Is it your salary?

280
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,042
Yes.

281
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,590
I merely came to the Dreams
because they offered me a high salary.

282
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,051
Is it wrong to consider money important?

283
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,138
So you've fulfilled your goal.

284
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:49,062
My goal is in my hands to fulfill now.

285
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:55,110
Thank you for letting me have big dreams,
even for a while.

286
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,446
Baek Seung-soo.

287
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,266
What are you doing, Mom?

288
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,684
Can't you see?

289
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,479
Go wash your hands
and help me gut these anchovies.

290
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,856
What was your goal?

291
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,984
It wasn't to take out the guts
of anchovies, at least.

292
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,614
-Then how did you end up like this?
-Because gutted anchovies are pricey.

293
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,116
I mean,

294
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,620
why did you give up on your goal in life?

295
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,581
Are you going to take the guts out or not?

-Let's go out.
-Okay.

299
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,721
Try some.

300
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,973
I ate on my way.

301
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,184
Are you sure?

302
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,820
Why didn't you eat dinner until now?

303
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,990
Kyung-chul's dad offered me
some rice cakes.

304
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,784
I didn't have an appetite because of it.

305
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,122
I'll come more often from now on.

306
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,502
Is something wrong?

307
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,048
I just...

308
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,175
got fired.

309
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,387
I thought it was something serious.

310
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,431
This is serious.

311
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,892
It's not serious
as long as you're healthy and sound.

312
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,104
You got fired, so why didn't you get
some rest instead of coming here?

313
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,858
When would I come
if not at a time like this?

314
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,571
I'm telling you.

315
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,448
I came here to rest.

316
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,616
That's why I came.

317
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,912
APPROVAL NEEDED

318
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,507
This needs to be approved
by the general manager,

319
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,718
but is it right that I give this to you?

320
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,220
Yes, I'll take a look at it.

321
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,223
GENERAL MANAGER: LEE SE-YOUNG

322
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,309
This one is from the PR team.

323
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,560
What?

324
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,646
He seems to find it difficult
to be around you

325
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,857
after getting a scolding from you.

326
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,902
You don't need to.

327
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,740
Hold on. What is that?

328
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,075
I need the approval
of the manager on this.

329
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,704
I'll take a look at it if it's
regarding the operations team.

330
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,289
Do you have a death wish?

331
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,918
-What?
-You aren't experienced enough

332
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,836
to check what needs the approval
of the manager?

333
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,880
You even skipped lunch because of work.

334
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,174
I'm eating the sandwich you gave me.

335
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,719
Thanks for your concern,
but don't be presumptuous.

336
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,936
Is there anything I can help you with?

337
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,604
Just do your job.

338
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,859
Seung-soo.

339
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,070
Seung-soo.

340
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,071
Yes.

341
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,865
You must be tired.

342
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,076
No, it's because I drove here.

343
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,704
-You should go see your father.
-Right.

344
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,831
Let's go, Mother.

345
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,803
Seung-soo is here.

346
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,525
You brat.

347
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,653
You came after such a long time,
so he forgot your face.

348
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,913
Father.

349
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,623
I'm here.

350
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,215
He will be back to his senses
later in the afternoon.

351
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,765
We've received a list of players
who we can pick from other clubs

352
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,435
in the Rule 5 draft.

353
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,979
Please take a look at it first.

354
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,106
Just go with Shin Min-kwang.

355
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,150
The middle relief pitcher of the Pelicans.

356
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,360
-And Cha Dong-joo.
-Shin Min-kwang is better.

357
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,071
As for that player, his performances
are getting worse steadily

358
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,865
after his surgery four years ago.

359
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,660
His strength is his fastball, but
its spin rate is dropping more and more.

360
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,246
We should lower our expectations
this year.

361
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,207
Instead, I recommend
Kim Se-in of the Whales,

362
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,834
who sometimes plays as a replacement.

363
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,463
His defense rate is a bit high,
but if you look at his performances at--

364
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,923
Why did you call us here
if you were going to be like this?

365
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,137
We invited you over
so we could share opinions.

366
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,765
Not to write down your opinions.

367
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,351
It's absurd to dispute our opinions

368
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,603
with computer results
like records and performances.

369
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,649
And you. Have you seen players
throw a ball from up close?

370
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,109
Forget that talk about the spin rate.

371
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,862
Can you take their pitches
in the batter's box?

372
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,114
What are you doing?

373
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,284
I'm okay, ma'am.

374
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,037
Ms. Lee. I think it's better we just go.

375
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,456
Yes, if you're going to talk like this.

376
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:51,086
When you made mistakes
when devising your strategy,

377
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,130
changing pitchers, or using replacements,

378
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,841
-did we ever criticize you?
-Why you little...

379
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,387
I have agreed with his opinion.

380
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,349
Say that I haven't seen players
from up close!

381
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,892
Hey!

382
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,269
You're crossing the line.

383
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,314
Coaches.

384
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,066
Please leave.

385
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,486
Let us hear who you'll pick before we go.

386
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,613
No, which position will you pick?

387
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,075
Tell them.

388
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,704
In terms of positions,

389
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,165
we're planning to pick three outfielders.

390
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,585
You're terribly bad at your work.

391
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,838
Are you clueless
about what kind of position we need

392
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,131
unless we tell you?

393
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,383
If so, listen to us, you jerks.

394
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,302
You agreed with this?

395
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,681
-Yes.
-Impressive.

396
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,560
We'll go.

397
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,811
Well,

398
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,605
the others might figure out
our plan too easily.

399
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,693
So we're thinking of picking
skilled players, not needed players.

400
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,404
We'll use those players as trade cards.

401
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,327
There are good outfielders
on the list this time.

402
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,539
If you look at the two rounds,

403
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,709
the franchises that need outfielders
have what we really want.

404
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:17,046
They have strong backup pitchers
and backup infielders.

405
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,801
According to the recent trend in trading,
franchises are more drastic

406
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:26,556
in trading backup players
instead of major players.

407
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,850
There's also a recent example.

408
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,519
Kim Eun-dong was the third-ranked
outfielder of the Sabers,

409
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,481
but he became a key player
of the Red Hawks.

410
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,681
THE VIEW POINT OF THE RULE 5 DRAFT
WITH VARIOUS NEW STRATEGIES

411
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,895
THE RULE 5 DRAFT HAS BEEN
INTRODUCED IN 2011.

412
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,026
A person who works only for money
wouldn't work this hard.

413
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,778
Why did you give us hope
in the first place?

414
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,446
It's a plan to win.

415
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,907
Everything in that USB stick...

416
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,869
You made it to win the league.

417
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,051
2019 KPB DRAFT

418
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,642
Today, we won't lose more than two players

419
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,436
and pick the players on our list. Got it?

420
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,772
Got it.

421
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,152
Then let's pray to the god
each of us believes in. Go.

422
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:08,783
-Please help the Dreams
-Give us strength...

423
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,911
pick the players we want...

424
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,417
-Let's go.
-Okay.

425
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,964
2019 KPB DRAFT

426
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,758
-Please check this for me.
-Okay.

427
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,305
Gosh. It must've already begun.

428
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,056
What has begun?

429
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,853
Why do you worry about the Rule 5 draft?

430
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,688
I don't worry about it.

431
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:43,151
Even if we pick decent players,
it won't change anything.

432
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,986
But it'd be nice if the results
come out well

433
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,905
as it's the first event since
the manager left.

434
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,950
2019 KPB DRAFT

435
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,677
-Hello, Ms. Lee.
-Hello.

436
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,307
So, what happened to Mr. Baek?

437
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,893
Well, it just went that way.

438
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,938
Of course, it's not something
I should put my nose into,

439
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,606
but I feel sorry for him.

440
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,275
He doesn't even answer his phone.

441
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,487
He will when he's ready.
You can talk to him then.

442
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,822
-Right. And...
-Yes?

443
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:34,077
Are you going to use
Jang Il-sun and Lee Han-ju?

444
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,245
That's why we picked them.

445
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,166

446
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,336
Goodness. Come on. Again?

447
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,089
You're no different from Mr. Baek.

448
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,175
Everyone knows you picked them
to trade out.

449
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,928
Still, we should meet
at the negotiation table later.

450
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,638
Sure.

451
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,350
Oh, he is...

452
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,351
Yes.

453
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,729
This is Baek Young-soo, who played
the most pivotal role today.

454
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,693
Then, I'll see you later.

455
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,403
Congratulations.

456
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,696
Goodbye.

457
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,749
-Yes!
-Yes!

458
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,501
2019 KPB DRAFT

459
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:27,964
Me too.

460
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:37,181
ALL EXPERTS SAY THE DREAMS
ARE THE WINNER OF THE RULE 5 DRAFT.

461
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,440
-We didn't lose any players...
-Right!

462
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,776
and picked two hitters and one pitcher
we can use right away.

463
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,694
Right!

464
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,573
-So, everything here is on me...
-If you don't have a death wish, sit down.

465
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,866
I will.

466
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,912
You all worked hard
in this adverse situation.

467
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,582
We don't know what awaits us,

468
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,877
but let's prepare passionately
for the coming season

469
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,463
so the Dreams can play until it gets cold!

470
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,764
You did a great job. Help yourself.

471
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,518
Thank you.

472
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:23,978
Dig in.

473
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,818
Right. Young-soo,

474
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,238
I'm not sure if I can ask you this.

475
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,698
You can't.

476
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,368
It's about Mr. Baek.

477
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,331
He takes photos of food every time
he eats. Why does he do that?

478
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,042
That is...

479
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,337
to send to Mom.

480
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,215
Come on. That's not funny.

481
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,842
Isn't it to send to his girlfriend?

482
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,094
Why?

483
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,972
I thought you've been eating
well these days,

484
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,974
but why do you look even thinner?

485
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,437
You want me to stop nagging, right?

486
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,232
No, please go ahead.

487
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,611
And you don't need to send photos anymore.

488
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,947
But I'll keep sending them.

489
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,075
He feels relieved when Mom worries
about him eating well.

490
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,662
Okay. Keep sending them.

491
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,247
Never miss a single time.

492
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,460
"Mom is still doing fine."

493
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,673
"She's in such good condition
that she even worries about us."

494
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,717
That's how he explains it
about sending those pictures.

495
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,427
By the way,

496
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,347
how long do you plan to stay here?

497
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,474
I just want to rest a bit longer.

498
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,643
If you want to rest, do it somewhere else.

499
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,062
You can go on a trip
or stay at your place.

500
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,067
If you stay at rock bottom too long,
you can't get back up.

501
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,487
It's time to return and work hard.

502
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,699
I still get paid even though I don't work.

503
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,995
And there's nothing to do
even if I go back.

504
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,080
But I don't want you to stay here.

505
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,084
He thinks he's responsible for my injury

506
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,378
because he made me do baseball.

507
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,047
But that was an accident.

508
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,426
When I got injured,

509
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,304
our father had a stroke.

510
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,770
Seung-soo thinks he's to blame
for that too.

511
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,983
He quietly quit
so that he could get his salary.

512
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,610
And it's not like him.

513
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,405
But considering the situation
he's in, he had no choice.

514
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,742
He can never save enough money
to pay for the medical bills.

515
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,873
He paid Father's medical bills alone...

516
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,795
and even paid my tuition,
since he wanted me to have...

517
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,342
a decent and comfortable job.

518
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,637
After our father had a stroke,

519
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,807
the company he'd been working for
suggested he should retire.

520
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,060
Why did it do that?

521
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,896
He was totally out of his mind,

522
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,315
and anyone could tell.

523
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,861
They thought he'd cause big trouble.

524
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,949
CONGRATULATIONS
ON WINNING THE TEAM COMPETITION

525
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,076
So even though he knew nothing
about Korean wrestling,

526
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,454
they sent him to a Korean wrestling club
that was about to be disbanded.

527
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,998
And that's how he started
his career in this field.

528
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,709
5H SHINHEUNG CONSTRUCTION
KOREAN WRESTING TEAM

529
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,255
In the meantime,
I'd been sponging off of him

530
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,839
up until now.

531
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,893
Then, all his teams were disbanded,

532
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,814
and no one ever defended Mr. Baek.

533
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,151
No one.

534
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,551
Come with me.

535
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,553
Get your hand off me.

536
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,895
I don't know what humiliation is
since I have no honor to lose.

537
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,188
Are you the same?

538
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,152
Read it.

539
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,622
Check how the news coverage
ruined an innocent guy's life

540
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,166
with your own eyes.

541
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,126
Do you want me to cover this?

542
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,174
I just edited the interview
with Gil Chang-ju a little.

543
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,968
-About Baek Young-soo, other newspapers--
-I know.

544
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,013
We'll hold a press conference for this.

545
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,770
You'd better think
about what you can do about this.

546
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,950
They're here.

547
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,175
Thank you for your presence
despite your busy schedule.

548
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:54,016
We're here to explain about the rumor
of the Dreams' illicit recruitment.

549
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,185
That's why we invited you here.

550
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,188
We were not aware

551
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,650
that the applicant was the brother
of General Manager Baek

552
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,443
before we interviewed him.

553
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,195
Also, General Manager Baek

554
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,572
gave him the lowest points.

555
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,076
However, I and the strategy
analysis team leader gave him full marks.

556
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,872
We recruited the applicant
with the highest points

557
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,666
according to the regulations.

558
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,796
And that is how the controversy
was triggered.

559
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,677
What was the purpose
of the press conference? Huh?

560
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,721
You. Why bring those busy reporters and--

561
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,308
I merely got back
the reputation of our club.

562
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,145
It's all over
with Baek Seung-soo's resignation!

563
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,148
It was not a matter for which
someone had to take responsibility.

564
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,484
And revealing the truth was
more important to me.

565
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,944
What?

566
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,863
You're so...

567
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,785
Father, I'll come by another time.

568
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,458
Have some coffee
when you feel sleepy while driving.

569
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,584
Yes.

570
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,590
Why didn't you come
with your wife and the baby?

571
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,717
What are you talking about?

572
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,386
Go ahead, Seung-soo.
There's going to be traffic.

573
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,180
Hasn't she given birth yet?

574
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,640
Let's go.

575
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,350
Go on now.

576
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,769
Yes.

577
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,334
OPERATING ROOM

578
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,174
I'm sorry.

579
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,731
Is Mom doing okay with Dad?

580
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,025
Yes.

581
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,737
I should visit them soon.
I've only been calling them.

582
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,990
You've done well.

583
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:57,950
What?

584
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,831
I'm not going to tell you again.

585
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,551
This is Kim Young-chae
of Baseball Is Life.

586
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:19,722
Yesterday, the Rule 5 draft
that happens every two years was held.

587
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,932
People have been saying

588
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,560
that the Dreams are the winner
of the Rule 5 draft.

589
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,937
Their fans seem very satisfied
with the result.

590
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,441
We predicted that the Dreams
would be filling the positions

591
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,776
-that they're weak on.
-Yes.

592
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,695
But surprisingly, they designated

593
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,905
the star players that we weren't
expecting to be named

594
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,741
instead of focusing
on their weak positions.

595
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,952
Along with Kang Doo-ki and Kim Kwan-sik,

596
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,580
we've been told that Gil Chang-ju
is throwing some strong pitches.

597
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,041
People are saying that they have
become a solid team.

598
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:51,086
The person who had contributed
the most in this Rule 5 draft

599
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,297
is known to be an acquaintance
of Baek Seung-soo

600
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,090
that was recently recruited.

601
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:59,470
According to the news we've just received,
the analyst was

602
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,597
a columnist specializing
in dealing with data

603
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,143
on a certain baseball website
under the pen name of Robinson.

604
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,687
THE SHOCKING CAREER
OF BAEK SEUNG-SOO'S BROTHER

605
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,523
BAEK SEUNG-SOO'S BROTHER WAS
SURROUNDED BY CONTROVERSY.

606
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,484
THIS IS DONATING TALENT,
NOT WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT.

607
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,903
-IT'S A BASEBALL FAMILY.
-IS ROBINSON THAT GOOD?

608
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,988
-COME BACK, BAEK SEUNG-SOO.
-YOU HIRED ROBINSON?

609
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,698
WHO TOLD HIM TO RESIGN?

610
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,582
Hello?

611
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,376
Yes.

612
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:31,960
Yes.

613
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,172
All right.

614
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,549
Yes.

615
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:50,062
I'd like to apologize once again
that you had to be criticized

616
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,481
for a mistake that we made
during the process of editing.

617
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,150
No, it's fine.

618
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,071
I heard you have something
that you'd like to say

619
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,907
on our program.

620
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,242
Yes.

621
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,496
It's because Baseball Is Life is
the program that most baseball fans watch.

622
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:11,083
Until now, I have given
the sense of deprivation

623
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,921
to a lot of people due to the issue
with my nationality and everything else.

624
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,965
And I've worried a lot of people.

625
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,844
I decided to stop being a coward.

626
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,556
I've talked to the Military
Manpower Administration,

627
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,268
and they told me I could recover
my nationality after this season...

628
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,938
by joining the army
as an active-duty soldier.

629
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,109
I'll commit to the Dreams this season,

630
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,027
and enlist in the army...

631
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,614
to become a proud husband

632
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,617
and a proud father.

633
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,578
A proud father?

634
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,416
We had a son recently.

635
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,335
Congratulations.

636
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,965
In fact, Mr. Baek and I had concluded
that I should join the army

637
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,760
and recover my nationality after a season.

638
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:08,474
I feel sorry and grateful...

639
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,185
to General Manager Baek.

640
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,565
The solutions are improvements
in the downtown duty-free shop,

641
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,026
improvements in the business hotel,

642
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,445
and changing the locations
of the luxury brands.

643
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,780
CHAIRMAN

644
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,663
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

645
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,001
Then why didn't you show your intention

646
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,837
of enlisting in the army
at the press conference?

647
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:43,592
If you had at the time, public opinion
wouldn't have gotten this bad.

648
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,844
I wasn't brave enough.

649
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,012
BAEK SEUNG-SOO

650
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,097
I also needed some time to think.

651
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,100
There is absolutely no fault...

652
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,020
on the part of General Manager Baek.

653
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,272
Hello?

654
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,275
What's going on?
Why would Mr. Gil join the army?

655
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,236
Let's meet up first.

656
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,739
Yes, I'll send you the address.
I'll see you there.

657
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,117
Are you seeing someone? What does he do?

658
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,287
-He's unemployed.
-Unemployed?

659
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,497
That's a bit...

660
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,208
Is he an earnest man?

661
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,255
Fine. At least you're seeing someone,
even though he's unemployed.

662
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,927
How did this happen?

663
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,391
I found out at the same time you did.

664
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,603
What's going to happen to his family
if he suddenly joins the army?

665
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:41,900
For the sake of Gil Chang-ju,
it's not such a bad decision.

666
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:47,322
He must have wanted
to be an honorable father.

667
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,493
But do you think that was the only reason?

668
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,329
Just for a little bit,

669
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,959
don't you think he would have
not wanted to let you go

670
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,211
by yourself?

671
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,426
Please come back.

672
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:11,388
Are you saying I can come back
now that Mr. Gil is going away?

673
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,974
If you think about it rationally,

674
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,519
he's merely joining the army
a bit later than others.

675
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,147
Instead of feeling guilty about it,

676
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,400
feel responsible for our team,
and come back.

677
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,529
Will my return make any changes?

678
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:32,159
Why do you think
we've always been in last place?

679
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,579
Every time we try to seize
the opportunity,

680
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,083
the same opportunity
always drags us down.

681
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,503
Whenever we even think
of having some hope,

682
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,297
our hope vanishes right away.

683
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,843
We didn't have someone to prepare for it

684
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,762
or prevent it from happening.

685
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:58,185
So do you think I can prepare for it
and prevent it if I come back?

686
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,144
No.

687
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,147
I only want you to assist us.

688
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,817
Because we'll also give our best.

689
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,665
What?

690
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,126
Would you make it a bloody fight
by having me tell everyone

691
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,088
that you laid off a competent
general manager due to discord?

692
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,214
Or,

693
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,801
would you rather tell people that
you suggested convalescence

694
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,220
with a guaranteed salary
to the manager whose health failed,

695
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,932
but he came back as he felt
responsible for his team?

696
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,183
Please choose.

697
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,437
What nonsense are you talking about?
Why should I make such a choice?

698
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,648
Aren't you conscious
of what the locals think?

699
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,274
Aren't your profits based on the locals

700
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,276
and consumer goods
that are used in everyday life?

701
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,570
I wouldn't want to cause
damage to the firm

702
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,572
that's more costly
than running a baseball team.

703
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,740
Hey.

704
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,244
The public opinion is criticizing you

705
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,415
-for wrongful employment and--
-But this office looks really nice.

706
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,291
Don't you have Internet here?

707
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,545
Or are you pretending to be
ignorant of the public opinion?

708
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,671
Baek Seung-soo.

709
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,759
You were glad to leave when I told you
I'd guarantee your salary.

710
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,803
What's up with all this fuss now?

711
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,848
What do you want?

712
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,809
I just want to do what I came here for.

713
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,060
Winning the league.

714
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,022
You're crazy.

715
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,108
Listen carefully.

716
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,112
The chairman has called me anyway.

717
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,531
He wants you back.

718
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:37,909
But...

719
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,247
I'm going to disobey him
for the first time in my life.

720
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,750
You know, I have a strong sense of pride.

721
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,420
Stronger than you can imagine.

722
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,503
DREAMS

723
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,257
Surprise.

724
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:48,855
What on earth?

725
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,649
He could have said something.

726
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:56,488
Well, I guess he's full
just to see us eat...

727
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,199
He can't see us eat
if he goes in his office like that.

728
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,951
He also has a lot of work to do.

729
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,955
I mean, we tried so hard
to make him return.

730
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,124
He's so weird.

731
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,375
I apologize.

732
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,461
No.

733
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,963
That's not it.

734
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,465
I said it because I consider you
as our colleague.

735
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,884
It's not that I forgot
about your presence.

736
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,722
Congratulations, Mr. Baek.

737
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,644
Come in.

738
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,652
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes?

739
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,738
We'd like to hold a get-together
to celebrate your comeback today.

740
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,159
I can't make it. I have a lot of work
waiting to be done.

741
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,788
It's to celebrate your comeback,
but you won't be there.

742
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,207
Okay.

743
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,461
-Look.
-Yes?

744
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,721
Tell them I appreciate it.

745
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,769
Okay.

746
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,522
I'll make sure to do that.

747
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,926
I bought coffee beans
from my friend's store.

748
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,887
It tastes much better
than the one made with cat feces.

749
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:44,846
Thank you.

750
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:53,521
Mr. Baek came back just like that.

751
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,691
I'm worried if you are okay.

752
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,152
Oh, that.

753
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,365
The chairman wanted him back anyway.

754
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,450
The chairman?

755
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:14,376
But why are you in such a great mood?

756
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,545
Find a general manager who is stupider,

757
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,340
but more obedient than Baek Seung-soo.

758
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,759
But Mr. Baek returned.

759
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,303
He signed a new contract.

760
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,559
SALARY CONTRACT

761
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,731
THE CONTRACTEE WILL RESIGN VOLUNTARILY
ON MARCH 28TH, THE DAY OF OPENING GAME.

762
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,358
Resign voluntarily?

763
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,611
How should I stand
seeing his face until spring?

764
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,329
He said he's very grateful to us!

765
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,166
For Mr. Baek's comeback,

766
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,836
-cheers.
-Cheers.

767
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,340
Can you believe you wrote
that article in ten minutes?

768
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,635
Let's drink a couple shot.

769
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,643
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

770
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,188
Of all the days I've seen you,

771
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,232
you look the happiest today.

772
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:25,739
On a day like today,
I hope my brother enjoys it too.

773
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,656
Enjoys what?

774
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,202
The feeling that there are people
who protect him.

775
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,581
He isn't someone who has to protect
others all the time.

776
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,291
I hope he enjoys that feeling.

777
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,592
Mr. Baek.

778
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,971
I heard you came back.

779
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,307
Why did you do that?

780
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,938
-It was the right thing to do.
-You're a father.

781
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,108
You've got one more in your family
to be responsible for.

782
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,902
The first thing you would do

783
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,446
is to leave your family's side
for two years?

784
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,907
It's not like we're in the States.

785
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,035
My wife's parents
and my family are here in Korea.

786
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,913
I'm getting paid thanks to you too.

787
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,957
That is ridiculous.

788
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,502
You're responsible for your family.

789
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:21,878
Mr. Baek.

790
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,048
All my family

791
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,509
is so grateful to you.

792
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,389
My wife agreed to this too.

793
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,398
Mr. Baek.

794
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,068
I gave him my consent.
I told him to do it for sure.

795
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,535
He is our treasure.

796
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,665
Would you like to try holding him?

797
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,454
I can't...

798
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,001
hold babies.

799
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,010
He's beautiful.

800
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,637
Then hold him once.

801
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,431
I'm about to feel bad now.

802
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,142
Can someone like me...

803
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,857
dare to hold a baby?
