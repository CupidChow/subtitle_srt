1
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,491
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION,
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,201
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,746
It's a team that's bad at baseball
and has no future.

4
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,123
The Dreams might be ranked last
for over ten years,

5
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,499
even with new teams.

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,293
This is ridiculous. That lunatic.

7
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,253
How much would he know about baseball?

8
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,338
This isÂ Baek Seung-soo,
our new general manager.

9
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,717
I've helped handball, Korean wrestling,
and ice hockey teams to win.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,636
I'm not entirely well versed
in baseball, but I'll learn.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,430
He's a strange person.

12
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,432
I'll be trading Lim Dong-gyu.

13
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,727
He's the outfielder and fifth batter
of the national team.

14
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,938
Do you leave home
when your housekeeper says?

15
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,441
Why'd you trade a batter
as strong as Dong-gyu?

16
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,902
His average is .330,
but he has fewer game winners

17
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,111
than a player averaging .270.

18
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,614
He's not a hero when it comes to winning.

19
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,782
Fans won't let that happen.

20
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,533
Do you want to see everyone up in arms?

21
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,077
Why would they be?

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,412
Everyone was happy to have Kang Doo-ki.

23
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,831
-Kang Doo-ki?
-Doo-ki is the national team's pitcher.

24
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,291
Is the trade even possible?

25
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,459
The Dreams.

26
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,669
I've come!

27
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,547
You disappointed I managed
to do something difficult?

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,007
Why do you think I hired you?

29
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,886
Win and disband. Win and disband.

30
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,971
Just do what your experience says.

31
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,057
That's why next season,
look at the big picture.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,310
Whose responsibility is it to choose
the ten new players?

33
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,813
I think I need to find out.

34
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,358
You're only messing
with the stones firmly set in place.

35
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,110
I'm sure stones set in place
have more moss.

36
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,696
Why couldn't we ever pick
the Rookie of the Year?

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,989
That kind of hurt.

38
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,117
Do you trust Mr. Ko?

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,284
Yes, I do.

40
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,079
You're just being vague
and remaining a spectator.

41
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,747
You know Mr. Ko Se-hyuk, right?

42
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,748
How should I know him?

43
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,543
How much did you give to Mr. Ko?

44
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,585
I don't know. Just go!

45
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,464
Let's say I do something that tarnishes
the reputation of the Dreams.

46
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,841
I came to report something.

47
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,719
I think it's an unprecedented
pro team scouting scandal.

48
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,847
Mr. Ko, you're fired.

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,895
If you're a fan of the Dreams,

50
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,356
this news report
might make your heart sink.

51
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,025
Andy Gordon has been the ace of the team
for three years.

52
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,027
Mr. Baek.

53
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,737
Did you see the news about Andy?

54
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,781
We will give up Andy.

55
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,241
I'm going on a business trip.

56
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,242
Let's go.

57
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,131
It's 146.

58
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,723
It's 149 this time.

59
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,021
He's way better than Andy.

60
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,355
Awesome.

61
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,482
He's like Kang Doo-ki.

62
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,538
He says the price went up overnight.

63
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,969
It's 152.

64
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,180
Double the price all of a sudden?

65
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,640
No way.

66
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,793
It's 155 km/h.

67
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,848
Which team is it?

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,856
He says he won't tell us.

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,401
Tell him we'll be reconsidering
the conditions of the contract.

70
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,865
Tell him it'd be great if he
can state conditions they offered.

71
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,090
-What a jerk, that man.
-Seriously.

72
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,310
General Manager Kim Jong-moo.

73
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,687
Did you get in contact with Miles?

74
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,148
You didn't?

75
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,567
I understand.

76
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,403
I wish you the best of luck.
I'll see you in Korea.

77
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,362
Yes.

78
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,657
And so...

79
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,410
how much do you need?

80
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,496
A million dollars?

81
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,873
That's the maximum.

82
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,667
That's a bit too much.

83
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,463
Is he that good of a pitcher?

84
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,424
Okay.

85
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,594
I have to discuss it with the director.

86
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,804
Keep up the good work.

87
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,814
Please eat.

88
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,528
Yes.

89
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,780
We have to eat and cheer up

90
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,699
so that we can force Miles
to sign or something, right?

91
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,992
Seriously.

92
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,161
Try to lighten the mood.

93
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,789
Yes. Let's eat.

94
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,957
Excuse me.

95
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,794
Are you Korean? What is it?

96
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,587
Hello.

97
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,339
Have you been well, Ms. Lee?

98
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,467
It's our first time meeting.

99
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,677
I'm Oh Sa-hoon,
general manager of the Pelicans.

100
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,304
I see.

101
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,145
What do you say we join tables?

102
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,940
There's not enough space.

103
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,443
Did you get in contact with Miles?

104
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,237
Yes.

105
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,950
It would be frustrating
to eat with someone

106
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,535
who made Miles double his price.

107
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,373
No, that's being too selfish.

108
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,500
To speak from my perspective,

109
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,794
we'd be taking Miles at the proper price.

110
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,381
The Dreams don't need to pay
the amount Miles is worth.

111
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,383
We'll be taking Miles.

112
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,845
You haven't signed the contract yet.

113
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,306
I think having an attitude
of not giving up is great.

114
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,810
But how did you learn about Miles?

115
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,020
I didn't even expect any competition.

116
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,565
I could have missed him
if we'd taken our time.

117
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,066
Mr. Oh.

118
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,527
Does the field like your moves?

119
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,528
Pardon?

120
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,988
How do you recruit members?

121
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,074
Do you find the puzzle piece
that your team needs,

122
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,952
or do you just pick good players
regardless of position?

123
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,831
I do whatever I please.

124
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,708
Your first pick is right-handed.

125
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,126
Your second pick is right-handed.

126
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,588
Your fourth and fifth picks
are also right-handed.

127
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,174
Miles is also a right-handed pitcher.

128
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,259
If we take Miles,

129
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,677
that's a problem for you.

130
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,974
Mr. Oh Sa-hoon, do you want to make a bet?

131
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,269
Let's see who is laughing
when we are on the way back.

132
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,147
I am...

133
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,985
frustratingly detailed and meticulous.

134
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:06,903
Well...

135
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,448
we have no choice but to take Miles.

136
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,074
Let's proceed with that bet.

137
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,178
Is that the name of the player
that Oh Sa-hoon looked up?

138
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,389
How much did you work out as your budget?

139
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,022
You think I'm going to harm you
with this information?

140
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,691
Don't be foolish and hang up.

141
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:48,819
Let's support him...

142
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,614
when we can.

143
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,659
Let's go big, $900,000.

144
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,703
Okay. I'll make the call now.

145
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,167
INCOMING CALL

146
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,382
Gosh.

147
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,927
Do I need to excuse myself
for you to pick up the phone?

148
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,221
We were actually hoping

149
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,307
to bring Kang Doo-ki on to our team.

150
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,393
So I wanted to meet you in person.

151
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,728
Enjoy your meal.

152
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,819
Hello.

153
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,362
Yes.

154
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,280
Yes.

155
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,073
Yes, I understand.

156
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,827
Let's eat.

157
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,288
How did it turn out?

158
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,958
They said a million would be hard.

159
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,299
But, Director...

160
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,512
we allowed for $900,000.

161
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,307
If we allow 100,000 more,

162
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,517
won't General Manager Baek

163
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,186
be able to bring that player here?

164
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,273
Mr. Ko...

165
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,109
what you're saying is problematic.

166
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,195
You seem to be implying that...

167
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,618
we're hoping for Mr. Baek to fail.

168
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,829
We are...

169
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,293
using a lot of money
to actually support Mr. Baek.

170
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,131
Yes.

171
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,594
Right.

172
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,764
He's a player from abroad.

173
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,974
The 100,000 seems small, doesn't it?

174
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,311
But for foreign players,
it's all about money.

175
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,776
Then should I give Griffin a call?

176
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,319
Ms. Lee.

177
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,281
Would you be willing to move
to another team if they called you?

178
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,407
What?

179
00:10:59,075 --> 00:10:59,909
No.

180
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,078
Even if they offered a higher salary?

181
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,915
Of course not. The Dreams to me is...

182
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,335
-Oh.
-Right?

183
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,880
Not all of us are obsessed
with higher salaries.

184
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:17,009
But foreign players don't have
any contacts in our country,

185
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,221
locally or from school.
So, isn't the pay all they care about?

186
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,223
That would be the case
if it were way higher.

187
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,642
He says he can take up to $900,000.

188
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,479
I'll get in contact with Miles again.

189
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,190
YOO MIN-HO

190
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,784
Hey.

191
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,786
Step on the mound with your heel.

192
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,663
Stop shrugging your upper body.

193
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,914
The force...

194
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,710
The force from your waist
is delivered to the ball.

195
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,004
Try again. I have to take this.
Keep practicing.

196
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,172
Yes.

197
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,387
Hey.

198
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,597
Don't step down on the plate.

199
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,641
It's not going to help your precision.

200
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,602
And maintain your axis around your head.

201
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,106
I'm worried you might be injured again.

202
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,401
What are you doing?

203
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:16,861
What?

204
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,363
Why are you shaking him up
when I just fixed his pose?

205
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,448
What do you want?

206
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,617
Are you the pitching coach?
You coach if you're gonna keep doing this.

207
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,994
I'll be the bench coach.

208
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,829
Hey.

209
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,749
I've studied longer than you have.

210
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,667
I've been pitching coach
way longer than you!

211
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,004
Just concentrate on managing
the team if you're the bench coach.

212
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,380
Or switch with me!

213
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,717
That little brat.

214
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,634
You!

215
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,303
Come here.

216
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,857
KANG DOO-KI

217
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,506
"Jang Jin-woo's pitches
are too messy to hit."

218
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,467
"I have not once hit his pitch
straight this year."

219
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,885
Yes.

220
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,054
Kim, the third baseman
of the national team, told me.

221
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,225
Pitching a ball fast doesn't mean
it's well pitched.

222
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,560
There are pitches that are too fast,

223
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,103
even when the batter sees it coming,

224
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,689
so he swings and misses
three times to be struck out.

225
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,567
There are also balls
that roll across the field

226
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,778
because the batter thought
he could hit it, but missed.

227
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,198
After Doo-ki takes seven innings,

228
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,784
you step out there
to save the eighth, Jin-woo.

229
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,537
You can't pitch faster than Doo-ki.

230
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,540
How should you pitch
to torture the batters?

231
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,178
Manager Yoon.

232
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,558
Put Chul-min in the pitching coach's spot
and make me bench coach.

233
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,060
Seems like he wants to be pitching coach.

234
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,479
It's about time you two got along.

235
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,279
We all have our own role.

236
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,039
Did the general manager go somewhere?

237
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,501
We need a pitcher
after the day Doo-ki pitches.

238
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,836
Player from abroad?

239
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,881
But can we even afford one?

240
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,216
It'll be good enough
if he can pitch down the middle.

241
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,344
Let's get back to training.

242
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,222
Miles.

243
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,061
The money we can offer you
is $900,000.

244
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,190
That's $100,000 short
of the million dollars offered to you.

245
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,808
He says he doesn't have
that much experience

246
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,518
in Triple-A, but a million isn't too much

247
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,144
compared to his abilities.

248
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,022
The Pelicans replaced
foreign players twice last year.

249
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:22,982
Were you aware?

250
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,571
We, the Dreams,

251
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,658
haven't replaced our foreign players
once in the last three years.

252
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,619
We give them enough time
to get used to the league.

253
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,832
If you want, I'll add that article
into our contract.

254
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,420
It's not about whether we have the money.

255
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,922
I'm talking about how it can affect you.

256
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,384
Well...

257
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,554
You must be familiar with Mac Miller.

258
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,890
He had a great career in the MLB,
but in our league,

259
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,601
he was replaced in four months
to come back here.

260
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,229
Also, other teams

261
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,314
don't hesitate to make foreign players

262
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,900
the middle relief pitcher
if they fail to adapt.

263
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,122
Of course.

264
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,877
Our league's rule states
a million dollars as the limit,

265
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,297
but you'll be free from that article
if you re-sign with us.

266
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,217
When you finish a season well,
the teams in Japan will notice.

267
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,221
There are a lot of teams in Japan
that do not spare their money.

268
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,725
You could think of the one year
guaranteed on our team

269
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,854
as a showcase
for the best pitcher, Miles.

270
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,691
Being paid $100,000 more now

271
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,070
won't matter at all in your future.

272
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,408
I bet 100 percent.

273
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,288
But...

274
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,667
on the condition you have the opportunity
until the end of the season.

275
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,382
If you have old friends
who still play in our country,

276
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,093
call them to check.

277
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,097
The Dreams recommend our players
autonomous training.

278
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,599
But it's different for the Pelicans.

279
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,770
They still follow team training
that also applies to foreign players.

280
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,366
I think I've told you all the facts

281
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,827
that can easily offset
the difference of $100,000.

282
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,954
Haven't I?

283
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,986
You've got quite the translator.

284
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,530
I prefer handling things gentler.

285
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,031
Since we're not strangers.

286
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,242
Nothing forceful happened.

287
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,954
You work pretty hard.

288
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,330
Let's go.

289
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,543
No wonder I wanted to sign a contract
in the middle of the night.

290
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,800
You're signing with me?

291
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,473
Mr. Baek.

292
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,980
You made quite an effort.

293
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,818
I thought what you told him
sounded like wise words.

294
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,112
So, we promised him
to add those to the contract, too.

295
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,118
Can you also guarantee your manager
will let him train on his own?

296
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,537
-Mr. Baek.
-Can you?

297
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,081
Whether that's true or not,

298
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,043
if Miles believes us,
then he's our player to manage.

299
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,044
Think about it.

300
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,214
Why would he say he'd think about it
when you talk to him,

301
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,008
but say yes right away when I talk to him?

302
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,969
It's probably a dual contract
that promises him a higher salary.

303
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,479
We'd rather get back to business
than agonize over a little money.

304
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,441
I'm giving you this advice
out of good intention.

305
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,153
Shouldn't you look for another player?

306
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,010
So, they are giving him a commercial
with the contract.

307
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,512
What?

308
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,056
So, they've admitted they offered
more than a million dollars.

309
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,183
Let's report them for the dual contract.

310
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,143
It will be meaningless.

311
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,478
What? Why?

312
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,648
There's no such regulation
that prohibits any payments

313
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,691
in the form of ad fees.

314
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:20,362
It was our mistake to simply think
there was a $100,000 difference.

315
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,116
It was a losing game in the first place.

316
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,287
We lost because we didn't have
enough money?

317
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,164
"I couldn't go to college
as I didn't have tutors."

318
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,749
"I lost because I was sick."

319
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,960
Everyone can't be in the same environment.

320
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,713
They are fighting with what they have.

321
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,924
If we make excuses,
we'll lose in the same way again.

322
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,803
It's not that we lost to Mr. Oh.

323
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,763
We lost to the given situation.

324
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,527
Why don't we watch a video of Griffin?

325
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,284
His performance isn't so flashy.

326
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,703
He's the type of player
who enjoys a battle of wits,

327
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,997
so he will get used
to the new environment quickly.

328
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,458
Taking that into consideration,

329
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,086
we can't say he's absolutely
less skilled than Miles.

330
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,131
He seems to have a good mentality
the more I watch his videos.

331
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,056
See you tomorrow.

332
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,390
See you.

333
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,481
Robert.

334
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,068
-Yes?
-Thank you for today.

335
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,362
I hope you keep up the good work.

336
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,902
Just like a veteran player,

337
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,739
he has his own stable routine
even for training.

338
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,158
He's pretty good
at painting the corners, too.

339
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,994
THE TECHNIQUE OF THROWING STRIKES
AT THE CORNERS OF THE PLATE

340
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,540
Mr. Baek?

341
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,754
Mr. Kim.

342
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,506
What are you doing here?

343
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,883
I told you I was going to California.

344
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,971
Who are you here to see?

345
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,523
By any chance, is it Griffin?

346
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,862
Darn it.

347
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,573
Mr. Baek.

348
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,409
I haven't known you for a long time,

349
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:16,246
but let me tell you this
out of good intention for you.

350
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,290
Go check your third candidate.

351
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,877
I'm not telling you we have priority.

352
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,213
We'll be left with no options
if we lose him,

353
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,674
so we are going to scout him for sure.

354
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:31,303
I'm telling you how determined we are.

355
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,180
I understand.

356
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:38,101
You wouldn't have wasted your time
if you shared all this beforehand.

357
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,146
Why didn't you tell me
when we counted to three?

358
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,606
Right.

359
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,483
I will see you back in Korea.

360
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,830

361
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,458
So are we leaving without getting
to talk to him even once?

362
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:05,212
He beat around the bush and kindly
told me that we don't have money.

363
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,799
We can't take him away from them,
so there's no use swaying him.

364
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,344
Don't you think
it's a $100,000 difference now?

365
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,720
Did you give up?

366
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,680
I mean, his pitches are weaker
than expected.

367
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,769
We won't often see him
do the same as in the video.

368
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,480
He may not strike the players out,
but still...

369
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,650
Right, he makes ground balls
by throwing cutters,

370
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,902
but we're weak
in terms of infield defense.

371
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:33,323

372
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,535
I'm sure Mr. Kim knows it, too.

373
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,328
Let's call it a day.

374
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,380
Hello?

375
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,258
Are you feeling a chill?

376
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,759
Did you take medicine?

377
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,178
Oh, right. You can't take any.

378
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,179
What should we do?

379
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,140
The situation isn't so good right now.

380
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,561
Okay.

381
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,739
It's around this time you get demotivated.

382
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,325
Of course not.

383
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,245
Picking foreign players is like farming.

384
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,998
I'm going to go at this with persistence.

385
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,458
I'm still full of energy.

386
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,044
That's good to hear.

387
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,506
What about our dinner today?

388
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,758
I've found a restaurant.

389
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,343
What's on the menu?

390
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,928
It's Mexican food.

391
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:37,929
Let's eat Korean.

392
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,934
Okay. Fortunately, there's
a Korean restaurant nearby.

393
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,352
It specializes in stew.

394
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,062
I don't feel like eating stew either.

395
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,982
Well...

396
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,651
you know.

397
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,694
What?

398
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,612
You know what.

399
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,324
What?

400
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,492
Is he here to write a food column?

401
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,747
Isn't it hard driving?

402
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,165
No, it's okay.

403
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,708
Thank you.

404
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,003
So where are we having dinner today?

405
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,632
What on earth is it that you want to eat?

406
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,385
You know, something spicy
that you have to boil at home.

407
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,220
You mean ramyeon?

408
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,680
Oh, gosh.

409
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,353
Where can we eat ramyeon?

410
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,105
My house is near here.

411
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,158
What are you doing?
You're not feeling well.

412
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,204
I was doing it for a short time
to forget about the pain.

413
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,873
We have guests. They're outside.

414
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,292
Now?

415
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,304
Thank you.

416
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,183
It must be hard for you.

417
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,810
I'm worried.

418
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,728
Thank you.

419
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,898
Why don't you join us?

420
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,858
No, it's okay.

421
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,777
Thank you for the food.

422
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,615
You should take a picture.

423
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,367
Right.

424
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,583
-Oh, the bowl is... Excuse me.
-No.

425
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,294
Don't bother.
It won't be a problem eating.

426
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,254
Why don't you join us?

427
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,271
I don't think
we need a meeting with Herbert.

428
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,149
But, actually, the other candidates

429
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,360
are worse than Herbert.

430
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,820
I see.

431
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,655
Let's move.

432
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,845
Is there a problem?

433
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,099
The car's out of fuel.

434
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,894
The engine might stop soon.

435
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,062
What?

436
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,899
It's okay. It happens.

437
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,837
Nothing ever goes right.

438
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,046
Where are we?

439
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,549
What do we do now?

440
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:28,928
Mr. Baek.

441
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:06,549
THREE DAYS AGO

442
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,580
Boo.

443
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,836
Gosh. We're on a date here,
which we haven't done in Korea.

444
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,964
What nonsense is that?

445
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,256
Push off, you punk.

446
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,094
Come on. You can't walk around alone
like this in a foreign country.

447
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,261
Aren't you tired?

448
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,263
And you? You didn't go to bed yet.

449
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,808
I just can't sleep.

450
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,103
I guess we must've persuaded Andy
more instead.

451
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,313
But this is what Mr. Baek decided.

452
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,566
It'd be worse if Mr. Baek
thought the same.

453
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,653
He already has a lot
to straighten out now.

454
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,534
-What?
-Nothing.

455
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,414
By the way, I guess Robert Gil
likes baseball a lot.

456
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,416
What are you talking about?

457
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,378
He seemed to know a lot
about baseball yesterday.

458
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,589
You don't know
Gil Chang-ju, the baseball player?

459
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,551
Robert Gil is Gil Chang-ju.

460
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,387
Sorry?

461
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,613
You still have a long way to go.

462
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
Come on.

463
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,826
I just forgot for a moment.
I know who Gil Chang-ju is.

464
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,955
If you're going to go talk to him
as if you know him,

465
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,415
you'd better get back and sleep.

466
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,584
Why?

467
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,878
He hasn't retired yet.

468
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,965
It seems like he's training
to play as a professional player.

469
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,216
Don't interrupt him.

470
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,306
You must be exhausted.
You didn't go to bed yet.

471
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,016
Hello, Mr. Baek.

472
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,601
You're out for a stroll too?

473
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,853
Yes. I just couldn't fall asleep,
so I came out here.

474
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,021
I see.

475
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,214
-Wait.
-I'm on the same page.

476
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,302
GIL CHANG-JU

477
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,096
A young pitcher with a promising future.

478
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,643
The man who betrayed his nation
is on the decline.

479
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,442
The pitcher with nine wins
in the MLB has been released.

480
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,903
He played for the national team
four times.

481
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,996
His pitches are...

482
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,374
The best we've seen in the States.

483
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,793
Hold on. I need to go to the hotel.

484
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,379
Hey, where are you...?

485
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,063
Have you known from the start?

486
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,776
I was going to tell you...

487
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,906
but I thought it had nothing to do
with his job as our guide, so I didn't.

488
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,242
How did you know?

489
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,618
Well...

490
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,496
his analysis was quite impressive.

491
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,666
He knew too much about baseball
for a non-player.

492
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,795
So I shook his hand,
and he had the hand of a pitcher.

493
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,135
Mr. Gil!

494
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,308
Hello.

495
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,941
Please throw with all your might.

496
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,777
Hey, come on. You are--

497
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,988
It's okay. I'm fully equipped.

498
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,282
-If I throw with all my might...
-It's all right!

499
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,539
I'm ready!

500
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,985
Now I feel great.

501
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,570
Are you okay?

502
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,074
Can you catch more?

503
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,868
No, I can't.

504
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,829
I'm sorry for interrupting.

505
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,248
It's okay.

506
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,166
How is your elbow?

507
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,584
Sorry?

508
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,169
You had surgery on the ligament.

509
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,590
Well...

510
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,177
I do pitching training
because I feel anxious.

511
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,975
I just want to check if it's okay
like the doctor said. I'm fine.

512
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,978
I see. It's good to hear that.

513
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,145
You really work hard.

514
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,773
This is all I've got.

515
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,109
My hand never lies.

516
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,194
You know I caught the balls Miles threw.

517
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,904
Thank you.

518
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,074
You didn't pitch with your utmost effort?

519
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,160
I did.

520
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,122
You really did your best
even though I'm not a player?

521
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,332
Hold on a second.

522
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,460
You can't retire like this.
What about playing in Korea?

523
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,586
Hey.

524
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,504
What?

525
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,842
That's so kind of you.

526
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,179
But you know I'm legally American now.

527
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,516
What about becoming naturalized
in Korea again?

528
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,936
It's not that easy.

529
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,229
And even if I do so,

530
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,982
I can't play, since the KPB
plans to impose a punishment on me.

531
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,068
Who would recruit a player like me?

532
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,737
Did you say punishment?

533
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,697
When I came...

534
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,242
to the States, things got complicated.

535
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,745
I didn't know about it,

536
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,954
but my team didn't inquire

537
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,248
about my status as a player
to the KPB back then.

538
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,335
I also heard the contract I made
in high school was against regulations.

539
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,088
So, currently, I'm suspended
from playing in the league.

540
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,215
Didn't you request the KPB
cancel disciplinary action

541
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,633
while playing in the States?

542
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,595
If you've ever thought
you'd go back to Korea someday...

543
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,056
Even if the suspension is lifted,

544
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,265
people would see me...

545
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,353
as a bad guy who evaded
my mandatory military service.

546
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,570
You finally became
a promising rookie pitcher

547
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,572
in the MLB after such hardships.

548
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,536
Enlisting in the army so suddenly
must've not been easy.

549
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,206
But many people said

550
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,377
they would understand even if you
chose to become American.

551
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,924
Actually...

552
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,678
my wife was really sick back then.

553
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,517
She needed a heart transplant
as she had a tumor in her heart.

554
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,436
But the waiting list
was too long in Korea.

555
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,482
I couldn't leave my sick wife alone

556
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,235
to go back to Korea
and enlist in the army.

557
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,278
If I went back then...

558
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,492
my wife wouldn't be here with me.

559
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,330
Why haven't you tried to explain it
through the press?

560
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,917
Being there for my wife was my choice.

561
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,130
I couldn't let my wife be criticized
for what I chose to do.

562
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,924
Fortunately,

563
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,427
she's much healthier now.

564
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,555
I have no regrets,
but I should still be blamed.

565
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,267
It must have seemed selfish.

566
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,645
No, I am selfish.

567
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,189
I don't expect to be forgiven.

568
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,943
I also shouldn't tell people
I'll make up for it with baseball.

569
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,029
I let others feel deprived.

570
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,282
I can't make up for something
like that with what I love.

571
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,201
It's just absurd.

572
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,414
Then are you planning
to play baseball in America

573
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,458
while remaining unforgiven?

574
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,917
At times,

575
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,755
the Korean players who play in the MLB say

576
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,591
that they want to retire in Korea.

577
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,596
But I don't deserve to even say that.

578
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,014
Well,

579
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,057
you can always dream about it.

580
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,895
You were injured and weren't playing well
before you were released, right?

581
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,235
But still,

582
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,155
I haven't quit or anything.

583
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,824
My wife is expecting.

584
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,663
I have one more person
to take responsibility for.

585
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,792
Though I've got a lot on my shoulders,

586
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,296
when I think about my wife,
who has been believing in me...

587
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,841
and the baby that's coming...

588
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,887
it gives me strength.

589
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,481
If you called beforehand,

590
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,608
you wouldn't have wasted your time.

591
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,401
I'll see you in Korea.

592
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,319
Sure.

593
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,946
I'm sorry.

594
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,449
No.

595
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,035
You don't need to be sorry.

596
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,287
I don't think
we need a meeting with Herbert.

597
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,373
Let's move.

598
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,670
I shouldn't have watched
Chang-ju pitch that day.

599
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,129
It only raised the bar.

600
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,094
If a player doesn't live up to
your expectations, we shouldn't sign him.

601
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,179
What do you mean?

602
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,766
So, where are we having dinner today?

603
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,353
What on earth is it that you want to eat?

604
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:48,148
You know, something spicy
that you have to boil at home.

605
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,192
Do you mean ramyeon?

606
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,455
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

607
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,794
Please join us.

608
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,921
No, it's okay.

609
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,590
Thank you for the food.

610
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,181
According to the rules on signing
international players...

611
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,767
I've looked into Articles 9, 10,
and Chapters 9, 10,

612
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,145
regulations
on signing international players.

613
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,939
But I couldn't find
any significant problems.

614
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,441
Yes.

615
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,944
Regarding the indefinite disqualification,

616
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,322
I request a disciplinary discharge.

617
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,037
Mr. Baek.

618
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,665
There's a gas station
five kilometers from here.

619
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,251
Really? That's a relief.

620
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,586
I'll be back.

621
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,171
Get some rest where it's safe.

622
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,131
Are you going alone?

623
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,800
It sounds like you want me to go with him.

624
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:01,513
No, I will run myself to death.

625
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,890
I'll go.

626
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,519
I'll feel sorry if you can't keep up.
I'll go by myself.

627
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,856
Some people still confuse me
as an athlete.

628
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:11,899
Let's go.

629
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,289
He's an earnest person, isn't he?

630
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,043
When men get married,

631
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,628
they must...

632
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,130
feel a sense of responsibility like him.

633
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,051
Some people do, and some people don't.

634
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,970
Sure.

635
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,972
Whether you're married or not,

636
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,849
if you become weak,
people around you suffer.

637
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,604
So he must have abandoned the illusion
of him being the best already.

638
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,315
He only hopes to be someone

639
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,735
who can do well enough
to protect the people around him.

640
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,659
The president?

641
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,369
No.

642
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:06,912
Then...

643
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,083
Yes, this is
General Manager Baek Seung-soo.

644
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,168
Yes.

645
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,629
Really?

646
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,090
All right.

647
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,508
Yes.

648
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,971
You should get to work, Ms. Lee.

649
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,437
He wanted some quick feedback
after watching the pitching video

650
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,980
as soon as it was sent.

651
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,064
Is it Miles?

652
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,275
We could always take him
if he's not injured.

653
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:37,985
Wait.

654
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:38,902
Who is that?

655
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,490
Isn't that Gil Chang-ju?

656
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,119
Why did he send us this video?

657
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,121
Our second-string pitcher.

658
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,749
I thought we were signing
a foreign player.

659
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,041
He's an American.

660
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,128
But still, is that even possible?

661
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,046
He said the association
already approved this.

662
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,632
Even if it's been approved,

663
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,384
it's morally wrong.

664
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,344
Don't you know
obeying the law is what's right?

665
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,306
You finally said it right.
This is just wrong!

666
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,351
He's back in shape.

667
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,437
His center of gravity shift
is more natural.

668
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,230
His pitching looks powerful.

669
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,399
We can't even guarantee
that he'll adapt well.

670
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,486
He's just pitching without a hitter.

671
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,362
You trying to be criticized
the whole season?

672
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,947
Has that general manager gone crazy?

673
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,409
Aren't you afraid of
being criticized for not playing well?

674
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,869
What did you say?

675
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,579
Listen.

676
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,790
Let's stop being criticized
for being bad at baseball.

677
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,751
Let's be criticized
for something else for a change.

678
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,628
Yong-gu and Chul-min.

679
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,713
Yes.

680
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,632
Watch carefully.

681
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,055
Do you think we can sign

682
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,933
a better foreign player
for $500,000?

683
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,019
No.

684
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,021
I don't think so.

685
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,676
I'm sorry I'm late.

686
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,178
We can fill this up
and get to the gas station.

687
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,388
Then we can go.

688
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,432
No, I don't think
we're in that much of a hurry.

689
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,143
We have a long way to go.

690
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,813
I have a question, Chang-ju.

691
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,064
Okay.

692
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:43,318
Were you aware your disciplinary action
had been discharged eight years ago?

693
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,653
No.

694
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,614
I also found out about it just now.

695
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,451
I've looked into Articles 9, 10,
and Chapters 9, 10,

696
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,412
regulations
on signing international players.

697
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,498
I couldn't see a problem,
so I requested it be discharged.

698
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,458
Why would you do that?

699
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,088
I'm trying to make you an offer.

700
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,061
INTERNATIONAL PLAYER EMPLOYMENT, CONTRACT

701
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,105
I'll propose a salary
of $500,000 a year.

702
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,690
There are many reasons.

703
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,733
One,

704
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,403
you haven't gotten any offers
from other teams yet.

705
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,072
I know it sounds harsh,

706
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,949
but the unfavorable party
must risk any damage.

707
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,408
Two,

708
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,120
I expect we'll have to cope
with critical opinions.

709
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,916
Everyone will understand why we signed you

710
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,668
as the season begins.

711
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,086
But until then,

712
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,046
we have too much time left on our hands.

713
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,215
If we tell them we've signed you
for 500,000,

714
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,716
it'll be more justifiable.

715
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,635
Three,

716
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,930
our goal was to sign a pitcher
who can get us 15 wins

717
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,515
for $500,000 in the first place.

718
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,685
I'd like to go back
with that goal accomplished.

719
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,398
I...

720
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,402
I don't...

721
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,239
I don't know what to tell you.

722
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:57,244
I'm not sure if it's right to say
in such an unbelievable situation...

723
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,832
but it's hard for me
to sign the contract easily.

724
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,963
Is our offer too small?

725
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,882
I'm worried what people who've served...

726
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,302
and their families might think of me.

727
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,849
Whenever I wanted to return to Korea,

728
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,727
I stopped myself with this thought.

729
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,939
But now that it's stuck in my head,

730
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,276
I don't think I can go back for real.

731
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,530
If I go back as a foreign player...

732
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,328
I will be playing with the name
Robert Gil.

733
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,709
My parents will not be
happy about it either.

734
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,927
People might consider my return
a result of my failure, too.

735
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,640
That scares me the most.

736
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,893
My goodness.

737
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,312
Then tell me.

738
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,565
What did you train yourself that hard for?

739
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,193
To return to the Major League?

740
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,153
Once I give...

741
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,199
an acceptable result
in the Major League...

742
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,244
I'll be welcomed then.

743
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:26,291
Do those people hate you
because of poor results?

744
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,504
No.

745
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,175
It's because you haven't fulfilled
your military duty.

746
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,512
It's not because of
your results or ability.

747
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:45,477
If a part of you still doesn't want
to be hated by anyone,

748
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:49,314
then I can't say
you're desperate for real.

749
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,150
Well...

750
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,780
I offered you a contract with us,
expecting you to be desperate.

751
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,242
Do you think it was easy
for me to decide this?

752
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,078
Mr. Gil.

753
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,082
Do you really not have any reason
to be desperate?

754
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,611
What's wrong?

755
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,695
What is it?

756
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,329
I can play baseball again.

757
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,166
Mr. Baek wants me to join his team.

758
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,973
I was so scared

759
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:51,353
you might not be able
to play baseball anymore because of me.

760
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,012
Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed
at Incheon International Airport.

761
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,349
Please remain seated

762
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:33,353
until the plane comes to a complete stop
and the seat belt sign is turned off.

763
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,106
Be careful when opening the overhead bins,

764
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,649
as items may fall.

765
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,779
We're going to keep
trying our best to help you travel

766
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,407
safely and comfortably.

767
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,700
Thank you.

768
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,091
It's Gil Chang-ju!

769
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,217
-Mr. Gil!
-There he is.

770
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,012
-Mr. Gil Chang-ju!
-Please look here.

771
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,774
I told you I could bet
that we would be the ones to smile first.

772
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,902
Do you think the reporters
are welcoming him with flowers?

773
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,240
I think they're here
to gnaw at his remarks instead.

774
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,285
Right, so we've arranged
a press conference.

775
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,037
So you can leave first.

776
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,582
I guess you enjoy buzz marketing.

777
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,627
Please come to the center.

778
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:41,838
How do you feel now?

779
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,425
How do you feel coming back
to Korea as a foreign player?

780
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:49,763
Do you think you can be back
on the field as a pitcher?

781
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,306
Chin up.

782
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,768
You've come here

783
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,312
to throw a ball on the mound
in front of millions.

784
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,858
This is not even a big deal.

785
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,405
Let's go.

786
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,115
Okay.

787
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:13,453
-Mr. Gil, please look here.
-Mr. Gil.

788
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,288
How does it feel to be in Korea?

789
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:22,337
PRESS CONFERENCE 2019
ON ROBERT GIL JOINING THE DREAMS

790
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,216
I'm Kim Jung-gu of Financial Modern.

791
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,635
Let me make my question
short and straight to the point.

792
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,345
Why Gil Chang-ju?

793
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,725
Well, he can throw a strong fastball
wherever he wants.

794
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,602
That's the kind of player he is.

795
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,354
I'm Lee Jin-soo of Jonghap Daily.

796
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:42,607
They say the year depends
on which foreign player you scout.

797
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,819
I'm curious if this was your best choice.

798
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,988
Yes, of all the options we had.

799
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,658
Did you consider
what the Korean people would think?

800
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,120
We brought the best player
we could choose,

801
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,747
although his past isn't so ideal.

802
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,708
Does that mean you don't care
as long as he's good at baseball?

803
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,421
We brought him with the expectation
of seeing him play well.

804
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,338
And...

805
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,882
"It doesn't matter
as long as he's good at baseball"?

806
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,801
Is there anyone who thinks so?

807
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,599
I'm Lee Se-young, operations manager.

808
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,770
We've seen him from up close,

809
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,440
and he's the responsible head
of his household

810
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,775
who doesn't look back on his flashy past.

811
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,528
He's ashamed and regretful of his past.

812
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:32,907
That is why he didn't have
the courage to come back to Korea

813
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,826
from the States,
where opportunities are scarce.

814
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,121
We persuaded him to join us.

815
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,624
I'm Jung Soon-geun of Jungdong Daily.

816
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:45,336
Mr. Gil became a US citizen
to avoid his military duty.

817
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,755
If he gets to play baseball again
in this country,

818
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,924
other Korean men
will most likely feel deprived.

819
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,342
What will you do about it?

820
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,642
Jungdong Daily?

821
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,482
I won't deny that Mr. Gil played
a role in that sense of deprivation.

822
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,358
I'm aware of it,

823
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,360
and he's aware of it, too.

824
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,614
Right, he will have to bear with criticism

825
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,074
that's much harsher
than that against people

826
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,452
like the heir of a press company
or son of a politician

827
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,579
who has been exempted from military duty

828
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,248
for excuses like essential hypertension.

829
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:24,792
But you know what?

830
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,796
There was a young baseball player
with a promising future.

831
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,424
He was selected as the ace player
of the national youth team.

832
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,677
He played in a total of four games,
two preliminaries.

833
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,181
He was the winning pitcher for
the semifinals, and for the finals,

834
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,807
he was the relief pitcher.

835
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,309
His team won the championship,

836
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:44,562
but unfortunately, he injured
the ligament of his elbow.

837
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,649
He went to the States for surgery
and focused on rehab.

838
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:48,733
GIL GETS SURGERY IN THE US

839
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,444
After the rehab, his results came out.

840
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,737
NINE WINS THIS SEASON

841
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,405
Then he finally got recognized.

842
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,824
However,

843
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,410
he was faced with the time
to join the army

844
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:03,581
when he finally became
a promising rookie in the Major League.

845
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,877
Around that time, there was a survey

846
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,881
for which 70 percent of answers
were favorable to naturalization.

847
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,759
Are you saying
his naturalization was just?

848
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,720
I do not think it was just,

849
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,764
and that is why
I'm making it a long story.

850
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,266
-What?
-Goodness.

851
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,936
Perhaps he trusted
the survey results too much,

852
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,855
but he made a mistake
in becoming naturalized.

853
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,857
But then he injured his elbow again.

854
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,902
In the end, he was dropped from the team.

855
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,113
His baseball career was put to a stop.

856
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,699
Are you saying he sacrificed
his elbow for his country?

857
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,118
It sounds like he needs
to be compensated or something.

858
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:44,872
No, I'm just saying that man
wishes to keep playing baseball.

859
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,875
He wants to continue his career
even as a foreign player.

860
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,627
Will that move baseball fans?

861
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,672
Even if it's your first time
joining the Asian Games,

862
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,049
winning a gold medal once

863
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,552
exempts you from your military duty.

864
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:00,221
Recently, the National Assembly

865
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,474
has been discussing
whether to change this system

866
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,809
into a mileage system.

867
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:08,896
Mr. Gil here was on
the youth national team for two games

868
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,025
and participated in the WBC two times.

869
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,651
That's his record as a national athlete.

870
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,112
Are you degrading
an Asian Games gold medal?

871
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,532
Miles. Griffin.

872
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,036
Those players have never been
to Korea before.

873
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,371
They will be playing on the mound
as foreign players...

874
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,168
while Mr. Gil has the record
of being a national athlete four times.

875
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,462
I'd like you to give him

876
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,881
a chance to play baseball
at least like them.

877
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,507
It's not Gil Chang-ju,

878
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:40,386
but Robert Gil who will be on the mound.

879
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:48,853
Can I ask you one last question?

880
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,361
I'm Kim Young-chae of Baseball Is Life.

881
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,698
There might be a way
for him to be forgiven.

882
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,580
What do you think about him
serving in the army now?

883
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,542
Did you bring a troublemaker?

884
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,877
If he were that great,
why would he come for only 500,000?

885
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,379
The reporters wouldn't want to come.

886
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,922
I have a lot of questions.

887
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,340
You're right. We're running away.

888
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,760
She'll keep hitting our sore spots
and think it's journalism.

889
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,846
I don't know why you scouted me.

890
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,180
Who would assist whom?

891
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,975
Please just do as much work
as others in your position.

892
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,601
You crossed the line earlier.

893
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,271
Do you think you'd be able
to not blame yourself if you were me?

894
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,732
You're good at your job
because we're related by blood.

895
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,443
How can you make such a decision
without a proper reason?

896
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,361
-Hey.
-I wonder why a smart man

897
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,821
would oppose me. Let me tell you.

898
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,658
It's a decision.
And the resolution of our group.
