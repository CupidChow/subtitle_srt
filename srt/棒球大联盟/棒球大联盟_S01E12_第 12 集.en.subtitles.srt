1
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,491
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,993
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,414
How do the players throw in this weather?

4
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,625
They're incredible.
I wouldn't be able to if it were me.

5
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,419
It's the general manager.

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,463
Even the rumors going around.

7
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,922
-That's right.
-Okay.

8
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,766
The two of you are close.

9
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:02,729
-I'm taking care of him right now.
-No, we're taking care of each other.

10
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,399
What did Lim Dong-gyu whisper in your ear?

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,026
He just called me out.

12
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,904
-He called you out?
-What for?

13
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,450
He said,
"You're doomed, you crazy little scumbag."

14
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,079
I understand.

15
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,498
I think I understand completely.

16
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,417
Lim Dong-gyu is very hot-blooded.

17
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,921
I'm sure we're going
to win tomorrow, right?

18
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,509
Whether we win or lose, I hope
we find a way to become a strong team.

19
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,969
I'm sure we'll win
when Kang Doo-ki is playing.

20
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,055
Yes, we've done well so far.

21
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,265
Have we done well?

22
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,350
Of course.

23
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,394
We now have Kang Doo-ki,
Gil Chang-ju, and Kim Kwan-sik.

24
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,898
We can only know that we did well
if the players do well.

25
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,903
We can't assume that
we did well just by ourselves.

26
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,074
-That's the job that we're doing.
-Yes.

27
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,868
That is the job that we're doing.

28
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,246
Yes, it's cold. Let's go.

29
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,516
I'm bored. Let's strike out Lim Dong-gyu.

30
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,725
Yes.

31
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,310
All right.

32
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,687
All right, everyone!

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,231
Everyone, have some ginseng
before you train.

34
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,024
Here you go, Kang Tae-min.

35
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,151
Our nice guy.

36
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,444
You can do it, Yoo Min-ho.

37
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,488
-Thank you.
-Here's one for our coach.

38
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,031
-Thank you.
-You can do it.

39
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,450
You can do it, Kang Doo-ki.

40
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,538

41
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,248
Let's do this!

42
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,340
-Hello, Mr. Baek.
-Hi.

43
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,593
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

44
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,553
Gosh.

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,057
There we have Lim Dong-gyu.

46
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,394
Of course, he's supposed
to be there. Why wouldn't he be?

47
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,605
He just happened to catch my attention.

48
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,816
He has no friends.

49
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,069
Anyways, we're all tuned in

50
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:19,324
to see a match between Lim Dong-gyu
and Kang Doo-ki.

51
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,536
Hello to all the fans of the Dreams.
I'll be today's commentator.

52
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,288
I'm the housekeeper
of the operations team,

53
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,707
its future and its hopeful big shot.
My name is Han Jae-hee.

54
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,877
And to the left of me...
I'm sure baseball fans all know him.

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,671
He was the Internet's
best baseball columnist, Robinson.

56
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,300
A member of our strategy analysis team,
Baek Young-soo, will be a commentator.

57
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,137
-Please introduce yourself.
-Yes. Hello.

58
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,391
Let's begin our telecast,
partial to the Dreams!

59
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,601
Let's begin!

60
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,645
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

61
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,784
Strike.

62
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,788
Strike.

63
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,416
-Nice.
-Nice.

64
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,086
Yes, that is Kang Doo-ki.

65
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,464
To Kang, the rookie Lee Chang-kwon
is like a piece of bread.

66
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,634
The bread dipped in one strike,
two strikes, and three strikes

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,344
goes right into your mouth.

68
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,564
Strike.

69
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,487
Strike.

70
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,406
It's a one-two-three inning!

71
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,574
Let's see the fourth batter
during the second inning.

72
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,742
Goodbye!

73
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,329
Of course, he's a force
to be reckoned with.

74
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,914
It's Kang Doo-ki.

75
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,917
Kang Doo-ki is normally a slow starter.

76
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,043
But today, he's different.

77
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,379
From the get-go,
he's using incredible strength

78
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,881

79
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,427
That is correct. He retired three players!

80
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,678
KWAK HAN-YOUNG

81
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,768
He hit it!

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,446
Home run! It's a home run!

83
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,782
Kwak Han-young hits a home run!

84
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,825
This is great!

85
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,203
I wish this match were
the opening game. Aren't I right?

86
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,163
Great.

87
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,833
-Yes!
-Kwak Han-young!

88
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,338

89
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,262
Strike.

90
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,473
Strike.

91
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,682
Out.

92
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,771
Swing and a miss, strikeout.
Onto the fourth batter.

93
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,066

94
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,694

95
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,987
an early education.

96
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,947

97
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,283
lesson fees to give to Kang Doo-ki.

98
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,162
You didn't see Jang Jin-woo
during his peak, did you?

99
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,163
I did.

100
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,041
It was just for a year,
but he was really good.

101
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,127
Did you have to mention
that it was only for a year?

102
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,590
LIM DONG-GYU

103
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,467
It's Lim Dong-gyu now.

104
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,266
Lim Dong-gyu has the best record

105
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,436

106
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,980
But he's the fifth batter, not the fourth.

107
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,732
They're not showing him complete respect.

108
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,777

109
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,697
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

110
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,282
-Mr. Baek.
-Hello, sir.

111
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,455
I'm all nervous myself.

112
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,624
I can only wonder how much they are.

113
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,586
Are you nervous? I'm not.
It's only a practice match.

114
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,633
Do you think those two are going to think
it's simply a practice match?

115
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,803
They're going to go at it
with everything they have.

116
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,014
It's always been that way
between Lim Dong-gyu and Kang Doo-ki.

117
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,763
Goodness.

118
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,431
Three fouls.

119
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,435
You can say that Lim Dong-gyu is
losing to Kang Doo-ki's strength, right?

120
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,103
No, that's not it.

121
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,982
Kang Doo-ki is sending
the same type of fastballs.

122
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,860
Lim Dong-gyu is cutting all the balls

123
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,403
until he receives one that he wants.

124
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,990
Then, you can say they're
putting their pride on the line, right?

125
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,283
Right.

126
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,017
-Strike.
-Nice.

127
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,395
Swing and a miss, strikeout!

128
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,398
I bet Lim Dong-gyu is shouting,

129
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,234
"Why was Kang Doo-ki born

130
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,320
when I came into this world?"

131
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,116
Why not a head-to-head contest?

132
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,161
I think Lim Dong-gyu thought

133
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,205
it would be a head-to-head contest

134
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,666
because it was the first match
after the trade.

135
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,293
But I'm sure Kang Doo-ki

136
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,253
was showing a firm determination

137
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,297
that he wouldn't put in more weight

138
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,173
because he was facing Lim Dong-gyu.

139
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,301
That was a good thing you pointed out.

140
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,738
-Great!
-That's the way to do it.

141
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,669
Out.

142
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,255
-Out. Yes!
-Okay.

143
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,176
Defense has gotten much more stable.

144
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,269
-Out.
-Nice!

145
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,898
My goodness.

146
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,818
The defense of the Dreams knows
where the ball is going to be.

147
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,945
They're making it look so easy.

148
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,698
Wouldn't it be because they've
trained so hard for this?

149
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,368
They're completely different
compared to last year.

150
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,411
You're right.

151
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:07,375
This proves that defense can
get better with earnest training.

152
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,876

153
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,923
Lim Dong-gyu is at bat for the third time.

154
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,758
We have to be careful here.

155
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,760
According to the records,

156
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,304
Lim Dong-gyu hits the most home runs

157
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,722
in his third at-bat.

158
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,730
And he hit the ball.

159
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,565
The ball keeps going!

160
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,442
Good.

161
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,490
It's a foul!

162
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,743
How would Lim Dong-gyu hit a home run

163
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,037
against Kang Doo-ki?

164
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,998
He's Kang Doo-ki, not kkakdugi.

165
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,252
-Come on.
-My heart almost dropped.

166
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,339
A high fastball.

167
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,299
Yes.

168
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,592
Seo Young Ju!

169
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,276
-Out.
-Nice!

170
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:29,123

171
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,750
It was Lim Dong-gyu,

172
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,043
who hits great balls, but now,

173
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,671
he's got his hands tied
against Kang Doo-ki.

174
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,131
Did you see that?

175
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,135
Kang Doo-ki just struck out the batter
after he got a sign from the side.

176
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,555
Manager Yoon Sung-bok's plays
must be working today.

177
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,349
I love you, Manager Yoon!

178
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,060
-Yong-gu.
-Yes?

179
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,397
-Replace him with Yoo Min-ho.
-Pardon?

180
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,734
Yes.

181
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:58,986
Yoo Min-ho.

182
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,780
Yes.

183
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,742
Get ready.

184
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,036
Pardon?

185
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,625
Yes, coach.

186
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,376
YOO MIN-HO

187
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,296
We're in the top
of the eighth inning already.

188
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,090
It's Yoo Min-ho.

189
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,468
Yoo Min-ho is a rookie

190
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,471
with a lot of potential
who was drafted first.

191
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,224
Once he realizes his potential,
you could say we'll be seeing

192
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,350
a young Kang Doo-ki.

193
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,852
What? Why did you replace Kang Doo-ki?

194
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,938
Are we a joke to you?

195
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,482
Yoo Min-ho is stepping up.

196
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,692
-He's not yet...
-Well,

197
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,736
the manager must have a plan.

198
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,702
Warm up a little more.

199
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,711
Manager.

200
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,588
-Min-ho isn't yet...
-I know.

201
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,135
Jin-woo and Kwan-sik,
you go get warmed up too.

202
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,053
Okay.

203
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,859
Hey.

204
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,735
Jin-woo.

205
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,614
I heard you couldn't pitch
the ball to the center.

206
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,327
You don't have to play well this year.

207
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,329
I have to.

208
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,165
You and I both have a reason to play well.

209
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,043
But those who don't have a reason
are just good.

210
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,007
I don't think the reason isn't
important in terms of being good.

211
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,676
-Don't you agree?
-I'm going to play well

212
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,970
because I have a reason.

213
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,515
Your grandmother?

214
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,350
It's her, right?

215
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,063
Don't try to play too well.
Let's just be good enough.

216
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,525
You're exhausted because you try
to be too good.

217
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,670
THE VICTORY IS OURS.

218
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,478
Hey!

219
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,939
Don't be scared
and just pitch it, all right?

220
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,190
Just relax.

221
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,319
Well, I think Yoo Min-ho is

222
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,322
adjusting his aim to pitch
fastballs as much as he likes.

223
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,823
That's what I'd like to think.

224
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,468
Yong-gu.

225
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,178
Get Jin-woo ready.

226
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,513
Okay.

227
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,266
He's a bit strange.

228
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,228
-He's not strange.
-Come on.

229
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,814
He has no control of the ball.

230
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,024
Hey.

231
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,824
Good work.

232
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,911
You seem to be in bad condition,
so let's get some rest.

233
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,538
Yes.

234
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,833
Well,

235
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,669
I guess the pitcher will be replaced
with Kim Kwan-sik,

236
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,839

237
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,507
I guess not.

238
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,219
It seems that Jang Jin-woo will take
the plate, not Kim Kwan-sik.

239
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,140
Jang Jin-woo is also a special reliever.

240
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,392
-I think it's the right choice.
-Of course.

241
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,936
Our manager is like a fox on the field.

242
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,772
Is he?

243
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,815
Yes, he is.

244
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,156
Yoo Min-ho!

245
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,867
-Yes.
-Why are you lowering your head?

246
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,660
Hold your head up.

247
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,549
If we were in the middle of the season...

248
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,884
Pardon?

249
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,429
Apart from winning and losing,

250
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,391
we must watch the game thinking
about what we should work on.

251
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:23,977
Right.

252
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,438

253
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,732
Jeez. What?

254
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,443
Who do you want to trade
and benefit from it?

255
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,655
You should know what your opponent
is in desperate need of

256
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,323
to negotiate well in the future.

257
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,368
My gosh. Yes, you're right.

258
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,662
Who do you want to take from us now?

259
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,791
Stay on your toes during the season too.

260
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:47,960
Yes.

261
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,670
I'll rely on you

262
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,797
and do well.

263
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,607
Out!

264
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,741
-Out!
-Good!

265
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,752
-Out!
-Good defense.

266
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,795
Yes!

267
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,633
What? It was a ground ball.

268
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,845
If you miss, you hit a ground ball.
Jang Jin-woo didn't pitch that well.

269
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,931
Jang Jin-woo led your batters
to hit ground balls.

270
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,059
We could win at this pace.

271
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,477
Gosh.

272
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,480
What are you talking about?
There's the promised ninth inning left.

273
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,108
Did you forget the Dreams lost
to us 13 times

274
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,860
only to win three games?

275
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,572
The Dreams are like a tonic to our team.

276
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,534

277
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,634
-Nice!
-Nice!

278
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,593
Nice!

279
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,637
The game has ended!

280
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,806
It was a great game that proved
who will dominate the new season!

281
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,725
The Dreams have won

282
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,310

283
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,854
They have crushed them!

284
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,522
Good job, Jang Jin-woo!

285
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,776
Great job!

286
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,236
That's our Dreams!

287
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,821
Jang Jin-woo didn't allow

288
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,782
even a single hit at the end.

289
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,409
We'll end the commentary
for the first practice match here.

290
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,663
We'll come back again tomorrow
with the second match

291
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,540

292
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,419
Dear fans of the Dreams,
please don't forget. We can do it.

293
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,837
We can win!

294
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,464
Let's go!

295
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:04,388

296
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,139
Please donate!

297
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,938
How pathetic.

298
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,948
Mr. Baek, I'll tell our guys

299
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,242
to play hard tomorrow.

300
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,202
Let's do it for real tomorrow.

301
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,329

302
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,332
it would be too bad for someone
who really wanted to win.

303
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,293
What are you talking about?

304
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,586
Put things in an easier way.

305
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:37,963
Bye.

306
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,892
Gosh, you startled me.

307
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,691
What's wrong with him?

308
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,738
-What's with him?
-What's the matter?

309
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,865
-What's wrong with him?
-My gosh.

310
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,325
-He's overacting.
-How can you smile

311
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,201
after losing to the worst team, you punks?

312
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,079
I mean, they were the worst team

313
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,332
when you were with them,
and Kang Doo-ki was with us.

314
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,377
-But he's with them now.
-Don't be so fussy over one practice game.

315
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,379
What, you punk?

316
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,341
How many home runs have you hit?

317
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,551
Has anyone on this team
hit more home runs than I have?

318
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:25,886
Say it!

319
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,722
-Let's just go.
-Gosh.

320
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:29,890
Let's go.

321
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,584
Yes.

322
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,213
Yes, I pitched today.

323
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,798
I did well.

324
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,718
I didn't allow any hits.

325
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,513
Yes.

326
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,515
What did you eat today?

327
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,272
Why are you crying?

328
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,324
I asked you what you ate.
Why are you crying?

329
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,417
We won the match today,
so can't we drink some beer?

330
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,293
No, you can't.

331
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,548
-No?
-No, you can't.

332
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,591
You people are frustrating.

333
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,153
See me for a moment after dinner.

334
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,447
Okay.

335
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,831
Hi.

336
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,056
Why are you all here?

337
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,893
To have a talk with you.

338
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,191
Sit down.

339
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,486
Okay.

340
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,870
Shall we watch some videos?

341
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:09,424
YOO MIN-HO

342
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:16,765
This is when you joined our team.
You weren't in good condition then.

343
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:21,144
Do you still feel the pain
in the same part of your body?

344
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,523
You might be worried
it will happen again.

345
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,610
That may be why you're controlling
your muscles unconsciously.

346
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,282
Can you...

347
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,451
turn this off?

348
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,247
No, it won't happen.

349
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:44,042
Your condition is way better now,
not to mention your pitching style.

350
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,796
Face your slump bravely.

351
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,631
You might be upset

352
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,174
to hear it's psychological,

353
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,093
but your body is perfectly fine.

354
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,096
Let's watch the next video.

355
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,032
You're capable of throwing a ball
like this, even now.

356
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,618
I doubt it.

357
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,206
Min-ho.

358
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,876
It's not that we want you
to be a starting pitcher.

359
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,004
Nor do we want you to be a relief pitcher.

360
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,423
We have Kang Doo-ki

361
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,341
and Gil Chang-ju on our team.

362
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,968
So you just have to learn and improve.

363
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,680
Right, you punk. You've been
on the field for only two years.

364
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,684
The coaches are worried about you.

365
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,783
Min-ho.

366
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,077
We don't want anything from you.

367
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,373
There's nothing in our plan
that we want you to do.

368
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,377
So just pull yourself together.

369
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,775
Are you happy...

370
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,157
to have won with Kang Doo-ki?

371
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,914
It's not because we have him.
It's because we won.

372
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:47,791
Do you think...

373
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,628
it makes sense that I'm playing...

374
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,674

375
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,386
I kept wondering.

376
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,515
"Why did Baek Seung-soo do it?"

377
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,309
You saw how Kang Doo-ki played today.

378
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,352
Hey.

379
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,563
I almost hit a home run back there.

380
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,150
I didn't bring the bat
I use against that punk.

381
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,738
I chose him
because of that slight difference.

382
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,367
I believe that slight difference
will make a big difference.

383
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,493
Bullshit.

384
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,578
You really should keep your manners...

385
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,998

386
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,128
Baseball isn't about making friends.
I just need to be good at it.

387
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,714
So why didn't you just play baseball?

388
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,849
Sorry. I wasn't trying to make a threat.

389
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,184
But...

390
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,563
why is it so important for you
to stay on the Dreams?

391
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,358
If you are with them,
you might be able to win the league.

392
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,989
You're asking me that question
because you aren't a player.

393
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,160
You think players only care about...

394
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,872
money or victory.

395
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,084
Is there another reason?

396
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,461
To you, I'm just...

397
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,173
a bad egg.

398
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,050
Having a man who slipped
a $1,000 bill into my hand

399
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,552
ever since I was in middle school.

400
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,346
A woman who waves her hand at me

401
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,432
every time she sees me
while selling dried filefish.

402
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,517
My fight song.

403
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,898
A drunken man who calls my name
as he shakes the fence.

404
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,527
To me...

405
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,199
this is more important.

406
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:46,868
Do you get it?

407
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,622
But all you care about is winning,
you jerk.

408
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,264
Did Lim Dong-gyu do any harm to you?

409
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,310
What's this?

410
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,776
He did give me a blow.

411
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,319
Where?

412
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,989
-Let's go inside.
-Don't you have to go see a doctor?

413
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,658
No, I'll go later.

414
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,288
Oh, right.

415
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,290
Who is the starting pitcher tomorrow?

416
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,292
You talked with the manager earlier today.

417
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,127
It's Gil Chang-ju.

418
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,674
I had nothing to worry about
with Kang Doo-ki.

419
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm sure Gil Chang-ju...

420
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,927
will also do well.

421
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,229
Strike.

422
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,277
Strike.

423
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,244
It's like they have two Kang Doo-kis.

424
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,718
Strike.

425
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,309
ROBERT GIL

426
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,201
That's it.

427
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,288
That's it. Lim Dong-gyu.

428
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,002
He manages a hit even when
the ball count is unfavorable to him.

429
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,923
-Lim Dong-gyu is incredible.
-That doesn't make a difference.

430
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,342
The Dreams are leading
today as well 2 to 0.

431
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,886

432
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,097
the Dreams' nutritious snack this season.

433
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,432
Switch pitchers.

434
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,392
-Yoo Min-ho, head out.
-Again?

435
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,561
Yoo Min-ho!

436
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,563
Yes.

437
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,442
ROBERT GIL

438
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,485
YOO MIN-HO

439
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,577
As soon as he takes the mound,

440
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,997
Yoo Min-ho gives two runners
a base on balls.

441
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,584
At this moment,
Lim Dong-gyu enters the field.

442
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,868
Yes.

443
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,579
Hey!

444
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,624
Wait, is it time to switch players?

445
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,628
If Jang Jin-woo, who played
well yesterday, comes out,

446
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,380

447
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,803
Starting now, I'm giving you two missions.

448
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,975
Strike Lim Dong-gyu out.

449
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,643
How can I?

450
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,395
If you can't...

451
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,139
That's it, a home run!

452
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,567
Strike Lim Dong-gyu out.

453
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,945
If you can't, give Lim Dong-gyu
a home run.

454
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,031
Excuse me?

455
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,125
It's a turnaround.

456
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,669
Lim Dong-gyu's miraculous home run...

457
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,507
-Why are you smiling?
-Excuse me?

458
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,968
They just got a home run against us.

459
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,513
-I know.
-You know?

460
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,765
You do...

461
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,183
Tell him to continue.

462
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,143
Yes.

463
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,146
Yoo Min-ho, keep it up!

464
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,154
I hate that he's on the opposing team.

465
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,657
It's great that he's on our team!

466
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,617
It sounds good!

467
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,536
Home run!

468
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,037
Lim Dong-gyu!

469
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,594
Why are you smiling? How can you?

470
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,682
It's been a while
since Yoo Min-ho's pitch was hit.

471
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,977
They will continue to get hit.

472
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,952
Don't get scared. Just relax and throw!

473
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,704
Just trust me!

474
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,201

475
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,007
Great job!

476
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,721
So I guess it's a tie, one to one.

477
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,349
The Dreams!

478
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,477
-You guys have gotten strong!
-Yes, it's all thanks to you.

479
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,231
Let's get to the postseason this year.

480
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,149
-I'll get going.
-Goodbye.

481
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,275
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

482
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:25,534
So Yoo Min-ho overcame his yips, right?

483
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,119
Ms. Lee.

484
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,163
His balls got hit that much.

485
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,540
How can you call that
overcoming something?

486
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,294
His balls can get hit
because he can throw a strike.

487
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,629
Huh?

488
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,924
And he has to be able to throw a strike
to strike someone out.

489
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,261
Rather than resulting in a base on balls
unable to face the opponent head-to-head,

490
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,763
our defense can block it,

491
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,933
so it's better for him to throw
a strike and give up a hit.

492
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,184
What?

493
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,271
Yoo Min-ho has taken a step forward.

494
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,982
The same goes for the Dreams.

495
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,360
Let's go.

496
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,697
Yes.

497
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:04,907
Let's go.

498
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,745
Yoo Min-ho.

499
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,331
Now you can throw to the center as well.

500
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,666
Do you hear me?

501
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:20,006
Just do as you did today.
You only need to do that.

502
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,844
Thank you.

503
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,263
Min-ho.

504
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,057
Great job today.

505
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,994
Players, let's all enjoy a can of beer.

506
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,623
Beer!

507
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,583
Here.

508
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,085
Don't drink too much.

509
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,171
Thank you.

510
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,549
-Thanks.
-Let's have a drink.

511
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,800
If we do win the league...

512
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,929
even by a small margin...

513
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:15,561
it will be all thanks
to the off-season training you did here.

514
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,398
If you lose by a small margin,

515
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:24,278
it will be my fault for bringing you to
a place like this for off-season training.

516
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,285
You did everything you came to do
and the off-season training is over.

517
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,704
Great job.

518
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,293
All right.

519
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,546
Great job!

520
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,173
Great job!

521
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,258
-Great job!
-Great job!

522
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,676
-Great job!
-Great job!

523
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,137
Nice!

524
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,063
Dreams!

525
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,439
-Dreams!
-Dreams!

526
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,489
INCOMING CALL

527
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:09,990
Seung-soo.

528
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,867
Yes, Heung-man.

529
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,036
Well, about Lim Dong-gyu...

530
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,164
I'm in the car with the speakerphone on.

531
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,083
Can we meet at a cafe later?

532
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,585
-Okay, then.
-Okay.

533
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,298
What about Lim Dong-gyu?

534
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,301
It's nothing.

535
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,263
You're keeping it to yourself again.

536
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,682
When will we ever get close to you?

537
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,600
Please understand.

538
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,646
I thought we were approved
as your colleagues.

539
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,067
Were you just talking to yourself
or speaking in non-honorific to Mr. Baek?

540
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,446
Do you want to be hit or be beaten up?

541
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,323
I just want to get there quietly.

542
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,830
These guys are no joke.

543
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,834
This is the list of the sellers.

544
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,713
And this is the list of the buyers.
The buyers are not confirmed, though.

545
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,298
LIST OF ATHLETES WITH DRUG USE, BUYERS

546
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,300
These are the ones that I've heard of.

547
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,015
-Can I talk to them?
-I'm afraid that'll be dangerous.

548
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,604
-Even if you came along?
-Yes.

549
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,808
Mr. Byun.

550
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,852
About the press release
of our off-season training,

551
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,439
-show them to me before you release it.
-Yes, I've finished it.

552
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:06,982
Have you?

553
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,861
We went south for the off-season training,

554
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,948

555
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,035

556
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,829
It's a new sensation
of off-season training."

557
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:25,417

558
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,629
one practice game each,
so the result wasn't so bad.

559
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,131
I thought it'd be better to emphasize

560
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,425
the content of the practice game too.

561
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,555
Yes, it looks good.

562
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,266
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you.

563
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,184
Mr. Baek.

564
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,228
Yes.

565
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,565
When you quit for a short time,

566
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:53,028
I'd like to apologize
for releasing the article right away.

567
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,451
It was difficult for me to disobey
orders from management.

568
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,870
I'm aware of what type of people they are.

569
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,043
Right. Ms. Lim.

570
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,630
I saw the list of the ceremonial
first pitchers, and it's strange.

571
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,092
Why are there so many local authorities?

572
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,970
There's an association president,
a hospital director, and the like.

573
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,723
It's just as you think.

574
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,813
The president...

575
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,817
Has he been doing it this way every year?

576
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,068
Well, I tried

577
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,364
liaising with celebrities, but it
got canceled and I was reprimanded.

578
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,284
You can call those celebrities
and repay the debt.

579
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,453
Pardon?

580
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,080
You obviously know who the audience wants.

581
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,001
Please add the names of the fans
or the local people

582
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,502
with a special history.

583
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,672
Yes...

584
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,138
Isn't this getting out of hand?

585
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,601
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK SEUNG-SOO

586
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,314
Baek Seung-soo!

587
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,150
You crazy freak.

588
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,819
Do you think you're the only one
who lives in this world?

589
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,741
Baek Seung-soo.

590
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,951
Do you think we're in Seoul?

591
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,622
They've all worked hard
in this local community.

592
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,041
We give them a chance to relieve
their stress with baseball,

593
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,877
get to know each other,

594
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,629
and be on good terms.

595
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,675
We could ask them a favor if we need to.

596
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,759
Right?

597
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:40,719
Are you listening?

598
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,766
-Who do you think should be enjoying that?
-What do you mean?

599
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,562
A president of an association,
a director of some hospital...

600
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,981
They come out to do
the ceremonial first pitch,

601
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,651
post pictures of it saying
it was a good experience,

602
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,945
and they never come back
to see a baseball game again.

603
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:02,658
They don't share a bond with the people
who come to the stadium every day.

604
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,702
The spectators would like to see

605
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,330
a celebrity or a fan with a story
much more than these people.

606
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,209
It's for when the franchise
might need help.

607
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,628
What kind of help do you get?

608
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,215
What do you need help with if you
deal with things with due process?

609
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,008
Hey, you...

610
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,847
Why do you always handle things
so squarely?

611
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,016
-Then how should I handle them?
-There are times

612
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,811
when you need to deal with things
in a nasty way.

613
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,939
How would people work around you
when they're so afraid that

614
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,315
you'll find a fault in them?

615
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,818
That's why you're getting fired!

616
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,616
I'm not fired yet.

617
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,953
I'd never do something to shame myself.

618
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,330
You won't even be there
for the ceremonial first pitch.

619
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,292
-Why are you meddling in this matter?
-Then should I work half-heartedly

620
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,544
just because it'll happen
when I'm not here?

621
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,629
Then what about the politicians?

622
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,924
They don't know
whether they'll be re-elected or not.

623
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,011
-Should they take a break?
-Stop picking apart my words.

624
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,055
There's no room
for reconsideration on this.

625
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,852
It's not something you should meddle in
either. Don't ever do this again.

626
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,729
I won't let it go next time.

627
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,135
Ms. Lee.

628
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,096
What?

629
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,310
Where's Ms. Lim?

630
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,564
She was in her seat just now.

631
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:01,944
Really?

632
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,571
I told you, didn't I?

633
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,156
Yes.

634
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,786
I have to go.

635
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,084
Where were you?

636
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,796
I went for some coffee.

637
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,049
Please show a diligent attitude.

638
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,012
And if you think some orders seem unfair,
including mine,

639
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,056
for once in your life,

640
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,433
try resisting.

641
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,107
That's how our team became rotten
little by little.

642
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,325
I see.

643
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,244
I ruined this team.

644
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,206
Was it because of me

645
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,543
that this team has been
at the bottom for four years?

646
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,304
The Dreams have become united
after the off-season training.

647
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,264
At least that's what I thought.

648
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,100
He's not a person to care about that.

649
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,689
Do you want to have dinner
with Mr. Baek tonight?

650
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,733
No.

651
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,903
Then I guess it'll have to be
just me and him.

652
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,322
I'll come with you then.

653
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,744
What's the matter?

654
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:36,705
I don't know.

655
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,421
Yes.

656
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:47,883
Oh, hey.

657
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,260
What brings you here without notice?

658
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,095
Have a seat.

659
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,222
No, you can sit here.

660
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,682
Pardon?

661
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,818
You must have been very busy lately.

662
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,781
What happened
with the personnel appointments?

663
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,825
President Ko.

664
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,578
When I was...

665
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:22,334
first coming back and forth
as the acting owner of this club...

666
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,627
Yes.

667
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,921
I'm way younger than you, right?

668
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,631
Yes.

669
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:31,593
Then, why did you treat me so well
at first?

670
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,844
Did I?

671
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,267
I just thought
I could learn a lot from you.

672
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,938
When I first took up
the job as the acting owner,

673
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,399
I was acting up

674
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,319
with the free agents thinking
this team could be something.

675
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,531
We spent quite a lot of money at the time.

676
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,116
You've shown your will.

677
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,661
You should do that when you're young.

678
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,913
Every time the head office called
at the time,

679
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,792
you covered for me, didn't you?

680
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,210
Gosh.

681
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,965
You must have had a hard time.

682
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:11,925
I know...

683
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,722
I shouldn't be doing this.

684
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,683
You can tell me everything.

685
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,520
I started my career earlier than you.

686
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,688
Am I right?

687
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,323
I've gotten a complaint...

688
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,579
about the list of guest throwers

689
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,581
for this season.

690
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,166
Oh, that?

691
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,795
Mr. Baek acted like he was going
to keep being a general manager forever,

692
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:52,007
-so I gave him a scolding.
-They brought up the issue...

693
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,802
so I've gone over

694
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,057
the lists of guest throwers
for the past two years.

695
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,310
There were a lot of problems.

696
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,231
Why on earth did you invite
heads of local organizations?

697
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:10,901
Sir.

698
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,528
This problem isn't about direction.

699
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,780
What are you doing?

700
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,990
What are you doing right now?

701
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,205
Focus on the baseball team.

702
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,458
I can't let just anyone take care of it.

703
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,797
I know what I did to Kyung-jun
was wrong, but...

704
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,716
What are you talking about?
I commended you for it.

705
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,430
Use me according to my competence.

706
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,058
I know I can do a good job.

707
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,060
Do you think it's simple
liquidating a business

708
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,395
that makes seven billion won
worth of deficit every year?

709
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,356
If you can't deal with this,

710
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,068
why must I keep you being criticized
that our company is nepotistic?

711
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,448
Where is that same guy who went down
on his knees for his college tuitions?

712
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:04,287
Do you want to go back to the bottom pit
by your father's side?

713
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,927
You got ousted.

714
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,558
Is it because you beat Kwon Kyung-jun up?

715
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,561
I'll give you enough pension.

716
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,566
Why would you beat
around the bush in front of me?

717
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,651
You could just say
things happened that way.

718
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,282
I should've married
my daughter off sooner.

719
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,076
I'm sorry.

720
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,504
GOPCHANG STORY

721
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,051
We're still so cautious

722
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,096
while getting closer to each other
even after some time.

723
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,055
Right?

724
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,725
What?

725
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,935
Shut what?

726
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,521
Shut your mouth, you punk.

727
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:13,648
Shut my mouth?

728
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,068
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

729
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,322
Hold on.

730
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,788
You can eat now.

731
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,964
-Do you have something to tell me?
-Gosh, it's hot. Wait a second.

732
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,509
I'll speak after I swallow this.

733
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:53,104
Everyone in the company went through a lot
to bring you back to the office.

734
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,564
And?

735
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,275
But you didn't even come
to the get-together.

736
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,820
So some people might be

737
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,156
a little upset about it.

738
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,117
I think that came to my mind once.

739
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,663
You want me to be more friendly.
Is that what you want to say?

740
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,872
Yes.

741
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,041
Starting with us.

742
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,964
Ms. Lim deserves to be respected.

743
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,675
As far as I know, Ms. Lim is often late,

744
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,594
leaves work early, and enjoys gossip.

745
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,055
Is there something I'm not aware of?

746
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,934
-She's Lim Dong-gyu's older sister.
-His sister?

747
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:35,272
No, not exactly.
It's more like an honorable nickname.

748
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,650
You may not like

749
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,611
the way she is right now,
but there were times

750
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:45,448
when the franchise made profits
worth two billion won through marketing.

751
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,701
Oh, really?

752
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,537
It's hard to believe for me too,
but it's true.

753
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,000
Even the president doesn't
complain much to her.

754
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,378
When Ms. Lim worked enthusiastically,

755
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:03,925
people joked about how they could pay
for Lim Dong-gyu's salary thanks to her.

756
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,761
Ground painting, exciting zone,

757
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,263
LED ads.

758
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,516
She came up with all these ideas.

759
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,476
It's true that she's competent.

760
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:14,936
Right.

761
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,480
In fact, all the team leaders

762
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,941
are not incompetent.

763
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,611
They may not be as competent as you are...

764
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,365
but they did make attempts for a change.

765
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,909
I want you to know that.

766
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,957
I'm an annoying jerk
who doesn't recognize others easily.

767
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,127
Right, I'm aware of it.

768
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,131
But that doesn't mean
I'm itching to fight.

769
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,843
What we need right now is motivation.

770
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:52,640
I want our front office
to forget about the past

771
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,019
and be constructive as soon as possible.

772
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,479
What I want...

773
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,815
is just that.

774
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,789
This way. Follow me.

775
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,338
JAESONG

776
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,598
What?

777
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,978
We're from the investigation team.

778
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,897
Are you Mr. Byun Chi-hoon?

779
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,483
Yes, that's me.

780
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,777
-We need to talk to you.
-What?

781
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,404
Hold on.

782
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,697
What are you doing?

783
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,951
-Why are you taking that?
-What are you doing?

784
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,452
Leave it be!

785
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,787
What are you doing?

786
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:56,955
What is this?

787
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,962
From now on,
we'll start inspecting Mr. Byun,

788
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,340
considering him as a thief
who caused harm to the company.

789
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:09,801
What?

790
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,638
-Let's go.
-What...

791
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,306
-Mr. Byun.
-Wait.

792
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,685
What did I do wrong?
What's wrong with you?

793
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,146
Stop!

794
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,605
What are you doing?

795
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:23,940
Mr. Baek.

796
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,151
We're from the headquarters.

797
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,527
Move aside.

798
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,365
-Goodness. Wait.
-Mr. Byun.

799
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,491
Mr. Baek.

800
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:37,954
Mr. Byun.

801
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,208
What did I do wrong?

802
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,835
Follow us already.

803
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,045
You need to tell me.

804
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,964
What is going on?

805
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,549
Tell me!

806
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,898
You're here, Mr. Baek.

807
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,569
Where is the president?

808
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,451
Thanks to you...

809
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,620
CEO KWON KYUNG-MIN

810
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,082
...he went home.

811
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,502
What are you doing?

812
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,547
Go make some coffee.
Make it delicious, but not too sweet.

813
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,132
I said, what are you doing?

814
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,728
What if there are players who took drugs?
Would you cover it up?

815
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,230
Do you mean by Kang Doo-ki?

816
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,273
What do you want?

817
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,025

818
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,944
Lim Dong-gyu's skills are from doping.

819
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,113
Kang Doo-ki. Do you completely trust him?
