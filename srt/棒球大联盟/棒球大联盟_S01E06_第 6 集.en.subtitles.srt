1
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,366
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE STORY

2
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,576
HAVE NO RELATION TO REALITY.

3
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,952
We have high goals.

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,078
We'll give up Andy.

5
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,539
Let's look at the video
of the foreign players.

6
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,374
Miles? How much is he worth?

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,668
We're in talks for $500,000.

8
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,421
I'm Robert Gil and I'm here
to serve as a guide.

9
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,298
There hasn't been a time when

10
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,467
a foreign player's contract ended easily,

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,218
so I'm a bit worried.

12
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,845
He says the price went up overnight.

13
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,306
Double the price all of a sudden? No way.

14
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,058
That's being too selfish.

15
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,185
We'd be taking Miles at the right price.

16
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,312
Mr. Oh Sa-hoon, do you want to make a bet?

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,313
Who's laughing now?

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,273
You've got quite the translator.

19
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,233
You don't know Gil Chang-ju?

20
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,902
Robert Gil is Gil Chang-ju.

21
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,279
I'm legally American now.

22
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,782
If you think about going back to Korea...

23
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,242
Who would recruit a player like me?

24
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,703
People see me as the guy who
evaded military service.

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,538
This is just wrong!

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,373
Are you to be blamed the whole season?

27
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,042
Do you think we can sign

28
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,794
a better foreign player for $500,000?

29
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,504
I couldn't see the problem,

30
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,130
so I requested it be discharged.

31
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,423
Mr. Gil.

32
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,093
Do you really not have any reason
to be desperate?

33
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,011
I can play baseball again.

34
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,306
I told you I could bet
that we would be the ones to smile first.

35
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,432
Chin up.

36
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,351
This is not even a big deal.

37
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,852
Let's go.

38
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,485
PRESS CONFERENCE 2019

39
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,239
I'm Reporter Kim Jung-gu
of Financial Modern.

40
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,825
Let me make my question
short and straight to the point.

41
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,368
Why is it Gil Chang-ju?

42
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,286
Well,

43
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,789
he can throw a strong fastball
to wherever he wants.

44
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,666
That's the kind of player he is.

45
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,668
Did you consider
what the people would think?

46
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,130
We brought the best player
we could choose,

47
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,465
although his past isn't so ideal.

48
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,217
I'm Jung Soon-geun of Jungdong Daily.

49
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,720
Mr. Gil became an American citizen
to avoid military duty.

50
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,348
If he gets to play baseball again
in this country,

51
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,433
other Korean men will
most likely feel deprived.

52
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,018
What will you do about it?

53
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,692
Jungdong Daily?

54
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,947
I won't deny that Mr. Gil played
a role in that sense of deprivation.

55
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,699
I'm aware of it,

56
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,034
and he's aware of it, too.

57
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,246
Right, he will have to bear criticism

58
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,039
that's much harsher than other people,

59
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,833
like the sons of media owners
or politicians

60
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,794
who were exempted from military duty

61
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,130
for excuses like essential hypertension.

62
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,300
But you know what?

63
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,595
There was a young baseball player
with a promising future.

64
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,389
He was selected as the ace player
of the national youth team.

65
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,809
He played in a total of four games,
including two preliminaries.

66
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,856
He was the winning pitcher
for the semi-finals, and for the finals,

67
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,982
he was the relief pitcher.

68
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,400
His team won the championship,

69
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,694
but unfortunately, he injured his elbow.

70
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,198
He went to the States for surgery
and focused on rehab.

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,241
After the rehab,

72
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,701
his results came out.

73
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,744
NINE WINS THIS SEASON

74
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,370
Then he finally got recognized.

75
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,789
However,

76
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,626
he was faced with the time
to serve in the army

77
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,546
when he became a promising rookie
in the Major League.

78
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,134
Around that time, there was a survey

79
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,846
for which 70 percent of the answers
favored naturalization.

80
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,308
Are you saying
his naturalization was just?

81
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,769
I do not think it was just,

82
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,729
and that is why
I'm making it a long story.

83
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,772
-What?
-Goodness.

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,947
Can I ask you one last question?

85
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,452
I'm Kim Young-chae of Baseball Is Life.

86
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,790
There might be a way
for him to be forgiven.

87
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,962
What do you think about him

88
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,672
serving in the army now?

89
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,560
Due to time constraints,
we'll end the press conference here.

90
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,020
You may get up.

91
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,857
-Hey.
-Please answer.

92
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,150
Please answer the question.

93
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,030
If you end it now, it seems like
you're running away.

94
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,991
You're right. We're running away.

95
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,660
You have to face them head on.
We all came here determined.

96
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,787
I don't know how to fight
with my hands tied.

97
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,247
We fight when we know how to win.

98
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,291
I have something I'd like to say.

99
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,792
Say it later. Let's go.

100
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,050
AMERICAN GIL CHANG-JU COMES BACK

101
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,969
Will the Dreams rise back up?

102
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,015
I said we'd be willing
to pay up to $900,000.

103
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,808
Yes, you did.

104
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,729
But they used only 500,000
and brought a lousy one?

105
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,772
But...

106
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,483
he's played in the Major League.

107
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,737
If he were that great,
why would he come for only 500,000?

108
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,114
His price represents his skills.

109
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,991
Yes, that's true.

110
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,452
Then, when Baek Seung-soo comes,

111
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,288
do I have to compliment him

112
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,331
or scold him?

113
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:35,293
I think we need to see first
how the public opinion is.

114
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,128
No, I think

115
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,007
I should compliment him
for showing some clueless courage.

116
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,885
Baek Seung-soo.

117
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,679
He's a bit...

118
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,725
strange, isn't he?

119
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,979
Aware of the controversy
surrounding Gil Chang-ju avoiding

120
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,690
his military service,
the Dreams held a press conference.

121
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,362
General Manager Baek Seung-soo showed
his conviction regarding the player.

122
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,910
-You're home.
-Yes. How have you been?

123
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,829
Did you not eat yet?

124
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,041
You must be tired.
I'll prepare the food today.

125
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,377
Thanks.

126
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,967
Gosh.

127
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,763
While I prepare the food, you should relax

128
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,349
and take out the presents.

129
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,061
It doesn't have to be
anything heartfelt or serious.

130
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,397
It just has to be expensive.

131
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,504
HIGH SCHOOL

132
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,099
Seung-soo, let's eat.

133
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,228
Okay.

134
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,991
I didn't crave any Korean food
when I was away,

135
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,535
so I thought I was very American
in that sense.

136
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,955
But I was wrong.
I was forgetting this taste.

137
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,832
How dirty.

138
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,542
Talk after eating.

139
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,587
I might be on TV tomorrow.
Can you take out a beauty mask?

140
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,549
No one would notice even if you had
five watermelon seeds on your face.

141
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,676
Do you have to say it like that?

142
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,345
Hey, are you sure
you brought the right person?

143
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,014
There's a lot of controversy.

144
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,308
He's a good person
who takes responsibility.

145
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,768
-If he had responsibility--
-Mom.

146
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,355
We should stand by his side, at least.

147
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,524
And apart from that,

148
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,068
he has a strong sense
of responsibility for his family.

149
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,530
That's why he worked
as a coordinator to earn money.

150
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,532
At night, he'd train.

151
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,992
He'll do well.

152
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:14,994
How would you know?

153
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,787
That's how your dad was.

154
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,081
After he knew you were in my belly,

155
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,167
he brought home the most money
he ever did. Here.

156
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,091
Before I was born,
Dad was too much of a playboy.

157
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,887
But when he has
a heavy burden on his shoulders,

158
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,722
you have to believe and be at ease.

159
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,183
Even if he doesn't play well,

160
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,851
don't blame him too much.

161
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,686
Don't feel sympathy for him!

162
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,647
He gets paid way more than me!

163
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,564
Way more!

164
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,067
It's because you get paid too little!

165
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,737
There you go again talking about my pay.

166
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,327
ROBERT GIL

167
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,208
Sir.

168
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,918
Look who's here.

169
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,548
Didn't we have more journalists
expected to come?

170
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,218
Just looking at the press conference,

171
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,887
it didn't seem like he'd answer
any tough questions.

172
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,723
I guess the journalists
weren't feeling it either.

173
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,934
Let's wait.

174
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,311
-Wait for what?
-Our hidden card.

175
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,193
Hello!

176
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,114
Hello!

177
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,241
-Hello.
-Have you been well?

178
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,450
Yes.

179
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,161
This is our operations manager.

180
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,497
I know of Ms. Lee Se-young.

181
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,541
We met at the conference
and before that as well.

182
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,584
How did you know her?

183
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,128
If I didn't know the first female
operations manager

184
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,380
in our country, I should quit
my job. Am I wrong?

185
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,135
But at the press conference,

186
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,887
you were too mean.

187
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,556
I was?

188
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,144
I only asked a question
that everyone was curious about.

189
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:07,857
If you were considerate of Gil Chang-ju,

190
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,902
you wouldn't have asked that question
as soon as he returned to Korea.

191
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,159
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello, sir.

192
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,785
Hello, everyone.

193
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,204
Hello, sir.

194
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,999
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

195
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,542
Is it hard to get an interview?

196
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,045
Do you think I would have
asked only once or twice

197
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,172
when it was you who wants the interview?

198
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,759
-He says he doesn't want to.
-Then I'll ask myself,

199
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,594
-face to face.
-What?

200
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,226
Hello, Mr. Baek. I'm Kim Young-chae.

201
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,395
Yes. Hello.

202
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,065
Confirm with the strategy analysis team
if their cameras are ready.

203
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,316
Yes, sir.

204
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,778
-A hidden card?
-Yes, a hidden card.

205
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,073
I have a lot of questions.

206
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,991
You can go through the PR team.

207
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,035
So you can reject it through the PR team?

208
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,036
Yes.

209
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,542
The Dreams is the club that's
preparing for the biggest changes.

210
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,921
Is there a reason
you're not replacing the manager?

211
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,383
It must be similar to the reason
the producer isn't replacing you.

212
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,306
I appreciate your kind words.

213
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,351
I'll officially be rejected
through the PR team.

214
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,831
-I'm nervous.
-Are they paying you more

215
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,625
-for pitching better balls?
-Mr. Baek said

216
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,672
that everyone will be convinced why
he brought me as the season begins.

217
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,340
But...

218
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,009
I'd like to convince them right now.

219
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,723
I don't think I should let him be
criticized because of me anymore.

220
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,268
May I throw the ball
with maximum strength?

221
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,146
Do you think any team would keep us
in check or analyze us

222
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,399
just because you're pitching
a little bit better?

223
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,817
Just pitch as you always do.

224
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,425
Mr. Gil Chang-ju,

225
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,053
please tell us how you feel
about your return to Korea.

226
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,265
For letting me stand on this mound,

227
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,267
for all the reporters

228
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,978
paying attention to me,

229
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,107
and for calling me Gil Chang-ju,
not Robert Gil,

230
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,525
I appreciate it all.

231
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,902
Yes.

232
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,530
You've just shown us
some good pitches.

233
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,993
It feels like I'm sparing words
of praise by saying "good."

234
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,998
I'll say it directly.
Those were very powerful pitches.

235
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,458
Thank you.

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,293
Before that,

237
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,338
I'd like to apologize first.

238
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,343
There is no excuse for the fact that
I've let down many baseball fans.

239
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,930
And I'll accept any criticism
on that matter.

240
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,016
I sincerely apologize again.

241
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,687
Let's wrap it up. Good work, everyone.

242
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,610
Hey.

243
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,994
Hey. I constantly search my name

244
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,873
and the name of our group
just like those kids nowadays.

245
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,960
-And what is going on?
-Well, sir...

246
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,754
The firm's name keeps coming up
in the sports section.

247
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,340
What do we do?

248
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,551
I apologize.

249
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,386
Why are they making a fuss

250
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,263
for something useless and of no profit?

251
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,056
I apologize.

252
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,268
Did you bring a troublemaker from the US?

253
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,938
Yes, the general manager has been

254
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,482
causing a bit of trouble recently.

255
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,818
But it's all part of the plan.

256
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,320
On a larger scale,
it's going as you have wished.

257
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,238
Kyung-min.

258
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:25,739
Yes, sir.

259
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,242
You're good at your job
because we're related by blood.

260
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,535
You know that, right?

261
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,092
Boy, what if they win the championship?

262
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,430
My father was complimenting you yesterday.

263
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,016
Relax.

264
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,560
What did he say?

265
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,271
-That you're better than your father.
-Hey!

266
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,480
I mean,

267
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,858
that's what my father said.

268
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,985
Fine.

269
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,405
-It's like you're going to bite me.
-Don't be dramatic.

270
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,157
Dramatic?

271
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,701
Let's not do this to each other.

272
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,622
We're cousins.
We should be friendly to each other.

273
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,000
And our objectives are different in scale.

274
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,793
I didn't say anything.

275
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,673
Let's just go eat.

276
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,350
DREAMS

277
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,143
And so?

278
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,270
I'm afraid that...

279
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,024
I won't be able to work any longer.

280
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,487
All right.

281
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,948
STRATEGY ANALYSIS TEAM LEADER,
YOO KYUNG-TAEK

282
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,586
The interview of Gil Chang-ju
by Kim Young-chae will be

283
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,381
broadcast the week after next week.

284
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,551
Chang-ju can pitch balls well for sure.

285
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,722
Young-chae said his pitches were
the best among what she saw

286
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,807
around the clubs this winter.

287
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,394
Were you there
for the interview she was doing?

288
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,729
Yes, of course.

289
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,024
-Any problematic questions?
-I told her repeatedly.

290
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,317
It was mainly focused on today's pitching,

291
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,903
and his resolution for the future.

292
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,657
I know she adds some
personal opinions in the studio

293
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,658
outside the interview.

294
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,201
Are you also her fan?

295
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,412
That's the secret to her popularity.

296
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,664
She engages viewers with her journalism.

297
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,374
And also,

298
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,126
she's pretty.

299
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,505
The opinions that she adds in the studio

300
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,591
could get us in trouble.

301
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,676
No way.

302
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,762
She won't be giving up her chance
to cover our club.

303
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,971
Have you told her not to?

304
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,765
No.

305
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,560
She'll keep hitting our sore spots
and think it's journalism.

306
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,316
Should I call her?

307
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,400
No.

308
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,485
I'll...

309
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,154
make sure.

310
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,157
The salary negotiation
of our players is coming soon.

311
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,494
As soon as I get the raw data
regarding the negotiation,

312
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,411
I'll hand it over.

313
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,329
RAW DATA

314
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,246
Yes.

315
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,873
We'll prepare to get the data.

316
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,374
It'll be arduous.

317
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,753
Because upper management
thinks players are

318
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,963
obsessed with money
when they're not even good,

319
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,675
the total amount of salaries is low
considering our bad record.

320
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,971
But it's something we get done
somehow every year.

321
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,431
And...

322
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,476
Lee Jin-bum of the strategy analysis team

323
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,686
-decided to quit.
-Jin-bum?

324
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,397
But he was a reliable employee.

325
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,900
His family runs a big orchard,
and he went there.

326
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,151
An orchard?

327
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,489
That is some reason to quit.

328
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,826
The employees of your division
are being replaced quite often.

329
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,620
Kids these days can't stand long
if you treat them too harshly.

330
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,831
We need someone who can work longer.

331
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,625
For the scout and strategy analysis teams,

332
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,752
it's never good to change staff often.

333
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,296
-Isn't it?
-How about

334
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,049
we hire one
through open recruitment this time?

335
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,261
Why?

336
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,389
Jin-bum used to handle data,

337
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,224
so rather than a former player...

338
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,851
It's someone that I can work with.

339
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,020
I know that.
That's why I'm just suggesting.

340
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,232
Since we're at it,

341
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,361
I think our teams are too closed
when it comes to sabermetrics.

342
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,822
If the experts in that area
apply for the job,

343
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,867
it wouldn't hurt to talk to them once.

344
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,327
How would I work
with someone I don't know?

345
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,290
I've never interfered in the recruitment
of the operations team,

346
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,916
and I don't plan to in the future.

347
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,335
I prefer not to work with someone

348
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
who hasn't struck out anyone
or hit a home run before.

349
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,136
Whether it's black or white,
a cat merely has to hunt mice well.

350
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,934
I also haven't struck out anyone
or hit a home run before.

351
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,315
In the Major League,

352
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,401
the number of coaches
who weren't athletes is growing.

353
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,863
Also, an analyst works close
to the players.

354
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,281
In the Pelicans,

355
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,285
I know that a sabermetrics expert
is working as an analyst.

356
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,828
And they're not doing so bad.

357
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,079
I believe

358
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,416
someone with experience
in playing baseball sees things better.

359
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,961
I still practice batting every morning.
Do you know why?

360
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,963
I wouldn't know.

361
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,884
The players won't even listen to me
if I'm not in shape.

362
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,929
No matter how hard I try
to analyze the data

363
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,139
and tell them to fix this and that
with the videos,

364
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,558
they still say they know
their own bodies best.

365
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,436
And you think an ordinary person
could tell them

366
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,730
what to do because they've
watched a few baseball videos?

367
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,148
Do you think they'd listen?

368
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,321
If it were me, I'd rather fix
their misconception

369
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,658
instead of changing myself
to their standard.

370
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,831
Let's do an open recruitment.

371
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,917
Have the one you recommended apply, too.

372
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,337
Let's end our meeting here.

373
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,006
-Good work.
-Thanks.

374
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,220
He says catching a mouse
is all that matters.

375
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,728
I can catch your pitches
with my eyes closed.

376
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,313
What? Hey.

377
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,232
Don't you know
I'm just playing catch with you?

378
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,193
Really? Then throw it properly this time.

379
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,319
All right.

380
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,780
I'm retired, but I still have my skills.

381
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,699
Here I go.

382
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,117
All right.

383
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,871
Are you okay?

384
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,207
Are you hurt? Let me see.

385
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,668
I knew this would happen.

386
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,461
Let's stop for today.

387
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,006
You're hurt, so don't pay me
for today's lesson.

388
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,467
Come on. It was my fault.
I still need to pay you.

389
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,346
I see you are sensible
the more I get to know you.

390
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,764
You're cool, too.

391
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,474
-You know that?
-Goodness.

392
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,934
Why are you so enthusiastic?

393
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,227
I'm not.

394
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,605
It's true that all of my students
like baseball.

395
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,400
But none of them take lessons
often and consistently like you.

396
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,694
-You don't even spare yourself.
-You see,

397
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,572
I might grow to like it

398
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,366
-if I do this.
-Like what? Baseball?

399
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,451
Well,

400
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,037
-something similar.
-Softball?

401
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,913
Gosh, I won't pay.

402
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,461
Jae-hee, about the data
sent by the strategy analysis team...

403
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,218
Why are you laughing?

404
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,471
Do you feel his absence?

405
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,805
No.

406
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,142
-He knows how to earn his keep.
-Look at you.

407
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,394
You gave him a hard time
for his connections.

408
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,479
Is he helpful now?

409
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,067
Connections...

410
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,111
THE DREAMS OPEN RECRUITMENT, 2016,
WAITING ROOM

411
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,326
-Hello.
-Hello.

412
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,581
-Go to that side.
-Thank you.

413
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,140
Is he the one who our CEO mentioned?
Han Jae-hee.

414
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,434
Right, from Jaesong Group.

415
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,856
VERIFICATION SLIP

416
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,902
Mr. Han Jae-hee.

417
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,198
Oh, hello.

418
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,548
-Mr. Han Jae-hee?
-Yes.

419
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,509
-Thank you for coming.
-It's my pleasure.

420
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:52,139
What's your resolution in applying
for our franchise?

421
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,766
That I'll work hard.

422
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,229
Is there any department you want to join?

423
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,106
What departments do you have?

424
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,774
A lot. Operations team is one.

425
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,694
Then I'll choose that department.

426
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,449
You're so confident,
unlike the other applicants.

427
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,825
-That's not true.
-I like it.

428
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,661
What's your problem?

429
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,956
-Do you have a death wish?
-What are you saying?

430
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,043
Why do you think
the other applicants are here?

431
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,628
I don't understand.

432
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,507
They studied much harder than you
and are desperate to get a job,

433
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,510
but they won't get hired
because of some jerk like you.

434
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,973
You jerk, using connections.

435
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,310
Apologize to those people
before you go home.

436
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,603
And you.

437
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,855
Don't come even if you get hired.

438
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,357
I'll never let that happen.

439
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,651
But if you pass just in case,

440
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,862
don't come.

441
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,114
Or I'll kill you.

442
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,457
Darn, what was that?

443
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,048
Wait.

444
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,009
Hey, Mr. Connections.

445
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,302
Gosh.

446
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,470
What?

447
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,182
You didn't get hired through connections,
so why did you answer?

448
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,642
Are you drunk?

449
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,269
-Then go home quietly.
-Hey, you little...

450
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,148
You didn't get favor
from your connections because of me.

451
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,983
Why are you bringing that up again?

452
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,361
You applied again after a year.

453
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,820
Did you feel wronged about it?

454
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,113
No.

455
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,908
I thought it would be better
than being hired like that

456
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,159
and getting nagged.

457
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,328
I knew someone would give me a hard time.

458
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,289
Why are you here? Isn't it your vacation?

459
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,417
This isn't Europe or anything.
I have a lot of work,

460
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,753
and my direct superior
is super slow at work.

461
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,463
I just can't go home.

462
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,048
You little...

463
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,800
How much have you done?

464
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,593
I'm about to do it now.

465
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,011
Then stop patronizing me.

466
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,180
Mr. Baek.

467
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,308
Didn't you leave work?

468
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,603
Is the analyst done taking resumes?

469
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,272
Yes, would you like to check them?

470
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,274
-Do we have a lot of applicants?
-No.

471
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,359
It took place in a rush,
so about ten people applied.

472
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,279
Let's interview them tomorrow.

473
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,321
All of them?

474
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,700
It's better we interview them all
because there aren't many.

475
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,411
-Okay.
-Good.

476
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,332
I'm home.

477
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:25,875
Hi.

478
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,545
Why don't you talk to me in person?

479
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,463
It's your exam tomorrow. Is that it?

480
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,840
Let's talk later.

481
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,934
Is it fun playing baseball?

482
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,854
Yes, it's fun. But...

483
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,731
But what?

484
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,900
It's true that I like baseball,

485
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,987
but I'm confused why I'm doing this,

486
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,739
because I play baseball all the time.

487
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,491
Young-soo.

488
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,870
Don't be weak, you punk.

489
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,414
Have you ever seen me
come home early and rest up?

490
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,583
No.

491
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,878
It's a battle out in the world.

492
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,589
At least you're doing what you like.

493
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,634
-Right.
-Good.

494
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,177
Any other concerns?

495
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,556
-Nothing.
-Deal with your odor first.

496
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,518
Go tell Mom to get you some strawberries.
I bought them on my way home.

497
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,699
AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS

498
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,992
SEASON RECORDS, 2019

499
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,301
YAMANSE

500
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,553
THE HEAT CHANGES EVERYTHING, EVEN BASEBALL

501
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,973
As for hitters to begin with,

502
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,103
YEAR, AVG, OBP, SLG, ISO, HRP

503
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,354
It's scientifically proven.

504
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,327
You don't seem well today.

505
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,165
You don't have to pass the exam.

506
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,334
I need to.

507
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,712
When you become an actuary,

508
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,715
let's save money together

509
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,800
and have our parents
move to a closer place.

510
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,970
What? Do you feel burdened?

511
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,098
A little burden is needed, you punk.

512
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,562
I'm leaving. Oh...

513
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,314
Don't struggle traveling,
and just take a taxi.

514
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,359
Bye.

515
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:57,944
Good luck.

516
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,667
Can I let the first interviewee come in?

517
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,835
Yes.

518
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,219
I saw on your resume
that you're studying sabermetrics.

519
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,388
-That's right.
-I'll ask you a question about it.

520
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,683
Tell us anything you know

521
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,979
about the least sample records
that can evaluate a batter's ability.

522
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,731
Are you referring to the domestic league?

523
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,233
It's different depending on the index.

524
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,235
Right, you know.

525
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,322
It changes according to which
analytical technique you use,

526
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,241
but as far as I know,
about 200 at-bats for strikeouts,

527
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,118
400 at-bats for walks,

528
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,453
and 300 at-bats for SLG.

529
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,829
HITTER'S BATTING PRODUCTIVITY

530
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,082
Then in terms of the Major League,
the sample should be...

531
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,502
As far as I know,
fewer samples are needed.

532
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,587
-Why is that?
-Well...

533
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,465
I'm not sure.

534
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,133
WAITING ROOM

535
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,855
Think of it as an experience
even if you fail.

536
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,398
You've studied hard.

537
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,989
What's the answer
to your question from earlier?

538
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,409
There's no definite answer to it.

539
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,537
I just wanted to see him
interpret the statistics.

540
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,747
Where did you learn

541
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,332
things like that?

542
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,792
I read books.

543
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,211
I also often check Yamanse for reference.

544
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,092
RESUME

545
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,059
It's okay. I'll try it on my own.

546
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,522
Hello.

547
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,482
Hello.

548
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,610
Shall we begin the interview?

549
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,155
BAEK YOUNG-SOO

550
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,865
I'll deliver it for you.

551
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,408
Thank you.

552
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,666
THE HEAT CHANGES EVERYTHING

553
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,792
Gosh.

554
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:05,214
Are you Robinson of Yamanse?

555
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,052
You wrote "The Heat Changes
Everything, Even Baseball"

556
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,221
and the post
about the Pythagorean winning data.

557
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,306
Right?

558
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,225
You don't know him?

559
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,144
I don't.

560
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,772
Oh, I see. He's really famous.

561
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:27,111
I'm Baek Young-soo and I often post
on Yamanse using my ID Robinson.

562
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,822
I chose a few articles

563
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,200
about the team performance analysis

564
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,328
from the things I've written so far.

565
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,622
You wrote a lot.

566
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,332
By the way,

567
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,085
is this really helpful
for the team performance?

568
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,338
You must be the strategy
analysis team leader.

569
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,799
-You're right.
-I'm sure

570
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,677
you already apply sabermetrics
when analyzing the statistics.

571
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,638
You make and gather the detailed
stats of each player, right?

572
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,016
But you make different choices
based on how you interpret data.

573
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,978
You would know it well
if you've ever played baseball.

574
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,440
There are so many reasons
people don't see beyond the numbers.

575
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,568
Most players that hit a slump
all of a sudden

576
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,863
turn out to have personal issues
with their girlfriend or family.

577
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,534
But sabermetrics has no clue
about such issues, right?

578
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,494
Among all the sports,

579
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,497
I think baseball is the best one
to be analyzed by numbers.

580
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,375
In basketball, volleyball, and football,

581
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:26,587
all the plays are easily
affected by other players' moves.

582
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,341
But for baseball,
players can make strikeouts and hits

583
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,343
without the help of other players.

584
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,764
Not introducing sabermetrics
in modern baseball

585
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,768
is the same as not willing to be healthy.

586
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,772
Even if you study sabermetrics,
you don't get an official diploma.

587
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,066
So if you're not getting a job
in this field,

588
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,402
you'd feel there is too much to study.

589
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,238
Seung-soo, what are you doing?

590
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,656
If I...

591
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,492
quit baseball,

592
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,037
can you teach me how to study?

593
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,497
Young-soo.

594
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,126
You're talented in baseball
more than any other thing.

595
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,544
You're not smart that way.

596
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,758
-Hello? Young-soo, I need to go.
-Seung-soo,

597
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,760
I have a game today.

598
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,136
Yes. And what?

599
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,097
And my pelvis has been hurting
since yesterday.

600
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,516
I heard that suffering from pain
is inevitable

601
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,562
for all players as they use
explosive energy at once.

602
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,858
Young-soo, don't look back
and look forward.

603
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,943
Just go forward, okay?

604
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,655
Tell me how many hits you got
after the game.

605
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,161
To my knowledge, even the Sabers,

606
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,791
the champion of last season,
didn't fully adopt sabermetrics.

607
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,209
Many think the same as you

608
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,670
because the Sabers didn't hire
regular workers for stat analysis.

609
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,630
But as far as I know,

610
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:54,092
they have two contract workers
designated for the task,

611
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,176
and the two refused

612
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,678
to work as regular workers for the team.

613
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,056
And their wages were raised
a lot recently.

614
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,934
Do you think those who studied
the mere numbers

615
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,687
can work for baseball teams
even if they have

616
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,689
not made a strikeout or hit a homer?

617
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,942
I've made strikeouts and hit homers.

618
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,652
Not your neighborhood league.

619
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,654
No, not in my neighborhood league.

620
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,282
DAESUNG HIGH SCHOOL

621
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,367
Daesung High School?

622
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,827
Yes. Also, I believe

623
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,206
if there's anyone who hasn't
made a home run or a strikeout

624
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,792
but knows sabermetrics better than me,

625
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,460
he should be hired instead of me.

626
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,296
You're very confident.

627
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,298
Of course, the analytical skills
are not always

628
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,300
directly related to the team's standing.

629
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,637
There are also many other factors
that determine the standing.

630
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,599
However, for the Dreams,
who have neglected statistics,

631
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,602
I'm sure it can give
some substantial help.

632
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,272
WAR is regarded
as one of the most important statistics

633
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,525
when it comes to sabermetrics.

634
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,487
Can you tell me why hitters usually
show higher WAR than pitchers,

635
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,407
while many say pitchers matter
the most in baseball?

636
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,366
That's the point.

637
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,036
That's the reason why we don't
trust these numbers in the field.

638
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,331
The first reason is that hitters
do both hitting and defense

639
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,875
at the same time.

640
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,669
So, the starting pitchers' WAR
is not much lower

641
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,962
than the hitters.

642
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:17,550
But middle relief pitchers
have really low WAR.

643
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:21,220
But aren't their roles
really important to win games?

644
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,181
Right. So I think we should use

645
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,225
WPA, the win probability added,
instead of WAR

646
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,520
to evaluate the performance
of middle relief pitchers

647
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,689
in a more accurate way.

648
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,864
You don't have any questions to ask?

649
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,831
How high do you think the doorsill is?

650
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,212
The doorsill you just crossed.

651
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,713
The doorsill...

652
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:01,844
you barely managed to cross
with someone else's help in the end.

653
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,264
I think it'd be
about six centimeters high.

654
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,059
Everything,
including such a trivial thing,

655
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,603
would be tough if you work for us.

656
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,605
Mr. Baek.

657
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:17,068
He should understand it exactly first
to accept whatever decision we'd make.

658
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,450
I really like Jackie Robinson.

659
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,204
That's why my ID is Robinson.

660
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,667
He's the first African American
player in MLB.

661
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,003
He had to fight against
the unfair calls of umpires,

662
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:40,466
and many pitchers hit him on purpose
just because he was African American.

663
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,011
It's total nonsense in this day and age.

664
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:48,224
If you hire me, I'd be
the first disabled baseball analyst.

665
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,727
The press would eagerly
write stories about me.

666
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,729
Such stories aren't what we are after--

667
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,148
I want you to know this.

668
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,567
If you don't hear good news from us,

669
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,238
that means we found someone
more competent than you.

670
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,784
We won't give you a disadvantage
because you are different.

671
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,287
I trust you.

672
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,709
-Let me ask one more question...
-You got injured.

673
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,922
Tell us what happened.

674
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,050
Sorry?

675
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,739
Young-soo,

676
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,241
don't look back and look forward.

677
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,952
Just go forward, okay?

678
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,521
I got injured during a baseball game.

679
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:26,906
You'll have to watch
countless game recordings.

680
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,117
The recordings of real games.

681
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,581
You might think you'd still be
in the field if that didn't happen.

682
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,833
Also, you must easily recall

683
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,296
the moment you crashed
and all the ugly memories.

684
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,174
Can you handle it?

685
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,844
I can.

686
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,807
Would your family also want that?

687
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,312
My family doesn't know.

688
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,024
This is what I want.

689
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,154
And that's why I'm doing this.

690
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,949
Because I'm fine.

691
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,019
Applicant Baek Young-soo
is my younger brother.

692
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,692
I wasn't aware he applied,
nor do I hope for his employment.

693
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,653
Please judge it
as objectively as possible.

694
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,697
But I don't think...

695
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,576
you have judged it objectively.

696
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,996
He must have considered how I would
rate him before he came here.

697
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,253
Even though it's your brother,

698
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,882
you crossed the line earlier.

699
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,801
Even though he could guess

700
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,095
why you would talk to him that way.

701
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,859
We have no choice.

702
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,903
I'll just announce the result
based on the scores.

703
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,821
Why? What did he say?

704
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,364
Shush.

705
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,501
BAEK YOUNG-SOO

706
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,463
BAEK YOUNG-SOO, DAESUNG HIGH

707
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,674
The intense advance that ended
the career of a rising star.

708
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,428
There has been a sad accident
during the match

709
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,351
Tolerating an injury led to severe injury.

710
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,977
I hope no more incidents like that

711
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,783
Mr. Baek!

712
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,159
Hold on.

713
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,248
I checked the heights
of the doorsills in our office.

714
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,209
We have eight doors with thresholds
of less than 2cm,

715
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,710
or don't have one.

716
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,963
He can pass these doors in the wheelchair.

717
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,925
We can also install ramps
on the doors with higher thresholds.

718
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,053
We can solve the problem
with a much cheaper budget

719
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,263
than installing new doors.

720
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,557
I still won't hire him.

721
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,686
We have to hire someone
who can assist and protect you.

722
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,398
Who would assist whom?

723
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,401
Please just do as much work
as others in your position.

724
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,654
Who's protecting whom?

725
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,792
What are you doing?

726
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,296
You always say your piece and just leave.

727
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,175
Fine. Say what you want.

728
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,975
Your brother was a good player.

729
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,939
That past doesn't exist.

730
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,817
RESUME

731
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,612
Have you read his resume thoroughly?

732
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,407
Do you think we're close enough
to talk about these things?

733
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,701
I'd like to stop talking about my family.

734
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:45,956
I'm talking about hiring an employee
of the strategy analysis team right now.

735
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,126
You made me realize

736
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,338
that you don't know all about him
even though you two are close.

737
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,721
RESUME

738
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,891
It doesn't say anything about him
going through a hard time, does it?

739
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,354
But you can tell.

740
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,398
With that one line where it says
he majored in statistics,

741
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,651
he deserves to be applauded.

742
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,237
No company hires an employee
because of a line in their resume.

743
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:21,116
You're working in the sport
that got your brother injured.

744
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,243
You must not have come here

745
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,954
without determination or hesitation.

746
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,873
But...

747
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,127
don't you think your brother would have

748
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,338
made a tougher decision

749
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,882
than the decision you had to make?

750
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,804
-Get out.
-Young-soo has been

751
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,932
walking on eggshells around you,
hasn't he?

752
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,686
I know you're doing this
because you're worried,

753
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,480
but your brother has been overcoming
his hardships

754
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,982
so amazingly that it's unbelievable.

755
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,151
You should admit to his courage
to some degree.

756
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,195
Did you know?

757
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,365
Young-soo had already overcome his injury,

758
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,202
and he has been waiting for you...

759
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,287
this whole time.

760
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:37,192
GENERAL MANAGER BAEK SEUNG-SOO
OF DREAMS SPARKS A NEW WAVE.

761
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,848
Since when have you been writing it?

762
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,312
It's been a while.

763
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,442
You deceived your family.

764
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,111
I haven't lied about anything
except that I like baseball.

765
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,990
-I worked hard.
-Hey.

766
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,202
I've been telling you to study
so that you can live

767
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,828
-a better life--
-I was sick of baseball

768
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,330
when I was an athlete.

769
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,582
But after this happened to me,

770
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,543
it's become fun watching baseball.

771
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,756
So I was going to tell you last time.

772
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,592
I'm okay with watching baseball now.

773
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,762
-Then why didn't you tell me?
-You threw it all away.

774
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,555
Everything related to baseball.

775
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,684
You always spit at and cursed baseball.

776
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,729
How am I supposed
to tell you that I like it?

777
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,903
-But that's what made you--
-Although you always say so,

778
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,656
you think it happened because of you.

779
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,370
It's been so many years.

780
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,582
Do you think anyone in this country
can hide from baseball?

781
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,418
Then why did you enter a baseball club?

782
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,464
The baseball manager won't let his brother
watch a baseball game.

783
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,841
How hypocritical is that?

784
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,426
Then who would make money?

785
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,263
What can't a man do to make money?

786
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,224
Someone has to make money.

787
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,226
Stop saying that stuff!

788
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,188
Don't you know we live
in a nightmare to watch you

789
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,732
devote your whole life to our family?

790
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,401
I'm the one who can't walk.

791
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,361
Why should you have a sense of guilt,

792
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,363
and why do I have to wait for you?

793
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,616
I'm out of the nightmare.

794
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,785
Why are you still in there looking at me?

795
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:55,581
"I'll make the sacrifice. You find
a secure job somewhere else."

796
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,707
Isn't that it?

797
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,419
Do you know how suffocating it is
to hear that?

798
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,299
Do I have to be this self-conscious
for all of us to be happy?

799
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,551
Snap out of it already, please!

800
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,684
Fine.

801
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,271
You don't have to hire me.

802
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,983
So let's live a brighter life.

803
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,278
It wasn't your fault.

804
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,489
Do you think...

805
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,827
you'd not be able to blame yourself
if you were me?

806
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,537
Yes.

807
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,207
Because it's really not your fault.

808
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,132
If you were the only one
who was hurt, it'd be different.

809
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,676
But that's not true.

810
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,138
I was...

811
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,433
I was...

812
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,124
We still have to see his progress.

813
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,461
But he has so many bruises on his body.

814
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,754
Do you know what happened?

815
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:28,966
No.

816
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,592
He's a baseball player, right?

817
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,971
I think there's been physical punishment.

818
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,683
His ankle was severely swollen
where it's not relevant to his injury.

819
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,853
It wouldn't have been easy for him
to run that fast.

820
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,244
MESSAGE INBOX

821
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,916
Young-soo.

822
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,460
Everyone is going through a hard time.

823
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,671
Let's only look forward, okay?

824
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,840
You're the pride of our family.

825
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,390
What are you going to do about the result?

826
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,647
GENERAL MANAGER'S OFFICE

827
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,573
Come in.

828
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:26,124
DREAMS COME TRUE

829
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,636
Oh, hey.

830
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,098
Why did you suddenly come?
I have classes, too.

831
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,767
I wanted to badmouth someone,

832
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,769
but I couldn't think of anyone else
to do it with.

833
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:51,608
If that someone is
the frustrating man I'm thinking of,

834
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,820
you've come to the right person.

835
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,496
It was bound to happen one day.

836
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:09,459
But I think
we put that day off for too long.

837
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,921
I'm okay.

838
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,674
What about you?

839
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,468
Well,

840
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,013
I ended up like this
after putting it off too much.

841
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,934
Unlike Seung-soo and me,

842
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:28,186
you two are brothers,
so you can't part ways.

843
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,272
Try to overcome it.

844
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,734
I just...

845
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,779
did it for myself.

846
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,031
Right.

847
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,493
Your brother will live
the rest of his life in regret

848
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,996
if he doesn't see us happy.

849
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,749
But aside from that,

850
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:53,253
you just need to enjoy your life.

851
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,965
And smile a lot.

852
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,054
INCOMING CALL

853
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,390
Hello?

854
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:09,227
Hello, I'm Lee Se-young of the Dreams.

855
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,063
-Oh, hello.
-Congratulations.

856
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,398
You passed the interview.

857
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,151
Really?

858
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,986
Thank you.

859
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,906
Congratulations once again.

860
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,991
When can you start working?

861
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,951
Right away.

862
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,455
I'll see you tomorrow at work then.

863
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,833
Thank you. Thank you so much.

864
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,338
-Did you get accepted?
-Yes.

865
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,340
-Really?
-Yes!

866
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,466
Goodness.

867
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,926
Congratulations.

868
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,678
-Can you do a good job?
-Of course.

869
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,888
Goodness.

870
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,724
I'm so happy for you.

871
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,601
Good luck.

872
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,438
Mom.

873
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,275
Young-soo is all right now.

874
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,783
I'm fine with everything
as long as he's fine.

875
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,537
Yes.

876
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:32,352
EXCEPTIONAL, CHALLENGING,
AND PROGRESSIVE BASEBALL

877
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,568
Kyung-min. You're good at your job
because we're related by blood.

878
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,195
You know that, right?

879
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,785
-President Ko.
-Yes, Mr. Kwon?

880
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,788
I need to see Mr. Baek.

881
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,623
May I ask what this is about?

882
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,252
I want to see him. It's been a while.

883
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,510
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

884
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,395
What's the total amount
of last year's salaries?

885
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,981
It's $5,530,000.

886
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,193
We'll need a sharp cut on that.

887
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,863
We can't afford that much money.

888
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,834
What's with the wine between two men?

889
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,962
We're expecting someone,
and he likes wine.

890
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,005
Is someone coming?

891
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,548
It's someone you know.

892
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,134
KWAK HAN-YOUNG, INFIELDER OF THE DREAMS

893
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:54,768
What's this?

894
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,853
The estimated salary budget of our team.

895
00:55:58,813 --> 00:55:59,898
Why do you have this?

896
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,816
I snuck it out from the operations team.

897
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,570
Do they know about this?

898
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,160
-Can this be leaked?
-You're so fastidious.

899
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,996
Why do you think I'm showing you this?

900
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,206
Look.

901
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,959
I don't want to get involved with this.

902
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,964
-I'll get going.
-Sit down, you punk.

903
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,852
Gosh, what's with this mood?

904
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,231
Sit back down, Mr. Kwak.

905
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,447
Goodness.

906
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,325
You see,

907
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,623
I opened an agency.

908
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,292
I'd like to sign a contract with you

909
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,294
and negotiate your salary.

910
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:08,258
I don't earn a lot, so you might not
get a lot of commission.

911
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,136
You just need to treat me to a drink.

912
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,930
I'm doing this because I feel bad
for your past contracts.

913
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,640
Right, you punk.

914
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,518
How long will you agree
to what they offer without a say?

915
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,440
Before you,

916
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,733
I've signed contracts with Lee Young-yul,

917
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,777
Jung Tae-soo, and Yoo Min-won.

918
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,739
People at the Dreams look down on me,

919
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,534
but I'm quite renowned outside.

920
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,911
All of them have won a Golden Glove.

921
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,039
Have you signed contracts
with four in total?

922
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,167
Who is the other one?

923
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,924
AGENT CONTRACT

924
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,682
LIM DONG-GYU

925
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,810
Don't tell me you're flustered.

926
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,520
You're Mr. Baek.

927
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,065
Is the topic a little too difficult?

928
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:08,985
Yes, it is.

929
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,029
Of course,

930
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,406
they might think it's huge

931
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,658
to have their pay cut by 30 percent.

932
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,204
But we'll have to make them understand

933
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,663
our circumstances.

934
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,750
The total of the salary budget
for players has been reduced,

935
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,752
and you want me to negotiate
and sign contracts

936
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,879
with all the players.

937
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,964
Is that it?

938
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,508
Right.

939
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,136
I suggest you make it ten percent.

940
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,930
I told you, it's 30 percent.

941
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:39,849
Fifteen percent.

942
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,061
Stop talking about money
as if you're bargaining at a market.

943
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:47,190
It's you who decided on the price
like it's some kind of bargaining.

944
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,902
What are you doing?

945
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,990
How can you make such a decision
without a proper reason?

946
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,745
Do you want me to tell you the reason?

947
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,373
We are...

948
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,000
bad at baseball.

949
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,836
There's more.

950
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,130
We're horrible at baseball.

951
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,925
One more.

952
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,803
We've been horrible at baseball for years.

953
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,638
And one more.

954
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,560
We're suffering a loss from this team.

955
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,186
Right.

956
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,231
We were bad last year and the year before.

957
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,692
That's why our players
have the lowest salaries.

958
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,571
They will hate it
if you cut it down this much.

959
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:38,324
I wonder why a smart man
would oppose me. Let me tell you this.

960
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:43,037
It's neither an opinion nor a suggestion.

961
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,582
It's a decision.

962
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,252
And the resolution of our group.

963
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:42,180
You left work, so get lost to your house.

964
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,223
Why do you want to eat with your superior?

965
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,852
Be grateful
that I'm having a meal with you.

966
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,271
Wait.

967
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,316
What's that?

968
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,027
Is she his girlfriend or wife?

969
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:58,863
I don't know.

970
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:02,450
I wondered why he left work
early today, and this was why.

971
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,160
I should ask him about this tomorrow.

972
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,537
Hey, be mature already.

973
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,039
What? What is it this time?

974
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,334
Let's just go.

975
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,670
I didn't know
Mr. Baek could smile like that.

976
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,004
Neither did I.

977
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,297
Let's go.

978
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,049
Okay.

979
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,308
I was supposed to go on a trip today.

980
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,061
Were you?

981
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,689
I canceled it after you called yesterday.

982
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:37,694
Whether I go with my friend, alone,

983
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,987
or with another man,

984
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,824
I will go on a trip next year.

985
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,451
Let's not see each other
this day next year.

986
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,579
Okay.

987
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,791
It's fine.

988
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,213
If we're obsessed with trying
to comfort one another,

989
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,342
we might never be able
to get over that memory.

990
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,303
That came to my mind.

991
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,849
This day will come every year.

992
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,476
We can't keep doing this.

993
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,398
Let's see each other on other days.

994
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,984
Okay.

995
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,904
Who's going to comfort whom?

996
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,283
We're both strong.

997
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,519
Did you accept that?

998
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,022
Prepare to negotiate fiercely as always.

999
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,148
I've seen many like this.

1000
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,317
People who want to look like
they have principles.

1001
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,027
It's professional, not sandlot baseball.

1002
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,278
We had a drastic cut.

1003
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,447
If you decline this,
I won't offer the same amount.

1004
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,532
We'll evaluate their weaknesses
thoroughly.

1005
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,743
Baek Seung-soo's fake leadership...

1006
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,078
This is the easiest way
to reduce labor costs.

1007
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:11,996
Expect a backlash.

1008
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,706
He started it by blowing the whistle.

1009
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,458
If he fails, he'll break down.

1010
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,501
Could this be...

1011
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,795
This is the list of ten players
to release from the team.
