1
00:00:02,034 --> 00:00:04,034
"Episode 5."

2
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,784
"Handle with care."

3
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:58,549
What are we going to do?

4
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,208
They must've erased all the evidence.

5
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:01,238
Then, what are we going to do?

6
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,756
Darn it, is there no way?

7
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:04,788
Is there nothing we can do?

8
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:06,157
Video recording.

9
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:08,649
Maybe the video still exists.

10
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,550
That was Hyun Woo-yong's order, right?

11
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:12,352
Don't you remember?

12
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:14,111
Start recording.

13
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:17,417
Hurry up and choose.

14
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:18,431
I'll give you ten seconds.

15
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:19,701
Wait a minute.

16
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:21,919
If you don't choose,

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,370
they'll both die.

18
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,971
There must be a place
where the recordings are kept.

19
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,621
Even if there is, how can we find it?

20
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,834
We can't search the entire building.

21
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:32,107
That's why we can't
go in without a strategy.

22
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:36,301
How about we make those
people guide us instead?

23
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:43,018
Where are you going?

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,456
Hey!

25
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:50,378
U-sol, everything is going on smoothly?

26
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:53,281
Yes.

27
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:54,961
Stick the camera like this.

28
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:59,210
But you didn't end up in prison
because of hidden camera, right?

29
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,062
You're looking at me as if I'm trash.

30
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:05,510
No, I asked a question. A question.

31
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:07,555
"Handle with care."

32
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:09,885
What is she doing?

33
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:11,496
What's this?

34
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:13,364
You, the one wearing a mask.

35
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:15,810
Delivery order?

36
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:17,160
"Handle with care."

37
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,919
But this...

38
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,585
-"In front of the broadcast room!"
-Will it work?

39
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,429
Right. This is a bit vague.

40
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,384
Looks like it's going
to be stuck in security.

41
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:28,890
U-sol. You've been given
his business card, right?

42
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:31,275
Yes.

43
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:35,434
The courier was really rude.

44
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,709
Not bad, right?

45
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:48,682
-"In front of the broadcast room!"
-Wouldn't it be okay if it's Hyun Woo-yong's?

46
00:02:48,683 --> 00:02:49,772
"FOG Martial Arts Competition
Chairman Hyun Woo-yong."

47
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,017
Broadcast room?

48
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,505
We have a broadcast room?

49
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,287
Broadcast room? You
wrote, "Broadcast room"?

50
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:58,303
You didn't say anything as I wrote it.

51
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,835
What broadcast room? Isn't it
the chairman's game relay room?

52
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:04,186
This one is related to the
chairman. So let's take good care of it.

53
00:03:05,563 --> 00:03:06,562
"In front of the broadcast room!"

54
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:09,213
"FOG Martial Arts Competition
Chairman Hyun Woo-yong."

55
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:19,174
Good work.

56
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,380
Guys.

57
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:23,452
It's moving.

58
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,999
This is crazy. This is absolutely amazing.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,129
Engine room?

60
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,148
Sang-hyup, draw a rough map.

61
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,167
Yes.

62
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:46,065
Not to the right.

63
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,281
To the left.

64
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,355
It looks like it.

65
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:01,873
Hey, loser.

66
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:05,295
Why is the package for the
chairman sent to your place?

67
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,593
-What's that?
-I don't know.

68
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:10,736
Take care of this.

69
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,149
Wipe your face.

70
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:14,788
So disgusting.

71
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,147
I've wiped my face.

72
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:31,980
What's this?

73
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:34,299
Shall I open it a little?

74
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:37,148
Darn it, I was shocked.

75
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,817
I was really startled.

76
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:40,956
We have a rough map.

77
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:44,325
I guess we can find it
if we enter the building.

78
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,966
Okay, let's go.

79
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:48,452
Shall we get started now?

80
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:51,291
Please help me, Red Rabbit.

81
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:20,518
What's that?

82
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,846
Chairman.

83
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,556
Hey, you guys!

84
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,336
Check the red truck on
the 4th floor of area B.

85
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:27,794
-Now!
-All right.

86
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:41,947
-Check all.
-Yes.

87
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,620
Did you hear something?

88
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:30,677
"Shark: The Storm."

89
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,225
Director.

90
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:44,279
There is no one.

91
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:50,046
Catch that jerk and bring
him to me right before my eyes.

92
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,755
Watch out if you can't find them.

93
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,687
Everyone, go down and look for them.

94
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:23,794
Was that your doing?

95
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:24,793
Darn it.

96
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,528
Even with the lure,
there's still a lot left.

97
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,578
How many? Two, three,
six, eight, ten, countless.

98
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:33,136
Let's go with the plan.

99
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:59,417
There are a lot of opponents,
so let's split up into teams.

100
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,569
U-sol and Sang-hyup are on the same team.

101
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:10,372
Yeon-jin and I will be on the same team.

102
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:16,604
Darn it!

103
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:20,327
One person focuses on physical
combat, the others take care of the rest.

104
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:24,108
The key is to resolve things quickly.

105
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:01,668
-To the next stage.
-I will look for evidence.

106
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:04,586
Are you all right?

107
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,572
Catch them!

108
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,212
Come on, quickly! Run!

109
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:20,595
There!

110
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:21,814
Catch them, they're there!

111
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:22,899
Sung-yong.

112
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:25,098
Darn it.

113
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:35,572
Darn it.

114
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,529
Where's the recorded video file?

115
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,749
File?

116
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,798
There isn't any.

117
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,392
Say it before you get hurt.

118
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:22,071
Darn it.

119
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:27,705
Crazy woman. Are you looking for death?

120
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:36,864
Open everything, quickly.

121
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,382
I don't really know either.

122
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,183
"Private Security Camera
Incentive Program."

123
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:21,963
August 22nd...

124
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:37,917
"File not found."

125
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:40,755
Darn it.

126
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:45,193
Darn it.

127
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:57,381
How was it?

128
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,266
I'm better than expected.

129
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,414
I'll go down.

130
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,042
Sung-yong, are you okay?

131
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,210
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

132
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,105
Did you find it?

133
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:39,186
Darn it.

134
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:42,782
Don't touch my friends or I'll kill you!

135
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,605
I'll kill you! I said, don't do it!

136
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:52,322
Won-jun.

137
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:56,680
I have absolutely no idea
what to do. I really don't know...

138
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:58,649
Are you looking for this?

139
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,026
This is my fault. It is my fault.

140
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:02,425
I was out of control just now.

141
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,473
Please don't do it.

142
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:06,595
They did nothing wrong.

143
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,312
What should I do?

144
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:19,429
Won-jun, I don't know what to do at all.

145
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,388
Won-jun.

146
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:25,947
I have absolutely no idea what to do.

147
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,714
No! Don't do it!

148
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,064
Don't do it!

149
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,942
Won-jun!

150
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:37,016
No!

151
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:38,900
Won-jun!

152
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,216
If you look closely

153
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:52,413
you look good on camera.

154
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:00,654
If you want the video, just take it.

155
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:03,769
Let him come up.

156
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,442
No.

157
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:20,921
You guys are not applicable.

158
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,757
I'll be back.

159
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:04,004
Take them and sort them
out in the underground parking.

160
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,100
All right.

161
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,055
I need to ask one thing.

162
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:21,413
Who stabbed Lee Won-jun with a knife?

163
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:27,490
What's this?

164
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:31,288
Are you that animal's girlfriend?

165
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,167
I'm his sister, you witch!

166
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:49,112
Isn't it obvious that your opponent is me?

167
00:16:57,534 --> 00:16:58,996
Hey, Knife Wound.

168
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,247
Are you good at fighting?

169
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,088
Come here quickly...

170
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:18,279
Cha U-sol.

171
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:12,033
It's hot, right?

172
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,434
Should I turn down the heat?

173
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,214
Have you eaten?

174
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:18,728
Lighten your expression!

175
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,130
You've been making me feel so good!

176
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:23,436
This is boring.

177
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,049
You are too serious.

178
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:31,003
That's the video file.

179
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,635
Do you want to take it or
fight seriously with me once?

180
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:35,643
Take your pick.

181
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,391
I'm giving you a chance.

182
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:39,641
A chance for you to take revenge yourself.

183
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,069
Who is next?

184
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:12,866
There is a price that
follows an option, right?

185
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:16,466
