1
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:10,210
Stop, please.

2
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,600
Hey, U-sol!

3
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,120
Stab it.

4
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:17,994
Try and stab me.

5
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:19,040
Try it now.

6
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:20,600
Try it now.

7
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:22,079
Here.

8
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:32,397
Although he experienced
violence in junior high school,

9
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:36,536
the defendant purposely used a
weapon to stab his right eyeball.

10
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,760
Do you admit it?

11
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,806
Teach me, please.

12
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:47,560
I want to be strong like you.

13
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:53,960
Pull your chin in...

14
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:14,301
You know sharks?

15
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:15,915
Sharks do not have swim bladders.

16
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,716
They will die right away if
they don't swim for a while.

17
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:24,405
That's why they continue
moving from birth to death.

18
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:26,360
Do not stop.

19
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:48,738
"Shark: The Storm."

20
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:52,793
"Episode 1."

21
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,111
Victims of violence at school.

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,480
Difficulty in adapting socially.

23
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:02,799
Subject under surveillance.

24
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:04,679
Ex-convict.

25
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,559
The world's gaze is directed at us.

26
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:11,166
We realised all that
after getting out of prison.

27
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:15,280
The only place in the world
where we can rely on is each other.

28
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:24,920
It's been six months since
my fight with Bae Seok-chan.

29
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,897
The bus is leaving soon. Hurry!

30
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,919
Wait for me!

31
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,047
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:34,679
Thank you.

33
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,759
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

34
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,977
I'm still struggling not to stop.

35
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:44,920
Driver, there is another person.

36
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:56,759
Because time waits for no one.

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,233
He's running at the same speed as the bus.

38
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:03,119
He's so fast.

39
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:07,774
Sung-yong, who took bread-making
class, started a food truck business.

40
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,248
Give me a beer!

41
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:12,913
How many times have I
ordered sweet and sour chicken?

42
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:14,400
I told you.

43
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,792
I told you so!

44
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:19,159
Come on, let's eat.

45
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,232
Won-jun is preparing for the
high school equivalency exam

46
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,839
in between work.

47
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:30,891
You are sleeping.

48
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:33,642
While you sleep... While
you're sleeping; Your brain...

49
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:42,800
Sang-hyup, who misses his
life as an athlete while in prison

50
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,661
has gone back to the training centre.

51
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:46,918
"Muay Thai, Crossfit, Gym."

52
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,640
"Best National Vice,
Coming Out As A Winner."

53
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:50,791
"World Martial Arts
Mastery Team Villains."

54
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,879
We made a promise to each other.

55
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:59,566
We might be labelled as ex-convicts,

56
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,480
but we will never give up.

57
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:11,561
We will surely be better than yesterday.

58
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,159
We escaped the past.

59
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,159
Like a shark that doesn't
have swim bladders.

60
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,610
"Sincere Rehabilitation, Bright Future."

61
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,890
Do Hyun.

62
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,444
I joined the gym.

63
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,200
Is it okay to have a criminal record?

64
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,249
Not as an athlete, but part-time work.

65
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,790
I live in a dormitory

66
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,399
while cleaning, washing
and doing other work.

67
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,667
Why are you laughing?
Is there something funny?

68
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,383
Accommodation is also provided.

69
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:02,105
And after work, I also exercise
with Sang-hyup at the gym.

70
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:03,506
Sometimes, I practise alone.

71
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,465
That's good, right?

72
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,119
Must you be a martial artist?

73
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:10,559
You said sharks never stop.

74
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:15,883
Why did I say that?

75
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:18,474
If I work hard, won't an opportunity come?

76
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,669
Do you think you are good enough?

77
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,537
Do you think you can
win against any opponent?

78
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,874
You are in a time when
you can easily cause trouble.

79
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,513
I didn't do anything.

80
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:30,519
Remember.

81
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:32,903
Although it happened six months ago...

82
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:36,223
you beat Bae Seok-chan, who
is famous among the gangsters.

83
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:37,690
Some punks might approach you.

84
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,039
Impossible.

85
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,999
I won't do that.

86
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,239
Okay.

87
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,225
The main thing is...

88
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:49,599
don't act emotionally at such moments.

89
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:51,841
Got it?

90
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,439
I am here now because of that.

91
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:58,679
Yes.

92
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,476
Do your best.

93
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:02,573
I support you.

94
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:04,119
Thank you.

95
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:08,151
He will try again.

96
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:10,719
He tried to make a tackle again.

97
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,199
Okay, good.

98
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:30,879
-One more time.
-Not successful.

99
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:35,151
Have you finished training?

100
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:36,910
I will wake you up right at
the afternoon practice time.

101
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:38,536
-Have a nice rest.
-U-sol!

102
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:39,546
Come here, quick!

103
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:40,759
Yes.

104
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:43,269
Where are my gloves?

105
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,128
I wiped it with alcohol
and kept it in the locker.

106
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,931
You can use it immediately.

107
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,490
Hey, ex-convict!

108
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,292
-Can't you hurry up?
-Yes.

109
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:51,599
Open it for me too.

110
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:53,852
Open.

111
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:56,156
Hurry up and open it, you
slow-witted jerk! Darn it.

112
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:57,679
-Here you go.
-Gosh.

113
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,795
Dear, that's so cool.

114
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,159
Darling, show me how you fight.

115
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:15,139
-Gosh.
-Darling, go stronger.

116
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:18,316
Who is my human punching bag today?

117
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:20,362
There isn't any left.
All of them ran away.

118
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:22,173
You hit them as if
you wanted to kill them.

119
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,828
Shouldn't you bring
them back here, you jerk?

120
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,559
-Isn't that what I'm paying you to do?
-What should I do if there isn't any?

121
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,610
If I bring them back, you'll beat them.
And when you beat them, they'll run away.

122
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:35,319
Or do you want me to call the boy?

123
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:39,668
Yes; Honey. Give it a try.

124
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:40,999
Just try it first.

125
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:43,759
Hey, prisoner.

126
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:45,839
Hey!

127
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,805
Songgot is doing it again.

128
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,501
-Yes?
-Get in the ring.

129
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,359
I said, get in the ring.

130
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:56,758
-Gosh.
-Let's go.

131
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,496
Get some protective gear for him.

132
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,278
My punching bag is scared, darn it.

133
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,002
Hey. Who knows?

134
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:06,037
If you can beat professional athletes,
maybe the coach will make you one.

135
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,799
Darn brat.

136
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:12,919
Look at that expression.

137
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:22,120
Darn it.

138
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,321
You're good at avoiding.

139
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,239
Boy, put it on.

140
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,304
I just going to try it once.

141
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:36,319
Under the same conditions.

142
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,799
You have a lot of guts too.

143
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,438
Starting now, be my punching bag.

144
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,081
Try hitting me. Try it.

145
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,592
Try hitting me, you jerk.

146
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:51,493
Try it if you can.

147
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:52,570
Come on, hit again.

148
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,919
Try hitting me, you jerk!

149
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,279
Gosh...

150
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:23,199
Darn it!

151
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,639
-Songgot?
-Do something.

152
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:31,140
-Today, you have a match.
-Just get me some ice, darn it!

153
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,558
Where's the ice?

154
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,623
Who told you to climb
into the ring as you please?

155
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,623
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,562
Sang-hyup, if you don't
want to be kicked out,

157
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,338
get him out of here quickly.

158
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,598
What happened?

159
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:02,919
Please verify your identity with a sound.

160
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,597
You have been verified.

161
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:12,835
This device is a ticket
for VVIP match betting

162
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:17,033
who are specially invited by
Chairman Hyun Woo-yong.

163
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,859
Please be careful,
because if you lose this item

164
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,271
it can be dangerous to
the safety of its owner.

165
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,272
"Building Under Legal Repossession;
Authorised Personnel Only."

166
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:27,239
Well then, enjoy the game tonight.

167
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,634
Basic match betting costs 50 million won.

168
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,217
-Who do you choose?
-The black pants.

169
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:35,220
Good, he keeps on
launching backhand blows.

170
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:37,268
The hot punch will explode again.

171
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,431
Even Chador came here
just to watch this match.

172
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,368
He waited for the moment to counterattack

173
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:45,376
and one more blow straight in!

174
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,547
Also throwing a kick now.

175
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:50,947
The battle of reading movement
and keeping distance is really fierce!

176
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,070
Jab!

177
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:54,412
The point is, he was
aiming for a hook shot.

178
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,798
He can immediately
pass out if it hits the chin.

179
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,243
Now he gets lots of punches in the face.

180
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:01,076
How fierce! They narrowed the distance.

181
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,899
A hot blow that burns the
chest! Continues to take down.

182
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,137
-Commentator space.
-A flurry of blows!

183
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:06,360
-The match is over. Get ready.
-Right hand!

184
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,610
Left hand too.

185
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:10,571
The damage is starting to show!
The match could end like this.

186
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:13,114
Yes! Doksa Fighter wins!

187
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:17,719
A match that showed amazing
guts from the novice, Doksa.

188
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:21,762
Coming up next, the last
match for tonight will start.

189
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:22,828
Before betting,

190
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:26,969
you can check the fighter's
abilities and records in the app.

191
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,229
Bets cannot be retracted.

192
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,543
But double bets are allowed.

193
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:35,012
Finally, we'll start the
main event of the day!

194
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:38,345
The only one recognised in FOG is Songgot!

195
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:39,715
Let's harvest money!

196
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:42,166
-Songgot is here.
-I have high expectation of him.

197
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:48,401
A man with a winning rate of 83.3%.

198
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:52,032
And the one challenging Songgot is.

199
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:54,079
Tanker!

200
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,426
Everyone has been here for a
long time, waiting for the match

201
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:04,049
-between these two fighters.
-I choose the handsome one.

202
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,798
It's going to begin soon.

203
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:16,507
Chairman.

204
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:17,919
He didn't show up.

205
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,478
Is it true?

206
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:24,718
This is interesting.

207
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,119
We just got the latest news.

208
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,078
Tanker's opponent has been replaced.

209
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:36,159
According to the main event
rules, a new bet will start.

210
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:38,544
"Player Change."

211
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:46,174
-Hey! He didn't show up!
-What about the bet?

212
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:48,485
Who is the new challenger
who will go against Tanker?

213
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:49,729
What's all this?

214
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,975
Before we announce the
identity of the new fighter...

215
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:54,824
you will get 10 times more
regardless of who is chosen.

216
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,451
"Will VVIP 17 participate
in a surprise event?"

217
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,970
-Bet changes are not allowed.
-This is exciting.

218
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,303
-Let's bet...
-Let's do it.

219
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:01,838
Care to join in this surprise event?

220
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,197
Countdown to 10x Surprise Bet

221
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:06,545
starts now!

222
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,541
Ten. Nine.

223
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,439
Eight. Seven.

224
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,435
Six. Five.

225
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:14,193
Four. Three.

226
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,405
-I don't think it's him.
-Two.

227
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:16,670
-That's why.
-One!

228
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,503
Surprise Bet is closed.

229
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:20,164
-Who's he?
-From now on...

230
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,678
the bets will go back
to the regular system.

231
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:24,315
Okay.

232
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:28,346
Who is the special fighter
that's making everyone curious?

233
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:30,760
Now, we'll introduce

234
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:34,162
the special fighter for
the Final Game tonight!

235
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:41,118
Chairman Hyun Woo-yong!

236
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:43,423
I betted on Tanker.

237
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,062
With a special appearance
by Chairman Hyun Woo-yong,

238
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:49,558
-new rules are added for a fair game!
-This is insane.

239
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,411
If Tanker can survive
for 30 seconds, he wins!

240
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:54,628
This is a great game.

241
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:56,692
-We'll repeat it one more time!
-I put five.

242
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,119
If he can last 30 seconds,

243
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,198
Tanker will win!

244
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:03,908
We have to bet on him.

245
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,259
We have to make a bet.

246
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,875
I'll definitely get a double.

247
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:08,319
Impossible.

248
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,123
It's Hyun Woo-yong. Look.

249
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:15,319
Hyun Woo-yong.

250
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:22,327
Do it right.

251
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,040
You are superior in
your heavyweight class!

252
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,879
Tanker, don't be afraid.

253
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,472
Why are you nervous?

254
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:30,638
Don't be nervous.

255
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,719
This is exciting, isn't it?

256
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:35,007
Just let me hit you once.

257
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:36,518
And after that,

258
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:39,293
I will write off all your debts.

259
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:40,318
Okay?

260
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,391
-Tanker, keep up the spirit.
-Tanker, don't be afraid!

261
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:49,326
Come on, Tanker!

262
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:53,358
Bets are closing soon!

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,138
Five.

264
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,045
Four. Three.

265
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,958
Two. One.

266
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:01,239
Come on! It's started.

267
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:03,078
Let's see.

268
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,137
Ready...

269
00:15:07,138 --> 00:15:08,971
Fight!

270
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:16,918
No, how is this happening?

271
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:26,158
He's down after one hit.

272
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:36,251
-Down!
-Come on, hit again quickly.

273
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:40,838
Tanker down in ten seconds!

274
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,616
Why?

275
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,217
There are still 20 seconds left.

276
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:58,450
-Yes, hello?
-U-sol.

277
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:00,119
It looks like tonight you
can go back to the dorm.

278
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,275
What?

279
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:04,555
Is it true? I thought they kicked me out.

280
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:06,254
Thank goodness. Thank you.

281
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:08,269
It's okay. You're here to meet them?

282
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,423
Yes, how about you?

283
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:10,803
I can't come today.

284
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,278
Just send my regards to them.

285
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:14,713
-Yes, see you later.
-I don't want to accept.

286
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:15,878
-Goodbye.
-Your apology.

287
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,799
Just looking at you makes me sick.

288
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,532
You think you can redeem
all with this small change?

289
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,879
Keep dreaming!

290
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,500
It's not like that. I just...

291
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,079
Where are you going, you jerk?

292
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:47,046
-What do you want?
-Won-jun, I'm sorry.

293
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,326
Do you want to jump?

294
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:49,398
Just try it.

295
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,057
Come on, jump.

296
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:52,827
Darn, do you really dare to jump?

297
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,279
I said, try jumping.

298
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:10,374
"Kim Dong-Geon. Does Not Accept Apology."

299
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,358
-Won-jun.
-Yes?

300
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:18,162
U-sol, since when you're here?

301
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,425
I just got here.

302
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:20,998
Not going to Sung-yong's?

303
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,838
Yes, let's go.

304
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:28,998
That's right, I heard you were kicked out.

305
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,899
Yes, almost got kicked out.

306
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,297
But it didn't happen.

307
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:35,598
Who is he? Want me
to help you clean it up?

308
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:37,878
Gosh, it's a long story.

309
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,595
This life is indeed...

310
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:44,479
hard to live.

311
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:48,279
But since this is the path I chose...

312
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,443
I have to move forward
even though it's difficult.

313
00:17:58,029 --> 00:17:59,278
Thank you, U-sol.

314
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,318
What for?

315
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:04,718
It is nothing.

316
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:09,554
How about we meet Sung-yong and drink?

317
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,182
Didn't you say you're on a diet?

318
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:12,565
What diet?

319
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,116
I'm the same as you when
you take off your clothes.

320
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,758
-This is the Hawaiian pizza you ordered!
-Thank you.

321
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,941
-The fries are a bonus.
-Thank you.

322
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,118
It's also yummy.

323
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,798
I've said many times to pay
300 thousand won in advance.

324
00:18:41,952 --> 00:18:44,354
Is your ambition to become a loan shark?

325
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:46,019
What kind of french fries
cost 300 thousand won?

326
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,238
The ones you ate before this don't count?

327
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:50,798
The pizza is burnt!

328
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:52,358
Darn it.

329
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,967
-U-sol, let's eat.
-Good grief.

330
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,067
I won't just let it go.

331
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,377
Give it all back, you animal.

332
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:01,441
Darn it, Han Sung-yong.

333
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:05,054
In prison, he always talked about
money and now it's getting worse, right?

334
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:06,308
But...

335
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,918
a debt of 300 thousand won is also a lot.

336
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,908
You're on my side, right?

337
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:13,051
Do not be like that.

338
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,744
I don't know if his sister has any idea

339
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,599
that his brother often eats for free.

340
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,984
It seems like if they find
out, he will be embarrassed.

341
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,092
This jerk.

342
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,280
Whatever it is, don't
bring my family into this.

343
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:24,313
This is going too far, right?

344
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:26,638
Do you have a younger sibling?

345
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:28,301
His sister is beautiful.

346
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,918
But why is he ugly?

347
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:32,068
In my life,

348
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:35,169
this is the first time I've been
called ugly by Han Sung-yong.

349
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:37,243
U-sol.

350
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,666
Give us honest answers.

351
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,931
Who is more handsome?

352
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:41,037
Why ask that?

353
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,188
It's obvious that I'm
more handsome, right?

354
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:50,439
I think you two have different styles.

355
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,281
Correct answer.

356
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:53,918
Me, right? Answer quickly.

357
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:57,504
-I'll get a beer first.
-Good grief.

358
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:59,313
U-sol, we're customers here.

359
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:00,878
Just ask the boss to get it.

360
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:04,351
Ask that customer
whether he has legs or not.

361
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:07,078
I do, so quickly tell him to get it.

362
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:10,250
Can you tell him to take it
himself if he doesn't want to die?

363
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,285
It looks like this kid
is looking for trouble.

364
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:15,027
-Want me to show you a killer kick?
-Today I will beat him up.

365
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,460
-Such an animal.
-You'll be the referee.

366
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:17,838
-Gosh.
-Stop it already.

367
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,999
-Cha U-sol.
-You have to sell.

368
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,801
Ji-hee?

369
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:24,277
Has the teacher arrived?

370
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:27,157
Sit here.

371
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:31,769
Boss Han. Why not get her a beer?

372
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,717
-This kid!
-Okay... Let me get it.

373
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:37,983
Sorry, I'm late.

374
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,799
My shift replacement came late.

375
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,308
No, we just arrived too.

376
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,918
Teacher, your beer. Please drink it.

377
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:47,398
I told you. Just call me
by name outside of class.

378
00:20:48,557 --> 00:20:51,241
Once a teacher, always a teacher.

379
00:20:51,242 --> 00:20:54,988
What made you want to take the high
school equivalency exam all of a sudden?

380
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,307
Don't dampen my students' spirits.

381
00:20:57,308 --> 00:20:59,117
He has the potential for that.

382
00:21:00,347 --> 00:21:01,592
See?

383
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,703
"Possibility".

384
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:04,284
The English word is "possibility".

385
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:05,598
What? Darn it.

386
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,717
U-sol, introduce a teacher to me too.

387
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,899
Can you really learn?

388
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,100
What do you mean
by learn? I'll just cook...

389
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:17,789
Hold on. What did you say earlier?

390
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,997
"Can" learn?

391
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:20,007
Are you underestimating me?

392
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:22,028
-Can't I study?
-Yes, no, you can't.

393
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:23,534
If you can do it, why can't I?

394
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:24,982
Are we the same?

395
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,783
From the start, we were different...

396
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,798
Hey.

397
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:36,497
Ji-hee, what's the matter with you?

398
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:37,958
Want to toast together?

399
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:41,507
Of course, let's all toast together.

400
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,888
-U-sol, the teacher's glass is empty.
-I haven't drunk this yet. Drink it.

401
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,397
-Thank you.
-Our youngest, please say something.

402
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,696
Me?

403
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:52,986
Okay.

404
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:54,038
I will try.

405
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:58,324
I support Won-jun's studying to
pass his high school equivalency exam

406
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:01,310
and our Han Sung-yong's
food truck success.

407
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,789
Cheers to our forever friendship!

408
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,917
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

409
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:16,022
-This.
-Yes.

410
00:22:16,023 --> 00:22:18,998
-Thank you.
-Teacher, you just stay put.

411
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:21,563
I also ate earlier. So I have to help.

412
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:23,638
How can you be so considerate?

413
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,152
Are you an angel?

414
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:27,997
What do you mean?

415
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,398
It's fine.

416
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:33,917
What?

417
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,318
Gosh.

418
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:55,837
Son of a gun.

419
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,776
This is a man's job.

420
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:05,997
Come on.

421
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:07,678
Cha U-sol.

422
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:34,279
Are you Cha U-sol?

423
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:36,837
Come and work with me.
