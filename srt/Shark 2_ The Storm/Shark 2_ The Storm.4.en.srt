1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,939
"Episode 4."

2
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,535
You think you can redeem
all with this small change?

3
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:23,736
Keep dreaming!

4
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,535
Won-jun.

5
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:32,835
Actually, I saw what happened.

6
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:37,833
You saw it?

7
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,031
If I were him,

8
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:45,582
I don't think I could have
forgiven you right away.

9
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:49,432
But that's just the start, right?

10
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,729
Thirty-one people.

11
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:07,527
These are the people I
have to ask for forgiveness.

12
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:09,227
"Notebook."

13
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,227
But do you know what hurts the most?

14
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:13,627
Among them...

15
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:16,927
There are people whose
faces I can't remember.

16
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,926
I guess you really are a bad person.

17
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:32,723
You just have to keep
sincerely apologising.

18
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:35,922
Besides, they are the
ones who will forgive you.

19
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:38,523
Don't they need time too?

20
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,920
Thank you, U-sol.

21
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,420
Thanks to you, I gained a lot of courage.

22
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,520
Did you just say that? I got goosebumps.

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,920
But I feel like my
courage is still lacking.

24
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,619
I have something I
want to tell you as well.

25
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,316
I'll finish my homework first,

26
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:07,017
then I'll tell you.

27
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:09,216
-Homework?
-I am very hungry.

28
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,316
Let's just eat there at Han Sung-yong's.

29
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,916
Don't beat around the bush. What is it?

30
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,815
Hey, there is something like that.

31
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,615
Only a true man can do this.

32
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:19,514
Then you can never do it.

33
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,414
Where else can you
find a true man like me?

34
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:23,013
So tell me quickly.

35
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:26,913
As I always say, a man
must know how to wait.

36
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,212
"Do your best, and let Heaven's
will take care of the rest."

37
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:30,113
A human should finish all his work

38
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:32,112
-and wait for the will of heaven...
-Won-jun!

39
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:33,712
This is a public place.

40
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,812
Pardon me.

41
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:38,012
Pardon me.

42
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:42,810
-Won-jun!
-Fight me if you can.

43
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:45,010
Are you on Han
Sung-yong's side or my side?

44
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,010
-On Sung-yong's side.
-You punk!

45
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:07,907
"Shark: The Storm."

46
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,303
You're Cha U-sol, right?

47
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:38,801
"1 hour earlier."

48
00:03:57,197 --> 00:04:00,297
"Notebook."

49
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:03,585
You're here?

50
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,879
"Dangjin Funeral Home."

51
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,677
You're Cha U-sol, right?

52
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:50,477
What were you doing?
Why are you still alive?

53
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:55,076
What did you do when Lee Won-jun died?

54
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:57,075
What were you doing?

55
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,775
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,174
Darn it!

57
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:03,073
Stop! What's wrong?

58
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,773
Say!

59
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:06,973
Why did Lee Won-jun die?

60
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:09,874
What were you all doing when he was dying?

61
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:13,973
Why?

62
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,971
Let go! Let go!

63
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:19,172
Please forgive me.

64
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:26,070
Forgive me...

65
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:28,169
If you're sorry, save Lee Won-jun.

66
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,069
-Save him!
-Stop, Yeon-jin!

67
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,568
-Why are you still alive?
-I'm sorry...

68
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,168
Please forgive me!

69
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:37,067
Calm down.

70
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:39,368
-Let go of me.
-Take U-sol out first.

71
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,667
Calm down.

72
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,166
Why? Why are you still alive?

73
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,466
U-sol, go out quickly!

74
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:48,567
You should save him!

75
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:57,065
"The deceased: Lee
Won-jun, Family: Lee Yeon-jin."

76
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:03,063
Crazy jerk.

77
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:04,863
Yeon-jin.

78
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:07,364
Don't hate your brother so much.

79
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,558
It's because of me.

80
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:42,657
Won-jun became like that because of me.

81
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:49,256
I shouldn't have said no
when he first came to me.

82
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:53,355
I should just work with him.

83
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:58,953
Sung-yong.

84
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:01,653
I shouldn't have learned
how to fight in the first place.

85
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:05,853
That way, he wouldn't have
been close to people like me.

86
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:10,750
That way, this will not happen.

87
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,750
-That's enough.
-I killed him!

88
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,550
I killed Won-jun.

89
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:17,950
It would be better if I died!

90
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:19,850
You jerk, stop it!

91
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,149
Do you still remember
what Won-jun said in the car?

92
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,748
Knowing you might be like
this, he still said it's not your fault!

93
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:31,647
That fool would always
brag that he's going to college.

94
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:34,898
He kept apologising even though
he knew he would not be forgiven.

95
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:39,646
For the first time, he felt like a human.

96
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:41,446
His life was like trash.

97
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,945
But thanks to you, U-sol,

98
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:46,145
he feels like a human for the first time.

99
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,044
But if you keep acting like this,

100
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:56,943
do you think he will like it?

101
00:08:58,143 --> 00:09:00,343
Don't burden the person who has left.

102
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,937
I have received the
treatment. I can go again later.

103
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,338
Yun Ji-hee!

104
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:30,136
-Mum.
-Come home quickly!

105
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,336
Everything turned out
like this because of me.

106
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,236
How could I do that?

107
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:37,135
Ji-hee.

108
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:39,034
Ji-hee, what's wrong?

109
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:41,234
Ji-hee.

110
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:43,133
Hello?

111
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:44,335
Ji-hee!

112
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:46,733
Hello?

113
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,533
-Mum, I'll call you back later.
-Ji-hee!

114
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:52,532
Darn it. Why did you come here?

115
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,732
Can't you see I'm working?

116
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:58,132
Let me eat and live too. Gosh!

117
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,431
So, what?

118
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:03,931
What are you going to do?

119
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,931
"Managing Director Cha Dae-po."

120
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,430
Please answer it.

121
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,028
This case is a stabbing incident,
so I can't just leave it like that.

122
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:18,827
I will take care of it as a solo crime.

123
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,527
Just come up with a scapegoat.

124
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:24,227
Why did that Hyun Woo-yong
always causing trouble?

125
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:27,627
I can't always keep
cleaning up after his messes.

126
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:31,825
Hey. This time...

127
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:34,626
makse sure the compensation is as good.

128
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:37,925
This is a murder case.

129
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:44,524
I get it.

130
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:49,774
-Make sure everything is well-prepared.
-I will.

131
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:52,022
Hey.

132
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:57,921
You jerk. Do you think
the police are pushovers?

133
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:12,118
-Grandma, I heard it well.
-Yes.

134
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,618
If you need any help,

135
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,717
"Inspector Kim Hyeong-kwon"
don't hesitate to contact me anytime.

136
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,917
Thank you.

137
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:20,516
I know you're very sad, but stay strong.

138
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:22,516
Everything will be all right.

139
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:24,817
-Thank you for your help.
-Sure, grandma.

140
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,715
So, you mean the police are
now on Hyun Woo-yong's side?

141
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:33,715
This is absolutely absurd!

142
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:36,314
What should we do now?

143
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:40,714
I'm leaving this here.

144
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:44,512
What's that?

145
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:47,912
"Let's finish what we were talking
about. From: Hyun Woo-yong."

146
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:50,212
It has been sent.

147
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,411
Hey.

148
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,809
Don't you want something fresh and raw?

149
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,260
-Let's go to a Japanese restaurant instead.
-Good.

150
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:09,908
Change the menu.

151
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,208
"Let's finish what we were talking about."

152
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,807
Darn it!

153
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,606
Darn it!

154
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,706
Police or whatever! We will do it!

155
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:27,504
Stop it.

156
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:29,904
If we go, what can we do?

157
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,803
Catch him, kill him or
drag him to the police!

158
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:36,602
What a jerk! How dare he
send flowers to the one he killed?

159
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:38,203
Do you want to go and get killed?

160
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:40,102
Do you think that's what Won-jun wants?

161
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:42,203
That's exactly what he wants!

162
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,700
-Sung-yong!
-As of now, you have to calm down!

163
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,100
Go away if you're afraid.

164
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,700
If you don't go, I will go alone.

165
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,100
Scared? Do I look scared now?

166
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:56,399
That jerk Hyun
Woo-yong, I want to kill him!

167
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,298
But now is not the time for that.

168
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,398
-We have to be patient now!
-Are you guys insane?

169
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,898
Are you guys gangsters?

170
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,498
Go out! The funeral isn't over yet!

171
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,198
Fight outside!

172
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:17,896
"Let's finish what we were talking about."

173
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:27,493
"Lee Dong-min (haven't apologised).
I broke his bone during exercise."

174
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:28,993
"Shin Min-sung (haven't apologised)"

175
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:32,294
"We are good friends and he was
seriously injured when we fought."

176
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:41,590
"Cha U-sol. I often hit him in
prison because he looked weak."

177
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:42,990
"A strong and good child."

178
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:46,091
"I will be a good brother
and be friends with him."

179
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,589
But I feel like my
courage is still lacking.

180
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,789
I have something I
want to tell you as well.

181
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,989
I'll finish my homework first,

182
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,788
then I'll tell you.

183
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:59,088
Homework? What is it? Tell me.

184
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,087
Hey, there is something like that.

185
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:03,287
Only a true man can do this.

186
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:08,687
"I will be a good brother
and be friends with him."

187
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:17,884
"Cha U-sol."

188
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:21,384
"Notebook."

189
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,082
What Sung-yong said is true.

190
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,681
Won-jun wanted us

191
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:38,482
to stay strong until the very end.

192
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:45,080
"Lee Won-jun."

193
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:57,178
I'll be back, Won-jun.

194
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:33,071
Let's go.

195
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:37,571
Let's make them pay for
what they did to Won-jun.

196
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,670
But let's make the right plan this time.

197
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,670
I'll go too.

198
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,069
This is my brother's
business. I'll go too.

199
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,066
Hey, that is a dangerous
place. We can't just go like that.

200
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,666
I don't think that's right.

201
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:14,064
Take this.

202
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:20,763
Let's go together.

203
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,761
If you truly believe that
the path you chose is right,

204
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:29,160
you must follow it, no
matter how difficult it is.

205
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:32,211
"Late, Lee Won-jun" -Won-jun
took my words and lived by them.

206
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,559
The path we take is certainly risky

207
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,660
but if we give up, nothing will change.

208
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:01,254
That's why we have to go.

209
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,655
I will be back.

210
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:23,152
Even if a big storm comes...

211
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:32,050
"Shark: The Storm."

212
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:52,646
Gosh.

213
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:58,246
Something odd keeps popping up.

214
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:04,043
It's odd.

215
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:06,143
There must be a reason why it's cheap.

216
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:07,444
Move aside.

217
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,642
It seems like you take photos a lot.

218
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:19,341
-Isn't this a bit odd?
-What?

219
00:18:19,342 --> 00:18:21,840
Who takes an exam ID
photo in a sticker booth?

220
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,440
This thing gave me two
photos for 4,000 won.

221
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,540
Where else would you
find a good deal like that?

222
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,541
From the size alone, does it look right?

223
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,939
Which ID photo is wider than it is tall?

224
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,638
-Oh, really?
-Is that all you can say?

225
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,537
-Come on out.
-Wait!

226
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:40,537
Then, you can take photos like this.

227
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:44,036
Let me help you. I'll take a
shot of you with my elbow.

228
00:18:44,037 --> 00:18:45,636
Is it really that strange?

229
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:47,535
That's odd, you fool.

230
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,035
It's embarrassing for others to see.

231
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:53,235
Guys, get inside! Look, I brought this.

232
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,334
This is for you because you like meat.

233
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,934
Meat. Okay, okay.

234
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,333
I like it.

235
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,833
Sang-hyup, let's go out
with the normal people.

236
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,333
Okay, go!

237
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:06,633
One moment! Ta-da!

238
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,132
You can't ignore this.
Because this is really funny.

239
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,131
-Why are you like that, too?
-Two photos for 4,000 won.

240
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,430
Where else can you get
such a good opportunity?

241
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:20,231
See? Everyone was tempted by the words.

242
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,329
This idiot came here to
take photos for the exam.

243
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,630
That...

244
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:28,028
Wait a minute.

245
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:30,228
Listen here. Wouldn't it be okay

246
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:32,328
if you tilt your head like
this and take the photo?

247
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:34,526
Look. He said the same thing.

248
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,827
You know how well U-sol studied, right?

249
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:37,927
-First place overall in the school.
-That's correct.

250
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,226
I'm going crazy.

251
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:42,625
This is too embarassing, even for me.

252
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,325
Don't!

253
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:45,725
My heart feels like
it's going to fall out!

254
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,925
I almost fell!

255
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:49,325
It is prohibited to say
fall here at this time.

256
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,224
If Won-jun fails the high
school equivalency exam

257
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:53,524
after saying fall, will
you be responsible?

258
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,175
If he ever gets into trouble
because of your mouth...

259
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,822
It fell down.

260
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,123
Fall.

261
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:04,621
U-sol, I'm going to fall because of you.

262
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:06,521
Forgive me.

263
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:08,622
Forget it. Let's take one photo and go.

264
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:12,120
Boss Han.

265
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,720
Am I your ATM?

266
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:16,219
Why are you like this, Boss Han?

267
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,920
-I have money.
-Do you have money?

268
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,918
I also have emergency cash.

269
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,717
-That's enough.
-Good grief.

270
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:27,018
-Is there a place to insert coins here?
-Well...

271
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,517
-No.
-Is this a thousand won?

272
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:30,818
Move.

273
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,017
That's a big boss!

274
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:38,215
The mode from earlier...

275
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:40,015
-Do you want to try this?
-Press it.

276
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:41,314
This or this?

277
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:44,614
-No, something still feels off.
-Move! Seriously!

278
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:48,014
-Where should I look, here?
-Look into the lens.

279
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:50,513
-Make a pose.
-Okay.

280
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:51,814
Get ready.

281
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:56,612
Hey, are you guys at a funeral?

282
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:59,212
Everyone, try to smile
a little sweeter like this.

283
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:01,811
-Shouldn't we strike a pose now?
-Let's do a heart.

284
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:03,411
Heart.

285
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,310
-I want to throw up.
-Throw up?

286
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:08,310
Sung-yong, are you really this tall?

287
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:10,861
It's been a while since
my feet touched the ground.

288
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,509
I'm levitating among the piglets.

289
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,708
-Then, I will go forward.
-Hey...

290
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,808
Hey! If the building is in
front, is the villa visible?

291
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,207
-Taking photo in three.
-It's not a villa but a single-family home.

292
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,707
-Do you want to be hit?
-It is capturing time!

293
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,407
-In the middle...
-Stay still, you rock!

294
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:28,507
-I'll go back!
-Move!

295
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:31,007
Like this?

296
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,107
Do a cute pose. Like this.

297
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:36,306
Your head is so huge!

298
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:39,205
Get out. Won-jun has to take an ID photo!
