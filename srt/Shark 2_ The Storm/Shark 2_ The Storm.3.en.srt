1
00:00:13,793 --> 00:00:16,933
"Shark: The Storm."

2
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,902
"Episode 3."

3
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:25,735
U-sol, wake up!

4
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:28,119
These jerks!

5
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:30,276
Stop!

6
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:39,871
The body of a martial arts athlete,
known as Songgot, has been found

7
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,833
in the Han River this morning.

8
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,594
It is said that this is due to the
problem he had with his manager.

9
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:48,998
The manager who killed
him then committed suicide.

10
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:52,135
Among the bodies found was
also Choi, who is the girlfriend...

11
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:12,514
You're up?

12
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:40,348
Where are my friends?

13
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,842
See? He immediately looked for his friend.

14
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:49,300
That's why I suggested this.

15
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,051
Why did you have to go this far?

16
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:59,193
I said I'll see you later.

17
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:00,448
How are you?

18
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:05,914
After living this life, I
feel the need to change.

19
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:08,428
That's why I tried to
expand my recent insights.

20
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,359
I'm asking, where are my friends?

21
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:19,429
I'm talking to you right now.

22
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,308
Stay focused.

23
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,044
I recently became chairman.

24
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:42,069
I read books, watched
documentaries and stuff.

25
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,244
I found out that in Africa,
they send kids to the battlefield.

26
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:45,838
I don't care about them.

27
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,600
Where are my friends, Ji-hee and Won-jun?

28
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:54,968
They make the kids mentally
unstable and shoot people with guns.

29
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,472
Over there in Africa.

30
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:02,186
Okay.

31
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:05,783
How to make them lose
their senses like that?

32
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:10,618
After putting on the blindfold,

33
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,435
they make the kids raise their guns

34
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:15,254
and shoot forward.

35
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,925
They thought no one was in front of them.

36
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:28,765
But after their blindfolds were removed,

37
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,626
the people in front of them were dead.

38
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,435
Hit by the bullets they fired.

39
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:38,311
Then, how are the kids?

40
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,178
They'll be mentally disturbed, right?

41
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:45,264
After that, they'd do
everything they were told to.

42
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,337
Okay.

43
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:57,292
Then, let's try to understand
the mentality of those kids.

44
00:03:58,282 --> 00:03:59,610
If you understand, choose!

45
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,665
What?

46
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,527
Choose who to kill.

47
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:07,921
You're not that smart either.

48
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:09,965
It's simple.

49
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:13,046
Once you choose, that
person dies and the rest will live.

50
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,355
You won't get hurt.

51
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,910
Choose who you want to save.

52
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,108
That's easier, right?

53
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:24,416
They have nothing to do
with this. Can you let them go?

54
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,063
Darn it!

55
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:30,179
That wouldn't be fun, U-sol.

56
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,345
I want to stay with you until the end.

57
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:42,886
But I have another schedule.

58
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,283
Anyway, choose carefully.

59
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:49,200
You can do this, Cha U-sol.

60
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:52,400
Wait a minute...

61
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,309
I'm all you need, right?

62
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,193
Hey... Wait a minute!

63
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:58,941
Wait, I'll do as you say.

64
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,423
Okay? I'll do it all!

65
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:03,522
-Whatever you say!
-Start recording.

66
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:04,563
Hey!

67
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:05,903
-Yes.
-Wait a minute!

68
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:12,855
If he insists, kill both of them.

69
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:15,254
Hey!

70
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:17,852
Wait a minute!

71
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,569
Please, just a moment!

72
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:34,275
This kid is scared.

73
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:41,030
Gosh, the UV rays.

74
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:43,067
You, on the right.

75
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:45,944
Start recording.

76
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,250
Hey. Broadcast room.

77
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,336
Gosh.

78
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:22,109
Darn it, I have to go to the salon.

79
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:24,666
Hey!

80
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:26,226
Hurry up and choose.

81
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:28,065
I'll give you ten seconds.

82
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,988
-Ten.
-Wait a minute.

83
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,141
If you don't choose, -Wait a minute.

84
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,338
They'll both die.

85
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:36,501
-Nine.
-I'll choose...

86
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:38,014
I'll do as I am told.

87
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,623
-Eight!
-What do I do to save them?

88
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,008
Save them?

89
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:45,680
-Seven.
-Don't!

90
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:49,441
I said don't do that!

91
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,729
Darn it.

92
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,895
Don't touch my friends or I'll kill you!

93
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,939
-Six.
-I'll kill you!

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,792
I said, don't do it!

95
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:09,021
Five.

96
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:13,057
This is my fault. It is my fault.

97
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,517
I was out of control just now.

98
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,430
-Please don't do it.
-Four.

99
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:18,608
They did nothing wrong.

100
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,938
You said you'd do everything, right?

101
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,239
Just now.

102
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,888
With your own mouth.

103
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:26,793
Three.

104
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,824
I told you.

105
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,244
If you don't choose within ten seconds,

106
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,438
they'll both die.

107
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:39,145
I don't know...

108
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:40,232
Two.

109
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:44,387
What should I do?

110
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,469
Ji-hee, what should I do?

111
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,792
Won-jun.

112
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,421
I have absolutely no idea what to do.

113
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:55,616
I really don't know...

114
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,175
One.

115
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,164
Won-jun.

116
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:01,850
I really don't know what to do.

117
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:08,307
-No! I didn't choose him!
-Time's up!

118
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:10,640
Don't do it! I didn't choose him!

119
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,756
No!

120
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,731
Won-jun!

121
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,228
This moment...

122
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:27,967
-Remember it well.
-No...

123
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,662
No!

124
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,380
No!

125
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:38,295
Darn it!

126
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,555
Miss Si-hyun, are you all right?

127
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:22,290
You should remember this clearly.

128
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,569
Won-jun, are you all right?

129
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,220
You think it doesn't hurt
to be stabbed with a knife?

130
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:35,358
Don't worry. I just got grazed.

131
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:37,983
Teacher Ji-hee?

132
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,313
I'm all right.

133
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,829
You're really okay, right?

134
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,539
You thought I'd die just
because of a stab wound?

135
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,063
Let's get out quickly.

136
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:02,930
The combination of punches
earlier was very neat, right?

137
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:16,570
Catch.

138
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:18,977
Catch the pig and the rest!

139
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:21,943
Catch him quickly!

140
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:25,069
I'll finish you all off if
you can't catch them.

141
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,186
-They're coming!
-Catch them!

142
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,085
Cha U-sol, hurry up and go!

143
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:52,562
Come here!

144
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,237
Go, hurry!

145
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:24,409
Darn it!

146
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,671
These jerks!

147
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,727
Scum!

148
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,631
Cha U-sol!

149
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:41,573
You witch!

150
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,312
Ji-hee, are you okay?

151
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,552
-U-sol, are you okay?
-Yes.

152
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:20,291
Let's get out of here. It doesn't matter.

153
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:21,787
Won-jun, are you okay?

154
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:23,391
Yes, come on down.

155
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:24,530
Hurry up.

156
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:48,228
I think it's that building.

157
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,743
-Look at that.
-Move quickly!

158
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,589
Take Ms. Ji-hee away
first. I'll buy you some time.

159
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,718
You can't do that.

160
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:02,177
Darn it, please listen to me!

161
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:03,755
We could all die here!

162
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,012
What do we do after entering?

163
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:06,975
Ask them, "Did you guys kidnap people?"

164
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,961
You want them to beat you up?

165
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:12,407
What are we going to do just sitting here?

166
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,116
Teacher, see you later.

167
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:15,400
Ji-hee, come on.

168
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:28,348
Because I live life
so difficult, I forgot...

169
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:35,501
what kind of person I used to be.

170
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:40,096
Attack him!

171
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:02,875
Good grief.

172
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:11,346
Where do you want to run to?

173
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,949
When I give a sign,

174
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,674
go to the bright place.

175
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:17,325
Be sure to go to a place
crowded with people. Got it?

176
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,173
One.

177
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:25,291
Two.

178
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,049
Gosh.

179
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,157
This is crazy.

180
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:35,271
Look.

181
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:36,622
What I said is true, right?

182
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,578
-Who are you?
-Who are we?

183
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:42,994
We deliver pizza.

184
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:46,943
With an extra cheese crust!

185
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:49,507
These jerks!

186
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:24,233
U-sol, where is Won-jun?

187
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,754
Don't you guys think you
guys came a little bit too late?

188
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,067
He's still alive, apparently.

189
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,518
He even looked like he
was sitting on the toilet.

190
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:16,023
Where is your car?

191
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:17,901
Follow us.

192
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,738
Won-jun, wake up!

193
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:22,656
Where are they?

194
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:24,679
There!

195
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,734
Stop, you jerk!

196
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:30,138
Come on, quickly!

197
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:32,445
-Hurry up!
-We're almost there.

198
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,658
-We're almost there.
-Hurry up!

199
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:35,844
Catch them!

200
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,154
Darn it!

201
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,159
-Hold my hand.
-Hurry!

202
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:41,481
Catch him!

203
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:43,562
-Won-jun! No!
-Won-jun!

204
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,630
Hey, hurry up!

205
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,621
-They're coming! Let's go!
-Catch them!

206
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:48,078
Sung-yong, let's go!

207
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,564
Come on, hurry!

208
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:50,759
No, Won-jun!

209
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,313
-Those jerks!
-Catch him!

210
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,042
Darn it, there are so many of them.

211
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:55,693
Should I just push them all away?

212
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,412
Stop the car!

213
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:03,614
Hey!

214
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,814
Those fools!

215
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,967
Won-jun, are you all right?

216
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:24,954
Sung-yong.

217
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:26,598
To the hospital quickly!

218
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,468
Won-jun, are you really okay?

219
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:29,928
Hold on.

220
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,962
Hurry up.

221
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:40,399
Won-jun, are you all
right? Are you still awake?

222
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:43,197
U-sol.

223
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:46,144
When you looked at me there...

224
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:50,560
Won-jun, I didn't mean to choose you.

225
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:51,827
I know.

226
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,610
The kids I used to bully

227
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,304
looked at me like that.

228
00:18:57,384 --> 00:18:58,620
Begging for forgiveness.

229
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:01,419
Begging for help.

230
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,654
That's why I know.

231
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,718
Darn it. Lee Won-jun,
you have a lot of debt.

232
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,319
If you die before paying it off,

233
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:12,167
I will really kill you.

234
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:15,883
The boy is still...

235
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:23,356
U-sol.

236
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,194
This...

237
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,301
Please take my place.

238
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:31,468
Please tell them.

239
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,579
That I apologised.

240
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,622
You can't ask someone else to
do it! Live and apologise yourself!

241
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:39,899
That's right.

242
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:43,895
Apologising must be done in person.

243
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:47,973
I'm sorry.

244
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:49,092
U-sol.

245
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,211
Never...

246
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,045
die...

247
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,404
like trash.

248
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:04,635
Won-jun.

249
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:09,670
Won-jun?

250
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,276
Won-jun, don't go.

251
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,110
Won-jun...

252
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,658
Won-jun!

253
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:27,652
Won-jun!

254
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,887
Won-jun!

255
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:36,244
Won-jun, don't go!

256
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:40,120
No!

257
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,618
Won-jun!

258
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,835
Darn it!

259
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,513
Won-jun!
