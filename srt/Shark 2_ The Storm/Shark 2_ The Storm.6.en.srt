1
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:16,803
"Shark: The Storm."

2
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:20,803
"Episode 6."

3
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:26,103
You jerk, don't!

4
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:32,103
Won-jun!

5
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,203
Let go!

6
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:46,102
I'm giving you a chance.

7
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:48,203
A chance for you to take revenge yourself.

8
00:00:52,902 --> 00:00:54,301
That's the video file.

9
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:57,902
Do you want to take it or
fight seriously with me once?

10
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,400
There is a price that
follows an option, right?

11
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,702
Get up!

12
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,902
Who is next?

13
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:29,501
Is family more motivating than friends?

14
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,701
-What is your reason for this?
-Reason?

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,101
This is exciting, right?

16
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,499
You jerk!

17
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,099
It hurts, right?

18
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,299
Are you surprised?

19
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,546
I invited you to have fun, right?

20
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:27,395
Darn it!

21
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:25,542
Darn it, you thought I called
you to have this kind of match?

22
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:34,892
Get up.

23
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:38,292
Get up. I won't hit you.

24
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,790
Get up.

25
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,792
It's okay, get up.

26
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,691
Jerk.

27
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,390
You can come in as my subordinate.

28
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,989
In your dreams.

29
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,190
Come on.

30
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:52,689
Won-jun!

31
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,389
Don't!

32
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,489
Won-jun!

33
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,388
Don't!

34
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,988
-Turn it off.
-Won-jun!

35
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:08,789
Why? You're afraid
of ending like this jerk?

36
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,489
Turn it off, you jerk!

37
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:18,488
Won-jun!

38
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,988
Won-jun!

39
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,289
Look!

40
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:32,687
Your friend was stabbed and fought hard,

41
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:34,388
why don't you try like that?

42
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:12,287
Just like this?

43
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,886
Is this all you can do?

44
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:53,385
Are you all right?

45
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:56,285
Let's keep going.

46
00:09:15,084 --> 00:09:17,085
You should've done this a long time ago.

47
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,083
Darn it.

48
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:45,577
Let go, you jerk.

49
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:12,474
Darn it!

50
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:35,771
Let go, you jerk.

51
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:44,671
Let it go so this can end.

52
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,768
You will regret saving me.

53
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,969
I'm different from you.

54
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,568
Different?

55
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:16,267
You're different from me?

56
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:08,466
I lost?

57
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:18,564
Breaking news.

58
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,264
Mr. Hyun, the leader of a corporate
crime syndicate, was arrested today.

59
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:24,564
Mr. Hyun operates an
illegal sports betting business

60
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:27,064
that targets people famous in
the world of politics and business.

61
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,964
It was shocking to learn that
he's the one behind the crimes

62
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:32,764
like ordering a murder,
abandoning corpses and kidnapping.

63
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:33,764
"USB proof sent anonymously
plays an important role"

64
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:39,964
Mr. Hyun's crimes were revealed
through a USB handed over anonymously.

65
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,164
It was also revealed
that the fighter found dead

66
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:43,964
in the Han River a week ago

67
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:47,463
is one of the members of
Mr. Hyun's dark business.

68
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:50,463
Prosecutors said they're
investigating both cases simultaneously

69
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,663
because they think the two are related.

70
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:55,463
The crime syndicate set up by Mr. Hyun

71
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:59,264
is a so-called third-generation gangster
disguised as a legitimate business.

72
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:32,363
"Han Yeong-sik (not forgiven)"

73
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:40,763
Darn it.

74
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:47,561
"Kim Sang-min (not forgiven)"

75
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,962
Why now...

76
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:51,463
Forget it.

77
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:03,861
"Jeon Hong-ki (not forgiven)"

78
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:06,262
"Kim Deung-geon (not forgiven)"

79
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:10,561
"Cha U-sol."

80
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:21,561
"Cha U-sol (forgiven)"

81
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,860
Won-jun.

82
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:34,261
I...

83
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,960
forgave you a long time ago.

84
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,960
"Lee Won-jun."

85
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,660
Others might think you're
Lee Won-jun's younger brother.

86
00:20:49,761 --> 00:20:52,559
He's Won-jun's younger brother.
Acting grumpy when he's clearly happy.

87
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,859
Isn't that right, Sang-hyup?

88
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,859
But you really came here empty-handed?

89
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,458
Do you know how much the debt is?

90
00:20:57,459 --> 00:21:00,559
I'll be like this until it is paid off.

91
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,358
Sung-yong, do you know you
really hold grudges sometimes?

92
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,759
-Exactly.
-I said I wanted to come alone.

93
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,859
You guys really are so noisy.

94
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,460
I'm always scared when you angry.

95
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,059
"Visiting room."

96
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,357
I heard about Won-jun.

97
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:43,957
Do-hyun.

98
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,957
I think I understand now.

99
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,257
What I really want.

100
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:49,558
What do you mean?

101
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,857
Every time I fight, I
feel like I'm still alive.

102
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:59,557
I thought only people like
Bae Seok-chan liked fighting.

103
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:01,257
I enjoyed it too.

104
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:06,356
So I'm going to keep fighting.

105
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:09,557
Now, instead of fighting after
being dragged into the situation,

106
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:12,557
I want to fight in a fight
of my own choosing.

107
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,656
I thought you're going
to say something else.

108
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:17,656
Don't you already want
to be a martial arts athlete?

109
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:20,556
Yes, I really want to
do it. Martial arts athlete.

110
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:22,256
You said it before, so
why did you say it again?

111
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,957
Fight me.

112
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:27,656
What?

113
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:30,055
I will work hard

114
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:32,256
and become a great athlete like you.

115
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:35,457
When that time comes, fight me.

116
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:41,755
Hey.

117
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:44,355
If you want to be like me,

118
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:46,356
you'll have to work harder after this.

119
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:49,056
You know that, right?

120
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,354
They say sharks don't have swim bladders,

121
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:06,255
so they swim their whole lives.

122
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,254
I also promised myself

123
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,555
that I will not stop and
will keep on moving.

124
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:18,154
But how hard is that decision...

125
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:19,555
I finally know it now.

126
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:25,355
Just like Won-jun apologised
even if he wasn't forgiven...

127
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:27,753
"World Rookie Championship."

128
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:30,253
Sometimes we have to do
something to get something else

129
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:34,154
even if we don't achieve 100 per cent.

130
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:36,954
World Rookie Championship.

131
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:46,104
"Kia Bongo 3 Built-in Tow Truck."

132
00:23:54,754 --> 00:23:58,753
"Total Prize 1 Billion Won
World Rookie Championship."

133
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:15,453
"World Rookie Championship."

134
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:39,852
Even if today's intention
comes with another burden,

135
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:43,752
I have to keep moving.

136
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,252
I no longer fight to survive,

137
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:52,852
but I've decided to fight to stay alive.

138
00:24:57,552 --> 00:25:01,451
"Shark: The Storm."

139
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:14,251
"Security Control Room"
