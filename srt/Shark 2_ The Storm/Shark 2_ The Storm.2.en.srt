1
00:00:01,821 --> 00:00:03,926
"Episode 2"

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,939
"3 hours earlier."

3
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:28,374
I've caught all three.

4
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:32,507
Bring them to the second-floor cabin.

5
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:33,908
All right.

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,311
The chairman is here, head to the cabin.

7
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,314
After dropping him off, wait
in your respective positions.

8
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:16,922
Hi.

9
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:24,224
Move.

10
00:01:27,626 --> 00:01:29,126
Open up.

11
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,729
You should feed them.

12
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,530
Surely Songgot is hungry too.

13
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:47,432
Please be quiet! I'm begging you!

14
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,132
Get them up.

15
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,433
Stand!

16
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,935
Hey, you jerk.

17
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:02,336
He can't compete because his wrist hurts.

18
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:03,837
That's why he ran off.

19
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:23,243
Come on, sit down.

20
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:28,644
Who made your wrist like that?

21
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:31,645
Someone named Cha U-sol
who works at the training centre.

22
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:34,447
Employee? Not an athlete?

23
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,648
But an employee?

24
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:45,149
It's okay. I finished the game well today.

25
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,551
So, don't worry.

26
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:51,051
Forgive me. Problems arose because of me.

27
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:52,952
I won't let it happen again.

28
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,603
This problem has already occurred

29
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:57,104
and there will be no next time.

30
00:02:57,654 --> 00:02:59,855
You're no longer interesting to me now.

31
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:08,057
Chairman, I...

32
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:09,557
Which one of you do you trust?

33
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:10,758
What?

34
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,758
Between the two, your
lover or your manager...

35
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,660
Who do you trust to risk your life?

36
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:34,466
Not your lover but your manager?

37
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,666
My younger sibling.

38
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,267
Cousin!

39
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:42,468
-Jerk...
-That surprised me!

40
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,468
Okay, cousin.

41
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:45,770
Younger cousin?

42
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,372
Chairman.

43
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,076
-Listen here.
-Yes.

44
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:11,977
If you survive for 10 seconds
without saying anything,

45
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:14,178
I'll save your cousin.

46
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:15,878
What?

47
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,180
Do you like mala soup?

48
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,480
Okay.

49
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,383
It's hot!

50
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:34,984
Chairman! Please spare me!

51
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:36,985
Chairman!

52
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,486
-Hey! Come here!
-Chairman!

53
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,487
-Songgot!
-Songgot!

54
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:44,087
Chairman, please spare me!

55
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:46,988
Chairman, no!

56
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,290
Songgot!

57
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:58,292
It seems like he's not a
regular part-time worker.

58
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,893
He has a criminal record.

59
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:03,293
Dae-po, take care of everything.

60
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:06,394
The guy who stabbed Bae
Seok-chan's eyes and tried to end him...

61
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:07,595
Do you remember?

62
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:09,495
He went for a payback
the day he was released

63
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:12,397
and he's back in a battered shape. Jerk.

64
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,198
He is that guy.

65
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,099
The person who hurt Songgot.

66
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,201
"Investigation and Criminal Report."

67
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:32,604
"Name: Cha U-sol."

68
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,405
Next game in three more days, right?

69
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,907
Jerk!

70
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,407
"Hyun Woo-yong."

71
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,108
Let's play a game.

72
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,160
At that time, I had no idea

73
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:56,011
what kind of storm

74
00:05:57,612 --> 00:05:59,512
has befallen us.

75
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:13,216
-Yes, what is up?
-Is Won-jun's class finished?

76
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:15,216
-Where are you?
-I'm in the parking lot.

77
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,317
I'm going home now. Why?

78
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:18,818
Just...

79
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,218
Please text me if you have arrived home.

80
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:22,719
I don't like you.

81
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,319
-What are you talking about?
-You keep acting like my lover,

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,021
so I'm disgusted.

83
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,622
Thanks for worrying about
me, but I'm not a child.

84
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,423
Anyway, please text me.

85
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,124
Hey!

86
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:39,424
-Hello?
-I will contact you if I'm home.

87
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,526
I'm hanging up.

88
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,227
Are you okay? Let me help you.

89
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:49,427
It's fine.

90
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,828
Never mind, let me help.

91
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:54,729
In that case, please
help me get to the car.

92
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,931
All right.

93
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,432
You're Yun Ji Hee.

94
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,633
Right?

95
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:48,747
"Shark: The Storm."

96
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:53,498
"Closed every second and
fourth Tuesday of the month."

97
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,957
Boss Han.

98
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,759
What happened? Has your
business gone bankrupt?

99
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,459
It's sold out, darn it.

100
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,560
Hey. They've been like
that for more than an hour.

101
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:32,061
Do they always do that?

102
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:36,862
You've grown up, Cha U-sol.

103
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,163
Did you raise him? Of
course, he's grown up.

104
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:40,763
When I first saw him, he was very strange.

105
00:08:40,764 --> 00:08:43,364
I thought he'd have a hard
time surviving in prison.

106
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:47,365
Because he's a child
who messes everything up.

107
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:48,766
Right?

108
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,966
Thanks to that, you and I seem
to be living in our right minds.

109
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:53,168
We study. We work.

110
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,068
I admit it.

111
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:01,671
Hey. But don't we look
like a retired couple now?

112
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:05,171
-What?
-It's that kind of vibe, right?

113
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:08,573
Watching our grown-up son and
bragging how he turned out so well.

114
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:15,074
Don't do it. I said no.

115
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:17,075
-My wife.
-Don't!

116
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:18,475
My wife.

117
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,376
I said no! That's disgusting!

118
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:24,178
Seriously, why is it always me?

119
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,380
It's so uncomfortable. I
thought I was going to die.

120
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:36,282
Darn it.

121
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:40,683
Hey, tie her feet.

122
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:09,392
Witch!

123
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:17,195
"Ji-hee."

124
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:21,895
-You're here?
-Since we have come here,

125
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:24,796
-will you treat me?
-Hey, piglet.

126
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,497
You didn't even treat us to a meal once.

127
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:29,198
-You're really...
-Sung-yong, why are you here at this hour?

128
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,898
Your business...

129
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,999
-not bankrupt, right?
-Not bankrupt.

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,499
The ingredients are sold out.

131
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,301
How can you two say the same thing?

132
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,901
Are you two praying for me to fail?

133
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,801
-No.
-You're here?

134
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:43,702
-Big brother, how is your business?
-Don't say it.

135
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:46,203
-Perhaps...
-Stop! Don't mind my business.

136
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:48,904
I haven't said anything yet,
but why are being harsh to me?

137
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,204
I told you not to call me big brother.

138
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:52,405
You are more scary, why
do you call me big brother?

139
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:55,806
Then do I have to call
you "big brother" like this?

140
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,207
Don't make me laugh. I'm
starving, quickly tidy up and let's go.

141
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,707
U-sol, put on your
clothes and sort this out.

142
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,009
Let's tidy up.

143
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,710
Why aren't you losing
weight? You need to lose some.

144
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:09,311
-A muscular man has muscles like me...
-What's this?

145
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:11,011
Let go! Let go of me!

146
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:14,312
Shut up! Come along quietly!

147
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:17,013
-I said, be quiet!
-Ji-hee. Ji-hee, where are you?

148
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,614
-What's the matter? Yun Ji-hee!
-What?

149
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:20,615
-I said shut up!
-Why? What's the matter?

150
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,915
Come quickly!

151
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:23,916
"Ji-hee."

152
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:25,916
Call again.

153
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:26,916
-What is it?
-It looks like a kidnapping.

154
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,518
-The number you are calling...
-Kidnapped? Who, why?

155
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:32,519
Are you Cha U-sol?

156
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,170
"Hyun Woo-yong" -Do
you know Bae Seok-chan?

157
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,521
I pay his salary.

158
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:46,023
Your eyes are pretty,
compared to Seok-chan.

159
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:50,624
Come and work with me.

160
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,424
Nothing is difficult.

161
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:55,825
If you do what you're told, you'll
get more money than expected.

162
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,126
What do you think?

163
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:58,827
Sorry, I don't want to.

164
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:04,928
You said you wanted to exercise.

165
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,729
The assassination attempt left you stuck.

166
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,329
When I reach out my
hand, you should hold it.

167
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,831
I'm sorry, but I'm not Seok-chan.

168
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,631
I will take care of my own life.

169
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,033
Hey, you darn jerk!

170
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,234
You should learn how to drive...

171
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:24,035
Are you okay?

172
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,536
What are you doing?

173
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:34,539
I can't help it. Looks
like this is your lover.

174
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
You've lost it right now. Take it easy.

175
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,940
-I have to go.
-Calm down!

176
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:45,142
Hyun Woo-yong has already kidnapped her!

177
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:47,843
Cha U-sol!

178
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:51,543
How can you go alone?
Then, what will you do?

179
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:54,044
If I don't go, what about
Ji-hee? I have to do something!

180
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,945
Let's say she's kidnapped
by Hyun Woo-yong.

181
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:57,945
Think about why he kidnapped her.

182
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:59,646
It's because of me! So I must go!

183
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,448
He wants you to go crazy
and run around like this!

184
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,449
So...

185
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:08,650
please calm down.

186
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,350
Han Sung-yong, Jeong
Sang-hyup and I are here.

187
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,952
Don't mess around
alone, let's go together.

188
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:24,654
I already told you.

189
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,655
He received a video
call and it was just...

190
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:29,655
Hello. Is it that hard to understand?

191
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:31,457
Darn it! The situation right now...

192
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:33,458
I didn't curse.

193
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:36,758
What did the police say?

194
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,659
The situation is unclear, so
they can't do anything now.

195
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,560
Darn it!

196
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,861
"Ji-hee: Woongbi Resort. Hurry."

197
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:48,762
I know this place. It's the
Woongbi construction site.

198
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:50,163
Let's go with my car.

199
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,664
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

200
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:07,768
Why? Did messing with those punks

201
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,469
hurt your pride?

202
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:18,272
I'm just curious.

203
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,072
What choice will Cha U-sol make?

204
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,674
-He didn't answer it?
-Yes.

205
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,178
Gosh, this place is huge.

206
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,880
Let's split up and look for her.

207
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:50,482
-Cha U-sol!
-U-sol!

208
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:53,182
Hey, it's dangerous to go alone.

209
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,183
-We'll split into two groups.
-You can come with me.

210
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:56,283
Let's contact each other if we found her.

211
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:57,885
-Okay.
-Be careful.

212
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:37,396
Won-jun, she's not here either.

213
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,497
Gosh. We can't just shout her name out.

214
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:41,799
Let's go down first.

215
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:05,405
I think we found it. It
should be this building.

216
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,306
Well, this place is...

217
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:08,807
How should I put it?

218
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,609
From where we come in and
go to the back of the building.

219
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,610
Go straight in, then turn
around to the back of the building.

220
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,110
After that, turn left...

221
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:23,411
-Gosh. What are you talking about?
-Wait!

222
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,811
U-sol, let's go together
when the others come.

223
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:27,412
Okay, I'll look for it.
Let's go, Sang-hyup.

224
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:28,614
Have they found her?

225
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:37,216
-Hey, wait the others come first!
-Wait a minute.

226
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:41,918
"U-sol."

227
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,820
Go away!

228
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,820
Do not come close!

229
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,321
Look at her temper.

230
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:01,723
Go away!

231
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:03,525
I said, go away!

232
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,126
Step aside.

233
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:13,028
-Darn it...
-Ji-hee!

234
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,929
Don't come here!

235
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,330
Don't!

236
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:44,037
I told you to wait.

237
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:46,639
Ji-hee, are you okay? Are you hurt?

238
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,040
Run away quickly!

239
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,541
You guys must leave here.

240
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:58,943
"Ji-hee."

241
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:10,746
Those punks are here.

242
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,649
Come on, move faster.

243
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,550
Look at those punks.

244
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:39,455
"U-sol."

245
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,757
The bait was a success.

246
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:04,162
Cha U-sol was caught, but of the
four of them, only two were caught.

247
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:05,764
I didn't see the other two.

248
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:09,564
What should I do?

249
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,365
Lee Won-jun.

250
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,865
Yun Ji-hee.

251
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,167
Cha U-sol.

252
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:22,469
Three is enough. Start shipping.

253
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,175
What's that?

254
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:46,177
Sang-hyup, get in the car.

255
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:51,377
U-sol.

256
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:53,178
U-sol, wake up!

257
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:54,979
U-sol...

258
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Won-jun, Ji-hee. Are you guys okay...

259
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:01,382
-You're noisy.
-U-sol...

260
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:03,929
Wake up!

261
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,048
You guys really...

262
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:08,573
-Darn it!
-U-sol!

263
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,896
-U-sol, wake up!
-U-sol!

264
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:15,368
-Please stop! U-sol!
-Stop!
