1
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,008
I like you!

2
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,605
Hey...

3
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,357
Yes?

4
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,860
You're a pest, an eyesore,
and I'm not interested.

5
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,198
He's right.

6
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,950
Of course, she is.

7
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,161
-Oh, Moe, you did it...
-How'd it go?

8
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,747
It didn't go well, did it?

9
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,082
Seems it did not.

10
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,709
Moe... Hey! Where are you going?!

11
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,388
You're in my way.

12
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,436
Do you know how much courage it took
for Moe to tell you how she felt?

13
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,232
And yet, you just went off on her.
You're unbelievable.

14
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,942
Only the most inhuman--

15
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,901
Who are you?

16
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,988
I'm Moe's best friend, Aoi Nishimori.

17
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,739
Moe?

18
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,450
The girl who just professed
her love to you!

19
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,871
She's actually serious about you!

20
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,124
What?

21
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:51,921
So you...

22
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,631
want me, too?

23
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,682
Not even in your dreams!

24
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,065
Oh, no!

25
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,236
It hurts...

26
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,781
My foot hurts.

27
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,908
Sorry.

28
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,075
The signal's turning red.

29
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,911
What?! Hold on.

30
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,246
Wait...

31
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,917
I made it.

32
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,836
Go left here.

33
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,216
Gosh...

34
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:40,720
Okay, okay...

35
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,056
<i>-Shusei Kugayama?</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

36
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,143
There he is!

37
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,686
On the left? Right?

38
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,772
The right, of course!

39
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,486
He's so cute!

40
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,321
Is he that popular?

41
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,075
Where have you been?
He's not just a handsome face.

42
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,452
He's a top student
and a talented athlete, too!

43
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,957
He's just so cool!

44
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,214
Go up here.

45
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,633
What? Wait a minute.

46
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:19,968
Ouch!

47
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,177
Try walking on your own--

48
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,220
No way.

49
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:29,936
Climb on.

50
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,272
Here we go.

51
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:37,360
You know, if it hurts that much,
maybe you should see a doctor--

52
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,278
Nope.

53
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,279
Why not?

54
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,196
I hate doctors.

55
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,282
That's not a reason not to go...

56
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,165
Hey, can't you do it right?

57
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,711
Sorry.

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,254
Okay.

59
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,975
Over there.

60
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,313
What?!

61
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,605
-Huh?
-Hey!

62
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,524
Don't just drop me here.

63
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,320
What?

64
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,238
Why here?

65
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,490
This is where I live.

66
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,951
What? This is where<i> I</i> live!

67
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:27,952
What?

68
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:28,995
Are you serious?

69
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:30,747
What room number?

70
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,081
Room 202.

71
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,000
Right next to me? Since when?

72
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,126
Since a week ago.

73
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,215
You're kidding me...

74
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,788
How did I end up having to do this, too?

75
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,758
Ow! What are you doing?

76
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,176
That's your...

77
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,178
Oh. You want to look at them?

78
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,557
No, I do not.

79
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,475
Dinner ready yet?

80
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,935
I'm still cleaning.

81
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,146
-Besides, you didn't mention dinner--
-Oh, it hurts so much...

82
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,731
I'm starving.

83
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,694
What a pest!

84
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,865
ROOM 203 NISHIMORI

85
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,666
ROOM 202 KUGAYAMA

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,461
Wow. I'm surprised you know how to cook.

87
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,131
I've been living alone for a year now.

88
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,133
Why are you living alone?

89
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,845
My dad transferred to China
for work last year.

90
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,848
My younger brother
and my mom went with him,

91
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,683
but I have entrance exams.

92
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,519
Our high school is affiliated
with a university. Just move on to there.

93
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,982
Wait, maybe you can't
because you're stupid?

94
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,568
That is not the reason.

95
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,448
To be honest, I wanted to stay in Japan.

96
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:31,951
Because...?

97
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,539
I didn't want to change schools,
and go abroad on top of that.

98
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,208
Plus, I didn't want to leave Moe behind.

99
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,460
Moe?

100
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,548
-The girl who said she liked you!
-Oh.

101
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,050
You know, Moe's a really nice girl.

102
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,803
She may not look it,
but she's got a deep personality.

103
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,599
Back in junior high, she stood by me
even when my other friends didn't.

104
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,350
She was always there for me.

105
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,102
Oh, that looks good.

106
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,437
Don't scare me like...

107
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,441
Put some clothes on!

108
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,554
Whoa...

109
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,057
My goodness, what happened here?

110
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,725
Ah, it's cold!

111
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,811
You guys made a real mess of this place.

112
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,608
Well, I've called someone
to handle repairs,

113
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,528
and the insurance will cover it.
No worries.

114
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,738
I am so sorry!

115
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,158
Um, how long will the renovations take?

116
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,245
They said they're currently busy
with other orders they've received,

117
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,539
so it could take up to a month.

118
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,541
What? That long?!

119
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,876
What'll you do until then, Shusei?

120
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,506
None of the other rooms are available.

121
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,384
I guess I can have you
stay with me, but...

122
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,554
That's okay.
I'll stay at a friend's place.

123
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,764
-Really?
-Yes.

124
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,682
Right?

125
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,559
Huh?

126
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,310
"A friend's place"?

127
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,232
Your room.

128
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,404
What?!

129
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,490
Are you serious?!

130
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,006
UNDER RENOVATION
VISITORS PLEASE GO NEXT DOOR

131
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:04,979
Come--

132
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,108
How did it come down to this?

133
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,085
Hey, are you really planning to stay...

134
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,550
Ah... that hurt!

135
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,139
Did you see anything?

136
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,932
I'm gonna take a bath.

137
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,018
Red polka dots.

138
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,071
What should I do?

139
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,614
I've never dated anyone before,

140
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,408
and now I'm living with a guy
I don't even like.

141
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,963
Are you a nudist or something?!
Put some clothes on!

142
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,340
It's fine. I live here.

143
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,967
It is not fine. I'm a girl, and...

144
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,261
Oh, I see. You have dirty thoughts.
You pervert.

145
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,848
No! If we're going to live together,
we need to establish some rules.

146
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,476
You can't just walk out here
looking like that.

147
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,144
-This is good.
-Think first and--

148
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,689
This is really good.

149
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,616
Really?

150
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,671
Nishimori.

151
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,551
Is my class boring you that much?

152
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,886
No! Not at all.

153
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,638
Not at all. I'm sorry.

154
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,682
To continue,

155
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,728
-What are you doing?
-...let's talk about the Renaissance.

156
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,691
In French, the word means "rebirth."

157
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,359
"Rebirth."

158
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,365
So doesn't that make you wonder
what was reborn?

159
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,075
Right? What do you think?

160
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,076
What?!

161
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,081
What happened to your injury?!

162
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,253
He's completely fine!
I was tricked!

163
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,297
Nishimori?

164
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,923
Tricked by what?

165
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,883
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,093
What's with your lunch?!

167
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,846
That's not like you. Did something happen?

168
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,979
Why'd you move my bed?!

169
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,689
There wasn't enough space for me.

170
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,024
Enough space for you?!

171
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,319
Give me back...

172
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,946
my spot!

173
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,493
He just does whatever he wants...

174
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:17,922
Okay.

175
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,010
Oh, no!

176
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,887
Darn it!

177
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,851
Today's recycling day!

178
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,938
You're gonna be late!

179
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,731
I'm skipping first period.

180
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,274
Oh, no!

181
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,026
You shouldn't let the trash pile up.

182
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,789
Well, I've had a few eventful days.

183
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,501
Living alone does seem
to have its difficulties.

184
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,468
-Hey, Moe.
-Yeah?

185
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,306
You know that guy, Kugayama...

186
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,351
I think I've fallen even harder for him!

187
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,229
What? Why?
Even after he said those awful things?

188
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,648
He's just a prince
with a hot-cold personality.

189
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,733
All the more reason I like him.

190
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,069
I... see...

191
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,613
Hey! Did you hear the bad news?

192
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,949
Manami in class two
might get kicked out of school.

193
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,909
-Kicked out?!
-Why?

194
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,203
The school found out
she was living with her boyfriend.

195
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,997
Well, that was stupid of her!

196
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,498
She should've hid it better.

197
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,126
You can get kicked out just for that?

198
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,503
It's bad for the school
if the parents found out.

199
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,131
Our school is surprisingly strict
on stuff like that.

200
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,132
I see.

201
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,593
Reina! We have to be careful, too.

202
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,594
That's right, Hama.

203
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,846
You two don't live together!

204
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,805
Oh, no...

205
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,557
Share your happiness with me, you jerk!

206
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,683
I'd never share with you!

207
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,436
I bought this yesterday,
but I've no clue how to use it...

208
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,438
Moe, look! It's Shusei!

209
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,857
No way. I should say hi to him!

210
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,817
But you were rejected just yesterday...

211
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,068
The real struggle begins now.

212
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,653
That's what it means?

213
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,654
Yes!

214
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,697
He's coming this way!

215
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,615
What do I do?

216
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,451
Go for it!

217
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,704
Hey...

218
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,706
-Yes?
-I'm talking to her.

219
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,707
Huh?

220
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,045
Me?

221
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,380
Your key.

222
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,675
Hey! Stop it!

223
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,888
I forgot my key.

224
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,849
Will you knock it off?!

225
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,855
If the school finds out we live together,
we could be kicked out.

226
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,649
We live together?

227
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,527
Simply put, yes. It looks like that.
So if we get busted for it--

228
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,570
Do you need it or not?

229
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,863
Give it back.

230
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,200
Hey... I said give it back!

231
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,581
Where's my "Thanks"?

232
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,501
Hey, get away from me.

233
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,547
It's bad if we get busted, right?

234
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,759
Thank you.

235
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,594
I can't hear you.

236
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,514
Thank you!

237
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,350
So you <i>can</i> say it.

238
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,730
Oh, yeah! What's with your leg?!

239
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,691
Since when did it heal?!

240
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,609
I dunno.

241
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,445
You're unbelievable!

242
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,864
Shusei!

243
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,285
Shusei!

244
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,788
-Hi, honey.
-Are you my girlfriend?

245
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,540
Oh, you must be in a good mood.

246
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,251
You came back at me with a perfect
straight-man response.

247
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,252
Not really.

248
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,463
No, something good happened, didn't it?!

249
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,425
Last night's dinner was good.
That's about it.

250
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,928
Really? Where at? Saizeriya?
You know, that place is...

251
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,680
Hey, Aoi, what was that?

252
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,723
Are you and Shusei--

253
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,101
My key! I dropped my key.
He was just returning it.

254
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,394
Isn't he so kind?

255
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,603
Right?

256
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,563
That's great.

257
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,441
Wow, he's so amazing!

258
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,068
YAMATE APARTMENTS

259
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,820
NO WALKING AROUND NUDE!

260
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,530
NO STEALING FOOD!

261
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,740
KNOCK WHEN ENTERING BATHROOM!

262
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,866
NO USING OTHERS' TOWELS!

263
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,332
I wish I didn't have to lie to Moe...

264
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,793
Okay.

265
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,882
All done!

266
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,342
I've got my own space again!

267
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,970
Man, I'm hungry.

268
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,431
Now, to put him straight.

269
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,850
So, this is your new place?

270
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,101
What?

271
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,269
What's he doing?!

272
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,645
What should I do?

273
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,022
It's so old.

274
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,690
There's dust everywhere.

275
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,276
Is it open?

276
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,363
This place is nice!

277
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,491
It's comfortable enough for one person.

278
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,492
What the...

279
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,993
Hey, what is this?!

280
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,662
This is a girl's!

281
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,626
-Oh, that belongs to the girl next door.
-Huh?

282
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,087
Sometimes her laundry flies over
off her clothesline.

283
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,254
From next door?!

284
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,467
Like her red polka dot underwear.

285
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,512
The neighbor girl's?
What's she like?

286
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:18,972
Ordinary.

287
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,307
Does she go to our school?

288
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,768
-Yeah.
-Who?

289
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,108
What was her name again?

290
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,071
Did you hear something strange just now?

291
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,572
No.

292
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,824
Really?

293
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,909
But it must be nice here.

294
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,537
What's it like living next to her?

295
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,538
It's whatever.

296
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,623
"Whatever"? So nothing's happened?

297
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,251
Like she doesn't come over
asking to borrow soy sauce?

298
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,962
Or ask you to come over
to switch out a light bulb?

299
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,631
Or come over to give you a message?
Nothing like that?

300
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,424
Nope.

301
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,518
Hey, stop it!

302
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,561
Huh?

303
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,812
What?

304
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,856
Didn't you just hear a girl's voice?

305
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,567
Next door. The walls are pretty thin.

306
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,486
Seriously? So, can you
hear her taking a bath?

307
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,404
I dunno.

308
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,822
Hello?

309
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,370
What?

310
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,455
What are you doing?!

311
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,498
Ouch...

312
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,624
What's wrong?

313
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,502
Who's she?

314
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,297
She came from next door
to get her laundry.

315
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,428
I'm Aoi Nishimori.
I'm a third-year from class three.

316
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,346
Ryosuke Sato, class one.

317
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,348
I went to junior high with Shusei, too.

318
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,642
I'm not sure if I'm a good friend
or a bad influence.

319
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,603
He's giving me a house-warming party.

320
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,062
Yeah, you should come too.

321
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,564
Oh, that's okay. I--

322
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,899
Yeah, she can't. Bye.

323
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,941
Maybe next time then.

324
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,153
Sure.

325
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,780
I'll be on my way now.

326
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,490
Wait.

327
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,161
You forgot this.

328
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,915
Thank you.

329
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,925
I'm so fed up!
That was my room in the first place!

330
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,011
Ooh, a sale!

331
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,266
Welcome!

332
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,226
Hello!

333
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,856
Wow, they've got some good deals today.

334
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,654
Oh, olive oil.

335
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,450
Would you like to try our new products?

336
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,411
Oh, Sanjo!

337
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,829
Welcome to the store, Aoi.

338
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,833
We just got this olive oil in today.

339
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,918
Wow.

340
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,294
-Would you like a taste?
-Yes!

341
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,675
That's delicious!

342
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,135
Oh! Seems like this will be a hit.

343
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,679
-Huh?
-Huh?

344
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,765
If it puts a smile on your face,
then it'll definitely sell well.

345
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,476
-Really?
-No doubt about it.

346
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,105
By the way, you know that marinade
that the landlady made...

347
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,862
You're wearing such thin clothes.

348
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,115
No, I didn't mean to--

349
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,199
Do you have an umbrella?

350
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,617
No, but I'll be okay.

351
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,702
Hold on.

352
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,539
I'm sorry for the trouble.

353
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,043
Who is that girl?

354
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,838
I think she lives
in the same apartment building.

355
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,464
What? Really?

356
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,237
I'm coming in.

357
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,873
Hey.

358
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:17,294
From now on, no inviting friends over.
That goes for both of us.

359
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,378
Why?

360
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,088
I told you.

361
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,507
If we're busted,
then we might be kicked out of school.

362
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,301
What's with the sweater?

363
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,472
Sanjo let me borrow it.

364
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,774
You've got a fever.

365
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,777
Do I?

366
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,489
Hey, you're standing too close.

367
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,578
You've never been around a man, have you?

368
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,789
Why are you asking me that now?

369
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,290
You haven't gone on a date either?

370
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,209
That's none of your business!

371
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,878
Why are you looking at me like that?

372
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,464
I don't need your pity.

373
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,844
And I don't need a man
when I've got plenty of friends. I--

374
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,137
Good luck!

375
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,977
Wait.

376
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,523
You hide over there!

377
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,863
Hi, Sanjo!

378
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,074
Here's the marinade recipe
you wanted.

379
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,575
Thank you so much!

380
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,703
Your drawings are so cute.

381
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,248
These would be good enough
to be in a cookbook!

382
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,624
No way.

383
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,420
Do you have a guest over?

384
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,004
No, of course not.

385
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,464
Oh, it's next door!

386
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,299
I often hear voices next door.

387
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,095
Oh, you mean the high school boy?

388
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,721
I think so.

389
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,599
You should be careful, Aoi.

390
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,769
Sometimes you forget you're a girl.

391
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,521
Yeah.

392
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,399
I'll return your umbrella
and your sweater once they've dried.

393
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,358
Don't worry about it.

394
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,901
No, please let me do that much.

395
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,236
You really saved me.

396
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,737
-Really?
-Yes.

397
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,114
Alright. Goodnight.

398
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,365
Have a good night.

399
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,793
How cute.

400
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,420
"Thank you so much!"

401
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,630
I didn't say it like that.

402
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,799
Does he live here?

403
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,636
Sanjo lives on the floor below us.
He goes to Keio University.

404
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,596
I'm going to work.

405
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,513
Work?

406
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,182
See ya.

407
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,766
Ouch!

408
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,852
What was that for?!

409
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,123
Good morning!

410
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,167
Morning, Aoi!

411
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,256
So how is it, living with a hunk?

412
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,176
I can't take it anymore.

413
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,387
It's rough being young, isn't it?

414
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,514
Huh?

415
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,974
Make sure you use contraception!

416
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,644
Oh, my God! Landlady!

417
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:26,066
Shusei isn't your average man.

418
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,234
He's solid.

419
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,861
He works a part-time job
to pay his own rent.

420
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,366
"I decided to leave home on my own.
Of course, I have to pay it myself."

421
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:35,992
That's what he said.

422
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,247
Mom!

423
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,251
I changed my shoes, Mom.

424
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,670
Oh! Well done.

425
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,838
Good morning, Kota.

426
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,300
Good morning, Aoi.
You're coming to the barbecue, right?

427
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,718
What barbecue?

428
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,136
Next Sunday.

429
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,389
We're having a welcome party for Shusei.

430
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,516
You're coming too, right, Shusei?

431
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,517
Yup.

432
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,485
Oh!

433
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,743
Moe, it's not what you think!

434
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,370
This isn't how it looks!

435
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,456
Moe, I swear this isn't how it looks...

436
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,500
Okay.

437
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,211
Are you okay?

438
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,462
No, I'm not...

439
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,090
Well, just do your best.

440
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,842
Alright.

441
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,260
Can I put this here?

442
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,554
Oh, actually can you put it over there?

443
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,557
That looks heavy.

444
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,643
What are you making for us today?

445
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,314
Some paella, spare ribs, and stew.

446
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,066
I knew we could count on you, Sanjo!

447
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,819
Won't you come be my bride?

448
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,029
Your bride?

449
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,947
-Yes.
-Can I be your bride?

450
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:56,948
Huh?

451
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,076
Who said that?

452
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,870
Me! I'm over here!

453
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,122
Oh, it's just you?

454
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,292
Hurry up and get to work! Open that.

455
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,209
What?!

456
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,006
Don't just sit there. Get the fire going.

457
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,382
Quickly!

458
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,679
I was so surprised
about Shusei being your neighbor!

459
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,556
It's such a coincidence, isn't it?

460
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,393
And that he goes to your place to brush
his teeth because his sink's broken.

461
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,103
-Amazing, right?
-Right!

462
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,481
Throw it!

463
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,859
I'm glad Shusei can smile
like a normal guy.

464
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,987
Catch, Shusei!

465
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,244
At any rate,

466
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,081
why do you have so many
good-looking guys at your apartment?

467
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,334
You've got Shusei and Sanjo, too.

468
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,044
Sanjo?

469
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,464
Sweet, handsome, mature,
and a fantastic cook.

470
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,465
He's perfect,

471
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,343
though I still prefer my hot-cold prince.

472
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,057
-Moe.
-Huh?

473
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,974
Well...

474
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,939
What is it?

475
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,651
You should join them.

476
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,985
-What?
-Yeah.

477
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,531
Kota, Moe said she wants to play, too.

478
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,324
-Is that okay?
-Yup.

479
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,410
Go on, Moe. Join them!

480
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,286
O-Okay!

481
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,335
Can I throw the ball with you guys?

482
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,253
Sure.

483
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:35,880
Here I go!

484
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,840
Okay!

485
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,760
It's behind you.

486
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,390
That's too close, Kota.

487
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,433
Shusei!

488
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,269
Shusei!

489
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,605
I missed you!

490
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:58,278
Mom! There's a man hugging another man!

491
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,488
This is my older brother.

492
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,449
-What?
-Huh?

493
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,367
Hello!

494
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,162
-Welcome!
-Oh, Kazumi!

495
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,164
Here, I brought this.

496
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,081
Really?

497
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,084
Soju! It's been a while.

498
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,296
Oh, Ryosuke! You look well. Hey!

499
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,590
Shu!

500
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,217
"Shu"?

501
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,478
It's so good to see you, Shu.

502
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,979
Why are you here, Satsuki?

503
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:37,192
I thought you'd be missing me
right about now.

504
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,485
Who is she?

505
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,613
This is Satsuki,
a childhood friend of ours.

506
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,281
A "childhood friend"?

507
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,408
It means we lived
in the same neighborhood as kids.

508
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,411
I guess she's like family,
or someone who's always with us.

509
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,496
Oh?

510
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,582
Were we just childhood friends?

511
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,125
More like just an ex-girlfriend.

512
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,585
-Shall we eat?
-Yeah!

513
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,669
-Let's go!
-Okay!

514
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,463
Come on.

515
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,512
So, there are girls at Shu's apartment?

516
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,181
I'm Aoi Nishimori.
I live next door to him.

517
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,475
And I'm Aoi's friend, Moe Shibuya.

518
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,518
Hello.

519
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,686
Let's go, Shu.

520
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,152
Thanks.

521
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,323
Shall we?

522
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,243
I've got a bad feeling about her.

523
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,869
A real bad feeling.

524
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,582
-Wow!
-Wow!

525
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,667
Amazing.

526
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,293
That looks yummy!

527
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,336
Eat it while it's hot.

528
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,088
-Alright!
-Thanks!

529
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,631
-Let's eat.
-Looks good!

530
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,341
Please help yourself.

531
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,885
Hey, Moe. Can you get me some of that?

532
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,970
Delicious!

533
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,304
-Is it good?
-Moe!

534
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,265
Glad you like it!

535
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,060
Woo-hoo! Boat time!

536
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:58,898
Here.

537
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,816
Thanks.

538
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,117
He must be popular at school.

539
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,160
-Huh?
-Huh?

540
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,954
Shusei.

541
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,332
Oh. Yeah, it seems so.

542
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,459
"Seems"? You're not interested?

543
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,796
Yup. Not interested
in that heartless prick.

544
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,506
Really?

545
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,551
Then we're the same.

546
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,053
I'm not interested in you, either.

547
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,180
Don't eavesdrop!

548
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,098
I want to eat that.

549
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,141
Get it yourself.

550
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,142
My hand hurts.

551
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,685
That lie again?

552
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,645
You two get along well.

553
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,730
-No way!
-No way.

554
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,901
You match too well.

555
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,320
It doesn't seem
like you're just neighbors.

556
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,030
I'm a little jealous.

557
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,782
Then why don't you take her home?

558
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,825
Huh?

559
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,118
Wait a minute.

560
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,120
What are you talking about?!

561
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,543
This is tasty.

562
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,758
I'm sorry about that.

563
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,470
-He's just weird like that.
-Don't worry about it.

564
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,560
Okay, here we go!

565
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,314
-Ready? Rock, paper, scissors!
-Ready? Rock, paper, scissors!

566
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,359
-No!
-Yes!

567
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,278
Why do I have to carry this
both to and from here?!

568
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,905
I'll take the yogurt!

569
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,239
Then I'll take strawberry milk.

570
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,241
I'll take strawberry milk, too!

571
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,618
Why are you copying me?

572
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,995
I'm not! I just want to drink this, too!

573
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,413
Here.

574
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,042
Shu.

575
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,502
Yeah?

576
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,798
You remember your promise, right?

577
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,384
How could I forget?

578
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,178
That's good.

579
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,145
You'll catch a cold wearing that.

580
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,272
It'll just aggravate it.

581
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,360
I can handle this much.

582
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,030
I've been doing well recently.
I don't really catch colds either.

583
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,534
I need the bathroom.

584
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,092
Hey.

585
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,099
Don't play games with Aoi, alright?

586
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:39,976
What?

587
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,520
For the last year,

588
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,857
I've been watching over Aoi
like an older brother.

589
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,447
If you do anything to hurt her,

590
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,949
I won't forgive you.

591
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,119
An older brother?

592
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,620
Huh?

593
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,706
That's cool.

594
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,585
He's overreacting.

595
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,295
It's not that cold out.

596
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,134
They've both always
been protective of me.

597
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,177
Is that so?

598
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,723
Your name's Aoi, right?

599
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,600
Yes.

600
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,437
Shu won't commit to anyone.

601
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,730
Huh?

602
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,815
Don't waste your love on him.

603
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,361
I don't have any feelings for him...

604
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:40,078
YAMATE APARTMENTS

605
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,613
What's wrong? It's just a little thunder.

606
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,533
Y-Yeah, I guess you're right.

607
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,628
It's nothing to be scared of.

608
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,006
Of course.

609
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,633
I'm fine.

610
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,114
Morning!

611
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,199
Good morning!

612
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,159
That was some thunder last night!

613
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,703
It sure was! I was so scared.

614
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,289
But at least Shusei was there with you.

615
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,043
What? No, it wasn't like that...

616
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,419
Oh, yeah.

617
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,505
Do you want to go to an amusement park?

618
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:01,093
I got two tickets from my friend,
but they expire this month.

619
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,554
I'm too busy to go.

620
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,806
Then I'll go with Moe--

621
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,851
-We'll go.
-Huh?

622
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:09,852
Thanks for the tickets.

623
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,395
See you after school.

624
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,941
What? Wait, what just happened?

625
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,192
Wait a minute!

626
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,485
Give that back!

627
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,948
Three, two, one!

628
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,534
Ta-da!

629
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,162
He's late.

630
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,665
That roller coaster was so fun!

631
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,833
It's been a while
since I've been to a theme park.

632
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,752
Where should we go next?

633
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,513
Wait, this isn't a date...

634
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,223
Ow! Huh?

635
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,766
Hey, wait!

636
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,104
Oh, that's right. I'll practice with you.

637
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,021
What?

638
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,357
Dating.

639
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,651
Never done it, right?

640
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,488
Wh--

641
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,656
What are you doing?

642
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,952
I think I like it when you're embarrassed.

643
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,056
What?

644
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,436
-That suits you perfectly.
-Shut up.

645
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,026
Oh, what?

646
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,235
You suck at this.

647
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,530
-One more time.
-I'm way better than you.

648
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,700
I did it!

649
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,410
Yes!

650
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,454
Alright!

651
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,956
Wow! That was awesome!

652
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,585
I did it! It went in!

653
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,878
Yay!

654
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,423
Hey, let's ride the roller coaster!

655
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:03,883
No, thanks.

656
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,511
Let's ride that instead.

657
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,929
Oh?

658
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,307
Are you scared?

659
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,143
I just don't like to hear
a bunch of girls screaming.

660
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,855
-You <i>are</i> scared!
-No, I'm not!

661
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,149
How is it? You nervous?

662
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,942
No.

663
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,944
Really? You're definitely scared.

664
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,584
I'm beat.

665
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,920
Look at your hair!

666
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,004
Shut it.

667
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,381
Wanna ride it again?

668
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,632
No!

669
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,095
Hey, do you know about this?

670
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,555
The Tanabata Fireworks Festival.

671
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,350
"Seven hearts filled with wishes."

672
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,351
What is this?

673
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,522
At the end of the fireworks display,
seven heart-shaped fireworks go off.

674
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:04,360
If couples kiss during that time,
they'll be together forever.

675
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,904
You believe that?

676
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,825
It's not a bad thing to dream.

677
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,369
Dream?

678
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,541
I shouldn't have told you.

679
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,709
Why don't you give it a try?

680
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,671
Someday, I will.

681
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,840
"Someday" is next month.

682
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,885
This year, I don't have anyone...

683
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,471
Then you wanna go with me?

684
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,474
-Huh?
-If you can't find someone first.

685
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,143
Why you?

686
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,185
It'll be fun.

687
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,983
Hey, I'm being serious, you know!

688
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,778
It's not a joke.

689
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,536
If I went with him...

690
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,255
Huh? Where did he go?

691
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,049
They're gone.

692
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,926
Do you think that was Shusei's girlfriend?

693
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,136
They were holding hands!

694
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,013
Who was it? A third-year?

695
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:14,972
Let's go see.

696
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,933
There she is! That's her!

697
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,982
-She's running!
-Seriously? It must be her!

698
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,485
She turned the corner!

699
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,364
Where is she?

700
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,365
Huh?

701
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,909
W-What are you doing--

702
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,826
Shh!

703
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,037
Where is she?

704
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,414
Where did she go?

705
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,333
I wanted to see who she was.

706
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,084
She has to be his girlfriend.

707
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,085
They held hands.

708
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,128
What do we do?

709
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,172
That's awful.

710
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,216
I know, right? The worst...

711
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,185
Sorry about that.

712
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,651
But... I wanted to go out with you.

713
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,645
You're so tense.
Save it for the right guy.

714
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,233
What was that?

715
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,672
YAMATE APARTMENTS

716
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,037
FIREWORKS AT 7:30 P.M.

717
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,419
Oh, morning!

718
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,879
Hey, Aoi!

719
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,255
Are you waiting for someone?

720
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,299
Really? Did you get boyfriend?

721
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,926
Of course not! Just go to class!

722
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,762
You're being suspicious!
Which class is he in?

723
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,181
Totally suspicious!

724
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,475
Morning, Aoi.

725
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,268
Morning.

726
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,811
Listen,

727
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,355
Moe...

728
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,397
Yeah?

729
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:12,816
You have a boyfriend?

730
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,734
Huh?

731
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,778
No...

732
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,115
So, you're going out with Shusei?

733
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,242
No! We just live together.

734
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,746
He doesn't even think of me as a girl.

735
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,705
How do you feel?

736
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,335
At first, I kind of hated him.

737
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,422
But now you... like him?

738
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:37,841
Kind of...

739
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,386
Even though I like him?

740
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,388
I'm so sorry.

741
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,226
This pisses me off.

742
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,979
We promised each other
back in junior high,

743
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,607
that if we liked someone,
we would tell each other first!

744
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,526
-I know.
-I've always done that.

745
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:56,819
I'm sorry.

746
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,535
You better tell me everything from now on.

747
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:06,829
Huh?

748
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,582
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
It's Shusei, remember?

749
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,711
You can't possibly do this alone
with no experience in love.

750
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,587
But Moe, you...

751
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:19,133
I thought it'd be nice
to be his girlfriend,

752
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,302
but since it hasn't happened by now,
I don't think it ever will.

753
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:27,015
Besides, I told him how I felt
just for the sake of doing it.

754
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,935
It's about time that I moved on.

755
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,813
Really?

756
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,610
Have I ever lied to you?

757
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,994
Moe!

758
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,579
-What?
-I love you!

759
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,622
I know that, sheesh.

760
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,958
Hey! Moe, wait!

761
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,251
Hey!

762
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,212
Oh, no! You're so fast!

763
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:03,177
STAR JEWELRY CO.

764
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,219
Oh!

765
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,223
It's so cute!

766
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:13,771
Buy it.

767
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,315
No way. I don't have that kind of money.

768
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,067
I see.

769
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,287
Do you really need this?

770
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,205
Huh?

771
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,916
Five kilos of rice.

772
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,002
We're going to eat it!

773
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:41,131
Besides, if we don't finish it,
we can just stick it in the fridge.

774
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,383
Eating five kilos of rice
will fatten you up.

775
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,302
I'm not eating it all by myself.

776
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,179
Though I ate three kilos alone--

777
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,222
Satsuki.

778
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,395
Is it true you're living with her?

779
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,396
Yeah.

780
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,024
Until repairs are done.
It can't be helped.

781
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,609
You could've come to my place.

782
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,568
It's too far.

783
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,780
Besides, we just live together
for convenience.

784
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,949
What's that supposed to mean?

785
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,700
My hand's gonna fall off holding this.

786
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,661
Wait, Shu!

787
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,880
You must be happy with this.

788
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,385
Living with a guy in your class.

789
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,764
That's just how things worked out--

790
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,890
I told you, didn't I?

791
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,268
Not to waste your love on him.

792
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,440
Well,

793
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,318
you guys broke up, didn't you?

794
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:53,328
Shu hasn't told you...
what happened two years ago, has he?

795
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,331
No, he hasn't.

796
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,174
He and I have an unbreakable bond.

797
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:13,181
I'm the only one who can make Shu happy.

798
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,774
Maybe you should try to pick up on that.

799
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,758
Satsuki went home.

800
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,427
I see.

801
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:04,650
Hey...

802
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,694
What?

803
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,741
Never mind. It's nothing.

804
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,806
What's up with that?!

805
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,059
S-Shibuya!

806
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,688
Do you have a complaint about my class?

807
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,731
Uh, no. Not at all.

808
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,652
-What?
-What was that?

809
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:49,569
Nothing.

810
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,696
What is it?

811
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,114
-Be quiet!
-To continue,

812
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,617
From the end of the 15th century
until the mid-16th century,

813
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,371
I DON'T BELIEVE IT! I'M SO MAD!
WHAT'S WITH THAT EX-GIRLFRIEND?

814
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,541
Italy was intermittently embroiled
in war for 50 years...

815
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,875
THERE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES...

816
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,336
What kind of circumstances?!

817
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,884
S-Shibuya!

818
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,469
I'm sorry.

819
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,430
Yeah, I'll go. Aoi, you're coming, right?

820
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,848
I'll pass today.

821
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,766
No, sorry.

822
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,684
-See ya.
-Bye!

823
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,643
Later!

824
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,155
Aoi!

825
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,782
Hello.

826
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,997
Where's Shusei?

827
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,583
I don't really know...

828
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,418
But you live together, don't you?

829
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,837
What? No! I mean...

830
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,882
I heard from Satsuki.
She can barely contain herself.

831
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,475
Can I ask...

832
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,936
what kind of relationship
does Satsuki and Shusei have?

833
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,150
Do you like Shusei?

834
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,486
Uh... no! Not at all!

835
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,197
You're easy to read.

836
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,869
My dad always had
a lover on the side,

837
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,498
and my mom tolerated it by not having
any interest in our family.

838
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,209
You could say it was a loveless household.

839
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,293
That was our family.

840
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,506
Satsuki knew about all of that
since we were kids.

841
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,133
So, when Shusei started
getting into trouble,

842
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,220
and my family basically gave up on him,

843
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,389
Satsuki would make sure
he made it to school.

844
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,893
She'd bring him home too,
from even the sketchiest places.

845
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,395
Really?

846
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:49,689
Well,

847
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:54,027
that's a pretty standard
childhood-friend story.

848
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,532
Do you want to hear more?

849
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,534
Yes.

850
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,203
It'll cost you.

851
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,538
Huh?

852
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,624
How will you pay me?

853
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,502
-Um...
-I know.

854
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,298
What are you doing?!

855
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,844
Oh, was that your first kiss?

856
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,680
Seriously?

857
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,474
Well then, why don't we just go out?

858
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,018
Don't mess with me!

859
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,280
Very nice!

860
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,073
-As adorable as ever.
-Really?

861
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,409
-Last three shots. Let's get a close-up.
-Okay.

862
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,077
Here we go. Yes!

863
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,453
Very cute!

864
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,289
Okay, that's perfect!

865
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,373
-Yay!
-Nice shot.

866
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,374
-It's good, right?
-Yup.

867
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,333
Good job.

868
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,710
Everything's okay!

869
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,337
Did you make me look good?

870
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,298
Of course. These are the best shots yet.

871
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,340
Please change costume.

872
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,342
-Okay!
-Thank you!

873
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,052
Oh, Shusei!

874
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,013
How was school?

875
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,806
What did you want?

876
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,643
You could at least
make some small talk first.

877
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,980
Here. This is from Mom.

878
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,399
I don't need it.

879
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,069
Working part-time isn't enough.
Just take it.

880
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:21,865
Take it back.

881
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,620
You can never have enough
money or women.

882
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,246
Then you keep it.

883
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,666
I'd gladly keep Aoi instead.

884
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,089
Why are you bringing her up?

885
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,887
That girl seems a lot like Satsuki.

886
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:45,597
How?

887
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,268
She's clumsy, but honest.
The straight-forward type.

888
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,230
Why are you making that face?

889
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,023
Well,

890
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,567
she's quite a tough one.

891
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,110
Huh?

892
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,946
I kissed her.

893
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,990
But I think it was her first
because she cried--

894
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,167
I haven't seen you angry in a while.

895
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,126
-Bastard!
-Stop!

896
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,503
What are you doing?!

897
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,217
Nothing!

898
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,718
Prepare for the shoot.

899
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,901
What are you doing?

900
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,575
Looking at the sky.

901
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,453
You're crying.

902
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,164
No, I'm not.

903
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,749
You are.

904
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,794
I said, I'm not!

905
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,809
You look awful.

906
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,728
Why are you taking a picture?

907
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,315
Don't just let anyone kiss you.

908
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,860
I told you to save it
for the right guy.

909
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,154
You're an idiot.

910
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,457
Sorry...

911
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,184
You've been reset.

912
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,686
-What--
-It's fine now.

913
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,604
Just keep quiet.

914
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,022
-But--
-With my kiss,

915
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,192
his kiss is canceled out.
I've decided it.

916
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,171
What?

917
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,716
-Off you go.
-Huh?

918
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,051
Wait!

919
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,594
Wait a minute!

920
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,939
That's pretty scary.

921
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,525
I thought I was gonna die!

922
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,988
You're laughing too much!

923
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,537
Maybe I just want to laugh with you.

924
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:07,924
<i>Me, too.</i>

925
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,219
<i>I want to laugh...</i>

926
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,847
<i>with him.</i>

927
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,727
Um...

928
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,522
Cut about this much.

929
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,274
Okay.

930
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,443
Actually, cut it this much.

931
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,407
Welcome back.

932
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,492
Thanks.

933
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:37,620
<i>But...</i>

934
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,081
<i>somehow...</i>

935
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,250
<i>when we're together...</i>

936
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,212
It's good.

937
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,214
What is?

938
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,012
I think I like it.

939
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,097
Hey...

940
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,100
Your cooking.

941
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:00,977
Gosh.

942
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,770
<i>...it's always me...</i>

943
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,732
<i>whose feelings get all mixed up.</i>

944
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,776
Thanks for waiting.

945
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,118
Welcome.

946
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,837
Hey, Kugayama!

947
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,088
Break time.

948
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,423
Okay.

949
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:45,104
It's so pretty!

950
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,150
Oh, that's a very cute lunch
you've got there.

951
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,902
Are you a married man?

952
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,280
That must be great
having a wife who can cook!

953
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,990
-Let me have a bite.
-No way.

954
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,201
-Me, too!
-No!

955
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,411
Hey!

956
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,289
That's my toothpaste!

957
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,292
Sheesh.

958
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,088
<i>The next thing you know...</i>

959
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,175
Here.

960
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,636
What's this?

961
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:17,762
It's nice, huh?

962
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,100
<i>...you're wanting more and more.</i>

963
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,852
You've got some guts to cut it that short!

964
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,438
You must have a boyfriend, Aoi.

965
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,274
No, I don't.

966
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,109
I told you, that's not it!

967
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,277
You're different somehow.

968
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,530
Yeah, you must be
to have cut your hair so short.

969
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,951
He's so cool!

970
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,750
X equals 6, Y is 6 minus twice root 6.

971
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:51,337
The maximum is 6 minus twice root 2,
minimum is 1. Got it?

972
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:53,881
Stupid.

973
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,301
If you want me to teach you, then listen.

974
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,928
You could be a little nicer, you know!

975
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,393
<i>But sometimes,</i>

976
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,896
<i>there's a voice inside that says,</i>

977
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:13,192
<i>"Don't come any closer."</i>

978
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,153
I know that.

979
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:20,033
<i>So things are good the way they are.</i>

980
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:25,622
<i>I want to cherish</i>
<i>this space we have between us.</i>

981
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,292
I'm having the plumber fix it tomorrow.

982
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,295
Do you two take baths together?

983
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,713
Of course not!

984
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,465
-Do you want to take a bath with me?
-Yup!

985
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,966
Then I guess we're married, huh?

986
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:40,178
Okay, I guess we'll be
naked together, Kota.

987
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,179
Oh, stop.

988
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:56,778
<i>Rather than say "I like you"</i>
<i>and lose what we have,</i>

989
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,699
NIGHT OF JULY 7TH
SEVEN HEARTS FILLED WITH WISHES

990
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,744
<i>we will just stay like this...</i>

991
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,705
-Let's go with that.
-Okay.

992
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,790
Wait!

993
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,877
Aoi!

994
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,302
Hello.

995
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,518
Because of you,
Sanjo will find out about us!

996
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,602
Is that a problem?

997
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,313
Of course, it is!

998
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,149
I don't care if people
find out I'm with you.

999
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,067
Huh?

1000
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,281
Being with you isn't so bad.

1001
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,791
<i>Always like this...</i>

1002
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,336
<i>forever and ever...</i>

1003
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:59,048
Ready? Rock, paper, scissors!

1004
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,676
<i>I want it to stay like this...</i>

1005
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,263
<i>for as long as it can.</i>

1006
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,182
Ready? Rock, Paper...

1007
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,606
That's so cute!

1008
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,942
Hello.

1009
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,736
Oh, hello.

1010
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,530
Isn't it beautiful?

1011
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,241
If you wear one of our <i>yukata</i> on a date,

1012
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,785
your love will become true.

1013
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,036
Really?

1014
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:30,830
Try it on.

1015
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,206
Okay.

1016
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,219
It'll happen, right?

1017
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,903
Okay. I understand.

1018
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,032
It's fine. I'll be right over.
Stay at home.

1019
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,576
What's wrong with Satsuki?

1020
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:10,203
I'll be back.

1021
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:54,831
<i>Shu.</i>

1022
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,666
<i>You said you'd protect me, didn't you?</i>

1023
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:31,701
It's open.

1024
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,956
Welcome back. Is Satsuki okay?

1025
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,083
Yeah.

1026
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,627
That's good.

1027
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,009
You didn't have to wait.

1028
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:53,055
The expression on your face when you left
made me worried.

1029
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:55,641
Sorry.

1030
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,605
She gets very insecure.

1031
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:07,862
I had to be there.

1032
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:18,831
What happened...

1033
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:20,958
two years ago?

1034
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,633
It's got nothing to do with you.

1035
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:33,220
Besides, don't even ask. It's annoying.

1036
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:42,605
Why did I have to go and say that?

1037
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,484
I'd say you've done well
to have held back for this long.

1038
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,571
What should I do? What if he leaves?

1039
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,865
It's okay.

1040
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,035
I heard that he seems
to like living with you.

1041
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,122
Huh? Heard from who?

1042
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,460
Actually...

1043
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,338
I have a boyfriend now.

1044
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:09,757
Oh, here he is.

1045
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:14,470
What?

1046
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,846
This is my boyfriend.

1047
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:16,889
Yup!

1048
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,058
What? Since when?!

1049
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,436
I asked him about Shusei to help you,

1050
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,271
but one thing led to another.

1051
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,358
From the first moment I saw you,
I thought you were great.

1052
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,275
Really?

1053
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,944
That's wonderful. Congrats.

1054
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:30,903
Thanks.

1055
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,322
We should double date with Shusei!

1056
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,281
No, that's okay.

1057
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,826
-Oh, what'll you do for him today?
-Today?

1058
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,077
It's Shusei's birthday.

1059
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:39,745
What?!

1060
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,474
I hope it bakes well.

1061
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,860
It's rising nicely!

1062
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,530
Okay.

1063
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,586
Why did you suddenly want to play catch?

1064
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,089
Why? It's normal
for two guys to play catch.

1065
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,550
I've never heard that before.

1066
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:38,971
Hey, Shusei.

1067
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,097
What?

1068
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,266
Isn't it time that you stopped?

1069
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,185
Stop what?

1070
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,645
With Satsuki.

1071
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:54,111
It was two years ago.
You've been holding yourself responsible--

1072
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,281
Hey! You threw it too far!

1073
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:58,783
Geez.

1074
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,119
Ryosuke.

1075
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,454
What?

1076
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,873
Why'd you start dating that girl?

1077
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,583
Isn't it obvious?

1078
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,043
Because I like her.

1079
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,132
I can't remember anything
I used to think about

1080
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:18,969
before I met Moe.

1081
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,769
Sex, right?

1082
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:29,980
What kind of answer is that?

1083
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:32,483
Throw it here!

1084
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:42,868
SATSUKI CALLING

1085
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,167
Hey.

1086
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,678
Make your relationship with Aoi official.

1087
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,722
It's unfair to keep
leading her on like this.

1088
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,015
Aoi must be uneasy--

1089
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,059
So, hovering around her
like a big brother...

1090
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:08,853
isn't unfair?

1091
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,448
Then I guess I'll make her mine.

1092
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,120
Go ahead.

1093
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,508
I made it just in time!

1094
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,099
He's so late.

1095
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,983
He's not working today either...

1096
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,245
SHUSEI KUGAYAMA

1097
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:13,834
Hello?

1098
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:14,960
<i>It's Satsuki.</i>

1099
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:22,384
I don't think Shu
will be coming home tonight.

1100
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,352
He and I are even physically well-matched.

1101
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,523
<i>Oh, I guess you don't know</i>
<i>what that means.</i>

1102
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,695
He's back now.

1103
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:43,614
See ya.

1104
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,291
Welcome home.

1105
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,168
Are you okay being up this late?

1106
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,296
Just seeing your face
makes me feel much better.

1107
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:00,756
Go to sleep.

1108
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,758
Don't want to make things worse.

1109
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,137
I'm sorry. I know it's your birthday, too.

1110
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,348
That doesn't matter.

1111
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:11,809
Shu.

1112
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:12,893
Yeah?

1113
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,565
Come live with me.

1114
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:27,366
YAMATE APARTMENTS

1115
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:41,964
Welcome back!

1116
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,342
You're still awake?

1117
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:55,394
Did you make all of this?

1118
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,397
Yeah.

1119
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:01,984
Can I eat it now?

1120
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:04,528
Yup.

1121
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,167
Thanks for the food.

1122
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,129
I hope it's good.

1123
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,142
It's delicious.

1124
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,032
Why are  you crying?

1125
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:54,370
Sorry.

1126
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:02,169
What?

1127
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,004
Say what you wanna say.

1128
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:09,927
I...

1129
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:13,722
just...

1130
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,184
want to laugh with you.

1131
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,069
What a pain.

1132
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,700
What are you doing?

1133
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:36,453
Stop it! This isn't what I want!

1134
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,498
You want to laugh, right?

1135
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,091
Why...

1136
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,931
No!

1137
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,624
Wait!

1138
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,588
This isn't what I want!

1139
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:16,637
I love you!

1140
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,223
I love you.

1141
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,059
I love you...

1142
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,437
I want to be with you.

1143
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:49,378
I...

1144
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,339
don't have that kind of feeling.

1145
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,884
Not just with you.

1146
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:59,221
I just don't understand...

1147
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,890
what it means to love.

1148
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:08,647
I'm sorry.

1149
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:15,779
It was a short time...

1150
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,490
but it was fun.

1151
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,414
I'm glad it was with you.

1152
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,426
No, don't go!

1153
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:38,552
I don't like it!

1154
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,097
I don't want to see you hurt...

1155
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:44,474
because of me.

1156
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,703
That promise...

1157
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:08,832
about Tanabata...

1158
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,797
I'm sorry...

1159
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:20,218
I can't keep it.

1160
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,777
Okay. Turn, turn.

1161
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,445
Hey, Kota!

1162
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,614
What did you write for your wish
for Tanabata? Tell me.

1163
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,032
It's a secret!

1164
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,076
What? Just tell me, please?

1165
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,370
No!

1166
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:31,832
What? Are you serious?

1167
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,376
That's crazy!

1168
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:38,213
No way! I mean, this is how it is!

1169
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:40,632
Like I said, it can't be helped!

1170
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,969
I know what you mean. This is how it is.

1171
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,764
Aoi's been acting weird lately.

1172
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,809
Shusei, too.

1173
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,436
Really?

1174
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:04,948
Hello.

1175
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,575
Hello.

1176
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:08,827
The fireworks festival is coming up soon.

1177
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:10,704
Yeah.

1178
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,294
Oh, yes. Here.

1179
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:22,340
If you write your wish on here,
it will certainly come true.

1180
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,889
Actually, I just made that up.

1181
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,725
But wishes come true
more often than you think.

1182
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,025
So, that's the last that you saw him?

1183
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,904
Yeah. But I just wanted
to tell him how I felt.

1184
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,324
Hey, Ryo,

1185
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,910
is this because
of that ex-girlfriend of his?

1186
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:52,162
-Huh?
-What's with that chick?

1187
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:54,915
Why does she still hang around Shusei
even though they broke up?

1188
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:03,924
Satsuki is kind of
an important presence in Shusei's life.

1189
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:05,383
What?

1190
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,928
When he had it the toughest time,

1191
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,138
she was the only one who stood by him.

1192
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,225
But that's not the same as love.

1193
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:17,103
When they first started dating,

1194
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:19,564
I told him it wasn't going to work out.

1195
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,567
She had just been dumped,

1196
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:27,155
and Shusei just couldn't watch
Satsuki be alone.

1197
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,033
So, when she asked him to stay with her,

1198
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,868
he said he'd protect her.

1199
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:34,704
Satsuki...

1200
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,290
Shu!

1201
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:38,375
What's wrong?

1202
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,253
You didn't answer my calls.

1203
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,797
Oh, sorry.

1204
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,550
Are you avoiding me?

1205
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:48,718
No.

1206
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:51,304
Really?

1207
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:53,265
Yeah.

1208
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,058
Yeah.

1209
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:57,894
See you.

1210
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,272
Oh, okay. See ya.

1211
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,694
Shu, we'll always be together, right?

1212
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:07,612
Yeah.

1213
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,740
<i>But it didn't last.</i>

1214
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:12,826
<i>He couldn't be what she wanted.</i>

1215
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,996
I'm sure Satsuki realized that.

1216
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,832
She became more demanding,

1217
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,626
until all they did was fight in the end.

1218
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,714
So, they eventually broke up.

1219
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:27,048
<i>But then that day...</i>

1220
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:29,843
<i>two years ago on Christmas night,</i>

1221
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,179
<i>Satsuki said she wanted to make up.</i>

1222
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:36,516
<i>I'm waiting for you</i>
<i>in front of the big tree.</i>

1223
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:39,102
<i>I'll be here until you come, Shu.</i>

1224
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,234
<i>Shu, why won't you come see me?</i>

1225
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:49,070
<i>You said you'd protect me, didn't you?</i>

1226
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:53,867
<i>I... don't want to live anymore.</i>

1227
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:00,332
Shusei?

1228
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:05,503
Shusei! Hey!

1229
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:07,255
Where are you going?!

1230
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,549
Coming through! Please make way!

1231
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:10,550
Shusei!

1232
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:13,261
Coming through!
Excuse us, please move aside!

1233
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:14,721
Where is she?

1234
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:16,681
Over here! It's this girl.

1235
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:20,143
Excuse me, what happened here?

1236
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,811
That girl seems to have collapsed.

1237
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,814
Can you hear me?
Can you tell me your name?

1238
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,443
Satsuki?

1239
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:30,862
Heart rate 90. SpO2...

1240
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,574
Excuse me!

1241
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,076
-Please move!
-Excuse me!

1242
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:38,078
One, two, three.

1243
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:42,582
Blood pressure is 110 over 60.

1244
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:43,625
How's her breathing?

1245
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,043
It's quite shallow.

1246
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,545
-Do you know her?
-Yes.

1247
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,755
-What happened?
-Satsuki!

1248
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:50,882
-Wake up!
-This girl collapsed.

1249
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,676
What's wrong? Satsuki!

1250
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:53,927
-Shusei, stop.
-Satsuki!

1251
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,221
Satsuki!

1252
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:01,893
<i>The doctor said to expect the worst.</i>

1253
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,521
<i>Shu blamed himself.</i>

1254
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:09,317
He stayed in front
of the intensive care unit for three days.

1255
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,320
Miraculously, she woke up,

1256
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:16,366
but then Shusei told Satsuki,

1257
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:21,788
"I'll always be with you
until you are happy."

1258
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:27,877
He's trying to keep that promise
no matter how long it takes.

1259
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:33,508
I understand he feels responsible...
but hasn't he done enough already?

1260
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:38,596
It's not fair for her
to tie him down like that.

1261
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:42,267
I guess...

1262
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:45,228
the two of them are special.

1263
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,273
Even though it won't turn into love?

1264
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,694
It seems they're destined
to stay together.

1265
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:57,907
So, does that mean
you're just giving up on Shusei?

1266
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,079
To love another person

1267
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,999
isn't always just fun.

1268
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,335
But it's okay to love someone
because they bring your life joy.

1269
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:14,841
That's what I did.

1270
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,375
Why?

1271
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:42,197
<i>Maybe I just want to laugh with you.</i>

1272
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:15,355
Coming through.

1273
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:49,681
AOI NISHIMURA

1274
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:50,807
Kugayama!

1275
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,227
Kugayama!

1276
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:57,272
After you're done cleaning,
can you set the tables?

1277
01:27:57,563 --> 01:27:58,481
Okay.

1278
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,474
It's so good to see a hard-working youth!

1279
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:18,311
Hey there, heartbreaker.

1280
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:24,650
Hey!

1281
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:30,948
I get about ten emails a day from Satsuki.

1282
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:33,701
Long ones, too. Give me a break.

1283
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,244
Sorry.

1284
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:39,582
What are you gonna do?

1285
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,797
Until she's happy,
I'm going to stay by her side.

1286
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:49,300
Even though you're not dating?
That's ridiculous.

1287
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:52,553
That just makes you smug.
There's no substance to this--

1288
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:53,471
I...

1289
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:56,057
If it's not making you happy,

1290
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:57,975
then put an end to it.

1291
01:29:59,685 --> 01:30:01,229
I can't do that.

1292
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:02,730
Don't you get it?

1293
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,275
The reason Satsuki is after you

1294
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,153
is because she's stubborn
and wants to control you.

1295
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:17,537
And you are using that as an excuse
to run from commitment--

1296
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,288
I already know all of that.

1297
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:20,998
Satsuki knows it, too!

1298
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:22,750
All of that.

1299
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:32,718
Leave her to me.

1300
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:34,679
I'll take care of her.

1301
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:37,306
I'm sick of her complaining anyway.

1302
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:44,814
Is it time to go?

1303
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:52,613
No more running.

1304
01:30:58,786 --> 01:30:59,620
Later!

1305
01:31:06,669 --> 01:31:09,380
I'm so hungry!

1306
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:12,758
Oh, I know! Moe, do you want
to eat at my place?

1307
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,261
I'll make you something really good.

1308
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:16,554
Aoi!

1309
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,973
Wanna go to the festival with me?
I know you're not busy.

1310
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:21,309
No, you should go with Ryosuke.

1311
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:24,145
You bought a <i>yukata,</i> right?
Don't let it go to waste.

1312
01:31:24,228 --> 01:31:25,980
It's fine. I'll wear it next year.

1313
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:29,192
We should invite another guy.

1314
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,776
Then, it'll be a double date!

1315
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,278
Moe, it's okay.

1316
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:35,239
Unrequited love is such a waste of time.

1317
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,908
Really, I'm fine.

1318
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:39,869
Where can we find a good guy?

1319
01:31:39,952 --> 01:31:42,288
Uh, Moe, are you even listening?

1320
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:43,289
Oh!

1321
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:45,166
I know!

1322
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:46,751
Huh?

1323
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,629
Sure, I can go.
I don't have work that day.

1324
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:51,964
-But I don't want to be a burden--
-That's great!

1325
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:54,675
Look foward to seeing Aoi in a <i>yukata.</i>

1326
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:55,593
What?!

1327
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:56,719
I certainly will.

1328
01:31:58,554 --> 01:31:59,931
Excuse me, Sanjo?

1329
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,099
Sorry, I gotta go.

1330
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,227
We'll meet you at the event on the 7th!

1331
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,603
Sounds good.

1332
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:07,730
Welcome!

1333
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:09,565
Okay!

1334
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:12,818
Hey, Moe. You're putting me
in an awkward spot.

1335
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:14,779
Why? Is Sanjo not good enough?

1336
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,405
That's not it. I--

1337
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,449
You can't say there's someone you like.

1338
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:19,784
Hold onto your unrequited love

1339
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:21,786
and you'll end up all alone forever.

1340
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:27,750
Wear this year's <i>yukata</i>
during this year, okay?

1341
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:33,130
Okay.

1342
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:17,633
<i>Welcome to the 12th annual</i>
<i>Tanabata Fireworks Festival.</i>

1343
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,010
Thank you very much!

1344
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:23,306
<i>Ten thousand fireworks</i>
<i>will shoot up into the night sky</i>

1345
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,934
<i>starting tonight at 7:30 p.m.</i>

1346
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:30,062
JULY 7, 2014 AT 7:30 P.M.
10,000 FIREWORKS WILL LIGHT UP THE NIGHT

1347
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,194
You look so cute, Aoi!

1348
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,113
Sanjo is going to love it!

1349
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:40,990
Don't say that!

1350
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:43,326
The bus is here.

1351
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:58,466
Okay, get on!

1352
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:03,763
Driver, please go ahead.

1353
01:34:03,846 --> 01:34:04,680
What?!

1354
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:06,932
Ryosuke and I are taking his scooter.

1355
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:08,643
Say hi to Sanjo for us.

1356
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:11,062
You better come later.

1357
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:14,023
See you later!

1358
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:19,111
Hopefully, our plan will work out.

1359
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:23,240
Well, if Sanjo pushes her,
I'm sure Aoi will do something.

1360
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,215
<i>The next stop is</i>

1361
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:42,593
<i>Yokohama Cosmo World.</i>

1362
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:45,846
<i>Due to today's fireworks event,</i>

1363
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,265
<i>please expect the next stop to be crowded.</i>

1364
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,518
<i>Please watch your step as you exit.</i>

1365
01:35:14,166 --> 01:35:15,042
Aoi!

1366
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,048
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1367
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:22,800
Where are the other two?

1368
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:25,261
Oh, they're coming a little later.

1369
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:26,846
I see.

1370
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:28,597
Shall we go?

1371
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:33,394
Was there traffic?

1372
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:34,770
Just a little.

1373
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,088
Hey.

1374
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:02,673
You!

1375
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:04,091
What?!

1376
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:06,552
Ow...

1377
01:36:06,635 --> 01:36:08,220
This isn't right!

1378
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,724
-What?
-You've changed!

1379
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:16,228
You enjoyed being with Aoi.

1380
01:36:17,521 --> 01:36:20,107
You wanted it to stay that way,
didn't you?

1381
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:23,194
Isn't that what love is?

1382
01:36:25,404 --> 01:36:27,281
But what are you doing?

1383
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:31,744
You're just making excuses
and putting on an act!

1384
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:34,789
Leave me alone.

1385
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,124
Shusei, you--

1386
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:38,292
Stop it!

1387
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:44,048
I don't care about how you feel.

1388
01:36:44,423 --> 01:36:45,257
But...

1389
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:49,261
this.

1390
01:36:50,262 --> 01:36:53,390
She put this away
because it makes her think of you.

1391
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:56,602
Maybe I should sell it for her.

1392
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:01,649
Aoi is with Sanjo
at the amusement park right now.

1393
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,276
I made her go.

1394
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:07,905
I don't want to see her stuck
on unrequited love for her whole life.

1395
01:37:42,731 --> 01:37:43,607
Shusei!

1396
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:48,654
You don't have time.

1397
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,531
Thank you.

1398
01:37:56,745 --> 01:37:58,122
Hurry, Shusei!

1399
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:03,043
You're slow!

1400
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:04,086
Yeah, he is.

1401
01:38:06,922 --> 01:38:08,966
Wait, how are we getting there?!

1402
01:38:11,176 --> 01:38:13,429
What were you thinking?!

1403
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,064
<i>Thanks for the gift.</i>

1404
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,402
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

1405
01:38:29,528 --> 01:38:34,033
<i>we didn't spend much time together.</i>

1406
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:45,169
<i>But I had a lot of fun.</i>

1407
01:38:46,295 --> 01:38:49,048
<i>I think it might have been</i>

1408
01:38:49,965 --> 01:38:52,927
<i>the funnest time in my whole life.</i>

1409
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:56,931
<i>But...</i>

1410
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:03,395
<i>I wanted to talk with you more.</i>

1411
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:07,483
<i>I wanted to know you well.</i>

1412
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:14,615
<i>If only I hadn't said I loved you...</i>

1413
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:19,203
<i>I thought maybe we'd still be together.</i>

1414
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:22,623
<i>But...</i>

1415
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:26,251
<i>I can't erase what already happened.</i>

1416
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:33,842
<i>Even if we can't be together anymore...</i>

1417
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,471
<i>even if you hate me...</i>

1418
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:44,228
<i>I am in love with you, Shusei Kugayama.</i>

1419
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:49,108
<i>That feeling just won't go away.</i>

1420
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:51,902
<i>I don't want it to go away.</i>

1421
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:54,863
<i>Aoi.</i>

1422
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:01,954
Wanna ride this?

1423
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:03,247
Sure.

1424
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,545
<i>Please proceed slowly.</i>

1425
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:14,425
<i>Lane restrictions are in effect</i>
<i>due to the fireworks display.</i>

1426
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,593
<i>We ask for your cooperation.</i>

1427
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:26,520
It's so pretty.

1428
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:36,113
<i>Please proceed slowly.</i>

1429
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:39,324
<i>-Please follow the directions.</i>
-Damn it!

1430
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:43,037
<i>Lane restrictions are in effect</i>
<i>due to the fireworks display.</i>

1431
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:44,329
Excuse me!

1432
01:40:44,496 --> 01:40:46,749
Please let me through! Excuse me!

1433
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,375
Let me through!

1434
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:49,835
Look out! Stop!

1435
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,629
I need to get through here!

1436
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,131
The lanes are restricted!

1437
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,051
Hey, you can't go through!

1438
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:58,594
Hey! Get back here!

1439
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:00,262
No parking here!

1440
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:03,474
Let me through! I'm coming through!

1441
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:09,146
The heart-shaped fireworks
should be starting soon.

1442
01:41:11,648 --> 01:41:13,358
I'm sorry you're stuck with me.

1443
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:14,943
Huh?

1444
01:41:15,277 --> 01:41:17,196
Next year, you can
take your girlfriend here.

1445
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:19,990
I'd like to come again with you.

1446
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:21,200
Huh?

1447
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:27,081
Excuse me! Make way!

1448
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:30,000
Sorry! Excuse me!

1449
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:33,545
I love you.

1450
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:38,217
I always have.

1451
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:42,930
I wouldn't make you cry.

1452
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,433
I like seeing you smile.

1453
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:08,705
Excuse me!

1454
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:44,408
I'm sorry.

1455
01:43:02,384 --> 01:43:03,760
Wow!

1456
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:23,947
Aoi!

1457
01:43:32,414 --> 01:43:33,373
Aoi!

1458
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:44,843
Aoi!

1459
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:51,141
Aoi!

1460
01:43:56,021 --> 01:43:57,689
Hey, that hurt!

1461
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:58,649
I'm so sorry!

1462
01:44:01,985 --> 01:44:02,819
Aoi!

1463
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:11,203
Aoi!

1464
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:17,376
Why are you here?!

1465
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:21,880
I'm sorry!

1466
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,841
I'm sorry for everything!

1467
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:30,847
I...

1468
01:44:32,182 --> 01:44:34,935
I thought I didn't know
how to love another person.

1469
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:37,187
But that's not true.

1470
01:44:39,147 --> 01:44:40,357
I was scared.

1471
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:43,277
I was scared of how direct you were.

1472
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:49,283
But I'm done running.

1473
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:06,883
I...

1474
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:10,262
want to laugh with you.

1475
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:15,726
I want to know you well.

1476
01:45:25,068 --> 01:45:26,820
Please be my girlfriend!

1477
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:43,920
You're so selfish!

1478
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:49,968
You closed yourself from me...

1479
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:53,805
and decided alone that's how it would be.

1480
01:45:59,394 --> 01:46:01,396
Share it with me!

1481
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:05,525
No matter how much grief...

1482
01:46:09,821 --> 01:46:11,823
no matter how much it hurts...

1483
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:16,244
no matter how many tears are cried...

1484
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:23,377
no matter what,

1485
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:27,506
I will never leave you.

1486
01:46:34,888 --> 01:46:37,182
I want to be happy with you.

1487
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:55,033
I'll always be by your side.

1488
01:46:57,702 --> 01:46:58,578
Yeah.

1489
01:47:39,244 --> 01:47:40,704
A face waiting for a kiss.

1490
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:45,250
Hey, you're seriously making me mad!
Give that to me!

1491
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:48,211
Huh?

1492
01:47:48,753 --> 01:47:50,005
The fireworks are over.

1493
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:52,716
Not quite yet.

1494
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:44,299
WE WISH TO ALWAYS LAUGH TOGETHER.
AOI AND SHUSEI

1495
