 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:11,782
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

3
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:15,396
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

4
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:20,681
 ♫ With a sense of excitement You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:25,762
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:31,110
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,598
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:38,162
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:42,794
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:48,766
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:53,902
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,902 --> 00:01:01,082
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

13
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:05,882
 ♫ All I possess is drowned The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

14
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:11,246
 ♫ Has never changed If miracles could exist ♫ 

15
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:15,329
 ♫ Promises would be kept Please remember ♫ 

16
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,240
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,020
Deep Affectionate Eyes

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,950
 

19
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:37,830



20
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,060
What a fancy courtyard.

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,060
Gardener Li designed it.

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,920
Men truly master all skills
only when trying to please women.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,820
Look how nice it is.

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,220
- Let me take a photo for you. 
 - Come on.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,380
These are ready. Ya En can have them.

26
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,160
Ye Meng skipped breakfast to host you.

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,960
Ya En must be hungry
after sending Jia Yu to school so early.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,700
Who are you to make demands?

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,300
As Ya En's non-blood-related brother?
Or her suitor?

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,100
Take them away.

31
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,300
That's enough. Ya En loves these. Seriously.

32
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,660
Here we go.

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,760
Let me pick one for you.

34
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,960
Is it burning?

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,420
Maybe just a little.

36
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,840
I should hang out with Ping An.
We're both third wheels in this house.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
I should've taken Jia Yu for a kids' meal instead.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,380
Why am I suffering here?

39
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,100
- It's a bit hot.
- Ya En.

40
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,280
Ya En, these are ready to eat.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,520
Alright, thanks. Here, Mai. Have them.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,740
Thanks, Ya En.

43
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,740
- Be careful, it's hot. 
 - I'll get drinks.

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,320
- It's good. 
 - Not bad, huh?

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,860
Cheng Kai Ran, choose your seat wisely.

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,300
Are you the family of the bride or groom?

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Of course, I'm the bride's family.

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,000
Then I'm also the bride's family.
I'm siding with Ye Meng.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,340
How come you are Ye Meng's family?

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,560
Alright, see? We've drawn a line here.

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,440
Can we ask you a couple of questions
as the bride's family?

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,140
- Great idea. 
 - Right?

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,910
- Who goes first? 
 - I'll start.

54
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,440
What was your ideal girlfriend like
before you met Ye Meng?

55
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,700
There was no specific type.

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,120
No way. That's impossible.

57
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,100
Even if you were single,
you must have fantasized about it, right?

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,420
Exactly.

59
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,760
Speak freely. No consequences.

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,840
I swear I didn't have an ideal type.

61
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,760
But I did consider types I'd never date.

62
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,960
Be more specific.

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,400
I can answer for him.
He wouldn't date someone older than him, like me.

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,280
You said "no consequences".

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,100
Says who? There are consequences.

66
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,620
Didn't you just say that?

67
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,880
My eyes.

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,420
You two drive me crazy.

69
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,420
- What do you mean?
- My bad.

70
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,120
You're all flirty and sickeningly sweet.

71
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,640
Have you ever considered how we feel?

72
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,320
Li Jin Yu, let me tell you something.

73
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,120
Once, Ye Meng asked me
to shoot beach photos for her.

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,520
It turned out to be her scheme.

75
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,400
She dismissed me right after the shooting.
It was so windy--

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,290
- I see. 
 - Another time...

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,620
I see what you're doing.

78
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,380
Alright, let me ask you a serious question.

79
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,520
You're from Jiangbei, right?
So your household registration's there?

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,140
And social insurance?

81
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't have a full-time job,
so I don't have social insurance yet.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,080
You don't? Then your kids' education
and your pension could be problems.

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,860
You can sustain yourself for now. But should Ye Meng starve with you in the future?

84
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,100
Ya En, that's far-fetched.

85
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,620
How can I let Ye Meng starve? I'll support her.

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,620
I'll get you social insurance tomorrow.
I run a legitimate bar.

87
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,960
Stop interrupting.

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,812
Even if I don't ask about it,

89
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:26,200
Ye Meng's aunts will bring it up.

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,440
For your relationship to last,

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,760
you must think about it
and address these problems.

92
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,320
Alright, I know I'm blunt.

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,340
But these are hard-won insights. Don't mind me.

94
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,760
I've said my piece. I'll drink up.

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,640
Thank you, Ya En. I'll take it seriously.

96
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
Is this even cooked? I can't chew through it.

97
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,340
It's medium-rare. It's totally edible.

98
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,860
- I grilled it a little bit. 
 - Really?

99
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,840
Rest assured.

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
This tree looks beautiful.

101
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,080
Listen, Fang Ya En did have a point.

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
The Ye family isn't easy to marry into.

103
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm fully aware.

104
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,720
You don't know crap.
But I've already planned it out for you.

105
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,320
I heard that the parent company

106
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,420
 
of Hailan Bay wants further development

107
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,280
and plans to demolish
all these old houses in town.

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,560
Take the compensation, buy a new house or make some investments.

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,900
What're you whispering about?

110
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,140
Just chatting. Come on.

111
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,920
Give it to me.

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,480
- Alright, I'll send you home. 
 - Okay.

113
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,620
- See you around.
- Bye.

114
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,120
- Bye, Ye Meng.
- Bye, think about it.

115
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,020
Bye.

116
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,240
You weren't upset about what Ya En said, right?

117
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,420
Of course not.

118
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,910
Ya En and I grew up together. Though we're the same age,

119
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,480
she's always acted like an older sister,
worrying about me.

120
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,900
I know she means well. It's interesting though.

121
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,080
So this is how it feels
to be interrogated by in-laws.

122
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,360
I just want you to know.
Feel free to do whatever makes you happy.

123
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,080
Got it.

124
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,580
Li Jin Yu.

125
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,180
What's wrong?

126
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,820
I love days like this.

127
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,760
Me too.

128
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,280
♫ ♫

129
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,760
♫ ♫

130
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,990
♫ ♫

131
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,830
♫ ♫

132
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,640
Let's go.

133
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,960
♫ ♫

134
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,420
♫ ♫

135
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,340
I thought they'd interrogate me.
All that preparation was wasted.

136
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,960
What did you prepare?

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,320
Answers about my favorite parts of you

138
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,440
or when you look most attractive.

139
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,960
And when is that?

140
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,820
When you play guitar. Why don't you teach me?

141
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,360
- Will you be able to learn? 
 - Of course.

142
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,540
I'll show you the world's most promising talent.

143
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,700
I'll think about it.

144
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,360
What's there to think about? Teach me now. Hurry.

145
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,760
You can't even open doors,
yet you want to learn guitar?

146
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,900
Alright, young lady.

147
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,520
- Careful. Over your shoulder. 
- Okay.

148
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,660
You're holding it too high.

149
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,800
- How do I hold it?
- Are you playing the pipa?

150
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,960
- Stop laughing at me. 
 - Lower your hand.

151
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,200
Now, press the chords with this hand.

152
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,940
Press like this?

153
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,840
This hand.

154
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,580
- Okay. Not bad, huh?
- Yeah.

155
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,080
I want to learn our love song.

156
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,940
Fine. Let me show you the first chord.

157
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,200
See? This is the first chord. Got it?

158
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,860
See? Give me your hand.

159
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Index finger here. Relax.

160
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,340
Alright.

161
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,100
- Push upward.
- Okay.

162
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,420
Stop fooling around.

163
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,220
Let me post this. It's worth remembering.

164
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,760
Sure.

165
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,620
- Done yet? 
 - Not yet.

166
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,700
- Wait. 
 - Can you hurry up?

167
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,720
Almost there. It needs captions, okay?

168
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,820
Okay.

169
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,960
Okay. One, two, three.

♫ ♫

171
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,950
♫ ♫

172
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,580

176
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,490
Gou,

177
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,940
it's the season of love.

178
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,760
- Ever heard of knocking? 
 - Give me a break. Check WeChat Moments.

179
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,240
Look.

180
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,800
 
Regretting it now?

181
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,820
I tried stopping you,
but you insisted on provoking Ye Meng.

182
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,160
Now she's found a guy back home.

183
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,080
That's enough. Ask her if you're curious.

184
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,660
Not with the other fingers.

185
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,296
- Like this?
- Yeah.

186
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:43,000
What about this?
 

187
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,400
You have a call.

188
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,320
Let's continue.

189
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,160
I can step out so you can take the call.

190
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,660
No need. I'm blocking him.

191
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,160
Don't block him. What if
you need to go back to his company?

192
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,560
No, I promise I'll never go back.

193
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,300
What's wrong, Mr. Li? Are you mad?

194
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,460
Not at all.

195
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,560
Let me make it up to you.

196
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,720
Then say you're wrong.

197
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,040
- Call me "brother". 
 - Brother, I'm sorry.

199
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,760
That was too easy for you.

200
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,100
Brother, I'm sorry. Forgive me.

201
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,920
Enough. Stop it.

202
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,360
People would think we're roosters crowing.

203
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,540
Teach me more.

204
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,140
Come on.

205
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,340
Hug me first.

206
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,960
Sure.

207
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,320
I'm not a child. You can't hug me like this.

208
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:17,420
 

209
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:38,570
 

210
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,440
Why didn't you put the package inside?

211
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,140
Aren't we in a hurry to see Granny?

212
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,160
Right, hold out your hand.
I have something for you. Hurry.

213
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,960
What is it?

214
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,660
Congratulations on obtaining
your girlfriend's house key.

215
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,460
- This doesn't feel right. 
 - It's fine.

216
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,140
If I need to visit Jiangbei someday, you can get packages for me.

217
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,340
Okay, Mr. Li?

218
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,300
Sure.

219
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,900
Let's go.

220
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,120
Wang, I'll be discharged in a couple of days.

221
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,060
I've grown attached to you. We've bonded.

222
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,960
My grandson is very considerate.

223
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,860
See this wheelchair? He bought it for me.

224
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,900
I don't need it at home, do I?

225
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,100
You wouldn't accept it
if I gave it to you for free, would you?

226
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,620
So this is what I'm asking.
You'll have something to remember me by.

227
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,300
Granny.

228
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,260
Meng.

229
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,760
- Why did you get up? 
 - You're back.

230
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,240
- Grandma, forget about the wheelchair.
- But--

231
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,480
We're not selling it.

232
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,960
Come on. Persuade Ba Dou to discharge me.

233
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,100
We need the doctor's discharge papers.
Stay one more day.

234
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,960
Doesn't our town organize free health checkups?

235
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,840
I can save you money like that. Silly boy.

236
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,760
Silly boy.

237
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,660
If you lie, I'll make you walk Ping An.

238
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,960
I thought having a girlfriend
would soften you. So heartless.

239
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,760
But I promise I'll get the checkup. Okay?

240
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,200
He means well. Let me peel an orange for you.

241
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,960
You're defending him?

242
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,860
- Have the orange. 
 - Make him peel it.

243
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,760
- You do it. 
 - Sure.

244
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,020
Wang, 300 yuan.

245
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,540
I bet it's the flowers I ordered for Granny.

246
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,440
Granny, I'll be right back.

247
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,340
I'll be waiting.

248
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,180
Hello?

249
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,680
 It's me, Gou Kai. 

250
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,360
What's wrong with you?
Why are you calling from different numbers?

251
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,100
You're even using unknown numbers?

252
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,820
Check your security cam.
I'm at your door in Ningsui.

253
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,450
What?

254
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,080
Let's meet.

255
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,500
You need to do that checkup. No, thanks.

256
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,860
To be honest, I'm a bit worried about going home.

257
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,240
Won't I disturb your romantic moments
with Meng at home?

258
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,900
True, we wouldn't share a room.

259
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,120
But old folks like me don't sleep much,
unlike you youngsters.

260
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,740
- Stop.
- With all that youthful passion--

261
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,800
You don't sleep much
because you're always on your phone.

262
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Not because you're old.
And Ye Meng doesn't live with me.

263
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,340
Let's get serious.

264
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,500
I heard about a new development in the district.

265
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,520
The medical staff said it was nice. It's called Hailan Bay.

266
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,460
I've saved all the money
you've given me over the years,

267
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,800
waiting to buy you a home when you get married.

268
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,380
 That's it. I'll meet you at the cafe. 

269
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,000
Take Meng to see the property.

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,060
You're dating now, and you'll get married soon.

271
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,740
You need your own place, right? I can't wait to hold my great-grandchild.

272
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,100
And you should show her family you're responsible.

273
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,720
Are you listening to me?

274
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm not going.

275
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,380
You're not going?

276
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,060
You never intended
to build a life with her, did you?

277
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,620
That's unnecessary. It's too early for that.

278
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,400
What do you mean? "Unnecessary"? Then what's necessary?

279
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,600
- Ba Dou, I-- 
 - That's not what I meant.

280
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,920
Ye Meng is just staying here for a while.
She's not going to stay.

281
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,500
She hasn't decided where to live.

282
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,700
I don't want to pressure her
with these decisions before she's ready.

283
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,600
But no matter where she wants to live,

284
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,370
shouldn't you discuss it first?

285
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,860
You need to talk.

286
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,100
Don't let her misunderstand you. Get it?

287
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,320
Got it.

288
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,660
Use your brain. Think carefully, okay?

289
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,020
-  I'm meeting with someone. 
- Who is it?

290
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,900
 The delivery person left the flowers
at the nurses' station. 

291
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,520
 Pick them up. 

292
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,200
 

293
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,740
Ye Meng said she had something to do.

294
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,300
I'll get the flowers she bought for you.

295
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,860
She bought me flowers? Hurry up.

296
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,140
You...

297
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,040
What are you doing?

298
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,200
...

299
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,470
It's okay.

300
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,160
Find me that song you played at the concert.

301
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,930
Duty-bound.

302
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,830
Here. Welcome to the fandom.

303
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,500
- Get to work.
- On it.

304
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,080
What's your problem?

305
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,920
H-Hey. Close your eyes.

306
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,120
- Why?
- Just do it. Close your eyes.

307
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,600
Feel it.

308
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,500
Exhale. Inhale. Do you feel it now?

309
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,060
Enough. I can't play Qiao Mai Mai's death metal.

310
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,380
I'm not asking you to play.
I mean, does your heart race?

311
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,800
No, it just sounds unpleasant.

312
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,960
Are you going to test
the customers' tolerance limits?

313
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,644
It's not about the customers.

314
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:56,420
I just want to know whether my heart was racing that night

315
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,820
from this damn music or because--

316
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,720
So when you realized you liked Ye Meng,

317
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,580
was your heartbeat the same as when you heard this music?

318
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,680
Or maybe faster? Boom-boom.

319
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,920
Like 180 BPM?

320
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,300
Maybe you should go to a hospital.

321
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,360
I'm serious. I'm going crazy.

322
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,920
I think I'm into Fang Ya En.

323
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,340
I-I suspect I might have feelings for Fang Ya En.

324
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,440
But I'm not completely sure yet.

325
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,400
Right? How could I possibly like Fang Ya En?

326
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,000
She's always bossing me around.

327
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,400
Even if I liked someone, it wouldn't be her.

328
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,420
But seeing her smile at the concert made me happy.

329
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,060
So you're saying you don't know
if you're into Fang Ya En?

330
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
Talk to her. Why did you ask me to come?

331
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,600
I'm too scared. Come with me.

332
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,060
Now you admit it?

333
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,140
Yeah, I admit it. Total coward now.

334
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,720
Just come with me.
Let's check on her from a distance.

335
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,200
- I have work today. 
 - You'll get paid.

336
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,860
Extra work means extra pay.

337
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,500
Triple rate.

338
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,300
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

339
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,060
Mai, watch the store.

340
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,300
- Sure thing.
- Okay.

341
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,600
You grew up here. Nice.

342
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,620
It's so chill. Great retirement spot.

343
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,800
But it's not for you right now.

344
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,860
The coffee quality's lacking.

345
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,080
Why don't you have proper coffee back at Jiangbei?

346
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,720
When will you fix your attitude?

347
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,740
I can't. So, what do you want?

348
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,540
Why did we park so far away?

349
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,680
She'd see us if we got closer.

350
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,200
I just want to take a look at her
and see how I feel.

351
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,060
You sound like a pervert stalker.

352
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm not. You're the perv.

353
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,480
- Hi, Ya En, taking out trash?
- You look fabulous.

354
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,040
- Thanks.
- Come visit sometime.

355
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,640
Will do.

356
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,100
She was all sweet with Li Jin Yu yesterday.
Now she's cheating on him?

357
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,160
Unbelievable.

358
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,020
She didn't come over, right? Take a look.

359
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,860
Did she spot us? Jin Yu.

360
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,660
Jin Yu. Check if she's coming.

361
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,340
Ya En.

362
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,060
Hi, what brings you here?

363
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,760
Well, Jin Yu needs to talk with you.

364
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,580
Let's talk inside. It's freezing out here.

365
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,720
Come on. I'm freezing to death here.

366
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,700
So cold. Hurry.

367
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,120
I'll make you tea.

368
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,600
Actually, Ya En, I won't come in.

369
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
Why not?

370
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,210
Because of him. He wanted to talk to you.

371
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,440
I'll leave you to chat. See you.

372
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,860
Where are you going?

373
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,200
Back to work.

374
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,900
Oh. Alright.

375
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,040
- Talk to her. Bye.
- Bye.

376
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,760
You...

377
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,040
Turn right.

378
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,700
Oh my god, unbelievable.

379
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,620
Actually, I...

380
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,660
 Bow to me already, sis. 

381
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,280
 Li Jin Yu almost saw you with Gou Kai at the cafe. 

382
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,700
 Luckily, I covered for you. 

383
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,620
Fine. I apologize. Will you come back with me?

384
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:43,100
 

385
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,640
Gou Kai, if you didn't hear me
clearly before, let me repeat it.

386
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,060
I've never wanted to go back.

387
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,520
You're dating someone? I saw your post.

388
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,960
He's local, huh? Just fool around with him.
You really plan to stay here forever?

389
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,660
Why can't I stay forever? And listen.

390
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,680
I'm dead serious. Believe it or not.

391
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,480
How serious? I'd like to meet him.

392
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,200
I know what's on your mind.

393
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,700
Stop lecturing me with that superior attitude.

394
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,240
We were never from the same world to begin with.

395
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,200
Stop lying to yourself. You wouldn't have
chosen Jiangbei if you had wanted stability.

396
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,160
I wanted adventures when I was young,
but that world wasn't for me.

397
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,780
I don't like it anymore. Got a problem?

398
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,360
- Ye Meng, I did everything for your good. I hope-- 
 - I have to go.

399
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,900
By the way, Gou Kai, you sound so patronizing.

400
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,760
Check please.

401
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,980
Your beans are mediocre. Nothing special.

402
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,920
What? Here to chat?

403
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,760
- Yeah. Sure. 
- Go ahead.

404
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,320
The suit I sent here was too big.

405
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,820
- Needed alterations?
- Yeah.

406
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,100
Done. It's here.

407
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,000
Tell me if it doesn't fit.

408
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,340
Okay. I'll pay you via WeChat.

409
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,440
No need.

410
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,340
Then... let me buy you coffee.

411
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,052
Okay.

412
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,460
Kai, let me...

413
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,060
let me retake your measurements.

414
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,960
My alterations might not be perfect. Give it here.

415
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,620
Come here. Let me measure you again.

416
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,470
Come back.

417
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:54,160
With the measurements, it will be more accurate.

418
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,200
- Take off your jacket. 
 - No need. I'll keep it on.

419
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,790
Come on.

420
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,720
Relax here.

421
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,900
Relax here.

422
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,340
Why are you shaking?

423
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,080
Late nights. I'm having palpitations.

424
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,280
- Then sleep earlier. 
 - I-I can't sleep.

425
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,920
- Keep your arm relaxed. 
 - O-Okay.

426
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,020
Length's good. Turn around.

427
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,760
- Left or right? 
 - Do as you wish.

428
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,080
What's wrong? Why are you dodging me?

429
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,100
Your shoulders are quite broad.

430
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,200
- Really? 
 - You work out much?

431
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,680
Absolutely.

432
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,380
Turn around.

433
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Am I tickling you?

434
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,360
Ya En, I'm here for my clothes.

435
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,280
One moment.

436
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,960
- Since when do you sell menswear? 
 - I don't.

437
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,860
Then who's this? Your boyfriend?

438
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,400
Boyfriend? My little brother. Closer than blood.

439
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,440
Here.

440
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,160
- Looks sharp. Do you have a girlfriend?
- Right?

441
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,920
- Not yet. 
 - Then come register at my matchmaking agency.

442
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,120
Good idea. My little brother is a great guy.

443
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,160
He's our town's most eligible bachelor.

444
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,000
Keep an eye out. I'll send you a red envelope.

445
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,300
No need. I-I have someone I like.

446
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,640
My bad. Never mind then.

447
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,320
- I'm off. Stay in touch.
- Alright.

448
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,200
Take care.

449
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,460
Got you to spill the beans.

450
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,960
Last time, you denied it. Why are you shy?

451
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,340
Who is it? Do I know her?

452
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,440
Sort of... I guess.

453
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,500
Really? I know her? Who is she?

454
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,380
Hold on.

455
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,260
Hello? Ms. Chen? What's wrong?

456
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,700
Wait. I'm heading there now.

457
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,600
- What happened? 
 - Jia Yu threw up and had diarrhea. I need to go.

458
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,080
I'll come with you. I got it.

459
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,460
- Let's go.
- Lock it.

460
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,860
Okay.

461
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,100
 Didn't he say he'll come to pick you up
after the Spring Festival? 

462
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,590
 Why would I go with him? 

463
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,480
 I won't even show up. You'll tell him to get lost. 

464
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,660
Sorry, that's it for today. Thank you.

465
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,840
- Sing for us, handsome. 
 - Not singing?

466
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,160
What's wrong? Sing for us.

467
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,100
Bro, are you in a bad mood? Why didn't you sing?

468
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,700
No.

469
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,300
What's wrong? Are you bothered?

470
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,800
I have a girlfriend. I'm going to marry her.

471
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,820
Impressive, Meng. Strict management.

472
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,420
Jin Yu, we still haven't
found a decent accountant.

473
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,940
Let me know if you know anyone qualified.

474
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
- Hey.
- Mr. Gou.

475
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,800
Come in.

476
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,500
Jiang, send me the thumb ring seller's info.
Thanks for your help.

477
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,580
No problem, Mr. Gou. Friends help friends.

478
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,060
Alright, let's have a proper gathering
back in Jiangbei.

479
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,200
Take a seat.

480
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,480
You're buying a thumb ring?

481
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,000
No, it's an antique. I'm asking for Tai Ming Xiao.

482
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,720
You're done?

483
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,600
I was planning to visit you.

484
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,480
Knock it off. I'm already flattered
by your visit to Ningsui.

485
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,920
Hailan Bay is about to start trial operations.
I should check on it as the boss.

486
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,600
But I'm returning to Jiangbei tomorrow.

487
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,352
Why the rush?

488
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:50,100
Since you're already here,

489
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,720
why not ask your star employee
out for dinner or coffee?

490
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,340
Aren't you my star employee?
Just name a place if you want a treat.

491
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:05,388
Cut it out. You know I'm talking about Ye Meng.

492
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:06,676
I know.

493
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:09,900
But didn't you say she was going to stay here

494
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,810
to get married and have kids?

495
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,120
I can't force her to leave.

496
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,340
And she posted about her date on WeChat Moments.

497
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,180
He's a local. Do you know him?

498
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:29,900
I've met him before. That's all.
But he seems like Ye Meng's type.

499
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,360
Good.

500
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,680
Why? Are you curious about her boyfriend?

501
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,320
No, you mentioned her.
So I'm making conversation. Doesn't matter.

502
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,380
Are you free later? Let's grab a drink.

503
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,320
Next time. I'm a bit tired.
I'll see you before I leave tomorrow.

504
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,508
Alright. I'll head back. Rest well, Mr. Gou.

505
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,320
Bye.

506
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:30,280
 

507
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:53,160
You're reading? Did you have dinner?
I brought you cake.

508
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,880
Why did you suddenly get a cake?

509
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,280
I visited a cafe this afternoon.
Their cake was amazing.

510
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,520
So I had to bring you some to try.

511
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,000
You met someone at the cafe? A local friend?

512
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,900
How did it go?

513
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,272
Not well. We fell out.

514
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:17,980
We're never meeting again. Totally unreliable.

515
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,940
Then you'd better make more reliable friends.

516
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:28,560
 

517
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,920
Professional Accounting Practices.
Are you studying for the CPA?

518
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,140
You don't look like an accountant.
Should I call you Accountant Li?

519
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,320
Just browsing through it.

520
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,420
Just browsing? Or looking for
stable work because of me?

521
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,800
Aren't you leaving soon?

522
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,820
I'm staying with my grandma.

523
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Yeah, keep your grandma company.
I'll keep you company. Okay?

524
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,820
Aren't you returning to Jiangbei?

525
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,940
Will you miss me? Then I won't leave.

526
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,200
Ye Meng. I remember every word you've said.

527
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:22,660
So don't make promises you can't keep.
Don't appease me.

528
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,560
I'm not appeasing you.
Nobody can predict the future.

529
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,220
But right now, I don't plan to leave.

530
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,520
Alright.

531
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,720
 Jiang said you've been searching
for the seller of this thumb ring. 

532
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,680
 I happen to have information. Want the details? 

533
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,400
I have to go. Don't stay up too late.

534
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,200
Have the cake.

535
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,960
You're here. Sit.

536
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,320
No need. You said you heard about
the seller. What do you know?

537
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,240
Don't rush. Let's talk over drinks.

538
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,060
I'm in a hurry.

539
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,900
Your boyfriend is so controlling?

540
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,240
I know you found yourself a guy to provoke me.

541
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,000
It's unnecessary.

542
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,280
Come back with me. I'll pretend nothing happened.

543
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,100
Wang Xing Sheng.

544
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:16,160
The thumb ring seller was Wang Xing Sheng,
a former real estate developer

545
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,380
and an antiques collector.

546
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,600
Wang Xing Sheng? Where is he now?

547
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,240
In Jiangbei. I can contact him for "business".

548
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,220
Why are you out in this heavy rain?

549
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,520
Where were you so late?

550
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I met someone. Let's talk at home.

551
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,300
That person from the cafe again?

552
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,880
Didn't you say you fell out
and you'd never meet again?

553
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,390
I didn't want to.

554
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:00,020
But he texted me, claiming to have clues about my mom's thumb ring.

555
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,460
He's your former boss, huh?

556
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,880
Yeah.

557
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,100
Why didn't you tell me?

558
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,340
I didn't want to upset you.

559
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,100
Also, I need to go to Jiangbei.

560
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,220
For how long?

561
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,320
I'm not sure. He said he'll arrange the meeting.

562
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,900
I can look into my mom's suicide
once I meet that man.

563
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,960
I'll return as soon as I get some leads.

564
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,580
And if you never meet him?
Does that mean you won't come back?

565
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,220
Why would I stay there?

566
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,980
Don't you know
what your former boss wants from you?

567
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,480
He's luring you to Jiangbei with that thumb ring.

568
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,312
Why would he let you return easily?

569
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,740
I know what I'm doing.

570
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,500
So you never planned to discuss it?
You would just leave, huh?

571
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,200
I'm discussing it with you now.

572
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,420
It's not a discussion. It's a notification.

573
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,120
So what should I do? For an "unnecessary" relationship,

574
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,500
should I give up on my mom's case?

575
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,960
You heard what I said to Grandma in the hospital?

576
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,720
Yeah, I did.

577
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,700
I meant to tell you about my former boss visiting.

578
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,360
But you told your grandma that it's "unnecessary"
to make plans for this relationship.

579
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,440
That's not what I meant.

580
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,660
I was saying that I knew you wouldn't stay long in Ningsui.

581
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,020
So I didn't want to disrupt your future plans.

582
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,660
Is that the reason? Or do you find it unnecessary?

583
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,940
True. I've always chased after you.

584
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,920
Celebrating your birthday, confessing my feelings,

585
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,120
and posting nonsense on WeChat Moments.

586
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,040
But you? You're always ready to walk away.

587
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,640
So that's what you think, huh?

588
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,600
Does it matter? What matters is what you think.

589
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,160
Let's take some time apart.

590
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,340
 

591
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,320
How's the child? Does he still have a fever?

592
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,420
The fever's gone.

593
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,380
Monitor through the night.

594
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,640
Are you here alone? Where's the father?

595
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,180
My apologies, doctor. I'm the father.

596
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,800
Alright. Take turns watching him. It'll be easier.

597
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,560
- Keep the child hydrated.
- Got it.

598
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,280
Yeah, dip the wet cotton swabs on his lips.

599
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,360
- Got it.
- Alright.

600
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,820
- Thank you.
- It's fine. Look after the child.

601
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,280
How did he get gastritis? Did he have bad food?

602
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,340
Let me take over. Take a break.

603
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:42,980



604
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:57,826
