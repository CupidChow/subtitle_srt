 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:11,814
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

3
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:15,428
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

4
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:20,713
 ♫ With a sense of excitement You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:25,794
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:31,142
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:34,630
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,194
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:42,826
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:48,798
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:53,834
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,834 --> 00:01:01,114
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

13
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:05,914
 ♫ All I possess is drowned The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

14
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:11,178
 ♫ Has never changed If miracles could exist ♫ 

15
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:15,361
 ♫ Promises would be kept Please remember ♫ 

16
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:20,250
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,050
Deep Affectionate Eyes

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,080
 

19
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:37,910
Come on, let me take over. You rest.

20
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,960



21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,028
Now you come running here,
pretending to be a good dad.

22
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:51,948
Why didn't you answer
the teacher's call at noon today?

23
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:56,508
Another business dinner
you couldn't get out of, right?

24
00:01:57,128 --> 00:02:02,688
I know you resent me.
I'm neither a good father nor a good husband.

25
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:06,568
But you think I wanted to attend these dinners
and drinking sessions?

26
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:11,248
I've ended up in the hospital multiple times
from bootlicking and flattery.

27
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:12,688
Am I doing this for myself?

28
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:17,788
Jia Yu's classes, summer camps, and travels.
Do you know how much these cost?

29
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:19,468
The company's laying people off.

30
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:22,068
If I don't kiss up,
you'll have to support everything alone.

31
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:28,348
Fine. Let's sign the divorce papers tomorrow then.

32
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:33,748
I won't ask for alimony.
I just want custody of Jia Yu.

33
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,148
So you insist on taking this step?

34
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,088
Did I force this situation myself?

35
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:45,968
If we divorce, he'll become
a child of separated parents.

36
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:48,608
Won't his classmates mock him?

37
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:52,128
When he's sick or during school events,
other kids will have both parents.

38
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,248
Keep your voice down.

39
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:57,648
Won't he feel alone?

40
00:02:57,648 --> 00:03:02,528
Our small town's gossip will haunt him for life.

41
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:05,848
You suddenly care about these things.

42
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:13,308
I know this talk is pointless,
but think carefully.

43
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:17,248
What other men could love him like I do?

44
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,868
Consider our child. Give him a complete family.

45
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:23,548
Divorce isn't an impulsive decision.

46
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:25,148
Kai.

47
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,448
The test results are out.
Should we show the doctor?

48
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:31,308
Thanks.

49
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:33,848
As his father, I'll handle this.

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,928
Thank you for bringing Jia Yu
to the hospital, Kai.

51
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,288
Let me reimburse you for the expenses.

52
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,608
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

53
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:49,448
You're nobody to him.
My son's expenses aren't your concern.

54
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:51,568
Just tell me the amount.

55
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:53,568
I said no need.

56
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,228
Aren't you busy with your business?

57
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:03,428
Stop coming around.
People might get the wrong idea.

58
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:05,528
How dare you say that, Chen Jian!

59
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:09,068
Ignore him, Kai. Thank you again.

60
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:16,688
I'll head out now. Call me if you need anything.

61
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:20,108
Yes. Go back.

62
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:25,908
Always playing the saint.

63
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:28,388
- He kindly brought Jia Yu here.
- What's his business anyway?

64
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:30,088
Mom.

65
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:32,968
You're awake.

66
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,548
Awake. Take it slow.

67
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:36,568
How do you feel? Any discomfort?

68
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,208
Why are you here, Dad?

69
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,928
I came when I heard you were sick.

70
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:55,040
 

71
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:07,848
Chen Jian, disappearing act again?
How many times now?

72
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:27,828
Okay?

73
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,708
How's Jia Yu feeling?

74
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,388
Back to school full of energy.

75
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:41,568
You changed your mind because of Jia Yu?

76
00:05:57,548 --> 00:06:02,188
I sometimes despise myself.

77
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:06,688
I know Chen Jian will never change

78
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:11,468
and that his hospital act was all fake.

79
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:17,468
But would a complete family be better for Jia Yu?

80
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:22,460
With both biological parents,

81
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,760
he might develop better.

82
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:36,568
My marriage is ruined,
but my child shouldn't pay for it.

83
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:45,468
Ya En, I know you love Jia Yu.

84
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:49,308
But I want you to love yourself more.

85
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,608
He's so sensible.

86
00:06:54,608 --> 00:07:01,508
Seeing you staying with that man
hurts him more than your divorce.

87
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:09,420
Enough about me.

88
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,620
What about you and Li Jin Yu?

89
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:17,408
This cold war can't continue.

90
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:29,648
What should I do? Apologize to him and make up?

91
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:36,888
I always yield, but he never considers our future.

92
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:42,028
Though I shouldn't blame him.
I never planned either.

93
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:49,828
But seeing how easily he could
walk away breaks my heart.

94
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:52,948
Your pain is normal.

95
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:57,328
If you didn't care,
Li Jin Yu would be the devastated one.

96
00:07:57,328 --> 00:08:00,108
But I care too much.

97
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:06,308
Though I seem to hold the reins
in this relationship,

98
00:08:06,308 --> 00:08:10,008
his moods actually control me completely.

99
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:15,148
When we fight, I rehash
old grudges like an 18-year-old girl,

100
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:17,648
keeping score of who cares more.

101
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:24,748
At 18, you weren't this hesitant and insecure.

102
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:30,388
You've fallen deeper than I imagined.

103
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,488
Ye Meng went to see her ex-boss, that Gou...

104
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:40,148
Do you know him?

105
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:42,828
I saw him in her social media posts.

106
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:46,688
No wonder you were distracted that day
and just left me there.

107
00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:49,728
So you two had a fight?

108
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:58,488
Ye Meng has high standards. You barely beat me.

109
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:01,268
I think it's just coffee meetings.

110
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:03,428
Nothing serious. Relax. Here.

111
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:05,680
She wants to return to Jiangbei with him

112
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,848
to investigate her mother's case.

113
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:14,888
You can't stop her
and definitely shouldn't fight about this.

114
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:21,048
I was upset at first,
but our fight wasn't about that.

115
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:22,948
Then what was it about?

116
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:28,908
She thinks I don't want a lasting relationship.

117
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:32,088
But how do I prove it? With words?

118
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:36,388
The more I say, the more
it sounds like I'm tying her to Ningsui.

119
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:40,788
You think silence helps her?

120
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:45,568
I can't stand people
who can't express their feelings.

121
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:49,468
At least, you have someone to talk to. I don't.

122
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:53,648
You get chances to speak. It's about seizing them.

123
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:56,988
How should I seize them? Tell me.

124
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:02,368
Just speak up. Unless you're scared.

125
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:05,380
Scared?

126
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,380
Watch me.

127
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:18,470
 

128
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:25,990
 

129
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:31,670
 

130
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:44,168
Her divorce isn't finalized.
Would this affect her family?

131
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:45,688
I feel so guilty.

132
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,868
Where's this confidence coming from?

133
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:51,548
Don't take your bad mood out on me.

134
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:58,188
Cheers.

135
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:00,728
Enough. You've had too much.

136
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:05,028
You're wasted. Okay, no more drinks.

137
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:08,948
- What's wrong? 
 - Look, look.

138
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,588
What's this?

139
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:13,388
He hasn't messaged me all day.

140
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:15,128
What does he mean?

141
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:18,220
He wants to break up? Fine.

142
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,960
Let's break up.

143
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:25,148
If he's not messaging,
why don't you message first?

144
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:27,248
- Why should I message him?
- What's wrong?

145
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:29,188
- I won't.
- Why not?

146
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,508
A woman never admits defeat.

147
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:36,508
In relationships, you can't keep score like this.

148
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:39,848
The more you fuss, the more it shows you care.

149
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:41,508
- You message him.
- What should I say--

150
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:43,808
- Just send it!
- Look at you.

151
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,268
- Send, send!
- What should I write?

152
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,108
What's there to say? We've got nothing.

153
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:51,088
Just write "Ye Meng is drunk." Quick!

154
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:54,888
Okay, "Ye Meng's drunk." Then see if he cares.

155
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,528
She's in danger. Big danger.

156
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:57,888
- So childish.
- Hurry up!

157
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,988
Okay, okay, "big danger".

158
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:16,688
Is 'sorry' that hard to type?
You'll burn a hole in your phone.

159
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:18,848
Look who's talking.

160
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:26,628
Let's swap. I'll write yours, and you write mine.

161
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:30,728
Help me think of something meaningful
but not boring or intrusive.

162
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:36,688
Think.

163
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:48,388
 Ye Meng's drunk, insisting on going home. 

164
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:51,908
 I need to pick up Jia Yu. Go check on her. 

165
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:58,428
What about me when you leave?

166
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:03,588
You obviously care deeply,
but you pretend otherwise.

167
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,168
Why are you taking my phone again?

168
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:12,288
Boss, let me help. I'm a good writer.

169
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,928
Does this shop have any actual writers?

170
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:19,468
Women understand women best.

171
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:22,548
Let's do this.

172
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:24,588
Okay, let me think.

173
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,628
Don't thank me.
Just give a salary raise if this works.

174
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:33,688
Deal.

175
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,108
 How's Jia Yu? Did your divorce go through? 

176
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:39,108
 Not final. Stop asking. 

177
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:41,828
I...

178
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:48,588
Why's their divorce delayed again?

179
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,108
Will this ever end?

180
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:02,720
 

181
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,868
Ye Meng.

182
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:35,988
Li Jin Yu.

183
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,868
Go inside.

184
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:45,848
Come on.

185
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:11,948
Let me get you water.

186
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:13,948
No need.

187
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:22,688
You coldly ignored me all day.
Why the sudden concern?

188
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:26,308
How much did you drink?

189
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:32,648
Can't I drink when I'm upset?

190
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,510
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,480
I spoke too harshly that day.

192
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:50,048
Can't you comfort me?

193
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:56,468
Hug me.

194
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:12,668
I'm going to Jiangbei tomorrow.

195
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:19,688
Can we stop fighting?

196
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,108
Sleep early.

197
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,680
It's freezing. Why don't you go inside?

198
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:36,288
You went to Ye Meng's place?

199
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:38,468
She's drunk.

200
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,108
You had a quarrel?

201
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,808
No.

202
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:51,288
So you're upset about her Jiangbei trip?

203
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,948
That blabbermouth Qiao Mai Mai.

204
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,428
Stop changing the subject.

205
00:17:57,428 --> 00:18:03,528
She's just going to Jiangbei, not disappearing.
Don't make a scene here with that long face.

206
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:08,288
If you can't bear to let her go,
afraid she won't return,

207
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:12,388
tell her your feelings or go with her.

208
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:16,148
Li Ling Bai is in Jiangbei. I can't go back there.

209
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:26,228
I know about your family drama,
but Ye Meng doesn't.

210
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:29,508
Try seeing it from her perspective.
She's completely confused.

211
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,748
It's just a business trip.
Why are you being so sensitive?

212
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:39,108
Why does everyone think this is
about Jiangbei? It's really not.

213
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:44,308
I'm just angry with myself.

214
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:49,128
I used to drift through life
without planning for the future.

215
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,710
Now,

216
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,648
I finally regret not pushing harder to finish college.

217
00:18:57,648 --> 00:19:03,248
At least graduate and get a decent job to give her a stable future.

218
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:08,628
And she can't stay trapped in Ningsui forever.

219
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,628
Regrets? Claims about providing futures?

220
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:18,628
You men spout bullshit, so full of yourselves.

221
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:22,808
How would you know her thoughts without asking?

222
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:33,628
You're scared to ask. Afraid of being abandoned
like when you were young.

223
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:37,708
Trust Meng. She's not that woman.

224
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:49,428
And you're not helpless Ba Dou
from childhood anymore.

225
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:52,828
I'm sorry.

226
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:55,168
Got it.

227
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,848
I don't need it.

228
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:02,808
Don't catch a cold. Wake up now.

229
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,868
Go to bed early.

230
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:11,948
No staying up late.

231
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:13,748
Don't worry.

232
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:26,588
Relax, Mom. Just a few clothes.

233
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:43,148
Hello?

234
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:47,748
Flower delivery. Your order's here.
Should I leave it by the door?

235
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:51,228
Cancel the order.
If it can't be returned, just trash it.

236
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,728
I said delivery only, no--

237
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:57,468
You had a quarrel?

238
00:21:57,468 --> 00:21:59,948
N-nothing's wrong.

239
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:04,428
Then why the rush to leave?

240
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:07,028
It's not like I'm leaving forever.

241
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:11,128
When will you return? Can you promise me?

242
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,708
You're her neighbor?
Such nice flowers are going to waste.

243
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,288
Want them? Take them?

244
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:34,608
Delivery only, no moving.

245
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:44,732
 Gardener Li, since I'm bad at gardening, 

246
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:49,268
 the yard's your responsibility now. 

247
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:59,988
Now I truly understand Li's feelings.

248
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:05,128
Remember when I sent you to Jiangbei for college?

249
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:07,548
I thought you'd return after graduation.

250
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:10,868
I never imagined you'd stay away for ten years.

251
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:14,988
Didn't you dislike Li before? Now defending him?

252
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:17,028
She can't deny he's handsome.

253
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:22,568
But mainly because you love him.
Otherwise, she wouldn't even notice him.

254
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:25,148
Eat while it's hot.

255
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:29,508
That's worse. What if he doesn't feel the same?

256
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,168
Enough. I'm leaving.

257
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:35,608
You didn't eat a bite.

258
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:42,748
You eat, Mom.

259
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:59,508
 Ye Meng, what I meant to say today wasn't this. 

260
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:03,540
 I wanted to tell you before meeting you,  

261
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:07,196
 I hated this world. 

262
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:14,408
I shut everyone out until you appeared.

263
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:21,608
Then I realized I was not as broken as I thought.

264
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:27,408
 But today, at your home, 

265
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,228
 I realized I was still pushing everyone away 

266
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:42,548
while dragging you into my isolated world.

267
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:45,548
But your world shouldn't be like this.

268
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:53,348
That night at the beach,
I feared you'd approach me

269
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,440
because I knew

270
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,660
I'd fall for you.

271
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,928
No exceptions.

272
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:16,748
Sir, stop here, please.

273
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:28,732
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

274
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:32,246

276
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:44,108
 If you encounter a sick goldfish,
the best thing to do is to stay away from it. 

277
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:48,290
 Because it'll only drag you into the darkness.

279

 Happy New Year.

00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,788

284

 Your partner shouldn't be someone like me, 

285
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:28,048
 who can't watch fireworks with you
or celebrate New Year's Eve with your family.

 Don't tease me. When I love someone, it's forever.

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,308
 Funny, me too.

Li Jin Yu.

292
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,768
Why are you back?

293
00:29:04,548 --> 00:29:06,548
What are you doing here?

294
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:12,288
I thought you'd need at least two weeks.

295
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:14,668
Warmer weather then, perfect blooming season.

296
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:17,468
You'd see your dream courtyard.

297
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:23,408
Not sure if you'd like it.

298
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:28,620
 See? Beautiful, right, 

299
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,360
 Gardener Li? 

300
00:29:34,268 --> 00:29:38,968
But I hoped by then you'd have cooled down.

301
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:46,028
This must be your dream home vision.

302
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:48,228
At least, for the flowers' sake--

303
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:49,928
Li Jin Yu.

304
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:57,428
Marry me?

305
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:07,008
Ya En says marriage is a gamble.
Want to bet with me?

306
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:12,708
What's this reaction? Were you just playing me?

307
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:16,528
I know I'm being irrational
and a bit confused right now, but...

308
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:36,568
I'm sorry I didn't prepare a ring.
These flowers will have to do for now.

309
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:42,988
But I think marriage proposals
should be done by the man.

310
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:50,728
This isn't just some fling for me.
I've genuinely fallen for you.

311
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:58,108
Ye Meng, will you marry me?

312
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:03,908
Yes, I will.

313
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:46,608
 
Congratulations.

314
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:48,308
Thank you.

315
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:18,068
I need to use the restroom.

316
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:40,628
Hello?

317
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:43,428
 Hey, what's this? Getting cold feet? 

318
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,488
No, I'm just really nervous.

319
00:32:46,488 --> 00:32:49,528
What's with you two?
This is straight out of a drama.

320
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:53,388
Breaking up yesterday, getting married today?

321
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:58,128
Such a plot twist. Did Li Jin Yu
take a bullet for you or something?

322
00:32:58,128 --> 00:33:00,528
Seriously, I can't wrap my head around this.

323
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:03,828
If you're confused, imagine how I feel.

324
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:07,368
Half impulse, half just feeling right, I guess.

325
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:11,048
When I saw him building that flower wall
at my place today,

326
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:17,208
I felt this certainty,
like every word answered, every promise kept.

327
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:20,408
All our past conflicts
suddenly didn't matter anymore.

328
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:25,928
Well, crazy matches crazy.
You two deserve each other.

329
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:27,388
Are you still going to Jiangbei?

330
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:30,808
I have to. The flight is at 6:30 AM tomorrow.

331
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,968
Does he know?

332
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:37,828
Not sure how to tell him,
but we're getting registered now.

333
00:33:37,828 --> 00:33:40,628
What's he gonna do?
He just needs some sweet-talking later.

334
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:46,368
Fine. At least enjoy your wedding night.
Smooth things over then.

335
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:49,008
I'm all jittery. I need to
sort myself out. Let's talk later.

336
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:50,348
 Don't be nervous. 

337
00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:51,948
Bye.

338
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:08,648
Our turn?

339
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:46,908
Don't worry. I'm here.

340
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,488
What are you doing?

341
00:34:52,728 --> 00:34:54,448
You seem nervous.

342
00:34:54,448 --> 00:34:56,848
I'm not that nervous.

343
00:34:57,688 --> 00:34:59,288
Let's go.

344
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:03,748
 

345
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:06,748
Please recite your vows, newlyweds.

346
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:11,788
Wedding vow...

347
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,508
One, two, three.

348
00:35:14,508 --> 00:35:16,908
- Wedding vows.
- Wedding oath.

349
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,408
- The oath. 
 - Sorry, sorry.

350
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:24,948
Wedding oath, we willingly
become husband and wife.

351
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:30,928
Hereafter we'll face life's challenges together.

352
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,440
In good times and bad,

353
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,928
we're both in this together,

354
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:47,448
sharing joys and sorrows, together for life.

355
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:53,448
Sworn by Li Jin Yu.

356
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:56,928
Ye Meng.

357
00:35:58,148 --> 00:36:01,788
Congratulations. Newlyweds, look here, please.

358
00:36:18,368 --> 00:36:21,508
Have something warm to drink.

359
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:25,028
What's so funny?

360
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:29,378
You. Look how sweet you look in the photo.

361
00:36:29,378 --> 00:36:35,328
When I first met you, I thought
you were a player with many girls following you.

362
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:39,968
Want my WeChat?

363
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:46,008
You're the real player here, snagging me in days.

364
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:51,888
Not completely settled yet. One thing left.

365
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:01,008
Just like that, we're officially married.

366
00:37:01,008 --> 00:37:03,848
Not impulse. Our kids will take his surname.

367
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:11,708
Marriage isn't just your business.
It concerns both families.

368
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,868
How could you decide so recklessly?

369
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,268
You didn't even inform us first!

370
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,588
That's why I came to tell you personally.

371
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:22,388
Fine, you know now. We're leaving.

372
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:32,708
Let's go before they process this.
Avoid the lectures.

373
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,310
Wait.

374
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:38,268
We can't just leave
after dropping this marriage bomb.

375
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:41,548
Wait here. Let me talk to them.

376
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:47,228
Great acting earlier. It totally fooled me.

377
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:49,388
Yeah, you should win an Oscar!

378
00:37:49,388 --> 00:37:52,868
Fill them up! Finally married!

379
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:54,868
Grandma.

380
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:06,848
Grandma, aunts.

381
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,748
I'll devote myself to Meng's well-being.
You have my word.

382
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:14,408
Actually, kids taking
the Ye surname is fine by me.

383
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:17,168
It depends whether Ye Meng likes it.

384
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:22,848
I'll take my leave then. Goodbye.

385
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,768
So touching.

386
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:32,628
 ♪ Beat the gongs now ♪ 

387
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:34,188
Our Meng is so blessed.

388
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:40,028
 ♪ Meng's finally married ♪ 

389
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,928
Cheers!

390
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:47,888
How was that?

391
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,580
..

392
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:59,428
It's... they're different from what I imagined.

393
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:02,168
Different? How?

394
00:39:03,848 --> 00:39:06,128
It's fine. Let's go.

395
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:52,120
High five!

396
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,360
Here, let me help.

397
00:39:58,008 --> 00:39:59,228
Feel good, bro?

398
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:01,088
Sure!

399
00:40:02,328 --> 00:40:05,108
Why haven't you come to see me lately?

400
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:11,988
My shop's been busy. It'll ease up soon.

401
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:16,168
I thought you were worried
about my parents like me.

402
00:40:16,168 --> 00:40:19,488
Seems they're not divorcing after all.

403
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:26,548
Jia Yu, I know you're a sensible kid.

404
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:33,528
But focus on being happy.
Don't let adult problems weigh on you.

405
00:40:33,528 --> 00:40:34,848
Mom's doing this for me.

406
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:40,488
But I don't need them pretending
everything's fine.

407
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:45,288
Playing along exhausts me.

408
00:40:50,568 --> 00:40:56,848
Call me anytime if you're upset or tired.

409
00:40:56,848 --> 00:40:59,068
If you need help, I'll come running.

410
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:00,948
Let the adults deal with their own worries.

411
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:03,268
You just focus on staying happy every day.

412
00:41:03,268 --> 00:41:05,528
Alright, let's go another round.

413
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:08,168
- Okay, let's go. 
 - Go.

414
00:41:11,248 --> 00:41:14,608
I hope you stay happy forever.

415
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:36,288
What time's your flight tomorrow?

416
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:43,368
Rescheduled to 6:30 AM tomorrow.

417
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:49,388
Don't be mad at me.

418
00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:56,500
Li Jin Yu, it's our first day of marriage.

419
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,560
You can't spend it angry with me, can you?

420
00:42:01,948 --> 00:42:04,448
Don't you think about anything else?

421
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:07,548
No.

422
00:42:11,308 --> 00:42:13,450
Tell me,

423
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:20,080
are you shy? We're already married.

424
00:42:22,968 --> 00:42:27,808
Have you been thinking about that this whole time?

425
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:34,708
You got the order wrong.
I fell for you first, and then...

426
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:50,030



427
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:23,286
