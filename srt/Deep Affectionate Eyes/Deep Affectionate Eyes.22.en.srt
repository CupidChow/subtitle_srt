2
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,920
So, how do you like my work
of your hair and makeup?

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,360
I like it a lot.

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,680
Come here. Let me take a look.

5
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
You are the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
What's this?
Are you about to cry? Don't you dare!

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,520
I worked too hard on your makeup
to let it get ruined now.

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm just too happy.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,120
Got it. Here.

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,520
Look at the two of us.

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,280
It's not like you're doing much better.

12
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,960
Happy wedding, my darling.

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,200
In the future, you'll take on many roles.

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,080
Wife, mother.

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,560
But to me, you'll always be

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,880
that happy child who does
whatever her heart desires.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,480
Alright, Fang Ya'en.

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,200
I'll always be by your side, you know?

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,920
And I'll be by yours too.

20
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,080
No, be careful!

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,600
Don't think I don't know. I can tell

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
what Cheng Kairan is thinking.
How do you feel about it?

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,840
There's really nothing between us.

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,000
Besides,

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,040
I honestly haven't even considered
starting a new relationship.

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,600
Is it because of Jiayu?

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
Not entirely.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,680
To be honest,

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,560
it just feels really awkward.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,760
Kai used

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,320
to like you, right?

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,320
Yeah? And now suddenly,
he's acting this way toward me.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,480
I just find it really strange.
No. It doesn't feel right.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,320
What kind of mess is this?

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,120
It wasn't me he liked.
He took me for someone else.

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,800
Don't dismiss him
because of such absurd reasons, okay?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
Anyway, I'm doing pretty well

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
right now. I just want
to keep things simple and low-key.

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,560
But don't overthink it, okay?

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,960
Alright.

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Today is your big day. I get it.

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
People…

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,200
should still believe in love, right?

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,320
That's right, Ya'en.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,920
You'll definitely find
the happiness that's meant for you.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,040
DOUBLE HAPPINESS

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,000
Close the door!

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
- Ladies, go easy on us!
- Open the door!

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,040
Dear ladies, please go easy on us!

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
If you want to take the bride away,
you'll have to get through us first.

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,680
- Listen up for the challenge!
- Challenge set!

52
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,160
- Here comes the challenge!
- Challenge set!

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,720
You have 20 seconds

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,640
to come up with ten
affectionate nicknames for the bride.

55
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,640
- Ready? Go!
- This is way too difficult!

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,080
- Why are you in such a hurry?
- Ladies.

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,680
Meng.

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,680
- Louder!
- Wifey.

59
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,080
Um…

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,640
Can I just give you
red envelopes to skip this?

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,880
- No!
- No way!

62
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,960
- Affectionate nicknames!
- Beautiful!

63
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,680
- Exactly!
- Gorgeous!

64
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,480
Next question! Change it up!

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,240
- Red envelope!
- Hurry!

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,560
Wow, that's quite a lot!

67
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,560
Yep!

68
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,880
Now for the second question!

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,680
Tell us about your most memorable moment

70
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,960
during your relationship.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,920
I pushed you into getting married!

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,480
- You…
- None of your business! I was asking him.

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
You traitor!

74
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,160
Speak.

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,120
- Hurry up and think of one!
- Think of one!

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,720
Whatever the affectionate nickname is,
as long as it's from you, anything works.

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,440
You never pressured me into marriage
or chased me relentlessly.

78
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,520
It was I who expressed
my feelings early on.

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,360
I said I knew I would
definitely fall in love with you.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,960
So, dear fairies,
is this answer acceptable?

81
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,240
Let us in!

82
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,600
The red envelopes are packed full.
I've got money now!

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
- Right!
- Good!

84
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,200
- Red envelope!
- We want red envelopes!

85
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,240
- We're way too kind!
- Get inside, now! Go!

86
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,680
Go! Red envelope!

87
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,240
Red envelope! Ladies!

88
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,960
- Here!
- Grabbing so fast?

89
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,080
They're all gone!

90
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
DOUBLE HAPPINESS

91
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,400
The bride and groom
will now serve tea to the father.

92
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,480
Dad, have some tea.

93
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Dad, please have some tea.

94
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,240
Here, take it.

95
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,280
Thank you, Dad.

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,760
Mom.

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,000
The bride and groom will now serve tea
to the elders from both families.

98
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,240
- Granny, please have some tea.
- Grandma, please have some tea.

99
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
Be careful.

100
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,080
It's sweet.

101
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,680
Here, this is from Grandma.

102
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,520
- Thank you, Granny.
- Wishing you a lifetime of harmony

103
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,320
and an early arrival
of your precious child.

104
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,040
Yes. Make it quick.

105
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
- Come here.
- Aunts.

106
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,560
Slow down.

107
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,800
- Big Aunt.
- Big Aunt.

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
May your hearts be forever united.

109
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
- Middle Aunt.
- Middle Aunt.

110
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,080
May you have great wealth and prosperity.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,360
From now on, all the money
will be managed by our Meng.

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
- Got it?
- No problem. Absolutely.

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,320
Little Aunt.

114
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
- Little Aunt.
- What?

115
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,000
- Little Aunt!
- Little Aunt!

116
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,640
Here. Be good to our Meng.

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,400
May you always
be happy and sweet together.

118
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,360
- Thank you.
- Definitely. Don't worry.

119
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,720
Is that enough? Should we switch
to the Western style now?

120
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
- Western style.
- Yes, go change into your outfits.

121
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,560
- Change clothes.
- Go! Hurry!

122
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,040
- I'm going to change then.
- Go ahead!

123
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,560
- Go quickly.
- Come here.

124
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,760
Granny will hold them for you.

125
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,600
- What about that other bag?
- Here's another one!

126
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
- Bring it here.
- Take them all.

127
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,040
- Warm them up.
- Hurry up!

128
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,600
DOUBLE HAPPINESS

129
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,600
Meng,

130
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,559
live happily with Jinyu.

131
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,520
Jinyu, she's in your hands now.

132
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,040
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll definitely take good care of Meng.

133
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,680
- The most beautiful!
- Beautiful!

134
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,640
So beautiful, Meng!

135
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,040
Hurry, look. So gorgeous!

136
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,760
- Beautiful!
- Dear family,

137
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,640
friends, and neighbors,

138
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
welcome to the wedding

139
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
of Mr. Li Jinyu and Ms. Ye Meng!

140
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,520
I'm today's bridesmaid, and I'll also
be serving as your part-time emcee.

141
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,720
And, of course, I am absolutely
the number one witness to this love story.

142
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,160
Do you know when I first noticed

143
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,800
the groom had fallen for the bride?

144
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
- When was it?
- When?

145
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,480
It was after I stunned everyone

146
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,680
with my singing at the Gem gathering.

147
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,040
At that time, Ye Meng happened
to be away from Ningsui for something.

148
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,040
My brother sat in the yard reading a book,

149
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,760
but he spent the whole afternoon without
turning a single page. Right, Granny?

150
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,160
Yes. Spacing out.

151
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,320
He just couldn't focus.
Sat there all alone the entire day.

152
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,280
So, I asked him,

153
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,680
"What's on your mind?"

154
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,960
Ye Meng, you know what my brother said?

155
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,480
Tell it properly.

156
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,400
He said, "There's a palace
of memories in my mind.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,520
I want to place you inside,

158
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,520
so that whenever
I close my eyes, I can see you."

159
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,600
Qiao Maimai, I didn't say that.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,360
It's pretty much what he meant.

161
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
- Nonsense.
- Didn't you say it?

162
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,240
- My brother said he really missed you.
- That's true.

163
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,720
Ye Meng, what I really mean is that vows

164
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,480
and promises aren't what matter most.
But as an outsider, I can see clearly

165
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,080
my brother truly, deeply loves you.
He will definitely treat you well.

166
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,640
Right, groom?
It's your turn to say a few words.

167
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,320
it's time to tell her your love
and heartfelt affections.

168
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,120
- Come on.
- Say a few words!

169
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,960
- Say a few words, Li Jinyu!
- Say a few words!

170
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,120
I've already…

171
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,760
said so much,

172
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,520
but today…

173
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,840
I want to thank you
for your patience with me.

174
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,480
You once told me

175
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,560
that the world never meant me any harm.

176
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,600
I never believed that before.

177
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,960
But now, I'm learning to believe it,

178
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,480
to feel this world,

179
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,440
because I've already met my moon.

180
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,360
Ye Meng.

181
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,520
The luckiest thing

182
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,080
in my life has been meeting you.

183
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,320
I may not have been
the best partner in the past,

184
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
but from now on,

185
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,400
I will strive

186
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,320
to be a worthy husband.

187
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,120
- Good! Worthy!
- Good!

188
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
Good!

189
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,600
- Good!
- Good!

190
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
I believe my brother
will definitely be a good husband.

191
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,880
Now, bride,

192
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,280
do you have anything
you'd like to say to the groom?

193
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,960
The first time I met Li Jinyu,

194
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,840
I thought to myself,

195
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,560
how could there be someone in this world
who fits my ideal type so perfectly?

196
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,280
I raised him well!

197
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,560
- Such a crush!
- Well done, Granny! Good Granny!

198
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,640
I really feel so lucky

199
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,960
because I quit my job
and still met my crush.

200
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,400
- What?
- But deep down, I've always known.

201
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,640
- The one who makes her heart skip.
- I'm an incredibly lucky person

202
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,960
because there are
so many people who love me.

203
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,720
And today,

204
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
that circle has grown by one more.

205
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Li Jinyu,

206
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,880
from now on,
my family will be your family.

207
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,120
My friends will be your friends.

208
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,160
And every bit of love and luck I receive,

209
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,680
I'll share with you.

210
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,880
- Good!
- Good!

211
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,760
Alright.

212
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,160
Now, it's time

213
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,400
to hand over
to our very own Ms. Dou Juhua.

214
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
She's been itching
to grab the mic from me.

215
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
- Come on up, Granny!
- Granny Tou!

216
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,440
- Let's hear it!
- Granny Tou!

217
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,120
I was afraid I'd get too excited

218
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
and forget what I wanted to say,

219
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,160
so I even prepared
a little notebook last night.

220
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,760
Meng, the first time I saw you,

221
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,960
I knew right away

222
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,320
that you were meant to be
my precious granddaughter-in-law.

223
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,200
Good!

224
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,960
- That's what we call fate, isn't it?
- Yes.

225
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,160
That's right. You were never getting away.
I knew it the moment I laid eyes on you.

226
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,320
So beautiful. Just stunning.

227
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,560
I didn't even want to blink.
I just wanted to keep looking at her.

228
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,160
So gorgeous. Exactly like that.

229
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,640
Let me tell you, Badou has a few flaws.

230
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,320
He's a bit timid,

231
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
tends to worry too much,

232
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,720
and keeps things bottled up.

233
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,120
But today, I saw my own grandson

234
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,440
truly become a man of responsibility.
Isn't that right?

235
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,240
- Right!
- Right!

236
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,560
- Right!
- Right!

237
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,040
This is also thanks to Meng

238
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,560
for being able to understand him

239
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,240
and accept him as he is.
I owe you my thanks.

240
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,800
And from now on,
you two must live well together.

241
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
If Badou doesn't behave, just tell Granny.

242
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,040
- Alright.
- Right.

243
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,720
From now on, Badou, learn from Granny.
Fear nothing, hold nothing back,

244
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,160
and speak your mind.
Okay, I've said enough.

245
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,480
Come on,

246
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,920
Meilan, you say something now.

247
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,600
Look at you crying. Is it because
I spoke too well and moved you?

248
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,840
Come on. Say a few words.

249
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,560
- I won't speak.
- Mom, say something.

250
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,400
Don't cry. It's a day of celebration.

251
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,440
- I'd like to speak for my family.
- Go ahead.

252
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,560
Actually,

253
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,400
I just have one thing to say.

254
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,760
May you live a long

255
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,680
and happy life together.

256
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,960
Jinyu,

257
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,600
she's my only daughter,

258
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,600
the one I've cherished like a treasure.

259
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,400
If you ever treat her wrong,
I won't let you off easy.

260
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,600
That's right. None of us will let you off.

261
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,640
And me too.

262
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,080
Don't worry, Dad.

263
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,680
Believe me, my brother
will definitely do well. Right?

264
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,120
- Right.
- Right.

265
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,440
Alright, now we move on to the most sacred

266
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,320
and romantic part, the vows.

267
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,880
First,

268
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,680
let's welcome the most adorable
little gentleman in the entire universe,

269
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,480
Chen Jiayu,

270
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,280
to bring the rings to the couple.

271
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,040
- Good!
- Good!

272
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,720
- Good!
- Good!

273
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,840
Groom, do you take

274
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,520
Ye Meng

275
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,400
to be your wife,

276
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,720
to love and to cherish,

277
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,040
from this day forward,

278
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,320
for better or for worse,

279
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,440
for richer or for poorer,

280
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,720
in sickness and in health,

281
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,240
until death do you part?

282
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,200
I do.

283
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,360
- Good!
- Lovely!

284
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,280
Bride,

285
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,040
do you take Li Jinyu

286
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,200
to be your husband,

287
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,560
to love and to cherish,

288
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,240
from this day forward,

289
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,400
for better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer,

290
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,680
in sickness and in health,

291
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,520
- until death do you part?
- I do.

292
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Louder!

293
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,600
I do!

294
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,920
Then, please exchange rings.

295
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
Now,

296
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,920
the groom may kiss the bride.

297
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,840
- Kiss her!
- Kiss!

298
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,080
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

299
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,400
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

300
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,120
Kiss!

301
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,280
Good.

302
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,800
Good.

303
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
One more.

304
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,000
We're married!

305
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,880
Wait, hold on.

306
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,280
Okay. Beautiful? Good?

307
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,520
Beautiful? Good? Okay.

308
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,080
Today, Ye Meng is getting married.
What would you like to say?

309
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,480
It feels like
I'm marrying off my own daughter.

310
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,200
So happy!

311
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,600
Of course, there's a bit of sadness.

312
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,240
Happy?

313
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Of course, I'm happy.

314
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,120
After all, she's my only daughter. Right?

315
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,720
A reminder for Meng.

316
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,040
A woman must be financially independent.

317
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,440
Always keep control of your own finances.

318
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,400
I thought today would be full of joy,

319
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,400
but…

320
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,160
there's also a touch of sadness.

321
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,640
Are you thinking of Fang Ya'en?

322
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
It just feels so sweet.

323
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,640
Wishing her happiness
and a fulfilling life.

324
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,240
Wishing you both a lifetime together
filled with joy and carefree days.

325
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
My brother has always been a good man.

326
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,600
- I feel at ease now.
- My suggestion

327
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,040
is that you still need
to give each other space.

328
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,360
And have lots of babies. Have several.

329
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,280
I'll help take care of them.
Big Aunt will help you.

330
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,040
I'd like to…

331
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,280
say to Fang Ya'en,

332
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,680
please think it over carefully.

333
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,600
But I still feel… a bit burdened.

334
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,120
I think it's better to stay friends.

335
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,440
But as for the future, I don't know yet.

336
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,640
I haven't said anything definite,
nor have I made any promises.

337
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,880
Kai, thank you.

338
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,680
I feel like every day spent with you
has been really happy.

339
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,640
Yes. Today, when I heard
Granny say those words,

340
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,680
it suddenly hit me. I don't want
to have any regrets in this life either.

341
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,320
I want to be a brave person too.

342
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,360
So, I've decided to retake
the college entrance exams

343
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,080
and keep pursuing my music.

344
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,120
Still playing rock music?

345
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,560
Not necessarily.

346
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,240
Gou, don't be sad.

347
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
You still have me.

348
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,600
- Honey.
- What's wrong?

349
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,360
When are you going to fix
this bathroom door?

350
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,520
It's really inconvenient.

351
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,800
I'll fix it tomorrow. I forgot.

352
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,920
Deal.

353
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,040
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at photos.

354
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,280
My wife is so beautiful.

355
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,200
Just realized that now?

356
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,520
Blushing?

357
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,840
What blushing?
It's just that the bedsheet is too red.

358
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
it's reflecting.

359
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,760
I didn't expect the cheeky you
to actually be blushing now.

360
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,600
When have I ever been cheeky?
What do you mean by that?

361
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,600
My husband is so handsome.

362
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,080
Got something for you.

363
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,360
- What is it?
- Open it and see.

364
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,440
The puzzle I hid?

365
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,480
Why?

366
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,000
I used to always feel like

367
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
I was that missing puzzle piece.

368
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,160
It wasn't until I met you

369
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,480
that I felt complete.

370
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,840
Really?

371
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,440
So, you never had feelings
for any other girl before?

372
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,880
Not even during your adolescence,
weren't you curious about anyone else?

373
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,720
Maybe, possibly.

374
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,440
But if you're talking about real feelings,

375
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,040
then no, never.

376
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,320
Really?

377
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,520
So, you never thought about
pursuing another girl

378
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,000
or having someone else be your girlfriend,

379
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,760
like what we have now?

380
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,160
I swear, it's only ever been you.

381
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,920
Your words keep getting sweeter.

382
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,840
No, they're not.

383
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,880
Actually, that day at the beach,

384
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,960
when you asked for my WeChat,

385
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,200
I dreamed about you after I got back.

386
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,360
I know.

387
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,080
You know?

388
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,680
How could you possibly know?

389
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,160
Why wouldn't I be able to know?

390
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,400
Do you still remember Ping'an's dashcam?

391
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
It has been lost,
and you didn't even believe me back then.

392
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,720
I found it.

393
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,000
On New Year's Eve, I heard everything

394
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,560
you said to me.

395
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,560
You…

396
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,520
heard everything?

397
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,560
Li Jinyu,

398
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,280
if you had sent me that message back then,

399
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,320
we wouldn't have had
to go around in circles for so long.

400
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,160
Luckily, even now,
I still haven't lost you.

401
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,120
What are you doing?

402
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,440
Didn't someone always say
I wasn't proactive enough?

403
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,200
Now that I'm a married man,

404
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,520
I've got to step up my game.

405
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,960
YA, STYLE IN TIME

406
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,200
We're here. Jiayu.

407
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,520
Wake up.

408
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,400
He's out cold.

409
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,400
- I can't wake him.
- It's fine. I've got this.

410
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,920
You're home.

411
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,840
Is it okay?

412
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,960
Sorry for the trouble today, Kai.

413
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,680
He's so heavy,
and you still carried him all the way up.

414
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,080
No problem. He's not even
as heavy as my dumbbells yet.

415
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,160
But he'll definitely get heavier.

416
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,520
From now on,
leave the heavy lifting to me.

417
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,560
Alright, I wouldn't dare trouble you.

418
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,920
Now that you're a big boss

419
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,280
and even took on the Hailan Port project,

420
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,840
you'll be swamped.
I wouldn't want to add to your chaos.

421
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,640
How could that be called chaos?

422
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Nothing is more important
than you and Jiayu.

423
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
Look at you. Now that
you're a big boss, it really shows.

424
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,200
Even your EQ has gone up.

425
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,880
Fine, in the future,

426
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,800
when you want to hang out
with your buddy Jiayu,

427
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,120
I won't stop you. How's that?

428
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Fang Ya'en,

429
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,120
how long are you going
to keep playing dumb?

430
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,320
What? Who's playing dumb?

431
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,920
You're calling me by my full name.
No respect anymore, huh?

432
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Get going. Go back.

433
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,840
Seriously, attending Ye Meng's wedding,

434
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,400
I think it made you stupid.

435
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm serious.

436
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
Before, when your divorce
wasn't finalized,

437
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,480
- I didn't feel right saying anything.
- Then just don't say it.

438
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,120
I'm going to say it.

439
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,080
Fang Ya'en,

440
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I like you.

441
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,520
I don't want to always
just be your little brother.

442
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,680
I know you're going
through a lot right now.

443
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,120
Ever since we were kids,

444
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,400
you've either hit me,
scolded me, or lectured me.

445
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,040
But now I don't even know
what's wrong with me.

446
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,880
I just can't help it. I like you.

447
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,000
Every time I think about
how you saved my life…

448
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,120
There's no such thing.

449
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,280
Back in senior year,

450
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,080
in the alley behind the school,

451
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,000
there was a kid
who was almost beaten to death,

452
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
and you saved him.

453
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,840
That kid was me.

454
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,600
I didn't use to think
too seriously about it back then.

455
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,080
But after I found out
it was you who saved me,

456
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,240
I started getting

457
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,960
to know you for real.

458
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,080
Kai, we're not right for each other.

459
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,760
What do you mean not right?

460
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,480
The peaceful life you want now,

461
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,160
the simple daily routine,

462
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,120
that's exactly the life
I want to share with you.

463
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
I've never been ambitious.

464
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,160
I just want to stay in Ningsui
for the rest of my life.

465
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
In the future,
we can finish our morning workout,

466
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,520
go to the market for groceries,
come home to cook,

467
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,560
and after dinner, take walks by the sea

468
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
to digest.

469
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,720
And when Jiayu is a bit older,
we can go on road trips ourselves.

470
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,960
Kai, now I…

471
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,280
I… I know what you're going to say.

472
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,760
You just got divorced

473
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,440
and don't want anything new right now.

474
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
But it's okay.

475
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,400
I'll wait.

476
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,080
I'll keep waiting.

477
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,760
I really like you so much.

478
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,160
Please don't reject me too quickly.

479
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,240
Just think carefully about what I've said.

480
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,120
I'll go now.

481
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,240
NINGSUI SEAFOOD

482
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,640
<i>How could that be called chaos?</i>

483
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,600
<i>Nothing is more important</i>
<i>than you and Jiayu.</i>

484
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,040
<i>Before, when your divorce</i>
<i>wasn't finalized,</i>

485
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,960
<i>I didn't feel right saying anything.</i>
<i>I'm afraid of disturbing you.</i>

486
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,760
- <i>Then just don't say it.</i>
- <i>I'm going to say it.</i>

487
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
<i>Fang Ya'en,</i>

488
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,800
<i>I like you.</i>

489
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,320
<i>I've never been ambitious.</i>

490
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,520
<i>I just want to stay in Ningsui</i>

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,480
<i>Just think carefully about what I've said.</i>

500
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,560
<i>I'll wait. I'll keep waiting.</i>

501
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,280
Slow down.

502
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,440
If I didn't know this was a hospital,

503
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,400
I'd think I was moving house.

504
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,440
Better to bring too much than too little.

505
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,000
Otherwise, we'd have
to go back and get it.

506
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,840
Alright.

507
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,280
Seems like whatever I say now
is useless anyway.

508
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,120
We'll do it your way.

509
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,520
Here, put on these slippers.

510
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,600
I've already packed all your things.

511
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,200
And I've put the food in the cabinet.

512
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,400
Also,

513
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,000
- all the other stuff…
- Alright.

514
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,280
I know this hospital better than you do.

515
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,360
You and Meng are busy, right?

516
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,280
Well,

517
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,760
you two go back and focus on your work.

518
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,760
Just seeing you annoys me.

519
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,400
I've just married into the family,
and you already can't stand me?

520
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,400
Don't you know distance
makes the heart grow fonder?

521
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,120
You'd get tired of the flowers
if you stayed with it every single day.

522
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,360
Of course, you're prettier than flowers.

523
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,320
Alright, now hurry up and go.

524
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,320
Hello.

525
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,120
<i>Something's happened at Hailan Port.</i>
<i>Get to the company now, Jinyu.</i>

526
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,080
<i>Hurry!</i>

527
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,280
<i>Listen, the place</i>
<i>is full of people demanding money.</i>

528
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,960
<i>Come quickly!</i>

529
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,800
Something came up at the company.
We have to go.

530
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,920
Granny, we're heading out.

531
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,280
- Maimai, I left the meal over there.
- Okay.

532
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,680
- Heading out.
- Bye.

533
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,440
Eat first.

534
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,160
I'll keep playing.

535
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,560
- Give us an explanation!
- You're an unethical business!

536
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,400
- Hurry up!
- Give me an explanation!

537
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,520
Everyone, please stop arguing. We've
already reported this to the company.

538
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,360
Please stay calm and stop the noise, okay?

539
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,240
- Stop the noise!
- Everyone, listen to me.

540
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,160
Hailan Port has had issues before.

541
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,800
They've been involved
in fraudulent fundraising.

542
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,440
And now there's this matter
of swapping materials.

543
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,320
Today, they must give us an explanation.

544
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,280
- Right!
- Right!

545
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,600
- Give us an explanation!
- We must get an answer today!

546
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,280
It seems to me that all your projects
were obtained through illegal methods,

547
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,760
specifically designed
to cheat us ordinary people.

548
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,240
Today, if you don't give us
a proper explanation,

549
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,720
you're not allowed to start work.

550
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,640
- Right, no starting work!
- Everyone, please calm down first!

551
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
Calm down!

552
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,560
- Kai, what's going on?
- What happened?

553
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,200
A wall collapsed at the construction site
this morning and broke a worker's leg.

554
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,840
Then someone dug up
the old Hailan Port scandal again.

555
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,960
Everyone's furious
and demanding an explanation.

556
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,280
They're here! The boss is here!

557
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,680
Don't move! Everyone, stay calm!

558
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,120
Speak one at a time!

559
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,800
Let's talk this through properly.
Everyone, just stay calm.

560
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
‪How can I calm down?

561
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,160
Ningsui Police Station.

562
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,600
We received a report

563
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,920
that Hailan Port is involved
in using non-compliant materials,

564
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,320
resulting in casualties.

565
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
You'll need to cooperate
with our investigation. Come with us.

566
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,800
No problem.

567
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Chen,

568
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,120
this hasn't been fully investigated yet.
You can't just take him away.

569
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,000
What, you want to come along too?

570
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,000
Kai!

571
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,640
Officer Chen, we did not use
any non-compliant materials.

572
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,760
Could there be some misunderstanding?

573
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,920
I know.

574
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
If they really haven't done anything
wrong, nothing will happen to them.

575
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,240
Don't worry.

576
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,240
It's just for the investigation.
I'll go and come back soon.

577
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,960
- You have my word.
- But…

578
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,520
Take care of yourself,
and look after Granny too.

579
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,080
Let's go.

580
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,440
- Mr. Li has been taken away now.
- What do we do now?

581
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,120
Alright, everyone. The police
have now begun an investigation.

582
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,240
Please go home.

583
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,640
Once we have results,
it will be announced to the public.

584
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Please go home.

585
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,080
Well then, we'll wait for your update.

586
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,720
- Yes!
- Right.

587
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,160
- <i>You must give us an explanation!</i>
- <i>You can't just bully us ordinary people!</i>

588
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,080
We are here for justice.

589
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,680
- Someone is standing up for us.
- Right.

590
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,920
- Trust them.
- They're not getting away with this.

591
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,480
- Back to work. Nothing to see here.
- Okay.

592
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,600
Okay, Ms. Ye.

593
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,280
- What about the worker?
- He's fine now. Don't worry.

594
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,120
There's something wrong
with this situation.

595
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,320
There's no way
we used non-compliant materials.

596
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,840
Every construction plan
and architectural design

597
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,400
was reviewed and approved
by every department.

598
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,120
Now that something has happened,

599
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,120
public opinion has completely shifted.

600
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,679
So you're saying someone
is deliberately causing trouble?

601
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,360
That's a possibility.

602
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,560
- Hello.
- <i>Have you seen the news?</i>

603
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,320
<i>Li Lingbai is holding</i>
<i>a press conference tomorrow.</i>

604
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,280
What?

605
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,080
What's wrong?

606
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,840
Li Lingbai is hosting a press conference.
We need to get to the bottom of this

607
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,199
before it takes place.

608
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,960
- Let's head to the site. Go!
- Let's go!

609
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,000
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT

610
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,239
It doesn't match the material
specifications in the contract.

611
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,719
- Did someone swap the materials?
- Most likely.

612
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,840
When was the last time you were here?

613
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,640
I'll pull the surveillance footage
for this area.

614
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,800
MATERIAL STORAGE AREA

615
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,760
- Zhou Yu!
- Zhou Yu?

616
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,400
Stop!

617
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,440
Stop right there! Don't run, Zhou Yu!

618
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,720
What are you doing here?

619
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,640
I'm telling you.

620
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,240
I'm telling you. I've got evidence
of you swapping materials!

621
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
- What evidence?
- What evidence?

622
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,440
Still playing tough, huh? What evidence?

623
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,080
Here, see for yourself.

624
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,040
MATERIAL STORAGE AREA

625
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,240
- This.
- See it clearly now?

626
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,480
You thieves crying "stop thief"!

627
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Thieves crying "stop thief"!

628
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
Are there any decent people
in your Hanhai Group?

629
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,840
You're all in cahoots with that
Wang Xingsheng, a bunch of liars

630
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,520
and scoundrels. Get away from me!

631
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,720
Who are you talking about?

632
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,160
Head back first.
I'm going to have a word with him.

633
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,560
Stop!

634
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
Mingxiao, I need all the recent
surveillance footage from Hailan Port.

635
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,920
All of it!

636
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,440
Let's go.

637
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,840
- Granny.
- <i>Meng.</i>

638
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,480
Why isn't Badou answering his phone?

639
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
Did something happen?

640
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,680
Can't get through?

641
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,480
Probably because he's been working
overtime lately. He's busy.

642
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,080
<i>As long as he's okay.</i>

643
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
What's up with this company?

644
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,200
Not even a moment to answer the phone?

645
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,640
Always overtime.

646
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,760
But you two must eat properly.

647
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,000
Don't worry. You get some rest early,

648
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,760
and once we're done here,
we'll come see you, okay?

649
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,120
No need to keep me company.

650
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,400
He should make time
to be with you properly.

651
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,640
You're still newlyweds.

652
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,200
<i>When I see him,</i>
<i>I'll give him a good talking-to.</i>

653
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,800
Alright,

654
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,600
then you get to sleep early.

655
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,440
Alright then, I'm hanging up.

656
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,160
Be good.

657
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,440
How did it go? Did Granny notice anything?

658
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,080
She hasn't noticed yet, but if we drag
this out any longer, she might.

659
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,920
You've been watching for a while now.
Take a break.

660
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,000
I think we should consider other options.
This way isn't making much progress.

661
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,760
Look at this video.

662
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,200
It was taken when I accompanied
Lin Yangyang to the construction site.

663
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,360
The equipment back then was all compliant,

664
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,760
completely different
from what's on the site now.

665
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,520
And look at this here.

666
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
This video from that period
has been tampered with.

667
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,120
Exactly.

668
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,600
Now it's up to whether Cheng Kairan
can catch up with Zhou Yu.

669
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,000
- How's it going?
- Did you catch up?

670
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,800
- Yes, I did.
- And then?

671
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,720
This Zhou Yu,

672
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,840
he absolutely refuses
to help Li Jinyu clear his name.

673
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,560
He's hated Hailan Port since he was a kid.

674
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,320
He'd be happy if it went bankrupt.

675
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,560
But without Zhou Yu,

676
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,520
that video footage is useless.

677
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,640
NINGSUI WELFARE CENTER

678
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,360
- Brother Zhou Yu!
- Play here!

679
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,560
Brother Zhou Yu!

680
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,640
Zhou Yu.

681
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,800
Shit!

682
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,760
Don't "shit". Get back here. Come on.

683
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,120
- Stand here.
- Move aside.

684
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Why do you always run?

685
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,240
Run! You never outrun me anyway.

686
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
You're going to fall.

687
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,000
What are you here for again?

688
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,040
How many times do I have to say it?

689
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,520
I don't help people get away with crimes.

690
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,720
I've told you just as many times.

691
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,680
The material switching
had nothing to do with Li Jinyu.

692
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,280
It wasn't us.

693
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,680
If you don't speak up, you're basically
helping the bad guys. You get that?

694
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,720
Zhou Yu,

695
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,040
I came here for Li Jinyu,

696
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,600
but I'm not asking you
to lie or give false testimony.

697
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,360
I only hope you can state
the facts as you saw them.

698
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,240
As for the truth, everyone
will draw their own conclusions.

699
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,840
At this welfare center,

700
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,160
all these kids really look up to you.

701
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,520
They see you as a big brother
and role model.

702
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,880
But if you say nothing now,

703
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,880
you could end up protecting a bad person

704
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,720
and framing an innocent one.

705
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,080
That's not the outcome
you want to see, is it?

706
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,720
Think it over again.

707
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,760
The press conference is about to start.

708
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,400
Let's go. Just give it some more thought.

709
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,240
UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESS

HAILAN PORT PHASE II CONSTRUCTION INCIDENT
PRESS CONFERENCE

711
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,000
HAILAN PORT PROMOTION: BE WITH THE CLOUD
THE VIEW AND THE COOL RIPPLES

712
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Here they are!

713
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,320
- Here they come.
- They come.

714
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,360
Unscrupulous boss, give us an explanation!

715
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,960
Yangyang, I'm embarrassed
you had to see such a serious incident.

716
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,960
Hurry up and give us an explanation!

717
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,280
Later, we'll need you to cooperate with us
in issuing a joint statement.

718
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,040
No problem.

719
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,160
As long as it can help Jinyu.

720
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,200
Mrs. Li.

721
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,240
Yang Bingzhang is already on his way.

722
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,920
How's it going with Wang Xingsheng?

723
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,360
He's keeping quiet. Being watched,
he won't be able to cause any trouble.

724
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,000
You lawless rogue!

725
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,640
Don't leave! You can't go!

726
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,200

735

to offer everyone
my sincere apologies here.

is Li Lingbai's company.
