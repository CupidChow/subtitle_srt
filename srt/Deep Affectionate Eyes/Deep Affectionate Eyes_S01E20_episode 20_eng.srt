1
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:11,882
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:15,496
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:17,281
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,810
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,962
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:31,210
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,698
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:38,162
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:42,794
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:49,066
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:53,802
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:55,882
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,882 --> 00:01:01,066
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,082
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:06,050
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,946
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:11,274
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,329
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,306
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:21,121
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,392
 

22
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,699
It's been a long time since I've been this happy.

23
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:49,579
Yeah. What are your plans next?

24
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:56,499
No plans. My life is so much
easier now without worries.

25
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:59,899
I'll just play it by ear.

26
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:08,019
Now that you're ready to start a new life,
don't you want a new relationship?

27
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:15,328
As I get older, I feel
that being in a relationship is troublesome.

28
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:18,979
Right now, I'm enjoying this kind of free life.

29
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:25,728
Look, I'm pretty free now.
And most importantly, I have emotional freedom.

30
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,659
So, I don't want to start a new relationship.

31
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:35,259
I'm not targeting all men. Kai, you're a good man.

32
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:42,939
Thank you for taking care of Jia Yu and me.

33
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:15,040
What are you doing?

34
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,339
M-My seatbelt.

35
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,488
What's wrong with it?

36
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:20,619
- It's broken.
- What's broken?

37
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:23,659
- Your seatbelt is broken.
- What part?

38
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,579
- It works now.
- Get out of here.

39
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:29,248
Okay.

40
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,139
Bye! Drive safely.

41
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:42,979
Fang Ya En, happy divorce.

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,480
Get going.

43
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,819
Jin Yu, you're here.

44
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:33,379
Aren't we supposed to discuss the project,
Phase III of the Hailan Bay? Why are you alone?

45
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:40,512
Someone else will come soon,
but I need to talk to you in private first.

46
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:43,200
What is it?

47
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:47,339
Jin Yu. I like you.

48
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:52,379
Before, to get closer to you,
I cheered for you outside the venue.

49
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,099
When you played basketball late,
I stayed up with you.

50
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:04,755
All these years, I've liked you.
Don't you like me at all?

51
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,579
I came to discuss the project. That's all.

52
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,152
Don't go. Your mom asked me here
for our arranged marriage.

53
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:16,448
Jin Yu, I know you want a free life.

54
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:20,579
I understand. After we get married,
I won't interfere with your freedom.

55
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,379
I'll be a good and obedient wife
as long as you stay with me.

56
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,640
The arranged marriage was
my mother's idea. I need to leave.

57
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,339
- No!
- Let go.

58
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:44,659
Jin Yu, this is Ye Kang, the bank president,
who will cooperate with us.

59
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:49,779
Guess what? His daughter also works at Hailan Bay.

60
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:56,259
It's Ye Meng. The other day,
she showed me and Ms. Li around Ningsui.

61
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:03,432
Mr. Ye, this is Li Jin Yu.
He is in charge of the project.

62
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,179
Hello.

63
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:09,579
Sorry, I need to use the restroom.

64
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:23,139
Lin Yang Yang. you're smarter than I imagined.

65
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,496
Jin Yu, what are you talking about?

66
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:29,699
Cheap tricks won't work.

67
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:35,339
You should focus more on the project.

68
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,640
- You've checked all possible places?
- Sure.

69
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,464
Any updates?

70
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:53,035
You're here.

71
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:55,859
Do you have any leads?

72
00:07:55,859 --> 00:08:00,416
That guy is cunning. I couldn't find anything.

73
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,888
Jin Yu, you're here.

74
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:06,259
Keep searching, you two.
Call me if anything comes up.

75
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:09,280
- Okay.
- Got it.

76
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,824
Why the long face?
Did you fight with Ye Meng again?

77
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:24,859
Can't you wish me well sometimes?

78
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:28,459
Ye Meng's Dad came back.

79
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:32,259
Today, he happened to see me dining
with Lin Yang Yang.

80
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,360
The worst part is, in front of her,
I couldn't explain properly.

81
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,059
So, he thinks I cheated on his daughter.

82
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,259
Honestly, Mr. Ye is pretty perceptive.

83
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:57,979
So, in that case, you can't even explain it.

84
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:02,299
You're in trouble.

85
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:13,579
What's that supposed to mean?

86
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:18,400
You came to me today
because you want my advice, right?

87
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,208
You're so wealthy now,
so I can't help you for nothing.

88
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,472
Why are you so confident?
Your help always makes things worse.

89
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:27,699
Just think about it carefully.

90
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:32,019
I often visited Ye Meng's home when I was little.
I was pretty familiar with Mr. Ye.

91
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:36,059
My experience is extensive.

92
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,368
Anyway, I can go to Gou Kai.
After all, he will pay me.

93
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:45,339
Fine, I'll pay you.

94
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:50,784
Done.

95
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,952
Dude, how come you're still so stingy now?

96
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:57,539
You're rich already. But you paid me 8.88 yuan?

97
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:00,299
Want me to cancel it?

98
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:06,560
Okay. Let me teach you.

99
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,579
Mr. Ye works at a bank.
Throwing money at him won't work.

100
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,099
Tell me about it. Spit it out.

101
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:22,499
Mr. Ye favors a highly educated man.

102
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:25,859
But you're just a high school graduate.

103
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:30,699
Get a fake top university diploma.

104
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,859
Is this your brilliant idea?

105
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,699
Dude, can you be more reliable?

106
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,752
I'm totally reliable! I can help you get it.

107
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:41,339
Forget it. I've figured it out.

108
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,339
Ye Meng's Dad looks down on you,
and it's got nothing to do with your education.

109
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,459
Come on. Why don't you just ask Ye Meng?

110
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:53,339
She knows her dad best.
Right now, she's having dinner with her dad.

111
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,819
I just hope she will still let me into our house.

112
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:03,139
Good luck, man.

113
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,979
What's that supposed to mean?
Give me back my money.

114
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:10,939
That's funny. I never got money from you.
Who do you think you are?

115
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,520
Honey, I'm home.

116
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,992
I bought your favorite fruit. Come and eat.

117
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:42,019
You must be tired. Have some water.

118
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:49,659
Thanks. You're so sweet.
I also bought fruit. Have a try.

119
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:53,120
Here.

120
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,939
This is durian?

121
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,859
You never eat durian normally.
Why did you buy this?

122
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:07,435
My dad demanded it. He said you need it.

123
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:13,059
Honey, a washboard or a keyboard also works.

124
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,059
It's unnecessary to use durian.

125
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:19,899
Washboards don't teach you lessons.
This works better.

126
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:25,179
So, your dad told you all about it.

127
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:29,739
He told me about a confession
and a marriage alliance.

128
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:34,939
My dad doesn't like watching TV shows.
But what he said is better than any TV show.

129
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,768
Sons-in-law and fathers-in-law are enemies.

130
00:12:40,768 --> 00:12:43,299
Now, I'm completely doomed.

131
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:47,099
Honey, I was wrong.

132
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:54,139
Can you help me restore my image?

133
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,539
Otherwise, you might even force me to divorce you.

134
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,899
If I have to, I'll kneel on durian as punishment.

135
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,939
I...

136
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:19,839
I'm putting it down and kneeling on it.

137
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,779
- Aren't you going to stop me?
- Why should I stop you?

138
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:28,739
- Will it hurt you?
- Careful. It'll hurt you.

139
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:36,139
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

140
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:38,739
I'm sorry for everything.

141
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:42,099
Please help me out.

142
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:48,499
Alright, if you want to win over my dad,
you should find out what his hobbies are.

143
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,299
Hobbies?

144
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:06,336
Dad.

145
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:48,992
Dad. Ye Meng said you like fishing.
I have prepared some bait for you.

146
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:51,779
Would you like to try?

147
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,099
No, thanks. I can't accept gifts.

148
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:05,259
We're family. I'm your son-in-law.
It's just a little something for you.

149
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:40,539
How did you put the baits?

150
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:45,019
Precise baiting. I put them in separate spots.

151
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,779
The fish can't swim to the feeding zone.

152
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,339
I made the bait with black rice and bloodworms.
Would you like to try it?

153
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:03,328
Black rice and bloodworms? Alright.

154
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:06,379
Let me try.

155
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:18,272
Dad.

156
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:25,219
My mom set me up with Miss Lin,
the girl you saw yesterday.

157
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,859
But there is nothing between her and me.

158
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:34,619
Ye Meng and I are secretly married right now.
We're not ready to make it public yet.

159
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,872
Secret marriage? What do you take Ye Meng for?

160
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:46,099
Don't get me wrong. I love Ye Meng.
I just joined the company.

161
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:50,112
If others know Ye Meng and I
are already married, it'll create rumors.

162
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:52,579
I want to protect Ye Meng.

163
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:58,179
Stop explaining. I know rich guys like you well.

164
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:11,360
The fish took the bite. A big fish.

165
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,168
One, two, three!

166
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,779
I got this.

167
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,139
- Take the rod.
- I'll reel it in.

168
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,395
How is it?

169
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,459
Look, it's a big fish.

170
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,379
What a surprise!

171
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:41,379
You come back.

172
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:51,379
- Meng, look at the fish.
- It's dark. You're finally back.

173
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:56,859
Have a look. How do you want it cooked?

174
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:03,136
Li Jin Yu, what happened to your pants?
Your shoes are wet.

175
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:04,259
It's fine.

176
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,099
Did you make him jump in the river?

177
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:11,699
What are you talking about?
My fishing rod fell in. He retrieved it for me.

178
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,379
- Is that true, Li?
- Sure.

179
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:16,704
It was my idea to help him. It's not his fault.

180
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:19,419
Exactly.

181
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,779
- I'll clean the fish.
- Okay.

182
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:27,499
Go change your pants.

183
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:31,579
I've noticed your dad seems afraid of you.

184
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:37,184
He's not just scared of me.
He also fears my three aunts and my grandma.

185
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:41,699
After you join us,
you'll be the only one he's not afraid of.

186
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:46,144
So, my status is actually the lowest.

187
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:53,739
You can put it that way. So, he will like you.
After all, he's not afraid of you.

188
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:58,304
After hearing that, should I be happy or sad?

189
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,059
- Meng, how do you want the fish cooked?
- I'm telling you.

190
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,539
Go change your pants! Don't catch a cold.

191
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,899
- The floor's all dirty now.
- No worries. I'll mop later.

192
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:19,360
Slice the fish? Make poached fish?

193
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,232
No problem. Go take a rest.

194
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:25,219
Go take a rest. I'll call you when it's ready.

195
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,219
But I can help.

196
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,139
- Go rest.
- Can you two handle this?

197
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:32,019
- We'll call you when it's done.
- Go for it.

198
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:42,779
Let me handle that.

199
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,715
Let me put on an apron.

200
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,419
Do it properly.

201
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:52,899
Clean it thoroughly, or it'll smell fishy.

202
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,200
Leave it to me.

203
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,520
The thinner, the better.

204
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,579
Got it. You go and take a rest.
I'll tell you when it's finished.

205
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:10,619
- I'm teaching you here.
- Okay.

206
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:21,819
Start here.

207
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:26,699
- As thin as possible.
- No problem.

208
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:28,979
Thinner.

209
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:33,379
Good. See?

210
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,979
Here. Try a bite.

211
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:42,259
Thanks. Let me try.

212
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:45,899
Delicious. Perfectly flavorful.

213
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,779
And your knife skills are so good. It's so thin.

214
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,979
It's pretty easy for me.

215
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:58,739
Dad, don't be modest. It's evenly thin.
Your skills are unmatched.

216
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:03,739
Besides, you're showing
not just your skills but your love.

217
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:08,579
Dad cooks whatever you want to eat.
Shouldn't you thank him?

218
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:11,379
You and Dad have a pretty interesting rapport.

219
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:16,235
Fine, I'll express my thankfulness.
Thank you so much, Dad.

220
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,339
As long as you enjoy it, it's worth it.

221
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:26,419
Li, help yourself.

222
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,216
Thanks.

223
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:33,139
I'll get wine. Wait a second.

224
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,728
- What did you mean earlier?
- I meant well.

225
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:45,568
I was serious.

226
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,619
Let me tell you.

227
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,539
Ye Meng has been our family's
treasured princess since childhood.

228
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,152
I have one demand for her husband.

229
00:21:57,152 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm listening.

230
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,779
Treat her well.

231
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,419
Don't worry. I'll make sure of it.

232
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,816
Alright. There's friction in life.

233
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:11,139
Your upbringings are completely different.

234
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:17,779
As long as you help and understand each other,
you two will keep getting better.

235
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:23,899
If Ye Meng makes a mistake,
just let me know. I'll discipline her.

236
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,819
As for this house, I won't interfere.

237
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,715
Dad, the liquor is here.

238
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:32,899
- What's this fancy liquor?
- Nothing special.

239
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:36,339
I just bought it. Tastes pretty good.

240
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,939
Look what I've discovered.

241
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:53,899
No wonder we couldn't find Zhou Yu.
He's been hiding at our local orphanage.

242
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:55,699
He's from the orphanage?

243
00:22:55,699 --> 00:23:02,499
His parents died when he was little.
He lived at the orphanage before turning 18.

244
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:06,739
He wasn't adopted because of Wang Xing Sheng.

245
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:10,899
When Wang Xing Sheng wanted
to buy the land at Hailan Bay,

246
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:15,179
he wanted financing. Yet nobody trusted him.

247
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,379
So, he used the orphanage
under the guise of charity work to raise money.

248
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:26,656
Very soon, he was put in prison.
He also made the orphanage notorious.

249
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:31,499
The family that planned
to adopt Zhou Yu abandoned him.

250
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:41,899
What's wrong?

251
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:47,936
This is the orphanage in the old district.
My mom grew up there.

252
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,304
Zhou Yu brought so much stuff.

253
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:59,699
I want one too.

254
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,539
- Do you like it?
- Yes!

255
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,459
Come on, line up. No pushing.

256
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:05,099
One at a time.

257
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:06,899
Zhou Yu, I want one too.

258
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:08,419
- Give me one.
- Give me one.

259
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:09,539
Give me one!

260
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,419
Wait for your turn. Here you go.

261
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:12,779
- I want one.
- Me too.

262
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:13,899
- I want one.
- I want one.

263
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,699
I want this one.

264
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,939
Hua, help distribute these.

265
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:20,179
I got a pencil case.

266
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:21,659
- I want one.
- Me too.

267
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,288
I want one too!

268
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:25,824
Why did you follow me here?

269
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:30,419
Calm down. We're here to ask some questions.

270
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,659
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Zhou Yu.

271
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,739
You know Wang Wang Xing Sheng, right?
You've been targeting us because of him.

272
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:39,979
You're all birds of a feather!

273
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,808
Your project made many kids
lose their chance at adoption.

274
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:47,168
What do you mean?
What does it have to do with the project?

275
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:48,619
Let go!

276
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:49,939
- Make it clear.
- Let go.

277
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:52,544
Zhou Yu.

278
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:57,939
What happened? Did you cause trouble again?

279
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,819
Zhou Yu!

280
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,355
We're from Hailan Bay.

281
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:09,632
I know Zhou Yu made mistakes.
I'm not defending him.

282
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:16,459
But he did it all
because of the Hailan Bay project.

283
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:24,096
How much do you know about that project?

284
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,419
 

285
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:31,739
The Hailan Bay project is
also called Tianhui Garden.

286
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:39,739
Wang Xing Sheng invested in Ningsui.
With his partner's help, he wanted us to join him.

287
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,000
Found it.

288
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:47,033
 

289
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:54,739
His partner grew up here.
We trusted the project she introduced.

290
00:25:54,739 --> 00:26:01,739
But unexpectedly,
she used us to swindle investors.

291
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:05,259
She ruined our orphanage's reputation.

292
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:09,059
Zhou Yu was a victim back then.

293
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:15,739
 
Shu Yi is my mom.

294
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:19,392
Do you know how she met Wang Xing Sheng?

295
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:27,339
I don't know. They were quite close.

296
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:50,720
Why come back so late? Have you eaten?

297
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,219
We visited the orphanage where my mom lived.
We already ate out there.

298
00:26:56,219 --> 00:27:00,739
What did you eat? How about I make you noodles?

299
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:03,456
No need, Grandma.

300
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:08,939
Grandma, do you know Wang Xing Sheng?

301
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:16,640
Wang Xing Sheng? I don't know him.

302
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,600
What about this?

303
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,328
 
I want to know

304
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:38,624
if my mom's death is related to this project.

305
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:47,259
Grandma, I'm not a kid.
What are you hiding from me?

306
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:50,459
Why can't you tell me the truth?

307
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:57,019
Why are you so stubborn?

308
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:00,608
That's all in the past.
What's the point of asking?

309
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:02,579
It's about my mom.

310
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:06,048
Without knowing the truth, I'll never move on.

311
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:08,352
Meng.

312
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:13,440
We've been hiding the truth to protect you.

313
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,659
To protect me? I'll try to find out the truth.
If I can't, I won't be back.

314
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:22,304
Meng.

315
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:36,739
 Your mom said her friend
introduced a profitable project to her. 

316
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:40,179
 You're investing that much? 

317
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:45,899
 Mom, the more money you have invested,
the more money you'll make. 

318
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:48,579
 Is your friend trustworthy? 

319
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:55,499
 Of course. The project is already endorsed.
The government and banks are also involved. 

320
00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:00,499
 Got it. I'll be there soon. 

321
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:06,379
 Mom, I have to go. Trust me.
I'll make the money back soon. 

322
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:17,219
 Later, her friend suddenly became unreachable. 

323
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:20,099
 How is it going? 

324
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:27,579
 He doesn't answer. 

325
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:30,139
 I'll send him messages. 

326
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:35,195
 I think it's a scam.
He probably took the money and ran. 

327
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:38,459
 Impossible! 

328
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:47,179
 Your mom tried everything
but couldn't find any trace of him. 

329
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:53,099
 But soon, many investors came
to the orphanage, demanding answers. 

330
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,859
 He took all my money too! 

331
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:03,579
 Your mom was desperate. 

332
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:10,859
 She went to Jiangbei alone to find that guy
without telling anyone. 

333
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:20,299
Why did you keep it from me?

334
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:24,539
I asked them not to tell you.

335
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:28,224
Dad.

336
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:36,896
Meng.

337
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:42,880
I didn't want you
to know the bad side of your mom.

338
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:47,739
I didn't want people to gossip about your mom.

339
00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:51,904
Besides, Wang Xing Sheng was sentenced, wasn't he?

340
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:56,640
That's why I thought it all should end here.

341
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:05,120
Dad, do you know
what I've been through all these years?

342
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:15,099
I blamed myself every day. I suffered.

343
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:18,656
I thought Mom got depressed
because of my poor grades.

344
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:24,299
Honestly, I didn't know what to do.

345
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,339
I thought hiding the truth was protecting you.

346
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:31,968
Right.

347
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,819
You all claim it's for my sake,

348
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:40,659
but did you ever consider how I felt?

349
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:44,299
Meng.

350
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:48,419
Don't worry. I'll talk to her.

351
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:14,304
Why come here alone to play a game?

352
00:32:14,304 --> 00:32:16,259
I need some fresh air.

353
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:19,779
Put this on. Don't catch a cold.

354
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:27,979
This game isn't popular anymore, huh?

355
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:31,200
Sure.

356
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Mom and I often teamed up to play it,
and we never lost.

357
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:42,699
A winning team. Pretty cool.

358
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:49,819
We often sit here, playing games and gossiping.

359
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:52,699
Mom knew all my secrets.

360
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:56,819
But she never lectured me like a mom.

361
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,779
She never demanded anything from me.

362
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:04,899
She always said,

363
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:13,219
"Meng, your happiness matters the most."

364
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:23,379
To you, she was not only your mom
but your closest friend.

365
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:33,259
That's why you blame your dad
for hiding the truth.

366
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:39,699
But I can tell how much he loves you.

367
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:45,819
Maybe he just wants you to live happily.

368
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:50,299
He's just trying to avoid the truth.

369
00:33:54,219 --> 00:34:01,408
How about you find a chance to talk with your dad?

370
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:12,736
No, there's nothing else to say.

371
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:21,619
He's your family, not an enemy, right?

372
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:34,560
Wait. Why are you on my dad's side?

373
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,819
How could that be? My stance is clear.
I'm always on your side.

374
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:46,779
Look, if you and your dad are good, I'll be good.
But you're the most important to me.

375
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:53,824
Come on.

376
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,555
Don't cry.

377
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:00,299
Otherwise, your eyes will be puffy tomorrow.

378
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:07,939
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

379
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:11,168
Feeling better?

380
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,899
There.

381
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:19,475
If you keep crying,
you won't look pretty tomorrow.

382
00:35:19,499 --> 00:35:22,099
I know.

383
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:31,379
Yang Yang, how did your talk with Jin Yu go?

384
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:36,019
That's just his personality.
He's aloof with everyone.

385
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:39,392
Don't worry. I'll come to Ningsui
and scold him for you.

386
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,219
Okay, talk later.

387
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:44,259
Ms. Li, the progress isn't smooth.

388
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:47,699
Will Miss Lin's marriage alliance
with your son be affected?

389
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:49,659
Marriage alliance?

390
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:53,739
I'm just trying to offload the Hailan Bay project
to the Lin Group quickly.

391
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,392
Dr. Yang.

392
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:02,619
Long time no see.

393
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:07,936
Ms. Li.

394
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:15,979
Jin Yu, please look at the budget
for Phase III of the Hailan Bay.

395
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:21,659
If you have no problems,
we'll demolish the fishing village.

396
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:27,819
Jin Yu, the fishing village is
in the best location here.

397
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:31,859
Lin Group will work with Hanhai Group
on Phase III of the Hailan Bay.

398
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,499
We chose the location of the fishing village.

399
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:40,299
That's all for today's discussion.

400
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:46,464
Regarding Phase III of the Hailan Bay,
we'll talk again later.

401
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:51,339
Alright. I have to go.

402
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,219
See you.

403
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:55,579
- See you.
- See you.

404
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:58,179
Goodbye, Jin Yu.

405
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:09,299
 Dad. Don't forget dinner at home tonight. 

406
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:25,939
Food's ready! The soup will be ready soon.

407
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:29,699
- You must be tired.
- Not at all.

408
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:32,779
Dad must be here. I'll get the door.

409
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:35,784
Coming.

410
00:37:35,808 --> 00:37:37,579
Dad, you're here.

411
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:40,339
Jin Yu, where's Meng?

412
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:43,499
She's waiting in the dining room.

413
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:50,080
Meng.

414
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:14,399
Ye Meng asked me to get you
your favorite liquor. Have a try.

415
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,859
I know you're still angry with me.

416
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:41,659
You know what?

417
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:48,224
When it happened, I was not mentally prepared.

418
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:52,000
I just wanted to protect you back then.

419
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,419
Maybe I wanted to avoid facing it myself.

420
00:38:59,499 --> 00:39:05,835
To be honest, your mom's death hit me really hard.

421
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:11,360
I naively believed the wound would never reopen

422
00:39:11,456 --> 00:39:15,619
if I didn't mention it.

423
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:25,728
Now, I realize I was wrong.

424
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,899
Meng, I should apologize to you.

425
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,459
I'm sorry.

426
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,024
Actually, it's not entirely your fault.

427
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:50,336
Even if you had told me back then,
I probably couldn't have taken it immediately.

428
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:56,480
After all, I was immature,
prone to acting impulsively.

429
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:04,416
So now, you're not angry with me, right?

430
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:10,848
Let go of the past. Let's move on.

431
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:22,944
Dad. That's what Mom would want to see.

432
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,859
Okay.

433
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:34,272
Well, let's have a toast.

434
00:40:34,272 --> 00:40:36,960
Come on.

435
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:40,419
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

436
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,096
Jin Yu.

437
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:52,875
I'm glad that Meng has you with her.

438
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:55,675
Thanks. That's really nice.

439
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:58,539
Did you cook all these dishes?

440
00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:00,256
Try his cooking. Here.

441
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:03,539
- Let me wash my hands first.
- Okay.

442
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:11,936
Congrats. You successfully won
over your father-in-law.

443
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,619
I'm good, right?

444
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,416
- Take this off.
- Hmm.

445
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:22,635
- You look handsome in an apron.
- Really?

446
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:25,379
- Then I'll wear it more often.
- Right.

447
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:28,160
I heard you.

448
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,496
No need to see me out. It's cold outside.

449
00:41:30,496 --> 00:41:33,699
Then I'll walk Dad out. You go back.

450
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:42,688
Actually, I want to talk about something with you.

451
00:41:42,688 --> 00:41:44,416
Go ahead.

452
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:50,496
Phase III of the Hailan Bay is about to start.
They're planning to demolish this fishing village.

453
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:52,219
Are you aware of it?

454
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,995
Yes. I approve.

455
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:56,659
I don't understand.

456
00:41:56,659 --> 00:42:02,619
The cultural charm of the Ningsui
lies in this fishing village.

457
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:07,680
Hailan Bay was first established
based on the existing ecosystem,

458
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,899
instead of destroying it.

459
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:18,315
You're absolutely right.
This fishing village is good.

460
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:21,859
But you must understand
it can't be expanded and strengthened.

461
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:28,019
Why does the government attract capital
to turn this village into Hailan Bay?

462
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:32,859
It's to bring business to boost the tourism here.

463
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:38,880
But this is where Ye Meng grew up.
So many people have precious memories here.

464
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,048
Even so, you still agree to demolish it?

465
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:47,139
My opinion doesn't matter.
As Ye Meng said, we need to look forward.

466
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:53,920
For the development, we have to
give up something. Go accompany Ye Meng.

467
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:57,779
Be safe on the road.

468
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,272
Grandma, wake up!

469
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:35,459
What's wrong with you? Grandma!

470
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:45,888
Look, it's a brain tumor.

471
00:43:45,888 --> 00:43:47,552
We'll know if it's malignant
after surgical removal

472
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:50,859
and a biopsy.

473
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:53,216
The patient's current condition is very unstable.

474
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:59,776
You should decide quickly
if you want conservative therapy or surgery.

475
00:44:13,939 --> 00:44:19,619
 Given the patient's age,
I don't recommend surgery. It's risky. 

476
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:24,299
 But if the surgery succeeds,
she might live another decade or more. 

477
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:28,448
 The final result is not quite uncertain, actually. 

478
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:34,019
 Talk with your family before making a decision. 

479
00:45:00,352 --> 00:45:02,624
 ♫ You ♫ 

480
00:45:02,624 --> 00:45:05,600
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

481
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:08,808
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

482
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:14,816
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

483
00:45:14,816 --> 00:45:20,736
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

484
00:45:20,736 --> 00:45:24,896
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

485
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:27,360
 ♫ Go ♫ 

486
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,376
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

487
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:33,504
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

488
00:45:33,504 --> 00:45:39,488
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

489
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:43,456
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

490
00:45:43,456 --> 00:45:50,272
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

491
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,792
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

492
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,376
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

493
00:45:57,376 --> 00:46:03,456
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

494
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:08,217
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

495
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:14,264
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

496
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:18,301
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

497
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:21,257
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

498
00:46:21,257 --> 00:46:23,424
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

499
00:46:23,424 --> 00:46:28,224
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

500
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:30,368
 ♫ But why ♫ 

501
00:46:30,368 --> 00:46:33,888
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

502
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:39,741
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
