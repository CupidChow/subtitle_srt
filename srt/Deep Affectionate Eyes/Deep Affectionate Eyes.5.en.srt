2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,440
Don't you feel like everything's spinning?
My head won't stop reeling.

3
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,600
It's like the whole place is tilting.

4
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,519
Can you slow down a little?

5
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,240
You're pretty quick on your feet.

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,920
Wait, are you drunk?
Your face is burning red.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,600
You're the one who's drunk.
Look at yourself.

8
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,400
What's the room number?

9
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
We're already here.

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,800
Li Jinyu…

11
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,240
You've got eyes of deep affection.

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,360
They're really beautiful.

13
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
Enough. Go inside.

14
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,920
Okay. Let me find the keycard.

15
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,360
What's wrong? Lost your nerve?

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,040
Stop it.

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,240
You're drunk.

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,360
Just go in.

19
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,120
Serves you right.

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,400
Why drink like that
when you can't hold it?

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,920
I just need a minute.

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,720
Don't leave me.

23
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,880
I'm too tired tonight.

24
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Let's save it for another time.

25
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,920
Uncle Yang?

26
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
Jinyu?

27
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,560
Here, have some water.

28
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,720
What brings you here?

29
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
Earlier this evening,

30
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,160
Ye Meng texted me. She sounded worried.

31
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,600
Asked me to come check on a friend.

32
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,120
And how do you two know each other?

33
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,760
That's a long story.

34
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
A few years back,

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
our counseling center

36
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,440
came to Ningsui to give some public talks.

37
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,920
Back then, people in this town
were so closed off,

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
no one showed up.

39
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Except Ye Meng. She came every time,

40
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,920
asking endless questions about depression.

41
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,280
So, she knows about your past?

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,600
No.

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,640
She just can't help herself.
Always rushing in to help.

44
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
You couldn't stop her if you tried.

45
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,480
I remember before you moved here,

46
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,480
you were popular among girls.

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
You just never dated.

48
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,280
That's why I told you back then,
try it at least once.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,960
Oh, and just recently,

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,360
your grandma mentioned

51
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,320
you'd met a girl from Jiangbei.

52
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,400
I never imagined it would be Meng.

53
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,120
It wasn't her.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,520
That wasn't dating,
just a blind date Grandma set up.

55
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
We only met once.

56
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,160
Either way, you seem better now.

57
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,320
What happened in the past
wasn't your fault.

58
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Stop punishing yourself for it.

59
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,320
As long

60
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,040
as nobody brings her up,

61
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm fine.

62
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,800
Jinyu, you ever hear
of the white bear phenomenon?

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,720
The thing is, the harder you try

64
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,880
not to think about something,

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,920
the more it stays on your mind.

66
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,680
I understand it's not easy
to put the past behind you.

67
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,320
But don't rush it.
And don't run from it either.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Alright. If there's nothing else,
I'll get going.

69
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,760
Let me walk you out, Uncle Yang.

70
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,120
No need.

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,000
And listen, if you don't
want her to know your past,

72
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,880
I'll act like we never met.

73
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,920
Safe trip home, Uncle Yang.

74
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
<i>Li Jinyu.</i>

75
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,800
Li Jinyu.

76
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,560
Li Jinyu…

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,680
I'm thirsty.

78
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,360
Thanks.

79
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,720
Looking for Uncle Yang?

80
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,320
He already left.

81
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
How was the talk?

82
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,400
He's been my therapist all along.

83
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,680
I've been seeing him for years.

84
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,640
But you…

85
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,840
What are you doing
sitting in on counseling?

86
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,400
Grandma told me my mom had depression.

87
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,000
I just couldn't believe it.

88
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,560
She was always so full of life.

89
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,200
How could she be depressed?

90
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
So, I went to every one
of Uncle Yang's lectures.

91
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
Li Jinyu,

92
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,560
I know you think I butt into everything.

93
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,120
But I really am afraid you'll…

94
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,640
Forget it.

95
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,960
What I'm really trying to say

96
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,960
is I hope you can let people in.

97
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280
I've just gotten used

98
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,560
to being on my own.

99
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,360
It feels like I went through

100
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,360
all the hardest parts of my life

101
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,560
all by myself.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Not anymore. You've got me.

103
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Look at me.

104
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,920
I'm steady, successful,
plenty of time on my hands.

105
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,840
Don't you want to consider it?

106
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,040
So, what is it you like about me?

107
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,440
That face alone is enough.

108
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,040
It's the first time in my life
I ever asked a guy for his WeChat.

109
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,080
Didn't you tell me you only wanted
my contact for that crab place?

110
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,640
Don't pretend you believed that.

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,160
You'd better not play games with me.

112
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,880
When I fall for someone,

113
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,120
I don't change.

114
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,080
Funny.

115
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm the same way.

116
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,560
That's still up for debate.

117
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,400
If I'd known, I wouldn't
have asked Uncle Yang to come.

118
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
I'd have just gone after you myself.

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,040
Let's see how smug you'd be.

120
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
Who's the smug one here?

121
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,720
You should be grateful
I didn't take advantage tonight.

122
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,200
Oh, please. As if you'd dare.

123
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,800
Is that a challenge?

124
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,680
Good thing the night's still young.

125
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,560
If I wanted to make a move,

126
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
I'd have plenty of time.

127
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,040
Do whatever you want.

128
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,960
It's not like I'd be the one losing.

129
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,280
SLEEP MODE

130
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,480
Good night.

131
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,760
Such a gentleman.

132
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,360
I've been looking for you all night.

133
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,240
So, this is where you've been.

134
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,120
You're with Ye Meng now?

135
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,320
Does knowing the answer

136
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,160
matter that much to you?

137
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,360
You don't like me.
When you acted like you did,

138
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,640
it was just to provoke her.

139
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,240
You hate her that much?

140
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,400
Hate is putting it lightly.

141
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,560
All through school,
everyone preferred her.

142
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,280
Every boy I liked ended up liking her.

143
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,200
Even my parents never stopped saying,

144
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,600
"Why can't you be like Ye Meng?

145
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,640
She's beautiful. She's sweet."

146
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
And what about me? I've got charm too.

147
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,960
I'm not bad-looking, right?

148
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,520
And my grades left hers in the dust.

149
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,640
So, why is she the one
everyone calls the perfect daughter?

150
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,040
Maybe in her eyes, you were the one

151
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
people compared her to.

152
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
Even if that's true,

153
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,120
there's no way I'll ever sit down

154
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,840
and share a meal with her.

155
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,080
We'll probably resent each other
for the rest of our lives.

156
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,160
Sorry.

157
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,360
I used you as a pawn again.

158
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,680
But I hope we can still be friends.

159
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,440
And if you really do care about Ye Meng,

160
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,120
then take my advice.

161
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Keep her here in Ningsui.

162
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,360
Don't let her go back to Jiangbei.

163
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,000
BED 13

164
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
IMMUNIZATION STATION

165
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,720
- Jinyu, you're here.
- Hm.

166
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,360
PATIENT ROOM 5

167
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,960
Give it here.

168
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,960
Slash it once.

169
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
I need to tell you something.

170
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm planning a trip to Jiangbei.

171
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,960
Jiangbei?

172
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,120
What for?

173
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,400
To see Li Lingbai.

174
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,000
You're going to that woman.

175
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,240
Have you completely lost your mind?

176
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
The ticket's already bought.

177
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,960
What nonsense is this?

178
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,960
I heard she's seriously ill.

179
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,360
Might not have much time left. As her son,

180
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,760
I have to show up and fight
for my share of the inheritance.

181
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,240
When I come back, I'll look after you.

182
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,280
We'll eat well, drink well.

183
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,600
Didn't you want to try
racing and skydiving, like me?

184
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,000
We'll take that world map,

185
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,920
throw a dart at it,

186
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,840
and fly wherever it lands.

187
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,120
I don't need her money.
I have plenty of my own.

188
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,160
And wipe that grin off your face.

189
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,880
You know exactly
what kind of person she is.

190
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,240
Fine.

191
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,640
If you insist, I won't stop you.

192
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,240
Call me the moment you land.

193
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
I already bought you sky-high insurance.

194
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,720
If anything happens,

195
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,440
at least I'll know where to collect.

196
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,880
Happy Spring Festival.

197
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,600
Don't even think about it.

198
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,560
Before the holiday,
I'll crawl back if I have to.

199
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,480
Now eat.

200
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,320
OPEN
WELCOME

201
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,920
<i>Pour in a little oil.</i>

202
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,800
<i>Then add 125 milliliters of milk.</i>

203
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,200
<i>Mix it well.</i>

204
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,960
<i>Now we can add the flour.</i>

205
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,360
You really don't sit still, do you?

206
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,120
Your leg just healed, and you're
already this busy. Don't overdo it.

207
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,040
Just film it properly.
It's Jiayu's school project.

208
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,040
They want a vlog.

209
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,320
It's the power of love. Get it?

210
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,000
Alright, alright. Forty-five degrees.
Makes your face look slimmer.

211
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,320
- Perfect.
- You got it? Let me see.

212
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,760
Here, check it.

213
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,200
- Well?
- Gorgeous. Absolutely perfect.

214
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
So, last night you two had drinks,

215
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,200
went back to the room,
and nothing happened?

216
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,280
That doesn't sound like
city dating etiquette to me.

217
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,520
I'm all about true love.

218
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,440
Please. You two are slower than slow.

219
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,960
A girl chasing a guy is easy.

220
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,640
But with you two?

221
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,440
It's like moving mountains.

222
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,440
So, tell me. Are your hints too weak,

223
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,600
or is he just pretending not to see them?

224
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Because if it's the second one,
he's really pushing his luck.

225
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,360
Honestly, last night,
I wasn't even planning anything.

226
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,960
Then why'd you bring him to your room?

227
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,400
You wouldn't understand.

228
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,320
Oh, you're serious about him.

229
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,680
Stop it.

230
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,960
Okay, okay.

231
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,680
You're doomed, Ye Meng. Totally gone.

232
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,560
Head over heels.

233
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,200
- It's snowing.
- Where?

234
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,160
No way.

235
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,640
I'm not kidding. Come on. Hurry!

236
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,200
Careful with your leg.

237
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,720
I can't believe it's snowing in Ningsui.

238
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
I have to get this on video.

239
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,000
You asked me just now

240
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,520
if I was really serious about him.

241
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,920
Honestly, I don't know.

242
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,400
But my first instinct right now

243
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,560
isn't to take a photo for Moments.

244
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,800
Then, what is it?

245
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,640
I'm worried Li Jinyu
might not have an umbrella.

246
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,520
<i>Or that the streets are icy,</i>

247
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,119
<i>and he'll slip and fall.</i>

248
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,480
You sound like you're in a drama yourself.

249
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,040
YA'EN

250
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,880
<i>But my first instinct right now</i>

251
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,000
<i>isn't to take a photo for Moments.</i>

252
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,600
<i>Then, what is it?</i>

253
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,280
<i>I'm worried Li Jinyu</i>
<i>might not have an umbrella.</i>

254
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,160
<i>Or that the streets are icy,</i>

255
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,160
<i>and he'll slip and fall.</i>

256
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,920
LEMONGRASS YE MENG

257
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,000
WHERE ARE YOU?

258
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,640
<i>Where are you? At the hospital or at home?</i>

259
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,320
<i>Home.</i>

260
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
<i>The snow's beautiful.</i>

261
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,560
HOME. THE SNOW'S BEAUTIFUL.

262
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,880
Aren't you cold? Close the window.

263
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,360
You don't get it. This is romantic.
It's all about the vibe.

264
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,600
Oh, give me a break.

265
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,800
Li Jinyu's birthday is coming up.
What should I get him?

266
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,760
You don't need to buy anything.
Just give him yourself.

267
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,480
So cheesy.
That's all you ever think about.

268
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,240
Hey, I'm allowed to think about it.

269
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Your love power's not bad.
Why don't you teach me?

270
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,880
Just take it. It's yours.

271
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,840
I don't want yours. I want my own.

272
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,880
You don't get rituals.

273
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,120
Fine, fine, I don't get it.

274
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
You city types come back here

275
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,920
and it's all about rituals and vibes.

276
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
Please, I'm begging you.

277
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Okay, okay, I'll teach you.

278
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
But first, shut that window.

279
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,080
Why are you so obsessed with the window?

280
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,000
- It's freezing.
- Okay, okay, I get it.

281
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,240
Pick a color you like.

282
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,400
- Paint it however you want.
- Really?

283
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,560
Do one first. I'll see how good you are.

284
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,280
- Like this?
- Yeah, squeeze it like that.

285
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,760
Geez, that startled me.

286
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,680
Like that?

287
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,960
Yeah. Looks good!

288
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,320
Fang Ya'en.

289
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,480
You're not bad at this.

290
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,520
Later, whatever you make,
you're eating it yourself.

291
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,880
Here, let me show you.

292
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,160
<i>I booked your ticket.</i>

293
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,120
FLIGHT TICKET ISSUED

294
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,040
<i>Flight's tomorrow morning.</i>

295
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
<i>Driver will pick you up.</i>

296
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,040
YE MENG

297
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,600
WHERE ARE YOU? AT HOSPITAL OR AT HOME?

298
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,560
<i>I might</i>

299
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,600
<i>need to go to Jiangbei tomorrow.</i>

300
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,880
SEND

301
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,880
We gotta hurry.

302
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,800
If Li Jinyu finds out,
the surprise is ruined.

303
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,160
Seriously?

304
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,960
My leg's still not fully healed,

305
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,280
and you've got me
running around for a man?

306
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,480
Sorry, I forgot about your leg.
Here, give that to me.

307
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,440
Look at you.
Fireworks, cake, the whole package.

308
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
Aren't you worried
you're spoiling him rotten?

309
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,240
He's got a sharp memory
and an even sharper tongue.

310
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,160
I don't want him
throwing it back at me later

311
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,160
that the first birthday cake
I made him was hideous.

312
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
- Fine, fine.
- Give it here.

313
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,600
No, it's fine.

314
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,640
No, hand it over.

315
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,960
I said it's fine.

316
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,240
You're impossible.

317
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,760
Careful.

318
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
327-3 XINGYI ROAD

319
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,640
OUTPATIENT

320
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,800
You two, wait outside.

321
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,960
Yes, Mrs. Li.

322
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,040
You've changed a lot.

323
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,080
Starting to look like a real man.

324
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,040
How's Grandma doing?

325
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,520
She fractured her leg a while back.

326
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,640
She's in rehab now,

327
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,360
but she's doing fine.

328
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,120
Something that big,

329
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,080
and you didn't think to tell me?

330
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,160
I know

331
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,080
you still hold it against me.

332
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,880
All those years…

333
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
I failed you.

334
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,520
And I failed your grandma.

335
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,080
How did you suddenly

336
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,840
get so sick?

337
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,800
Call it karma.

338
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,560
I've been in this hospital

339
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,360
over six months now.

340
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,760
I keep having nightmares.

341
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,240
I dream

342
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,960
<i>of that stormy night…</i>

343
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,480
<i>You clutching my hand…</i>

344
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,600
Mom!

345
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,080
<i>…crying, begging me…</i>

346
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,520
Mom!

347
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,560
- <i>…"Mom, don't send me away."</i>
- Mom!

348
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,200
Don't send me away!

349
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,760
Every time I wake up,

350
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,040
I feel like I should pick up the phone.

351
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,160
On the way here, I read up on it.

352
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,160
First, you need a full exam,

353
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,720
then a bone marrow biopsy, right?

354
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,760
You'd really

355
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,440
donate your bone marrow to me?

356
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,040
Isn't that the reason

357
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,320
you reached out in the first place?

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,120
<i>The process</i>

359
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
<i>is complicated.</i>

360
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,000
<i>You'll have to stay here</i>

361
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,360
<i>a few days.</i>

362
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,920

Maimai. You're home.

369
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,640
Where's your cousin?

370
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,480
He's not here. I'm just feeding his dog.

371
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,400
Where did he go?

372
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,000
He went to Jiangbei.

373
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,640
Jiangbei? That sudden?

374
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,200
Yeah, off to be a blood bank.

375
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,360
You mean donate blood?

376
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,600
No. Grandma said

377
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,280
his mom's really sick.

378
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,120
Nobody knows exactly what it is,

379
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,840
only that it's life-or-death.

380
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,080
She wanted him to donate marrow.

381
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,760
Now she's terrified of dying
and suddenly remembers she's got a son.

382
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,160
Only he would be that dumb.

383
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,080
The second he heard she was sick,
he dropped everything and went.

384
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,920
If you ask me,

385
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,040
he still hasn't let go of her.

386
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,760
And with his birthday coming up,

387
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,520
he's probably even hoping

388
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
she'll remember.

389
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,160
<i>I've heard donating marrow</i>
<i>hurts like hell.</i>

390
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,080
And he's over there all by himself,

391
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,800
with no one by his side
to ask if he's in pain.

392
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,120
It's just too pitiful.

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,920
I need to ask you something.

401
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,480
What is it?

402
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,040
Am I…

403
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,720
really not your son?

I know you.

407
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,160
You can fight through this.

<i>Sorry…</i>

429
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,160
I didn't have my phone with me.

430
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,320
I missed your calls.

431
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,040
Maimai told me everything.

432
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,040
Are you calling

433
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,920
to ask me to go to Jiangbei for you?

434
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,400
<i>Of course not.</i>

435
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,520
I'm calling because I dreamed about you.

<i>I wanted to ask if you like</i>

<i>tofu cake.</i>

438
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,240
Back when I was in Jiangbei,

439
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,160
there's this little shop.

440
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,560
We used to go there a lot.
The cake was amazing.

441
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,160
<i>If you want some,</i>

442
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,520
<i>I could bring it back.</i>

443
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,440
Forget it. Let's go together sometime.

Even if you came,

449
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,920
I wouldn't have time.

450
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,800
So, no meet-ups?

451
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
No meet-ups.

452
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,560
Fine.

453
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,080
Yu Ziyang!

454
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,080

Yu Ziyang!

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,480
I missed you so much.

457
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,000
My sweet boy,

458
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,480
let me take a good look at you.
You've lost weight.

459
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,960
Leaving so soon?

460
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,280
You went through all that trouble
for such a performance.

461
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,000
You didn't have to.

462
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,360
I know. It's Li Zhuofeng who's sick.

463
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,480
You're sharp.

464
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,160
I practiced in front of the mirror
for days to make it convincing.

465
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,760
I won't let you leave empty-handed.

466
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,160
Take this. Call it compensation.

467
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,600
This is what I owe my dad.

468
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,480
The bone marrow…

469
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,000
Use it on whoever you want.

470
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,960
I don't care to know.

471
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,200
Fine.

472
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,240
Have it your way.

473
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,000
Come on. Let's go home.

474
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,360
I made you spicy chicken

475
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,280
and braised pork.

476
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,920
- And more?
- Of course.

477
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,200
Everything you love.

478
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,320
Now hurry up.

479
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,360
Okay!

480
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,320
What are you doing at the station?

481
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,320
Someone sneaks off to Jiangbei

482
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,520
without a word,

483
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,080
and I can't block his way back?

484
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
My fault.

485
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,480
Here, tofu cake for you.

486
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,480
How did things go in Jiangbei? All sorted?

487
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,640
More or less.

488
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,680
It's over.

489
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,960
That trip

490
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,000
drained you enough.

491
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,440
Any more and you'd collapse.

492
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,320
EXIT

493
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,120
Got your seatbelt on?

494
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,320
Okay, let's go.

495
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,080
Got plans later?

496
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,480
Nothing important.

497
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,800
Then come to my place.

498
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,720
Mr. Li, after you.

499
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,640
Ready?

500
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,080
Happy Birthday!

501
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,440
I was planning to throw you
a grand ceremony.

502
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,680
but you ran off to Jiangbei,

503
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,360
so this is all that's left.

504
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,280
But I baked this myself.

505
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,640
My first cake ever.

506
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,000
And since you bought me tofu cake,

507
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,360
I guess we can call it a mutual love.

508
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,960
Grand ceremony and mutual love.

509
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,280
That's not how those words are used.

510
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,680
I'll use them however I want.
I'll be right back.

511
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,120
Li Jinyu, look!

512
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
This is my gift for you.

513
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,880
Out of nowhere, you're giving me goldfish?

514
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,040
So your little black fish
won't be all alone.

515
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,560
You'll have a role model now.

516
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,120
No more loneliness,

517
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
just some lively company.

518
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,960
And the next step…

519
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,520
Come on.

520
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,080
Make a wish first.

521
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,200
Li Jinyu! You'll need
to make a wish before you…

522
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,040
Not before you make your wish.

523
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,360
Try the cake.

524
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,680
It's my first time baking,

525
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,600
but I think it actually turned out okay.

526
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,960
THANK YOU FOR FLYING WITH US
FROM NINGSUI TO JIANGBEI

527
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,200
- Have a bite.
- Were you in Jiangbei?

528
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,320
Your cousin was worried
something might happen to you.

529
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,440
So, I went in her place.

530
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,600
Then why didn't you tell me?

531
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,840
What do you mean? I told you on the phone.

532
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,120
But you didn't want to meet up.

533
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,440
So you just left like that.

534
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,480
I went to Jiangbei alone,
but someone wouldn't even see me.

535
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,040
My heart was already in pieces.
How could I stay?

536
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,600
What's wrong?

537
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,440
Do you still want to give us a try?

538
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,280
Ye Meng.

539
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,680
Do you still want to be with me?

540
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,480
Forget it.

541
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,000
Pretend I didn't say anything.

542
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,760
Let me…

543
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,480
Let me ask you.

544
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Are you asking me this

545
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,880
because you actually love me,

546
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,800
or just because you're touched right now?

547
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,880
Because I want to be with someone
who truly loves me.

548
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,360
So, I'm not in a rush for an answer.

549
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,640
Take your time.

550
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,920
Eat your cake.

551
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,600
Go on. Taste it.

552
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,560
Though, I can't promise it isn't poisoned.

553
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,120
Look at that smiley face.
It looks just like you.

554
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,640
You should smile more often.

555
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,640
