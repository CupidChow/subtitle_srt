ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>DEEP AFFECTION EYES</i>
BY ER DONG TU ZI ON JJWXC.NET

2
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,640
I used to be into younger guys,

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
but after the Spring Festival,
I've decided to be realistic.

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,200
- Here is your dish.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Say something.

6
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,600
You know why I came to find you today?

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,840
Jiayu has this practice problem here,

8
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,040
- and you're going to solve it for me.
- Who told you to say that?

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,320
They're over there
trash-talking younger guys.

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,240
Nothing to say in defense?

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,520
Just eat.

12
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,800
I do think women mature

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,720
faster than men of the same age.

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,760
Younger guys are too playful.

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,280
They're not really suited
for anything long-term.

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,720
He said we're immature!

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,000
Especially

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,360
for an independent woman like you, Ms. Ye.

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,120
I think you should consider
someone mature, maybe a year or two older,

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
emotionally stable,

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,560
financially secure, someone who can

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
truly support you.

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,280
Listen, man.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,360
This is called youth and vitality.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,400
All the cool ladies nowadays
are into younger guys.

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,600
Who'd want to date some boring guy
with a poker face, right?

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,120
I wasn't talking about you!
What I mean is…

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,160
He…

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,280
He's older doesn't mean
he's emotionally stable!

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,680
Especially the ones with glasses.
It makes my blood pressure spike!

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
I… I think…

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,320
what Dr. Gao meant was that

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,200
compared to younger men,

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,760
older men might be
better equipped to solve problems.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
- Yes.
- It's a personality thing!

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,800
What does age have to do with it?

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,400
Younger guys are sincere and passionate.

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,640
And the older ones? Aside from being
greasy, they're just full of schemes.

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,360
What else could they possibly offer?

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,760
Not all older guys are greasy.

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,000
And plenty of younger guys
are mature and thoughtful too.

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,120
But younger guys
have less romantic experience.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,400
They simply don't know how to care
for someone else. You have to admit that.

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,520
Wait.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,360
Having a ton of romantic experience
is something to brag about now?

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm not bragging! I'm just saying
they don't know how to care for people!

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,320
We younger guys
can take care of people too!

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,320
Who said it was about you?

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
- We were just chatting.
- He's actually pretty interesting.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,480
It's nothing, really!

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Have something to eat.

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,560
Wow, you're pretty quick for an old timer!

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,400
Finished talking?

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
Just a discussion.

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,920
I don't think
your discussion was meaningful.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,040
A woman like Ms. Ye deserves to be with
someone of equal education and background,

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,800
a quality man with good upbringing,

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
someone who can offer her a real future.

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
So, you're talking about me?

60
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,960
Just because you're highly educated,
you look down on the three of us,

61
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,800
- who only graduated from junior high?
- That's not it.

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,240
A degree doesn't mean you're cultured.

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,240
Good manners don't mean
you have a good heart.

64
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,160
A good upbringing
doesn't guarantee a future.

65
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,160
- A good future doesn't mean compatibility.
- Enough!

66
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,920
Can you stop this now?

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,680
Sorry about that.

68
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,320
My friend here
has been a bit sensitive lately.

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
You might have struck a nerve. So…

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,080
What nerve? I'm not sensitive at all!

71
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,120
Okay! That's enough from both of you.

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
Stop ganging up on him.

73
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,600
We young boys listen

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,600
and follow the ladies' words.
You could learn.

75
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,960
- Please, have a seat.
- Okay.

76
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,519
- Sorry about that, Dr. Gao.
- It's all good.

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,400
Go on. Dig in.

78
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm seething.

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,400
Please eat! Thanks.

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,680
SPICY STEAMED RED SNAPPER, SCALLOPS
WITH GARLIC SAUCE, SEAFOOD FRIED RICE

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,120
MARINATED SEAFOOD MEDLEY
SPICY CHILI CLAMS

82
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,680
THE OLD FISHERMAN'S BAY

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,840
- Paid. Thanks, Boss.
- Take care!

84
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,080
Ya'en!

85
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,240
What's he doing here?

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,720
I met you at the wedding.
You're the guy from Ye Meng's blind date.

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,640
Hello.

88
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,040
It's their gathering.
What are you even doing here?

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,240
Come with me.

90
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,320
Who's going with you? What's your problem?

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,840
It's nothing urgent, really.

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,040
I was thinking we should invest
on an education fund for our kid.

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
All my colleagues
are talking about it lately.

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
It got me thinking
we should get one for our son too.

95
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,680
Did you come here for the investment,

96
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,200
or just to show off your new car?

97
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,840
Businesspeople upgrade cars all the time.

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,760
Ye Meng, since you're friends,
convince her.

99
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,560
Like I said before, blunt but true,

100
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,520
wouldn't a stable option be better?

101
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,000
Not really.

102
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,480
I just hope I can be
Ms. Ye's backup option.

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,760
If I'm qualified to be her backup,

104
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,160
at least that proves I, Gao Yuan,
am not completely hopeless, right?

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,520
Come on, Dr. Gao. You're way too humble!
With your credentials, you'd be

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,520
the top catch in Ningsui's dating scene.

107
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,080
Are you done here?

108
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,640
If you really want to be a good father,

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,080
go home and reflect on yourself.

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,240
Stop disappearing
every time Jiayu needs you.

111
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,120
Who the hell are you to judge me?

112
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,120
You left your kid home alone

113
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
just to party, and you dare lecture me?

114
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Who left their kid home alone?

115
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,960
When did you see me "partying"?

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640
I just went out for dinner!

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,440
- So, it's fine for you to feast and party?
- How dare you lecture me?

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,840
Look at this crowd,

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,640
eating, drinking, partying!

120
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
- What is it then?
- Hey, you.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Enough with the yapping.

122
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,560
Just back off already.

123
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,720
Ugh, you're so annoying.

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
We're just friends having dinner.
Stop killing the mood.

125
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,280
Chen Jian,

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,680
if you want to see the kid,
go to Jiayu's grandma's place.

127
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
What are you making a scene here for?

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,200
Go ahead. Keep hanging out
with these lowlifes.

129
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,760
Soon enough, you'll rub off on our son.

130
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,600
Who touched my car?

131
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
Who did this?

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,120
Which son of a bitch was it?

133
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
Who?

134
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,920
Let's go somewhere else to sit.

135
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,720
Come over to my place.

136
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Sure.

137
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,320
- Let's go.
- Go.

138
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,040
Let's go.

139
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,760
Car wash fee?

140
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,800
You think I care about your damn money?

141
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,880
Audis have four rings, and yours?
Four rotten eggs?

142
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,920
Custom-made?

143
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,720
Wash off that egg white already.
Once it dries, you'll never get it off.

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,480
Wow, your bar is really nice.

145
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,600
It's okay.

146
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
Maimai!

147
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,520
- Maimai.
- Escort them in.

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,760
Dr. Gao,

149
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,160
order whatever you want today.

150
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,800
- It's all on me, the younger guy.
- Fine.

151
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,960
- I'll go make a quick call.
- Got it, bro!

152
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,520
- Yan'en, Ye Meng! Long time no see!
- Yeah.

153
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,520
- Take a seat. I'll grab the drinks menu.
- Fine.

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,040
I need to use the restroom.

155
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,080
Maimai,

156
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,480
what've you been up to lately?

157
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,720
- Wanna do some part-time work?
- Have a seat, Dr. Gao.

158
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,440
- Sure! What is it?
- What do you want to drink?

159
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,920
- Let me text you on WeChat.
- Fine.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,840
Thank you.

161
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,440
Come on.

162
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll transfer the car wash payment to you.

163
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Don't worry about it.

164
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,080
Let's pay separately.
That's what you prefer.

165
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
Where were you?

166
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,680
Dr. Gao is here with Ye Meng.

167
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,720
Is this the music you like?

168
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
I really want to know
what kind of music you're into.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,039
No offense,

170
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,080
but if you don't make a move soon, you'll
end up being someone else's groomsman.

171
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
Dr. Gao,

172
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,400
do you usually work out?

173
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,920
As long as there's no surgery,
I make time for it.

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,640
What about you, Ms. Ye?

175
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,080
He's asking if you work out.

176
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,800
I don't workout much,

177
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
but I do go for runs occasionally.

178
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,880
Good evening. Thank you all for coming.

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,840
Tonight, I'll sing a very special song.

180
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
One that means a lot to me.

181
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,440
It was sung to me by someone important.

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,400
That night, she was drunk

183
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,520
and said so many drunken words.

184
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,240
Li Jinyu,

185
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,240
if anyone ever tells you

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,640
you're not qualified,

187
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,880
send them to me.

188
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,720
From now on,

189
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,080
let me conquer the world for you.

190
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,160
I wonder if that person

191
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
still remembers any of it.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,240
<i>Your eyes</i>

193
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,840
<i>Like shooting stars in the night</i>

194
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,560
<i>Streaking</i>

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,600
<i>Across frozen borders</i>

196
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,800
<i>To pierce my heart's defenses</i>

197
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,520
<i>Just like that, conquered</i>

198
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,000
<i>A black goldfish</i>

199
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,200
<i>Stranded in desert sands</i>

200
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,560
<i>Even if all memories fade</i>

201
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,760
<i>Your silhouette lingers</i>

202
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,480
<i>Etched in my mind</i>

203
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,640
<i>Every time I gaze at you, longing to near</i>

204
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,760
<i>I drown, unasked, in reverie</i>

205
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,040
<i>Those accidental heartbeats</i>

206
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,880
<i>How could I ever discard them?</i>

207
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,680
<i>If you sensed my turmoil, my retreat</i>

208
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,960
<i>Know it's only because I care too deeply</i>
<i>The courage I threw away</i>

209
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,720
<i>Where does it hide now?</i>

210
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,040
<i>With the last of my strength</i>
<i>I'd reach to hold you</i>

211
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
<i>Don't you dare doubt it</i>

212
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
With how Li Jinyu acted today?

213
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,600
No doubt about it. He's totally into you.

214
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
I'm a bit tired.

215
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,480
I'll head back first.

216
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,680
LIU'S MORNING EATS

217
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,800
STEAMED STUFFED BUNS 3 YUAN, STEAMED BUNS
1.5 YUAN, FRIED DOUGH STICKS 2 YUAN

218
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,800
Thank you.

219
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,120
- A sesame ball and a bowl of soy milk.
- Okay.

220
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,320
- I've paid, Boss.
- Okay. Take care.

221
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,520
JIJI'S SATAY NOODLES

222
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,720
Not going mountain climbing.
I'm exhausted.

223
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,040
Here you go, miss.

224
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,400
- Please enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

225
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,640
The beach sounds alright.
Then, let's go watch the sunset.

226
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,960
What are you doing?

227
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,360
I've changed the water for your goldfish.

228
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,200
Who said you could touch it?

229
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
This helps them sunbathe properly.

230
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,240
Prevents black spot disease.

231
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,640
How can you tell
it has black spot disease?

232
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
Ye Meng told me.

233
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,840
That day at the bar,
she offered me a side gig.

234
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,640
I thought it was some regular job,

235
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,000
but turns out she paid me just
to help you change the goldfish's water

236
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,000
and give them sun.

237
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,680
She said they get black spots

238
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,000
from dirty water

239
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,440
or lack of sunlight.

240
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,680
Look.

241
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Just some sunshine and this black fish
is already way more lively.

242
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,040
Gotta send Ye Meng a progress report.

243
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
YE MENG

244
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,360
Where'd Ye Meng go?

245
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,320
Her WeChat Moments are stunning!

246
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,200
The beach sounds alright.
Then, let's go watch the sunset.

247
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,360
Hah! Who else but me?

248
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Best wingman ever!

249
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,400
WARNING: STRONG WAVES, PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS

250
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,720
<i>I used to be into younger guys,</i>

251
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,880
<i>but after this Spring Festival,</i>
<i>I've decided to be realistic.</i>

252
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,320
Li Jinyu!

253
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,920
What are you doing?

254
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,640
I thought you'd left already.

255
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,240
What? You own the ocean now?
Can't I come back if I want?

256
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,000
So, why did you come back then?

257
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,359
Were you afraid

258
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,280
I'd jump into the sea?

259
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
No.

260
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,839
Love turned to hate.
I came back to kill you actually.

261
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,120
Ye Meng.

262
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,160
Do you still want me?

263
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
You can ride a bike, right?

264
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,760
- Yeah.
- Then take that one.

265
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,840
Can you slow down a bit?

266
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,720
Is this all you've got? Not enough for me.

267
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,720
What the hell is going on here?

268
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,520
What happened?

269
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,800
Nothing.

270
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,240
Out of battery?

271
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,760
Must be broken.

272
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,240
- Shall I take over?
- That's alright.

273
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,240
I got this.

274
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,160
Seriously, no help needed?

275
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,560
Alright, you do it.

276
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,520
Hurry up,

277
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,360
or we won't get home before dawn.

278
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,640
You're way too fast.
How are you so energetic?

279
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,400
I just twisted my wrist.

280
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
I can't walk anymore.
My knees are killing me.

281
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,320
So?

282
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,680
Give me your hand.

283
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,600
Here's the fare.

284
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,280
- I'll just sit here then.
- Do you have a heart?

285
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,560
Now I have to push you too?

286
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,280
You're being quite the gentleman today.
And you already charged me. Go ahead.

287
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,840
- Fine.
- Thanks.

288
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,960
Just so you know,
if you fall, that's on you.

289
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,480
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

290
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,920
- No.
- Listen up.

291
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,840
I'm not getting down!

292
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,920
Why are you walking so fast?

293
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,600
- I'm going to bed. Goodnight.
- Wait. Hold on a sec.

294
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,800
Ye Meng.

295
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,840
Can you please stop being mad at me?

296
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Who said I was mad?

297
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,320
Then what are you doing?

298
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,040
I simply don't wish
to engage with you right now.

299
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,840
Fine. Ignore me all you want.

300
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,880
But come take your goldfish back.

301
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,480
Fine. I'll take all of them!

302
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,680
- Where's the camera on Ping'an?
- It's missing.

303
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,640
Is it missing or did you throw it away?

304
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,960
So, this is how it ends?

305
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,600
You'd sever every tie between us?

306
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,440
Even the last living memory of Ping'an.

307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Fine. Just give me a container.
I'll take my fish and go.

308
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,480
You really don't want me?

309
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,320
Wasn't it you who pushed me away?

310
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,120
I regret it now.

311
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,520
Don't you try the "victim act" on me.
It won't work.

312
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,120
Li Jinyu, what are you doing?

313
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,280
What are you doing, Li Jinyu?

314
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,120
So, you're so proactive
because of Dr. Gao?

315
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
When are you going to cut
things off with Dr. Gao for good?

316
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,120
And what if I don't?

317
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,680
It doesn't matter anyway.

318
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,240
He's a doctor. He's never got time.

319
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,200
I don't have a steady job.
I've got all the time.

320
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm always on call.

321
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
The kid's is getting bad now.

322
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,240
Was it you who told Qiao Maimai

323
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,160
to change the goldfish's water?

324
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,200
So, it was a goldfish

325
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,440
that saved my dying love.

326
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,480
The one who was saved…

327
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,400
was me.

328
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,440
Why so emotional now?

329
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,440
I've always thought I was trash.

330
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,160
I didn't want to drag you down.

331
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,160
Honestly, being a loser isn't so bad.

332
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,680
Take me. I quite like
being a piece of quiet trash.

333
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,640
Nobody pays me any attention,

334
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,320
and nobody talks about me.

335
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,160
Well, I could never be like you,

336
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,760
do whatever you want.

337
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,600
At the very least,

338
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,240
I can't get fat and ugly.

339
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,120
Because you're shallow.

340
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,600
You only care about looks.

341
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,520
How am I supposed to seduce you
if I let myself go?

342
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,160
When did you seduce me?

343
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
Now.

344
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,560
Listen.

345
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,480
To what?

346
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,520
Close your eyes.

347
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,840
The magnolias are blooming.

348
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,560
MAY PROSPERITY RISE LIKE THE EASTERN SUN

349
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,640
Let me give you some water to drink.

350
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,800
Thank you.

351
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,120
- Good-looking?
- Yes.

352
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,320
Since I'm so good-looking,

353
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,840
you really spent
the whole morning planting flowers?

354
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,240
I mean the flowers.

355
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,920
First day together, and you're already
eyeing "the flowers outside"?

356
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,680
I swear I'll rip out
every single one of these!

357
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,080
Go ahead.

358
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,040
You're the expert.
You've done this before.

359
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,880
What?

360
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,440
Those flowers from Spring Festival?

361
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,440
They died from the frost.

362
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,320
You actually thought I dug them up

363
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,280
because of you?

364
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,000
It haunts you

365
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,880
that I threw those flowers away.

366
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,880
You couldn't sleep all night.

367
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,240
No.

368
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,000
When did you start liking me?

369
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,000
And when did I become
so unbearably important to you?

370
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,040
Where are you off to?

371
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,360
I'll visit Grandma later. First, shower.

372
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,120
You're so guilty.

373
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,600
Spill it now. I'm dying to know.

374
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,800
What?

375
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
Such a clean freak!

376
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,880
Didn't you just shower last night?

377
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,560
What's wrong with being clean?

378
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,480
Oh yeah, Mister Clean over here.

379
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,280
Like I'm some kind of swamp monster?

380
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
I shower daily too.

381
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,560
By the way,

382
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,600
the bathroom door's broken.

383
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,720
No peeking!

384
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,920
I'm not a pervert!
Why would I be staring at you?

385
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,320
Don't you dare take it off.

386
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,040
Oops, it fell. Sorry.

387
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
Fine.

388
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Li Jinyue.

389
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,360
What was that about yesterday?

390
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,640
What's wrong?

391
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,960
Should we maybe
pay a bit more attention to…

392
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,400
Well, I…

393
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,040
Li Jinyu.

394
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,640
Getting nervous?

395
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,240
Nervous?

396
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Why would I be nervous?
There's nothing to be nervous about.

397
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm gonna go take a shower.

398
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,920
You are nervous.

399
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,320
Are all you ladies this bold?

400
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,520
Girls are normally
more preserved, aren't they?

401
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,120
I won't be called lady sister
if I am not bold.

402
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Why are you missing two goldfish?

403
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,880
I've isolated the two

404
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,720
with black spot disease
for antibiotic treatment.

405
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,440
Reintegration with the group

406
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,160
will commence after full recovery.

407
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,800
Kind of regret it now.

408
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,920
Should've gotten you
a different birthday gift.

409
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,680
Like…

410
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,880
Llike a turtle.

411
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,000
Healthy, long-lived, easy to care for.

412
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,040
Then you wouldn't have
pushed me away on New Year's Eve.

413
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
You've got some nerve.

414
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,240
What makes you think
it had anything to do with you?

415
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,480
Because I'm smart. I know everything.

416
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,560
Know what?

417
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,240
<i>So, about you and Ye Meng.</i>
<i>She's really not coming back to Jiangbei?</i>

418
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,440
So, you're still texting your ex, huh?

419
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,840
No. We don't talk.

420
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,400
Who even texts their ex out of nowhere?

421
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,080
I've never replied.

422
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,720
I don't buy it.

423
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,880
- Look for yourself. See?
- I refuse.

424
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,680
You must delete them all.

425
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,960
You think I could have deleted
all that in such a short time?

426
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,080
- Come with me to the farmer's market.
- What for?

427
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,760
No more questions. Go get changed. Go!

428
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,760
From now on,
I'll take care of the goldfish.

429
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,680
You take care of this.

430
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,680
I think you're implying something.

431
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,040
Don't you already have Jiang Luzhi?

432
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,440
This gift is perfect for you.
It's symbolic.

433
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,080
- I'll take this one, please.
- Sure, that'll be 45 yuan.

434
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,520
Besides,

435
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,440
you're breaking up with me
over a goldfish.

436
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,360
Even for the sake of our relationship,

437
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,120
you should at least raise one
that lives a hundred years.

438
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,560
Seriously? This again?

439
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
- I've paid.
- Sure.

440
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,720
Take it.

441
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,600
As a qualified boyfriend,
I still need to make it up to you.

442
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,840
Let's go on a date.

443
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,720
Alright,

444
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,200
you treat me to a movie,
I'll treat you to dinner.

445
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,360
Salmon steak or maybe
the biggest chain in town.

446
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,880
- The biggest chain in town.
- Are you sure?

447
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,880
Let's go get some
braised chicken with rice.

448
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,640
Is it too late to switch to the salmon?

449
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,360
- Hello.
- <i>Chen Jian is going to be here.</i>

450
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,080
<i>Can you take Jiayu out for a bit?</i>

451
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,280
<i>Bring him back after his dad leaves.</i>

452
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,600
- What does he want this time?
- <i>He doesn't want the divorce.</i>

453
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,800
<i>So he just shows up</i>
<i>at the shop every day to pester me.</i>

454
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,120
Okay. I'm on my way.

455
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,360
What's wrong?

456
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,280
Let's go. Let's switch to the kids' meal.

457
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,240
FANTASIA LAND

458
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,080
The amusement park again?

459
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm way too old for that.
No way I'm going.

460
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,040
- How old are you?
- I'm eight years old.

461
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,040
Eight-year-olds
love the amusement park the most.

462
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,280
- Let's go.
- Go.

463
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,520
No!

464
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,560
- I'm not going!
- Come on.

465
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,840
So cute!

466
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,920
HAPPY CARNIVAL

467
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,720
- Come on.
- I'm not going! It's too scary!

468
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,000
Okay, get ready! Three, two… Jiayu, smile!

469
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,440
- Can you take a picture for us?
- Can you get a shot of us?

470
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,760
- What should we do next?
- Anything you want.

471
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,720
Haunted house!

472
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,800
I'm too young for this. I'm exhausted.

473
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,400
You two go on ahead.
I just want to sit here quietly for a bit.

474
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,160
Chen Jiayu!

475
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,080
This is an amusement park.

476
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,760
He's scared of ghosts.

477
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,800
Are you scared of ghosts?

478
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,560
Don't be ridiculous.

479
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,960
Ms. Ye can be a bit childish.

480
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,280
I'm leaving her in your hands.

481
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,520
I'd recommend the Ferris wheel over there.

482
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,239
It's more romantic than the haunted house
and offers more privacy.

483
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,280
I won't be a third wheel.

484
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,040
And if you need me
to take a picture for you,

485
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
just call me.

486
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,520
I gotta show Ya'en

487
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,719
what this guy usually reads.

488
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,719
I can hear you.

489
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,480
Alright.

490
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,920
You just wait over there for us.
We'll be right back.

491
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,920
Go on.

492
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,520
- Let's go.
- Go where?

493
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,159
- You're treating this like a date.
- What else would it be?

494
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,880
What about the kid?

495
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,120
If we have kids someday, there's no way
I'm letting you take care of them.

496
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,040
- Let's get some water.
- Let's go.

497
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,199
MEMBER'S DAY
PLEASE PROCEED TO DESIGNATED AREAS.

498
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,800
Wang Sisi?

499
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,080
It really is you!

500
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,040
Wang Sisi,

501
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,040
what are you doing
at the amusement park all by yourself?

502
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,520
I just needed to get some air.
What are you doing here?

503
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,720
I…

504
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,920
I was forced to come here and "work."

505
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Wang Sisi,

506
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,600
why did you stick
so many blue tears on your mask?

507
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,080
Because I feel like the little mermaid.

508
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,240
A mermaid is in the water.

509
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,880
But when she's on land,

510
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,840
everyone can see her tears.

511
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,480
School's starting soon.

512
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,040
I don't like school.

513
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,720
And I don't like people seeing my tears.

514
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,120
Have you told your parents
or your teacher about this?

515
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,560
I already told Mom.

516
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,880
But she has my little brother now.
She's busy working to provide for him.

517
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,360
She doesn't have time for me anymore.

518
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,280
I'm afraid she'll scold me
for being difficult.

519
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,720
I'm even more afraid that
she'll get angry and stop loving me.

520
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,640
So, I just stopped talking about it.

521
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,080
That's not true.
Your mom definitely loves you.

522
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,960
It's you, Grim Reaper.

523
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,200
But did you tell your mom

524
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,800
why you don't like school?

525
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,720
Every time I try to talk about it,

526
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,720
Mom just yells at me.

527
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
It only makes me feel worse.

528
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,760
Grim Reaper, do you have any candy?

529
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,800
Can we still play the game
where you guess which pocket it's in?

530
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,200
How about we switch
to a different game today?

531
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,440
After all, we have everyone else
to consider too.

532
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,200
Fine.

533
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I think your mask is really well done.

534
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,480
On your way home tonight,

535
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,320
make sure to keep it on.

536
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,960
When you get home,
your mom is sure to notice.

537
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,400
Then you can tell her
why you made it this way.

538
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,320
But it would be so weird to wear it.

539
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
So many people would stare at me.

540
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
It's okay.

541
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,600
We're all with you today.

542
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,920
Once you have the mask on,
you can make any face you want.

543
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,960
Do whatever you want, cry or laugh.

544
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,440
And whoever
takes their mask off first is out.

545
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,880
Come on. Let's make a game of it.

546
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,440
Here,

547
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,320
this is for you. Grab one for me.

548
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,680
What color do you want?
What color are you making yours now?

549
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
- Sisi, are you tired?
- Not really.

550
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

551
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,960
Thank you so much for all your help today.

552
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,360
You went off by yourself
without even telling me!

553
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,680
I've been looking all over for you!

554
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,600
It's alright.
Sisi is being such a good girl.

555
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,800
Sisi,

556
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,600
don't you have something
you want to tell Mom?

557
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,880
Remember?

558
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,360
Goodbye.

559
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Thanks.

560
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,280
Is Sisi…

561
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,160
A child's emotions
can change in an instant.

562
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,000
However, if the parents
can pick up on it quickly,

563
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,080
they should be able to help
the child adjust in no time.

564
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,000
I regret it now.

565
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,360
I should have made a pair with you,
like a Harley Quinn duo or something.

566
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,920
I think what you have is really great.
You're just like a little sun.

567
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,280
You know what?

568
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,120
You're even better

569
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,040
than I imagined.

570
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,960
Really?

571
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,560
Yes.

572
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,480
Jiayu is back.

573
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Where is Wang Sisi?

574
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,280
Her mom came to pick her up.

575
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,920
Here.

576
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,520
Why don't you head back first?

577
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,880
I'll take Jiayu to find a milk tea shop,

578
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,640
stay with him while he finishes homework,
and then we should come back too.

579
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,840
No way.

580
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,680
We came together, and we leave together.

581
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,720
Someone came to pick him up.

582
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,640
Who?

583
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,040
What's so urgent?

584
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,640
Pick someone up.

585
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,880
It's him.

586
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,160
Come on.

587
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,880
That tutoring last time
finally came in handy.

588
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,040
You actually did the extra tutoring?

589
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,520
No! Don't listen to him.

590
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,760
- Why?
- It's my new hobby.

591
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,200
- Let's go then.
- My passion is Math Olympiad.

592
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,400
Let me show you.

593
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,440
I've finished all the Olympiad problems.

594
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,560
- What are you doing up here?
- Just came to chat.

595
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,800
- I'm a bit cold.
- Give it to me.

596
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,840
- Come here.
- Sure.

597
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,080
What's on your mind?

598
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,120
I want to ask you a question.

599
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,960
Go ahead.

600
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,520
I had no right to ask before,
since I wasn't your boyfriend.

601
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
But now I do.

602
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,160
So, fess up.

603
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,160
What?

604
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,600
Exes. How many?

605
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,880
Three.

606
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,080
No way.

607
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,240
Can you please stop
getting jealous over nothing?

608
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,960
I know,

609
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,080
I have a history, and I'm your first love.

610
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,720
But if I had known someone like you
existed in this world,

611
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,200
I would have crawled my way
to you without a second thought.

612
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,120
See?

613
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,920
With your skills, there's no way
you've only had three boyfriends.

614
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,880
I'm giving you one opportunity to fess up.

615
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Six.

616
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,680
Actually, nine.

617
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,000
Sorry. Ten.

618
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,760
Are you just pulling numbers out of a hat?

619
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,560
I'm just messing with you! How could there
be that many? Seriously, it's three.

620
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,960
- Really?
- I swear. Three.

621
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,160
What about Gou Kai? Does he count?

622
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,360
Of course he doesn't count.

623
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,520
Why would I ever be
with a shady businessman like him?

624
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,280
But what's really weird is you.

625
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,040
You seem especially hung up on Gou Kai.

626
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,520
I'm still not over
that whole photo incident.

627
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,440
And didn't he say

628
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,560
he was going to personally come to take
you back after the Spring Festival?

629
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,680
The photos were just
from a team-building event.

630
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,240
And even if he comes to get me,
you think I'd actually go?

631
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,120
I won't even show my face.

632
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,640
You can just tell him to get lost.

633
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,920
Are you happy now?

634
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It's alright, I guess.

635
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,920
So, that was pretty good, right?
My attitude was spot-on.

636
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,480
How many have you had?
Right, your first love. I forgot.

637
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,800
You know full well why!

638
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,400
I do care, actually.

639
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,800
But a question just suddenly came to me.

640
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,000
Go ahead.

641
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,840
Would you mind clarifying something?

642
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,200
If I'm your first love,
then what was Jiang Luzhi?

643
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,800
What's that all about?

644
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,800
No.

645
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,360
Jiang Luzhi really wasn't.

646
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,360
Then what was she? Go on. Tell me.

647
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,360
It was only to get my grandma off my back.

648
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,200
She kept pushing me to get married
and wanted me to go on blind dates.

649
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,480
- So, I met her just the one time.
- Since when was it okay

650
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,760
for you to chase after Jiang Luzhi?

651
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,960
But when it was me pursuing you, you gave
me the cold shoulder every single day!

652
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
- That's completely--
- And you're still so sarcastic.

653
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,840
That's completely different!

654
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,440
How is it different? Then tell me today!

655
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,080
How is it different? Exactly how?

656
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,360
Of course I can't just use you
to fool Grandma, right?

657
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,400
Why?

658
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,080
Because…

659
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,440
- I like you.
- Then…

660
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,680
To the…

661
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,560
Say it to the sun.

662
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,680
So cold. Quick, cover up!

663
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,160
Speak it to the sun.

664
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,520
That day at the lighthouse,

665
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,000
what really happened
between you and Dr. Gao?

666
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,240
What "Dr. Gao"?
What are you even talking about?

667
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,080
- That day when you sent the photo.
- I don't get what you're saying.

668
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,040
You're so beautiful.

669
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,840
- Just relax a bit.
- Really?

670
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,600
Look sideways, sideways!

671
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,600
Hold still!

672
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,280
Let me elongate your legs.

673
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,320
Okay, 3-2-1 go!

674
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,440
Got it! My God!

675
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,760
- Really?
- See.

676
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,280
- These all look great, right?
- You are talented!

677
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,600
Okay, I'll send them to you.

678
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,360
- Send them now.
- Come on!

679
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,200
This shot needs zero retouching.

680
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,560
- Impressive! You've really improved.
- I guess it's alright.

681
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,480
Don't you need to go pick up your kid?

682
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,760
- It's the weekend.
- Take your time. I'll just relax a bit.

683
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,160
It's fine. I'll stay with you for a while.

684
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,080
Go keep Jiayu company.

685
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,680
I'll be fine alone. Go!

686
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,880
- Really?
- Go!

687
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,880
Why?

688
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,440
WAITING FOR THE SUNSET
