1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,904
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:15,518
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,303
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:20,832
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,984
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:31,232
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,720
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,184
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:42,816
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:49,088
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:53,824
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,904
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,904 --> 00:01:01,088
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,104
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,072
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,968
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,296
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,351
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,328
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:20,343
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,420
 

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,180
 
Please don't be too harsh on him.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,940
Jin Yu has been suffering from
mental illnesses for many years.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,640
His psychiatrist is here today.

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,800
 
You'll know the details about his illness later.

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,488
But regardless of the reasons,
this is all my fault.

27
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:56,780
 

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,000
In the spirit of being responsible to everyone,

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,300
Li Jin Yu will completely withdraw
from Hailan Bay.

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,860
I'll share responsibility
for this incident with him.

31
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,300
Hanhai Group will permanently
relinquish control of Hailan Bay.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,120
 
The Lin Group will take it over.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm Lin Yang Yang from the Lin Group.

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,300
We'll dismantle the current Phase II construction

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,600
and rebuild Hailan Bay.

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,580
We welcome villagers
to supervise the reconstruction.

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,660
Therefore, I hereby announce...

38
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,480
What's going on?

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,536
What's going on?

40
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:38,840
What is this?

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,440
What's going on?

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,780
- Look!
- Look at the screen.

43
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,420
Look!

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,408
Record this.

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
What are you doing?

46
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,344
Shut up!

47
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,600
Is it ready yet?

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Shut up! It's done.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,900
Be quiet.

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,220
Stop blabbering!

51
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:08,380
Who's this?

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,260
Hello everyone, I'm Ye Meng,
PR manager of Hailan Bay.

53
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,440
As you can see,

54
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,480
this is the footage on the Phase II
construction site from a week ago.

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,860
You can clearly see

56
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,740
that all construction materials met regulations.

57
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,500
Miss Lin, you can verify this, right?

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,480
But after the incident,

59
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,920
all materials mysteriously became non-compliant.

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,800
Coincidentally, surveillance footage
from that period was tampered with.

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,440
Ms. Li, as the chief responsible person
for this project,

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Li Jin Yu wouldn't sabotage
his own project, would he?

63
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,740
I naturally hope Li Jin Yu isn't involved in this.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,520
But as an outsourced PR manager,

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,440
what authority do you have to represent him?

66
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,600
Moreover, you're disrupting public order.

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,960
Security, take her out.

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,800
What are you trying to do?

69
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,668
Who says I lack authority or standing?

70
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:25,120
 

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm Li Jin Yu's legally recognized spouse.

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,480
Do I qualify now?

73
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,940
Ms. Li, since you want Li Jin Yu
to leave the group so much,

74
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,860
you should communicate properly with him.

75
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,120
After all, he cares most about you, his mom.

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,260
Li Jin Yu got married?

77
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,100
Why did you hide this from me?

78
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,780
There's video evidence, but so what?

79
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,440
Who knows if Li Jin Yu staged this himself?

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,780
Maybe he is playing detective
to get away with this.

81
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,160
Li Jin Yu is mentally ill!

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,780
- What wouldn't a madman do?
- Exactly! Who'd believe a crazy person?

83
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,696
- Besides, in the video,
- Crazy people can do anything.

84
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,780
- did you capture whoever swapped the materials?
- Did you?

85
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,260
Right, it doesn't show anything!

86
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,776
- Is there proof?
- Exactly!

87
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:12,860
- There isn't any!
- It's too blurry.

88
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,008
- I captured it!
- What?

89
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,300
I recorded it.

90
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
That day, I happened to pass by the warehouse.

91
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,520
I saw someone acting suspicious,
so I filmed them with my phone.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,380
Come closer.

93
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,940
Be careful.

94
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,100
Push these over there.

95
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,780
 
Two more times, and we're done.

96
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,100
- I'll get back to work.
- Okay, go ahead.

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,600
You're the one who sabotaged the materials!

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,160
Not me! It wasn't me!

99
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,340
He's trying to escape! Stop him!

100
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,380
That's not me in the video!

101
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,700
Freeze! Where do you think you can run?

102
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,272
Not me.

103
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,992
- Behave yourself!
- You've been deceived!

104
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:55,040
Get out!

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,140
Ms. Li, who's really playing detective here?

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,080
Seems this was just a misunderstanding.

107
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,900
I'll hand that guy over to the police
for investigation.

108
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,640
However, considering project safety,

109
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,360
Jin Yu's current mental state
makes him unfit to manage Hailan Bay.

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,888
Hello, everyone.

111
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm Yang Bing Zhang,
Li Jin Yu's attending therapist.

112
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,220
Based on my professional expertise,

113
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,600
I certify that Li Jin Yu's mental state
is completely normal.

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,940
It won't affect his work.

115
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,480
Dr. Yang, you...

116
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,560
Ms. Li, that is Li Jin Yu's current diagnosis.

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,960
If you have doubts,

118
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,700
you may consult other professionals
for reevaluation.

119
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,740
Dr. Yang already confirmed
that Li Jin Yu has no mental issues.

120
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,960
This project was under Li Jin Yu's charge.

121
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,340
The best solution is to reinstate
Li Jin Yu as project head

122
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,500
to answer the public concerns.

123
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,260
Ms. Li, do you prefer

124
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,840
to keep publicly insisting
your son is mentally ill?

125
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,720
How could I want my son to be ill?

126
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,880
What mother doesn't love her child?

127
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,720
Please watch your words.

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,940
Bullshit! Li Ling Bai, shut your mouth!

129
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,420
I'm here to teach you a lesson. Let go!

130
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,480
Grandma.

131
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,440
- Grandma, why are you here?
- Let go!

132
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,420
You're a terrible mom.

133
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,040
Having a mom like you
is Li Jin Yu's greatest misfortune.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,940
Stop making a scene here.

135
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,160
If you dare to lie, why should I hold back?

136
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,380
Listen carefully!

137
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,000
This heartless woman

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,940
abandoned her own son before he was seven

139
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,420
on a stormy night with thunder roaring.

140
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,940
You wanted him to freeze to death, didn't you?

141
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,860
Where was your maternal instinct then?

142
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,016
Speak!

143
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,520
Exactly.

144
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,952
- Infuriating! What truth?
- Exactly!

145
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:20,640
How awful! She's a terrible mom.

146
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,160
Li Jin Yu never had any mental issues.

147
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,700
This cruel woman

148
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,160
forced my grandson to see a psychiatrist

149
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,640
and made him attend sessions daily.

150
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,040
She locked my grandson in a dark room

151
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,300
and hired outsiders to brainwash him

152
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,700
to make him believe he was sick.

153
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,220
You're the sick one!

154
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,700
I warned you.

155
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,740
I told you not to hurt my grandson again.

156
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,960
I'll haunt you till my dying breath.
Remember that!

157
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,220
Where are you going? I'm not done!

158
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,860
Grandma.

159
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,780
Don't be angry. Calm down.

160
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,200
That is a shameless woman!

161
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,420
Enough.

162
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,960
That's her biological son.

163
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,220
Suppress today's news coverage.

164
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,520
Avoid negative publicity for the company.

165
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,376
Yes, Ms. Li.

166
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,740
Look, Ms. Li.

167
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,400
The Lin Group won't clean up this mess.

168
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,320
Trying to use me as a pawn? You wish!

169
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,600
Honey.

170
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,120
Honey, I've been so worried these days.

171
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,580
How are you feeling?

172
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
Have you lost weight?

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,540
Are you feeling unwell?

174
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,080
I'm asking you. Are you feeling unwell?

175
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
I'm fine.

176
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,580
I was just thinking I married an amazing wife.

177
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,420
Look at me. I'm perfectly fine now.

178
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,928
Stop worrying.

179
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,700
Let's go home.

180
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,240
Alright.

181
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,040
 
 All construction materials meet regulations. 

182
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,920
 Miss Lin, you can testify that, right? 

183
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,460
What are you looking at?

184
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,512
This article says

185
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:46,740
a cool woman challenges

186
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,320
the CEO of Hanhai Group.

187
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,620
She's slim yet curvy. A real-life Barbie.

188
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,580
Okay, stop it.

189
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,960
Are you blushing?

190
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,900
Sure.

191
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,260
So, you can get embarrassed.

192
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,780
I looked confident at the press conference.

193
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,200
I was actually terrified.

194
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
When the police took you away, I was so worried.

195
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,080
But I wasn't worried at all.

196
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,800
Because I knew
my wife was the most capable person.

197
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,540
She'd come save me like a heroine.

198
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,800
What? Are we in a movie now?

199
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,120
Alright.

200
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,460
My fault for making you worry.

201
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,432
Let's sleep.

202
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,800
Li Jin Yu.

203
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,000
I'll protect you.

204
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,144
Okay.

205
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,960
Mom, I'm going out.

206
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
Where are you going?

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,192
School performance.

208
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,460
Kai is coming to pick me up later.

209
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,680
He's coming later?

210
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,568
Call him and tell him not to come.

211
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:18,780
I'll take you to school later.

212
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,432
Stop bothering others.

213
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,660
Ya En, I'm here to pick Jia Yu up.

214
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,160
Let's go, Kai.

215
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,304
Kai, don't bother.

216
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:35,740
I'm not busy today.

217
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,240
I'll take him to school.

218
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,820
I already promised. Don't overthink it.

219
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,780
I'm not overthinking. I'm free today, anyway.

220
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,960
I can send him to school. You do your work.

221
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,320
- Ya En.
- We're just...

222
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,856
I came with my friend.

223
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:51,584
Alright then.

224
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:54,080
You have customers now and can't leave now.

225
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,460
I'll send him to school today.
I already promised him.

226
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,240
Thank you then.

227
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,280
Let's go.

228
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,248
Jia Yu.

229
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,400
Should we call your dad for the performance?

230
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,460
I'll call him.

231
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,960
Mom, stop worrying about that.

232
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,940
We'll be late. Let's go!

233
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,760
- Bye.
- Bye.

234
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:25,620
You know what?

235
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,160
Chen Jia Yu's parents got divorced.

236
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,980
Really? Poor Chen Jia Yu.

237
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,320
Why am I pitiful?

238
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,820
Though my parents are divorced,

239
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,620
they're still my Mom and Dad.

240
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,540
Their love for me remains the same.

241
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,700
What's the problem?

242
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,000
What's wrong with divorce?

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,120
He has parents and me.

244
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,320
Who are you?

245
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,860
He's my buddy, Kai.

246
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,728
This is my buddy, Yu.

247
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,568
Stop laughing!

248
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,312
Go.

249
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,620
What play are you rehearsing?

250
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,500
Little Red Riding Hood vs. Wolf Grandma.

251
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,000
Little Red Riding Hood vs. Wolf Grandma?

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,160
Little Red Riding Hood is so strong now?

253
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
She can take on the Wolf Grandma alone?

254
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,440
Nope! Six against one.

255
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,030
Six against one?

256
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,120
Who's the poor kid in your class,

257
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,340
playing the punching-bag Wolf Grandma?

258
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,320
Jia Yu, we're waiting for you.

259
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,660
Go try on the Wolf Grandma costume.

260
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,608
Let's start the rehearsal.

261
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:39,712
You're playing Wolf Grandma?

262
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,960
Quickly get in position.

263
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,120
Stand properly!

264
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,032
Stay in your marks!

265
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,660
Jia Yu, knock and say your line.

266
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,360
Is Little Red Riding Hood home? It's Grandma.

267
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,160
Louder, Jia Yu.

268
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,540
The audience won't hear you otherwise.

269
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,872
Is Little Red Riding Hood home? It's Grandma.

270
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:16,960
Action!

271
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,240
Hit him!

272
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,620
Hit him!

273
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,960
Stop! It's not right.

274
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,120
- Come here.
- Come on.

275
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,700
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

276
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,160
They were hitting your head.

277
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,112
It's okay.

278
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,000
No wonder you asked me to take you there.

279
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,740
You knew you'd play the Grandma, didn't you?

280
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,280
I don't want Mom to see me get beaten as the wolf.

281
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,880
But she'll find out during the performance.

282
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,960
Jia Yu, let's rehearse again.

283
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,920
Get in position.

284
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,832
Excuse me?

285
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:57,960
Hello.

286
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,480
You stage this play

287
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,860
to improve kids' anti-scam awareness, right?

288
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,900
Exactly!

289
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,540
But Jia Yu is not fit to play the Grandma.

290
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,940
No child should play that role.

291
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,260
This might cause division among them.

292
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,860
What do you mean?

293
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,920
I mean...

294
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
I have a suggestion.

295
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,500
Suggestion?

296
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,000
 
Next, class 2-3's performance,

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,880
Seven Little Red Riding Hoods
vs. the Wolf Grandma.

298
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:39,392
Once upon a time,

299
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:44,000
in Fairytale Village
lived adorable Little Red Riding Hoods.

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,500
They lived happily.

301
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,660
Until one day, an unwelcome guest arrived.

302
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,780
I heard

303
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,280
this family had seven kids.

304
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,740
That's my food for a year!

305
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,500
Little Red Riding Hoods? Are you home?

306
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,460
- I'm the Grandma from the video call.
- Who are you? Are you really Grandma?

307
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,000
Open the door. Let's see who you really are!

308
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Grandma, why are your ears so big?

309
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,820
Yeah! Why's your voice so gravelly?

310
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,360
Are you the dumb wolf pretending to be Grandma?

311
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,320
I-I'm really your gentle, wise Grandma.

312
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,800
Hey, your nephew is so kind.

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,420
He's not my nephew. He's like my brother.

314
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,540
He is pretty close to Jia Yu.

315
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,240
He treats Jia Yu well.

316
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,040
Jia Yu didn't want to play the wolf,

317
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,040
so he volunteered to take the role.

318
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,460
It's rare to see parents collaborating
with kids like this.

319
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,160
I'm opening the door. Stay back.

320
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,168
Okay.

321
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,760
Here I come!

322
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:17,240
 

323
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,660
Where is everyone?

324
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,504
Charge!

325
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,740
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,360
Little Red Riding Hoods
have installed anti-scam apps!

327
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,620
They're quite smart.

328
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:38,780
Children, learn from Little Red Riding Hoods.

329
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,500
Don't trust strangers' words.

330
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,780
The online world's full of dangers.

331
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,160
Stay vigilant against scams!

332
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,448
Mom, that Little Red...

333
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:53,568
Jia Yu.

334
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:54,656
Mom.

335
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:56,580
Amazing! This is for you.

336
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,700
Thanks, Mom.

337
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Let me hug you.

338
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,544
My son acted so well.

339
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:01,728
You know what?

340
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,040
The Wolf Grandma could be reformed

341
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,200
because of you.

342
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,700
You organized it so well,

343
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,288
and even managed to subdue Wolf Grandma.

344
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:09,320
Come on.

345
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,000
If it weren't for Kai today,
I would've been the one getting beaten up.

346
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,992
Kai.

347
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,712
You're here.

348
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,280
This was a last-minute decision today.
I didn't have time to tell you.

349
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,820
You two did such a great job.

350
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,240
You two worked together so well.

351
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,780
Jia Yu, I can also act.

352
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,540
Next time, if there's an opportunity like this,
remember to tell me.

353
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,660
Forget it. I don't want
to play the beaten-up role anymore.

354
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,320
I want to play someone
like Little Red Riding Hood,

355
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,944
strong and smart.

356
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,080
You are strong.

357
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,500
Kai, can you teach me boxing?

358
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,000
Then I can protect my Mom.

359
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,080
Violence solves nothing.

360
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,120
We must arm ourselves with knowledge.

361
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,260
Kai, I think you've changed.

362
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,660
That's what you taught me.

363
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,580
I-I wasn't...

364
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,280
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

365
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,040
Starting tomorrow,
I'll personally teach you boxing.

366
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,120
But for the record,

367
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,580
boxing training is tough.

368
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,780
Be mentally prepared.

369
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,740
I won't go easy on you even if you cry.

370
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,940
Bring it on!

371
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,120
I'm not scared of you!

372
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,380
I'll give you an uppercut.

373
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
Kai, can you send me home?

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,960
I need to handle something else. See you later.

375
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,580
Oh, I forgot to tell you two.

376
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,500
I've converted my bar into a restaurant.

377
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,540
I've already told Li Jin Yu,
Ye Meng, and the others.

378
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,120
Come to the opening in a few days.

379
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,620
Wait, why convert a bar into a restaurant?

380
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,540
Since Jia Yu is still a kid,

381
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,580
he shouldn't go to bars.

382
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,540
Yu is my good buddy.

383
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,384
Alright, I'll be there!

384
00:22:56,384 --> 00:22:57,504
I have to go.

385
00:22:57,504 --> 00:22:58,540
Bye!

386
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,740
- Bye, Kai!
- Bye!

387
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,540
Why do I feel like Kai seems sad?

388
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,820
Jia Yu, do you like Kai?

389
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,280
He genuinely cares about me,

390
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,460
so I should genuinely like him too.

391
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,040
You're quite sensible.

392
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,460
The adults' world is so complicated.

393
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,000
Kids' world is simpler.

394
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,168
Stop talking like a grown-up.

395
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,280
Let's go home.

396
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,160
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

397
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,260
The headscarf is kinda cute.

398
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,672
Breakfast's ready.

399
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,960
Where are you going?

400
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,080
I need to go to the company.

401
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,540
You have to have lunch alone.

402
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm leaving.

403
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,160
- Bye.
- Bye.

404
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,424
Coming.

405
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,160
Meng.

406
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,968
Yu, come on in.

407
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,792
Okay.

408
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,792
Sit.

409
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
Thanks.

410
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
- Here.
- Thank you.

411
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,320
Ye Meng, I actually came today to apologize.

412
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm sorry about attacking you before.

413
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,080
I was blinded by hatred back then

414
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,580
and didn't even realize I was used.

415
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,620
Thank goodness, you're okay.

416
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,940
I almost forgot about that.

417
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,540
Your switchblade is still with me.

418
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:21,500
Just kidding!

419
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,900
Thanks for helping us
at the press conference that day.

420
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,820
Actually, we should be thanking you.

421
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,700
Don't mention it.

422
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,280
Don't worry, Ye Meng.

423
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,240
I'll never do anything stupid again.

424
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,460
I'll work hard,

425
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,400
take good care of the kids at the orphanage,

426
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,360
and set a good example for them.

427
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,240
I believe in you. You can do it.

428
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,080
Right, I came to give you something.

429
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,620
I found some childhood photos
of your mom at the orphanage.

430
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,072
I thought you should keep them as mementos.

431
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:53,280
Thanks. Have some tea.

432
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,168
Thank you.

433
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,880
Meng, is this your mom?

434
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,080
The short-haired one is my mom.

435
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,864
What's wrong?

436
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,680
Do you know her?

437
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,000
I saw her many years ago at the orphanage.

438
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,700
Li Ling Bai was also there at the time.

439
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,880
They were arguing fiercely with each other.

440
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,620
 Why did you do this? 

441
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,340
 Have I ever hurt you? 

442
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,080
 I hate you! I want you to feel my pain! 

443
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,016
 Why? 

444
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,300
 What's wrong with you? Weren't we good friends? 

445
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,500
Did they say anything else?

446
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,820
I was too young then.

447
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,500
I only remember these details.

448
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,120
I've forgotten everything else.

449
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,152
Meng, I'm leaving if there's nothing else.

450
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:18,200
Have some water.

451
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,120
No need. I just came to deliver the items.

452
00:27:56,772 --> 00:28:00,160
 

453
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,460
We used to call your mom Yi back then.

454
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,700
This is Bai.

455
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,360
This photo was taken on Bai's adoption day.

456
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,240
In my memory, they got along exceptionally well.

457
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,040
 They were inseparable all day long. 

458
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,900
 Later, Bai was adopted first. 

459
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,660
 The adoptive parents initially wanted your mom. 

460
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,540
But your mom gave the opportunity to Bai.

461
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Why do you want to see me?

462
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,900
You did it all to set up a scheme,

463
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,660
not just to reclaim my shares.

464
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,780
You fear that your dealings with Wang Xing Sheng
about the project Tianhui Garden will be exposed.

465
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,340
That's why you're rushing
to let the Lin Group take over.

466
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,100
What's your real connection with Ye Meng's mom?

467
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,320
Li Jin Yu, you have terrible judgment.

468
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,240
You actually like the daughter of a fraud.

469
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,000
That person has been hypocritical since childhood,

470
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,960
putting on acts to make people like her.

471
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,660
Everyone was deceived by her appearance.

472
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,040
She's the real fraud.

473
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,496
You're back.

474
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,080
You went out?

475
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,728
Sure.

476
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,816
I'll get some water.

477
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,152
 A fraud? 

478
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,580
 Is she really a fraud or a victim in this case? 

479
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,500
 Given what Ye Meng did at the press conference, 

480
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,800
 I'm the actual victim. 

481
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,900
 Her acquaintance with Wang Xing Sheng 

482
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,000
 and being set up couldn't be coincidental. 

483
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,080
 It must relate to you somehow. 

484
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,960
 Come back with evidence next time. 

485
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,488
 Fine. 

486
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,976
Hello?

487
00:31:38,976 --> 00:31:42,740
Ms. Ye? This is Fat Buddha.

488
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,700
 Is Wang Xing Sheng missing? 

489
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,040
How did you know?

490
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,860
He left me a USB drive.

491
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,900
He told me to contact you
if he doesn't show up this month.

492
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,360
 You'll be very interested in this USB drive. 

493
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,880
 And you'll pay handsomely for it. 

494
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,260
Where are you? I'll come immediately.

495
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,320
Where's the hidden item? Speak quickly.

496
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,540
We don't want to torture you to death.

497
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,160
If you kill me,

498
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:35,460
Li Ling Bai and all of you will go down with me.

499
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,460
Do you want to die?

500
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,120
Come on! Kill me.

501
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,500
Do it. Kill me!

502
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,096
Come on!

503
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,328
Do it!

504
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,752
Come on.

505
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Wait! Hold on!

506
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,200
Wait! Just wait!

507
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,184
I...

508
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,700
Make your man leave.

509
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,120
I-I need to talk to you.

510
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,220
Li Ling Bai...

511
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,504
Trust me.

512
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,420
There's a car tailing us.

513
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,040
Must be Li Ling Bai's people.

514
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,580
She probably knows about the USB.

515
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,500
Let's split up in a moment.

516
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,360
Stay here and track their destination.

517
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,200
Okay.

518
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,464
 

519
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Be careful.

520
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,448
 

521
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,540
Is Wang Xing Sheng missing?

522
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,500
He left me a USB drive.

523
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,900
You'll be very interested in this USB drive.

524
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,960
And you'll pay handsomely for it.

525
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,040
Stop!

526
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,224
She went that way! Over there.

527
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,872
Thanks.

528
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,320
 Locker one is open. 

529
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,040
 Please close the door after retrieving your item. 

530
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,080
I'll leave the USB in the hotel parcel locker.

531
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,080
You'll get the password
after transferring the money.

532
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,008
 That's all. 

533
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,460
Are you hurt?

534
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,700
I'm fine. Where's the USB?

535
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,704
I have it.

536
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,500
This is empty! Nothing's inside.

537
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,328
I'll call him.

538
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,940
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is unavailable. 

539
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,200
We might've been played.

540
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,300
It seems Fat Buddha has held back a trick or two.

541
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,320
No.

542
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,780
We need to find Fat Buddha
before Li Ling Bai discovers

543
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,620
the USB is fake.

544
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,080
What's wrong? Are you in a bad mood?

545
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
No, I'm just a bit tired.

546
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm going to take a shower.

547
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,580
An empty flash drive makes you look like a fool.

548
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,940
You can't even handle such a simple task.

549
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,740
What can you do for me?

550
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,580
It's useless to hire you.

551
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,740
I might as well get a dog.

552
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,760
At least, a dog can guard my house
and bite intruders.

553
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:02,976
 

554
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,492
 ♫ You ♫ 

555
00:43:07,492 --> 00:43:09,668
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

556
00:43:10,564 --> 00:43:12,883
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

557
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:19,684
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

558
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:25,604
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

559
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:29,764
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

560
00:43:29,764 --> 00:43:32,228
 ♫ Go ♫ 

561
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:34,244
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

562
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:38,372
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

563
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:44,356
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

564
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:48,324
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

565
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:54,340
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

566
00:43:55,588 --> 00:43:58,660
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

567
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,244
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

568
00:44:02,244 --> 00:44:08,324
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

569
00:44:08,324 --> 00:44:13,085
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

570
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:18,332
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

571
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:23,169
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

572
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:26,125
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

573
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,292
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

574
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:33,092
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

575
00:44:33,092 --> 00:44:35,236
 ♫ But why ♫ 

576
00:44:35,236 --> 00:44:38,756
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

577
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:43,809
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
