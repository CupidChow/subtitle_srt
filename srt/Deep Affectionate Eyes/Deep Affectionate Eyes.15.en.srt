3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Yu!

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,720
We came to pick you up today.

5
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,319
Where do you want to go tonight?

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,240
Hold on.

7
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,520
You're not Jiayu's parents, are you?

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,560
Who are you?

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,160
- You must be Ms. Chen.
- Don't come near me.

10
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,520
If you do, I'll call the cops.

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,960
Miss.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,560
They're family friends, not kidnappers.

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,840
My mom knows them.

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,920
Fine then.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,080
But once you get home,

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,000
you'd better call me
to let me know you're safe.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
- Thank you, Ms. Chen.
- Wait.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
I still don't feel right.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
Give me a number.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,760
The surname's Cheng.

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,120
- Thanks again.
- Bye, Miss.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,120
Bye.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,240
Let's go.

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,760
Seatbelt on.

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,440
Thanks, Ms. Chen. Get home safe.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,600
Why are you picking me up today?

27
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,000
Your mom had something to do.

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,280
So, she sent us.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,720
What about Aunt Meng?

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,080
Come on. Lighten up.
Don't make that gloomy face.

31
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
The kid's watching.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
Your mom's out
with her girlfriends tonight.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
That means
a happy night for the three of us.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
Time for a boys' night.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,080
But I was planning to go home
and do homework.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,240
Forget homework. Tonight we play.

AMERICAS CIRCUIT, ROOKIE, TRICK UNLOCKED

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,040
Let's go, Yu!

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,400
Lean! Lean! Faster!

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,960
Give it more gas.

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,120
- Go!
- More gas. Lean into it!

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
- Yu, come on, come on!
- I'm top 100!

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm going for it!

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
My man!

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,920
This way, this way!

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Pass him! Pass! Go, go, go!

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,200
Block him! Block him!

50
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,520
Finish line!

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
FINISH, 13TH PLACE

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
My man! High five!

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,280
That's how it's done. Let's do a lap.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,960
Come on. Let's do a lap.

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
Forget it. It's not fun anymore.

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,120
Just one more. Come on.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
One round. Please.

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,800
Just one lap.

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,280
One more, okay? All right, just one lap.

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,760
Stop pretending. I can see through you.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,720
If my mom doesn't want me to go home,

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll just play along.

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm hungry.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,560
Let's eat.

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,600
Yu, wait up!

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
- What do you want?
- Fried chicken.

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,800
You must be tired from keeping up
this act with me.

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,400
But really, no need to make excuses.

69
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,440
Every time my mom
keeps me from going home,

70
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
it's because Dad's causing trouble.

71
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,760
- Jiayu…
- Grown-ups have grown-up problems.

72
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Kids have kid problems.

73
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,680
Like this time. I only
got second place in the math Olympiad.

74
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,400
I still can't forgive myself.

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Then, I guess life really is a struggle.

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,440
But Jinyu, you're good-looking,
and you're smart.

77
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,160
What could you possibly worry about?

78
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,720
My wife ignores me.

79
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Does that count?

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,760
That's not a real problem. Phone.

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,280
Come on. Let me show you how it's done.

82
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
Honey,

83
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,480
I miss you.

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,440
Kiss kiss kiss.

85
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,760
MESSAGE TO WIFE
HONEY, I MISS YOU. KISS KISS KISS

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
You didn't have to walk me back.

87
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,440
It's fine.

88
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
Let me help you clean up.

89
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,880
Look at this mess.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
- It does need cleaning.
- Let me help.

91
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,800
No, no. I'll do it myself.
Don't touch. Here, let me.

92
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
All of this…

93
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,920
Go ahead.

94
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,240
If you need to cry, just cry.

95
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
You know…

96
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,000
a few days ago,

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,360
I actually pitied him.

98
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,760
I thought maybe I shouldn't
go through with the divorce.

99
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,680
How stupid was that?

100
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,440
Think about it. When we were young,

101
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,320
back when we had
all the swagger in Ningsui,

102
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,560
who'd have thought…

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,680
I'd end up like this?

104
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,960
I'll tell you what.

105
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,320
Your taste in men is really terrible.

106
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,240
What is it with women?

107
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
We're always too soft, too easy to fool.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,920
All these years married.
I've got a kid.

109
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,680
And still,

110
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,240
I didn't really know the man beside me.

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,520
Yeah.

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,200
What about you and Li Jinyu?

113
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,040
Something's off.

114
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,600
Did something happen

115
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,600
when you were in Jiangbei?

116
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,520
You're hiding something from me.

117
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
I don't even know.

118
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,960
It just feels like
he's becoming a stranger.

119
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,640
Like I never really knew him at all.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,120
Maybe rushing into marriage

121
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
wasn't such a good idea.

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,840
But both families

123
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,520
are already talking about the wedding.

124
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,400
Don't tell me you're regretting it now.

125
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
So, what's your plan?

126
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,840
The families are way too invested.

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,799
It's gotten messy.

128
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,200
For now, all I can do is drag my feet.

129
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,080
And how long do you think you can stall?

130
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,120
Until the day he can't fake it anymore.

131
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,720
Alright, enough gloom.

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,520
Jiayu's on his way home.
Go fix your makeup.

133
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,160
Your eyes are all puffy from crying.

134
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,280
- I'll finish tidying up.
- Okay, I'll go.

135
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,880
<i>Don't tell me that airhead</i>
<i>deleted the footage.</i>

136
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
- Jiayu.
- Jiayu.

137
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
Mom. Aunt Meng.

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,480
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah!

139
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,480
Thanks for taking him.

140
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Here, his backpack.

141
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,440
Got it. We'll head back in.

142
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
Call me anytime if something comes up.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,920
Dinner's on me next time.

144
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,760
Drive safe.

145
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,320
- Bye, Aunt Meng.
- Bye, Jiayu.

146
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,240
- Bye, Jiayu.
- Bye, Kai.

147
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
Bye, Jinyu.

148
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,920
Then… I'll get going.

149
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,920
Stop giving her the cold shoulder.

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,240
Make the first move for once.

151
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,000
Are you going my way?

152
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,800
Give me a lift.

153
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,800
Ye Meng.

154
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,600
Are you okay today?

155
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm fine.

156
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,360
Next time something like that happens,

157
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,840
you should call me.

158
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,120
It wasn't a big deal.

159
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,280
I just feel bad for Ya'en.

160
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,160
When she got married,

161
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,000
I thought she'd finally found happiness.

162
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,520
That she'd chosen someone solid.

163
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,800
Didn't expect things
to fall apart like this.

164
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,920
Are you…

165
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
still mad at me?

166
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,880
Is there something you want to tell me?

167
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,000
You know, people are complicated.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,720
You can share a roof
and still never know them.

169
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,960
Some people get lucky

170
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,520
and stay in the dark their whole lives.

171
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,320
Others…

172
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,840
wake up halfway through love

173
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,800
and realize they never knew
their partner at all.

174
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,920
I'm going in.

175
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,400
Good night.

176
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,080
<i>Mr. Li, Hanhai Group's water runs deep.</i>

177
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,040
<i>If you want answers,</i>

178
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,240
<i>you need someone on the inside.</i>

179
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,920
- Here you go.
- Juhua, look.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Look at this piece, Juhua.

181
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,960
Isn't this gorgeous?

182
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,560
Small, delicate, elegant.

183
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,720
Perfect for Meng's style.

184
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
This is the one.

185
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,000
Too skinny.

186
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,040
No weight to it.

187
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,280
Looks so cheap.

188
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,920
Doesn't show wealth or status at all.

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
What do you know?

190
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,800
Only flashy people wear big,
chunky chains.

191
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,080
And let me tell you,

192
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,520
these days,

193
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,800
young people go for subtle luxury.

194
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,800
Subtle luxury? What's that even worth?

195
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,240
With gold, the heavier the better.

196
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,440
And if one day their marriage falls apart,

197
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,160
I can pawn this here

198
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,840
and get cash back.

199
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,680
You should learn to think ahead.

200
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,520
- Got it?
- Don't jinx them!

201
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,680
They're young and happy now.

202
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,080
Why curse them like that?

203
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,080
Look at these.

204
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
Dragon and Phoenix, a symbol of harmony.

205
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,240
- Wrap them up.
- Oh, stop it already.

206
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,760
Dragon and Phoenix is ancient history.

207
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,160
Young people want sparkle.

208
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,040
Something blingy.

209
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,560
You just don't get it.

210
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,000
- Something blingy, huh?
- Exactly.

211
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,040
You think you're some young girl?

212
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,920
At your age, and you're still into bling?

213
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
Don't fool yourself.

214
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,880
Are you insulting my taste?

215
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,880
- Why not?
- Cheap.

216
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
Why not?

217
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,120
Who says I can't wear something
sparkly and blingy?

218
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,440
I'll wear it just to annoy you.

219
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,640
Ladies,

220
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,760
we have many other designs in the store.

221
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,080
Take your time.

222
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,840
Actually,

223
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,280
the trend now is gold mixed with diamonds.

224
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,280
See?

225
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
It's stylish and it holds value.

226
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,160
- What do you know?
- What do you know?

227
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,720
If you want to look like

228
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,520
some tacky nouveau riche, go ahead,

229
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,920
but don't drag my granddaughter into it.

230
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How did I suddenly become tacky?

231
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,680
You're the cheap one.

232
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,600
You're the one with small vision.

233
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,240
Ladies…

234
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,000
- What now?
- What now?

235
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,040
Look.

236
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,280
Since you're buying
for the younger generation,

237
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,280
why not ask what they like?

238
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,520
Because in the end,
even if you two like it,

239
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,440
if your granddaughter

240
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,200
or future granddaughter-in-law doesn't,

241
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,680
what happens then?

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,920
Hello?

243
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,920
Grandma.

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,520
- Badou.
- Meng.

245
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,360
- I'm at the jewelry shop, picking out…
- I'm checking out…

246
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,280
<i>- your wedding gold set.</i>
<i>- some jewelry</i>

247
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,920
<i>- Hurry over here.</i>
<i>- for you.</i>

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,520
- <i>You're getting married. You need…</i>
- <i>I don't know what you'll like.</i>

249
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,080
- …right?
- Best you come pick one.

250
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,960
- Bring the bank card.
- Whatever you like, I will pay.

251
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,880
- I'll be here waiting for you.
- That's settled then.

252
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,320
Morning.

253
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,200
Morning.

254
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,360
I brought you breakfast.

255
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,720
I'm not hungry. Let's go.

256
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Check this out.

257
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,240
Hear that weight?

258
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,160
That's real quality.

259
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,640
Real presence…

260
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,080
- Grandma.
- Grandma.

261
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,000
There you are.

262
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,240
Come and take a look.

263
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,600
Meng, come here.

264
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,920
Quick, sit down.

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,280
I've already chosen for you.

266
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,880
Look at those thin,
little pieces she chose.

267
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,640
Doesn't suit your aura.

268
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,600
Alright.

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,360
Meng, these are the earrings
I picked for you.

270
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,920
And a bangle.

271
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,640
And mine.

272
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,920
Plus a ring.

273
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,760
Do you like them?

274
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,400
- Pick one.
- What do you think, Meng?

275
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,880
- Don't just sit there.
- Pick one!

276
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,080
Come on. Pick.

277
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Grandma.

278
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,280
Gold prices are sky-high right now.

279
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
It's a waste to buy now.

280
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
Why don't we wait and look around first?

281
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,560
How is it a waste when it's for you?

282
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,920
The wedding gold set is tradition.

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,640
Besides, Badou can afford it.

284
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,640
So, pick whatever you like.

285
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,200
We've been busy for days.

286
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Today we settle this. That's final.

287
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,760
Exactly.

288
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,280
Whatever you like,

289
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,839
- I will buy it.
- Right!

290
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,200
Don't worry about the price.

291
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160
- That's right.
- Just pick something.

292
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,920
The grandmas are having fun.

293
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,720
Grandma, I didn't want to say it earlier,

294
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,240
but these designs feel outdated.

295
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,400
Nowadays, you can have jewelry
custom-made online.

296
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,240
Don't you want our wedding
to be one of a kind?

297
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,920
- Naturally.
- Of course.

298
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Please put these away.
We'll look at other options.

299
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,040
What a handful.

300
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,640
We should push the wedding back.

301
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,760
What… do you mean?

302
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,800
I still haven't figured out
my mother's death.

303
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,160
I can't focus on this now.

304
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,160
When we got the certificate,

305
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
it didn't feel real.

306
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
But now, with the grandmas
planning everything,

307
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,800
marriage suddenly feels very real to me.

308
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,920
And honestly, it doesn't feel good.

309
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,080
It makes me uneasy.

310
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,800
I feel overwhelmed.

311
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Ye Meng.

312
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,280
Are you saying you regret this?

313
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,840
I'm going home.

314
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,800
SAPPORO

315
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,240
BREAKING!
MARRIED WOMAN CAUGHT HAVING AN AFFAIR

316
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,280
Ya'en.

317
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,880
What are you doing?

318
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,800
Come look at this.

319
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,560
What the hell is this?

320
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
At it again.

321
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,200
Who did this?

322
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,800
Chen Jian, who else?

323
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
But why?

324
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,160
So when we divorce,
I'll be the one at fault.

325
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,520
He'll walk away with more money.

326
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,440
Shameless. This is ridiculous.

327
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,280
Look at that.

328
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,960
What if Jiayu saw this? Then what?

329
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,280
I'll help you clean it up.

330
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,760
It's going to be okay.

331
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,920
God.

332
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,680
YA

333
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,080
God, I'm furious.

334
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
MIX & MATCH, TEN PERCENT OFF

335
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,680
That man will stoop to anything.

336
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,560
Absolute scum.

337
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,600
- Honestly, Fang Ya'en,
- What?

338
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,400
when did you become a Ningsui celebrity?

339
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,840
You're tabloid material now.

340
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,880
Look at this, "Breaking".

341
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,280
"Exposed".

342
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,440
I… I mean,

343
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,480
I own a clothing shop.
What's there to expose?

344
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,680
No, but seriously,

345
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,000
what were you two doing here?

346
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,320
Kai came for a fitting.

347
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,960
That's it.

348
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,520
Then that creep snapped a photo.

349
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,440
I'm so mad, I don't even know
if I should laugh or scream.

350
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,000
Be honest.

351
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,040
Did you feel anything?

352
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,480
Don't mess with me right now.

353
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,480
So, what's the plan?

354
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,320
Do we hit back?

355
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,440
And how exactly?

356
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,920
We hit back.

357
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,440
- What's wrong?
- He's in there.

358
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,280
But listen…

359
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
I was just thinking…

360
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,320
We're not kids anymore.

361
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,840
If this gets out of hand,
it won't look good.

362
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
He crossed the line. Stop hesitating.

363
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,640
If something happens,
I'll take the heat. Come on.

364
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,760
Fine, fine.

365
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,040
Hand me that.

366
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,600
And your phone.

367
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,480
- Where is it?
- In there.

368
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,400
You sure?

369
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,360
- Here, here.
- Found it.

370
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,120
You take this.

371
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,880
- Alright.
- Let's go.

372
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,160
Go.

373
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,720
Why aren't you moving?

374
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Just need to prep myself.

375
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,840
Let me see.

376
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Good.

377
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,240
- Go.
- Go.

378
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,920
Out of my way!

379
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,120
Screw you!

380
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,680
What…

381
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,040
What the hell is wrong with you?

382
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,480
You wanted a big public scene?

383
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,520
Fine. I'll give you one.

384
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,480
Everyone, listen up.

385
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,680
This man is Chen Jian.

386
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
He is a criminal of domestic violence.

387
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,400
He's never paid child support.

388
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,640
He refuses to divorce me.

389
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,760
He threatens me with my son.

390
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,280
And when that doesn't work,
he plasters lies

391
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,440
on the walls of my building.

392
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,360
According to you,
Cheng Kairan is my lover.

393
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,640
I'm sure you know
what he does for a living, right?

394
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,560
Don't want a divorce?

395
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,520
Fine.

396
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Then, let's see
how long you can still

397
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,240
show your face in Ningsui!

398
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,640
Whore.

399
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,080
That's it. I'm calling the cops.

400
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,280
I'll have you arrested!

401
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,600
Go ahead. Call.

402
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,160
If marriage had a criminal code,

403
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,480
you would've been executed ages ago!

404
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,160
You should've been dead already!

405
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,880
We'll talk business another time.
I'm leaving.

406
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,800
No, Mr. Zhao.

407
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
She's crazy. Don't listen to her!

408
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,200
Mr. Zhao.

409
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,200
Don't listen to her.

410
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,320
She's crazy.

411
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,880
I had no idea she'd come here tonight.

412
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,680
Got it on video?

413
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,280
- Every word.
- Good.

414
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
- How does it feel?
- My head's spinning…

415
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,960
But God, that was satisfying.

416
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
Did you see his pathetic face?

417
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,240
So worth it.

418
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm so sorry. We lost our tempers.

419
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,240
Sorry.

420
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,800
Whatever your issues are,
don't bring them here.

421
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,600
Look what you did to my private room.

422
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,720
I have a business to run.

423
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Really sorry for the mess.

424
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,120
- Yes, so sorry.
- Here, scan.

425
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
We'll go home and reflect.

426
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,880
Word of advice.

427
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,640
Couples should deal
with their fights at home.

428
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Who's a couple with him?

429
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,600
Payment's done.

430
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,560
Meddling busybody.

431
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,040
Jerk.

432
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,800
Go clean it up.

433
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,880
Look, you missed half of him.
Look at the paint splatter.

434
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,400
Doesn't matter.

435
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,920
The way he cowered was enough.

436
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,160
He's pathetic.

437
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,160
Seriously. How could you fall

438
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,320
- for someone like that?
- I mean…

439
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,320
Never again.

440
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,640
I can't even look at him.

441
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
Makes me sick.

442
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,360
Who needs men anyway?

443
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,720
Life's better without them.

444
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,000
Cheers.

445
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,640
Remember how carefree we were as kids?

446
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,040
We laughed all day over nothing.

447
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,840
The older we get,

448
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
the more we have, but…

449
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,920
the less happy we seem to be.
Won't you agree?

450
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,960
It's not that we've changed.

451
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,600
We just think too much, worry too much.

452
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,880
Makes us scared of everything.

453
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,080
No tears tonight.

454
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
Here's to our future.

455
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,280
May it only get better and better.

456
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,160
To better days.

457
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

458
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,040
Now tell me.

459
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,560
Why did you show up with booze tonight?

460
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,760
Something's off.

461
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,520
Did Li Jinyu do something again?

462
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Sometimes…

463
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,760
Sometimes he scares me,

464
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,400
even more than Chen Jian.

465
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,400
What…

466
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,520
Come on.

467
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,920
Nothing's worse than a man

468
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,640
who beats you and steals your money.

469
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,320
Tell me what happened. What did he do?

470
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,440
He lied to me.

471
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
He lied to you?

472
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,000
And the worst part is…

473
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,120
I still want to believe him.

474
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,840
Am I crazy?

475
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,960
Do I have some kind of martyr complex?

476
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,480
No, babe. That's not you.

477
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
You were never like this with anyone else.

478
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,560
Meng.

479
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,800
I don't know anymore.
My head's a mess.

480
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,440
Forget it.

481
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,680
Don't force yourself.

482
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,320
- When I figure it out, I'll tell you.
- Good.

483
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,880
Whenever you're ready.

484
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,240
Just remember this, Ye Meng.

485
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,400
Do whatever you feel is right.

486
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,080
No matter what happens,

487
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,680
no matter what you decide,

488
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,200
I, Fang Ya'en, will always have your back.

489
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,080
- Okay.
- Okay.

490
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,240
Okay.

491
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,840
Here.

492
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,720
Drink.

493
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,160
I don't care.

494
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
If you get drunk, I'll carry you home.

495
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
You said it.

496
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,720
Come on. Hurry.

497
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,560
Come on.

498
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
<i>Hey!</i>

499
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,080
<i>Bottoms up. Got you.</i>

500
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,120
<i>Where'd you learn that?</i>

501
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,720
<i>Only city girls pull stunts like this.</i>

502
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,880
<i>I should…</i>

503
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,720
Even without women,

504
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,000
a man's gotta live with some dignity.

505
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,840
Come on. Drink.

506
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,560
Women are ruthless.

507
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,280
You mean Fang Ya'en or Ye Meng?

508
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,560
Both.

509
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,880
Sometimes I really don't get it.

510
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,680
What's wrong with this world…

511
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
or maybe just what's going on
in their heads.

512
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,000
Ya'en and I will have a good talk
with her.

513
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,400
Stop overthinking.

514
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,400
This isn't something you can fix
with a talk.

515
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,960
It's not that simple.

516
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,400
I'm only trying to protect Ye Meng.

517
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,600
Alright.

518
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,400
I don't know what's going on
between you two,

519
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,160
but I've never seen you
this serious before.

520
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,600
Must be something big.

521
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,720
If there's anything we can do to help,

522
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,040
if you need backup,

523
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,080
just say the word.

524
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,200
Give me a few days off.

525
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,400
327-4 XINGYI ROAD

526
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,280
Ye Meng.

527
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,360
Ye Meng.

528
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,080
Why did you drink so much?

529
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,720
You're at the wrong house.
Yours is over there.

530
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,320
What do you want?

531
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,040
What you said earlier…

532
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,920
What did you mean?

533
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,480
Exactly what it sounded like.

534
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,440
The day I went looking for Wang Xingsheng,

535
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
you were there too.

536
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,720
You erased the security footage,
didn't you?

537
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,000
I waited for you to be honest with me.

538
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,400
But I'm done waiting.

539
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,040
If this relationship is nothing

540
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,080
but secrets and lies…

541
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,240
then what's the point of keeping it?

542
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,240
Ye Meng.

543
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,400
<i>Aren't you afraid I'll use</i>
<i>what I've got on you?</i>

544
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,560
<i>All that dirt I'm holding?</i>

545
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,640
<i>There's no need for us to be enemies.</i>

546
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,480
<i>You know me better than anyone.</i>

547
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,200
<i>Give me what I want,</i>

548
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,080
<i>and I'll disappear from your life.</i>

549
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,080
<i>Li Jinyu, you're sick.</i>

550
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
<i>You can't handle the shares right now.</i>

551
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,800
<i>Sign them over to me.</i>
<i>I'll hold them for you.</i>

552
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,720
EQUITY ENTRUSTMENT AGREEMENT

553
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,560
<i>Li Jinyu,</i>

554
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,600
<i>what are you playing at?</i>

555
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
I'm taking back what's mine.

556
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,760
That equity contract you made me sign…

557
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,400
The time's up.

558
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,480
I'm reclaiming my share.

559
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
That 15% stake in the company.

560
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,440
Hello?

561
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,360
<i>Ye Meng.</i>

562
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,560
<i>I've been tracking</i>
<i>Wang Xingsheng for days.</i>

563
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,480
<i>No luck finding him.</i>

564
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,159
But I did uncover something else.
A witness in your mom's case.

565
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,400
Did you know there was
an eyewitness that day?

566
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,840
An eyewitness?

567
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,159
The day she died,

568
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,800
someone saw her at Jiumen Ridge.

569
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,679
She was in a car.
And there was a man with her.

570
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,560
That man was most likely Wang Xingsheng.

571
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,239
How come no one told me this?

572
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,280
Because he…

573
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,560
He recanted.

574
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,280
Said he got the license plate wrong.

575
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,639
Can you track him down?
I need to meet him.

576
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,920
No need. I know him.

577
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,440
Funny how small the world is.

578
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,440
That witness is none other
than the airhead I told you about.

579
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,360
Li Jinyu.

580
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,880
Who?

581
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,680
<i>Li Jinyu.</i>

582
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,880
<i>I mentioned him a few days ago.</i>

583
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,280
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

584
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,160
<i>What matters is I know him.</i>

585
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,400
<i>Do you want me to ask him what happened?</i>

586
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,400
<i>Hello?</i>

587
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,480
<i>Ye Meng, are you there?</i>

588
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,480
<i>I'm asking if you need me</i>
<i>to dig into it for you.</i>

589
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,600
No. And don't tell him anything yet.

590
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,000
FLIGHT BOOKING

591
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,400
JIANGBEI TAXI

592
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,360
Hanhai…

593
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,240
Ye Meng.

594
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,120
Back in Jiangbei and no hello?

595
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,520
You're tailing me?

596
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,880
Tai Mingxiao told me
about the deleted footage.

597
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,680
And?

598
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm sorry.

599
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,240
Canceling your meeting with him
was impulsive of me.

600
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
Now the man's vanished, and that's on me.

601
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,360
But if you still want to find him,

602
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,240
I can help.

603
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,120
And how exactly would you help me?

604
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,400
Heard of the Hailan Port project
in Ningsui?

605
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,320
It took a lot of maneuvering
to wrestle it out of Li Lingbai's hands.

606
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
If you want access to her,

607
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,640
this is your chance.

608
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,240
Come back to the company

609
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,040
and you'll take the lead on the project.

610
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,640
Why should I believe you?

611
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,680
Because honestly, I'm the only way in.

612
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

613
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,840
Right?

614
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,760
Fine. I'll do it.

615
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,840
Hello. Do you have an appointment?

616
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,680
We're with Geometry Field.
We booked a meeting with Mrs. Li.

617
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,920
Great. Please sign here.

618
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,440
I'll print your passes.

619
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,320
Mr. Gou, you go ahead.
I'll handle the check-in.

620
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,600
<i>Did you see my message?</i>

621
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,960
<i>The airhead is back.</i>

622
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,920
<i>Can you believe it, Gou?</i>

623
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,400
<i>Li Jinyu is back.</i>

624
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,280
Mr. Gou, this way, please.

625
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,600
Mrs. Li, Mr. Gou has arrived.

626
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,320
Mrs. Li.

627
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,240
Gou Kai, welcome.

628
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,960
When did Jinyu get back?

629
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,160
Just recently.

630
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,480
I'm taking him around
to get familiar with the company.

631
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,960
What brings you here today?

632
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,520
To sign the framework agreement
for a project.

633
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,920
And let me introduce you.

634
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,760
This is Ye Meng, my right hand.

635
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,520
She'll be leading this project.

636
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,560
Hello, Mrs. Li.

637
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,200
- Hello. Young and accomplished, I see.
- Thank you.

638
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,760
And this is Mr. Li of Hanhai Group,

639
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,920
Li Jinyu.

640
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,520
Cut the formality.

641
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,400
These two grew up together.

642
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,600
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Li.

643
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,800
Hello.

644
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,080
We'll let you get back to work.
We'll head to the conference room.

645
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,520
- Take them in.
- Yes, of course.

646
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,680
- See you in a bit.
- See you shortly.

647
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,960
Mr. Gou, this way, please.

648
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,120
Mrs. Li, rest assured.

649
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,800
We won't let Hanhai down.

650
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,360
I'll hold you to that.

651
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,040
You've become very thorough, Gou Kai.

652
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,560
The company has been growing so fast.

653
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,720
Jinyu, learn everything you can from him.

654
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,400
Understood, Mrs. Li.

655
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,600
That's only thanks to
your trust and support.

656
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,360
Now that Jinyu's back,

657
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,800
Ye Meng and I
will be learning from him too.

658
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,440
Capable and modest.

659
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,160
That's why I feel confident
leaving this project in your hands.

660
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,600
There's a dinner tonight. Everyone come.

661
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,520
Of course.

662
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,160
Stop by my office later.

663
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,720
So, you went back to work for Gou Kai.

664
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,800
Didn't you tell me
you'd never return to that company?

665
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,320
What's the issue?

666
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,840
You came back to take over
your family business too.

667
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,120
And you act like we're strangers.

668
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,520
