1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,904
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:15,518
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,303
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:20,832
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,984
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:31,232
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,720
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,184
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:42,816
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:49,088
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:53,824
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,904
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,904 --> 00:01:01,088
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,104
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,072
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,968
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,296
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,351
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,328
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:20,343
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,496
 

22
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:34,016
 

23
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,390
This is the seaside vacation villa
you told me about?

24
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,110
Just an old house in the countryside.
You lied to me.

25
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,784
You're overthinking it. Not here.

26
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:13,850
You'll stay over there.

27
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,350
Grandma, your grandson is here.

28
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,190
Coming, coming right up.

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,470
My dear, I've missed you so much.

30
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,890
I've cleaned up a room for you. Filled with toys.

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,730
Look at this free-range chicken.
It's even got double eyelids.

32
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,550
I'll kill it tonight

33
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,510
and make some nourishing soup for you.

34
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,450
Look how skinny he is, like a little monkey.

35
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,190
It's dirty. I won't eat this.

36
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,390
Still fussy about cleanliness?

37
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,110
You little brat, stop hiding!

38
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,610
Who spoiled you?

39
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,770
Eat it or stay hungry.

40
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,570
Let's go home.

41
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,110
Come, let's go home with me.

42
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,970
Come home with me.

43
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,070
If you don't eat it, we'll save money.

44
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,110
When will Mom come take me back?

45
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,110
Do you really dislike this place that much?

46
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,190
But to be fair, I had a harder time
adjusting when I first came.

47
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,410
Really? So you think Grandma's scary, too?

48
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,190
She was much tougher on me than she is on you.

49
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,024
She even beat me before.

50
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,970
But she's all bark and no bite.

51
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,270
Deep down, she cares about us more than anyone.

52
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,690
Right after being discharged from the hospital,
she cleaned your room for you

53
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,350
and even learned your favorite dishes.

54
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,350
She kept asking me when I'd go get you.

55
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,310
But I still miss Mom,

56
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,610
even though she made mistakes.

57
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,720
She misses you, too.

58
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,190
But now you have Grandma and me.

59
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,850
Don't worry. We'll all take good care of you.

60
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,910
But it's okay. Take your time.

61
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,430
Ba Dou, Zhuo Feng.

62
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,570
What are you doing? Get back here for dinner!

63
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,570
- Coming.
- Hurry up!

64
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,568
Let's go.

65
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,550
How's the little brother adjusting?

66
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,730
Not bad. He's adapting faster than I did.

67
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,450
What're you looking at? Smiling so happily.

68
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,310
Let me show you something.

69
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,690
Look, look quickly!

70
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,650
See? This kitten is so cute.

71
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,190
Let's get a Devon Rex to raise.

72
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,110
They're beautiful and clingy.

73
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,550
Clingy.

74
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,350
The key is that they don't shed much.

75
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,864
No.

76
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,430
Why not?

77
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,930
We already have Ping An.

78
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,550
A cat would make it jealous.

79
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,930
Ping An is barely home anyway.
Why would it be jealous?

80
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,850
If you don't want to raise one, just say so.

81
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,070
Don't use Ping An as an excuse.

82
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,510
Seems you're too devoted to Ping An.

83
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,910
No room left for me in your heart.

84
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,610
You're reversing the blame.

85
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,930
You're the one wanting to get a cat
and be unfaithful.

86
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,390
Are you jealous of a cat?

87
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,350
I'm already married to you, Li Jin Yu.

88
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,360
I don't care.

89
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,810
Fine, fine.

90
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,430
We'll visit the cattery when we have time.

91
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,490
That's more like it. Pinky swear.

92
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,120
Pinky swear.

93
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,104
Swear, swear, swear.

94
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,730
Look again.

95
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,650
So adorable, don't you think?

96
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,570
Not as cute as Ping An.

97
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,430
I'm the prettiest.

98
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,230
Yes, you're the prettiest.

99
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,310
Finally, wrap it three times around the wrist.

100
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,770
Make sure to wrap it tight.

101
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,970
Before we start formal boxing training,

102
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,690
you need to learn to protect your body first.

103
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,310
Keep your wrists inward.

104
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,930
- Like this?
- Press them tightly against yourself. Yeah.

105
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,350
- No, this way.
- Like this?

106
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,110
Right, press them against your cheeks.

107
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,850
Then keep your elbows glued to your ribs, right?

108
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,810
- This way?
- To protect your sides from punches.

109
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,470
And these areas, too. Got it?

110
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,528
Let's end today's lesson here, okay?

111
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,288
- Alright.
- Come on.

112
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:41,472
I'll drive you home.

113
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:44,190
No, thanks. My mom's picking me up soon.

114
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,970
Is your mom coming?

115
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,030
- Jia Yu.
- Mom!

116
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,150
Here to pick up Jia Yu?

117
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,390
How's business since converting this place
into a restaurant?

118
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,310
It's doing pretty well, huh?

119
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,510
Mostly regular customers.

120
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,570
Not bad.

121
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,550
Let me pack up, and we'll leave.

122
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,850
Okay.

123
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,930
Cheng.

124
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,510
Why weren't you answering?
I finally tracked you down.

125
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,550
Liu!

126
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,384
You're here, too?

127
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,970
I scheduled your blind date for tomorrow noon.

128
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,610
Kai, you're going on a blind date?

129
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,390
No, I didn't know about this!

130
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,770
What? What blind date?

131
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,430
Your mom arranged it with me.

132
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,430
Besides, last time at Ya En's shop,

133
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,970
we talked about finding you a girlfriend.

134
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,190
Listen, this girl's got great qualifications.

135
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,600
Meeting her won't hurt. Right?

136
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,690
But I--

137
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,770
Ya En, help me convince him.

138
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,550
He's being shy.

139
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,550
My mom--

140
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,550
Exactly! Just meet her.

141
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,730
Don't miss this chance.

142
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,230
Yeah, what's there to be shy about?

143
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,110
Your family already paid the agency fee.

144
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,610
Let me tell you, I'm a professional matchmaker.

145
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,990
Not like those agencies that just take your money.

146
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,810
Right, Liu is reliable.

147
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,310
- Let's go, Jia Yu.
- Mom, let's go.

148
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,960
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

149
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,970
Bye, Kai.

150
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,808
You...

151
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,930
But my mom never told me about this.

152
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,512
Your mom already prepaid for the service.

153
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:29,650
Enough. Listen.

154
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,510
Tomorrow at noon at Tide Restaurant.

155
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,008
Don't be late. Understood?

156
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,890
Don't be late.

157
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,270
Jia Yu, you...

158
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,610
Go, go.

159
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,190
- Don't be late.
- Okay, okay, okay.

160
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,650
- Alright, I'm off.
- Got it.

161
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,010
- Don't be late.
- Okay.

162
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,016
Goodbye, Liu.

163
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,550
Mom, a Ms. Liu told me

164
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,730
you set up a blind date for me tomorrow?

165
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,510
Hello, we have a reservation.

166
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,510
Ms. Fang, right this way.

167
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,850
I thought you hated this restaurant.

168
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,150
Why come here suddenly?

169
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,190
People's tastes change as they grow up.

170
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,110
Kai, what a coincidence.

171
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,030
Excuse me.

172
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,510
Such a coincidence. Your friend?

173
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,570
My parents wanted me to meet her.

174
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,650
Here for a blind date?

175
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,730
No, no.

176
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,110
W-W-Well, enjoy your meal.

177
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,550
We won't third-wheel. Go ahead.

178
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,070
- No.
- Bye, Kai.

179
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,390
You order, Jia Yu.

180
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,390
Thank you.

181
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,430
I'll have these fried chicken wings,

182
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,430
a potato salad,

183
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,010
and this... saury?

184
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,810
Sorry about that. I ran into someone I know.

185
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:08,110
That's okay. Did Liu brief you on me?

186
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,430
For drinks, vanilla milk tea.

187
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,470
Then an apple cake.

188
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,810
- Here.
- Got it.

189
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,770
The matchmaker who set us up,

190
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,610
didn't she tell you?

191
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,448
Maybe our parents discussed it?

192
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:35,424
Let me introduce myself.
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

193
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:37,510
My parents are educators, too.

194
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,510
I'm an only child.

195
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,470
I own both a car and an apartment.

196
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,190
I'm looking for someone compatible in Ningsui.

197
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,970
Chen Jia Yu, did you bring me here on purpose?

198
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,350
Mom, how could you suspect your own son?

199
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,690
Since when does my own son scheme against me?

200
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,910
And when did my mother become so contradictory?

201
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,390
Okay, you win.

202
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,550
What do you think of me?

203
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,550
Not bad.

204
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,610
I think we're quite compatible.

205
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,430
Good looks, height,
and financial stability, all satisfactory.

206
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,072
Rare to meet someone with decent features
through blind dates.

207
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:20,190
Since we both feel good about this,
let's try dating.

208
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,730
Actually, maybe not.

209
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,430
It's not you. It's me.

210
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,550
There's someone I like.

211
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,650
She hasn't accepted me yet,

212
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,650
but I won't give up.

213
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,390
I came today to make things clear.

214
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,230
I want to apologize.

215
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,510
That's okay. Having a crush is wonderful.

216
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,390
You should've told me earlier
to avoid her misunderstanding.

217
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,470
Let's consider today as making a new friend.

218
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,930
Here's to your success in love.

219
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,510
May you win her heart soon.

220
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,350
Wishing you all the best.
Thank you for understanding.

221
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,770
By the way, I opened a restaurant by the beach.

222
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,190
Bring your girlfriends sometime for a meal.

223
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,230
Absolutely, definitely.

224
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,150
Mom, what are you doing?

225
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,230
Let me take some photos of you.

226
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,850
This place has a nice ambiance.

227
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,650
Wait, let me pose.

228
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,150
Let me look.

229
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,610
This is blurry. We'll retake photos outside.

230
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,456
The lighting is not good.

231
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,850
Mom, I need to tell you something.

232
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,010
I didn't want to tell you at first.

233
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,800
It was a man's secret between me and Kai.

234
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,930
What is it?

235
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,320
Remember my school fight last time?

236
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,470
How could I forget?

237
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,952
They were talking trash about
you and Kai behind my back.

238
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:08,690
Otherwise, I wouldn't have fought them.

239
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,970
Why didn't you tell me then?

240
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,610
I didn't want you to blame yourself.
Kai thought the same.

241
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:19,810
Eat up before it gets cold.

242
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,230
I never thought there was anything wrong
with you and Kai being together.

243
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,890
Actually, I'm really happy

244
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,450
because now, there's another person
to protect you with me.

245
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,650
I understand now.

246
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:41,056
 

247
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,010
Hey, Meng.

248
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,890
 Where are you, sweetie? Busy this afternoon? 

249
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,150
I'm having lunch with Jia Yu.

250
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,050
It's fine. Mom, go with Godmother this afternoon.

251
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,050
I'm meeting Wang Si Si at the library.

252
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,088
Alright, I'm free now.

253
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:58,270
Where are you?

254
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,190
 - Let's meet at the cafe. 
- Okay.

255
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,220
What's with the grumpy face?

256
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,080
Arguing with someone?

257
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,820
Li Jin Yu again? What's wrong now?

258
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,300
Now, he's learned to stand me up.

259
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,060
Last night, we agreed
to adopt a cat from a cattery.

260
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,020
Now, he's pretending to be busy.

261
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,600
He just doesn't want me to have a cat.

262
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,600
Are you two fighting or flirting?

263
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,520
Just flirting.

264
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:37,408
But I really feel...

265
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:40,340
Do you think we've hit the marriage slump phase?

266
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,760
You two? Impossible.

267
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,680
You're practically glued together 24/7.

268
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,600
If separated by 100 meters,
you'll turn on location sharing.

269
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,340
Not that exaggerated.

270
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,380
Keep showing off your love then.

271
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,180
I need to ask him straight up.

272
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,880
You look off today. What's wrong?

273
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,480
Do I? Not really.

274
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,480
What's their blind date got to do with me?

275
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,220
Blind date? Who's dating?

276
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,720
Cheng Kai Ran went on a blind date
behind your back?

277
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,980
Watch your words. What 'behind my back'?

278
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,760
What relationship do I have with him?

279
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,680
Besides, blind dates are good for him.

280
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm like his elder sister. I should be supportive.

281
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,600
Right, and the girl's quite pretty.

282
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,920
She looks nice.

283
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,520
Who is she? From our town?

284
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,480
Do I know her?

285
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,180
I don't know her.

286
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,140
See if you do.

287
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,840
The same girl who smashed
bricks on hooligans' heads.

288
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Now playing paparazzi with secret photos?

289
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
What? Secret photos?

290
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,904
Give that to me.

291
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:17,340
I was taking photos of Jia Yu,

292
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,340
and she just happened to be in frame.

293
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,344
Hand it over.

294
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,060
You're acting really strange.

295
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,140
What's strange about me?

296
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,220
Super strange.

297
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,704
Am I?

298
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,600
Be honest. Have you been avoiding Kai recently?

299
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,140
Why didn't you attend
Jubaoshi Restaurant's opening?

300
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,520
Just busy, not avoiding.

301
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,060
Fang Ya En, sometimes,
you should really learn from me.

302
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,760
See, although Li Jin Yu and I started impulsively,

303
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,680
we've made it work in the end.

304
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,020
Don't let a bad experience
make you overly cautious.

305
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,420
If you like someone, just give it a shot.

306
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,180
This is so annoying.

307
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,640
Cowardly, aren't you?

308
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,260
You're blushing.

309
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm not! I really...

310
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,980
Honey.

311
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
You're home.

312
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,940
Quick, come sit down.

313
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,920
You must be exhausted today.

314
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,140
You do remember to come home, huh?

315
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,840
You stood me up today and came home this late.

316
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,680
Do you not want to see me anymore?

317
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Yes, I do.

318
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean it.

319
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,880
I don't want you to keep a cat

320
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,680
because your eyes sparkle more
for that cat than for me.

321
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,980
Why are you competing with a pet?

322
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,520
Are you saying I treat you like a pet in my mind?

323
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,020
Stop looking at me like that.

324
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,280
You really do act like a big cat.

325
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,880
Don't think this can distract me.

326
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,920
I think we've hit the marriage slump phase.

327
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,900
The slump phase.

328
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
Where did you even learn that term?

329
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,100
It is the slump phase.
Everything I do annoys you now.

330
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,480
Then let me show you what a real slump looks like.

331
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,140
What are you doing?

332
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,760
Which one of us is really in the slump?

333
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,100
Does the sight of me disgust you now?

334
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,840
No, no. I'm actually feeling nauseous right now.

335
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,320
Are you serious?

336
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Seriously?

337
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,100
Why did you buy so many?

338
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,584
I'm worried about false negatives.

339
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:28,760
Can't you read this?

340
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,880
It's clear here.

341
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,440
One line or two lines. Simple enough.

342
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,320
Well?

343
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm almost done.

344
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,560
What's the result?

345
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,560
If there's a baby,

346
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,300
will you be a good father?

347
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,220
I'll do everything to be the best dad.

348
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,400
Congratulations on your new role.

349
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
I got carried away. Is the baby okay?

350
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,380
The baby's fine. I'm just dizzy.

351
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,420
I'm going to be a dad!

352
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,680
Li Jin Yu.

353
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,180
From now on, no reckless movements.

354
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,520
- You need to lie down.
- I need to lie down?

355
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
Be careful.

356
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,800
- Lie still.
- I haven't taken my shoes off.

357
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,692
Let me do that. I'll help.

358
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,456
Hey, hey.

359
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:21,840
Hey, check.

360
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,420
Hey, hey, hey.

361
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,432
Come on.

362
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:27,460
Come on.

363
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,520
Give it to me. Be careful.

364
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,940
Stop overreacting.

365
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,380
I can't even hold a drink now.

366
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,740
Listen, you're pregnant now.

367
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,180
The embryo just implanted. Be extra careful.

368
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,220
- Don't take this lightly.
- I know.

369
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,520
Right now, sit.

370
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,320
- Tell us before doing anything.
- Right.

371
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,340
Don't move a muscle.

372
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,620
- Rest. Rest.
- Here's some fruit.

373
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,472
Quickly, quickly.

374
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,520
I gathered everyone here today

375
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,340
to share some great news.

376
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,380
Jia Yu, come here.

377
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,880
- To hear good news.
- Come on, Jia Yu.

378
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,080
Mai got accepted into Jiangbei Music Academy.

379
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,400
Really?

380
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,460
That's awesome, Mai!

381
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,740
Okay, keep it low-key.

382
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,960
To be honest, that school
accepts anyone who pays tuition.

383
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,080
But I used my own hard-earned money.

384
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,800
Anyway,

385
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,540
I am finally pursuing my music dreams.

386
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,680
Thanks for everyone's support.

387
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,980
Enjoy the feast today.

388
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,140
I'll work my final shift at Jubaoshi diligently.

389
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,888
Amazing. Keep it up, Mai.

390
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:26,980
Absolutely.

391
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,320
- Well done.
- Great.

392
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,240
Why are you so late?

393
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,340
The traffic was a nightmare.

394
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,180
I said skip it, but Mr. Gou insisted on coming.

395
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm scouting this place for potential acquisition.

396
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,100
It's mediocre.

397
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,020
No crowd, no unique features.

398
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm leaving.

399
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,520
Stop pretending.
Don't you need Jin Yu for something?

400
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,220
Do I?

401
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,040
Yes.

402
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,168
Hurry up.

403
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,840
These past few days,
I've given it some serious thought.

404
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,600
I know I've made mistakes, too.

405
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,220
I am not a petty person.

406
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,820
Let's leave the past in the past.

407
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,272
Come on.

408
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,440
Drink this, and we're still buddies.

409
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,220
This drink settles everything.

410
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,260
You're drinking without me?

411
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,420
You guys.

412
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,520
If you want acquisition,

413
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,060
you need to negotiate with me.

414
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,320
I hold all the business rights for this shop.

415
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,680
Your place isn't exactly unique.

416
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,880
Not unique?

417
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,060
Li Jin Yu, our trump card.

418
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,208
Mai!

419
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,380
He's calling you.

420
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,560
- Future superstar.
- Hello, boss.

421
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
You know what?

422
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,980
I'm planning to turn this place
into a live music bistro.

423
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Customers can enjoy meals with live performances.

424
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,580
It's called a livehouse.
You must have heard of it.

425
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,800
Livehouse.

426
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,060
Chinese accent.

427
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,640
Not bad, not bad.

428
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,480
I can invest.

429
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,520
But didn't you lie to me before?

430
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,328
Give us a performance.

431
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,600
I'm the boss here. Why should I perform?

432
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,880
He's giving you a chance.

433
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,260
Women understand women best. This could work.

434
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,520
Sing something!

435
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,900
Kai, give us a song!

436
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,880
A song! A song!

437
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,712
One song!

438
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,460
Sit still.

439
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,480
I'll sing you a love song.

440
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,720
This song sounds harsh,

441
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,680
but when I first heard it,

442
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,900
I thought the rhythm made my heart race.

443
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,400
But later, I realized

444
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,020
it was because of the girl beside me.

445
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,000
Which 'her'?

446
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,820
Mai.

447
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,300
Wait, again?

448
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,280
This sounds amazing.

449
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,240
 ♪ Rage ♪ 

450
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,640
 ♪ Grief ♪ 

451
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,780
Cheng Kai Ran, stop singing!

452
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,040
Kai, stop!

453
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,140

454
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,056

455
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,260
Look, Ya En is stunned.

456
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,480
Kai, stop, stop!

457
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,320
Enough! Enough!

458
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,840
Stop! That's enough!

459
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,760
- Stop singing!
- Wasn't that good?

460
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,520
What? Don't you like it?

461
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,960
Alright, get down already.

462
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,320
Mai, keep going.

463
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,840
- I'll take over.
- Follow my vibe.

464
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,100
- Okay.
- Let's do this!

465
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,980
- Mai is going to sing.
- Let's go.

466
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,680
We're coming, too.

467
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,840
- Coming!
- Problem?

468
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,620
- My song was no good?
- You're not singing that too, are you?

469
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,720
Sing whatever you want.

470
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,580
- Come on.
- Why don't you sing instead?

471
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,760
You do it.

472
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,960
You're the lead singer. Lead us.

473
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,300
- Can you sing?
- No.

474
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,760
My rhythm was okay, right?

475
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,300
Is your throat sore?

476
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,336
It's okay.

477
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:38,220
Have an orange.

478
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:50,840
If you're free these days, let's grab coffee.

479
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,600
L-L-Like afternoon tea.

480
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,600
When?

481
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,780
How about tomorrow?

482
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,960
Okay.

483
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,200
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

484

 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

499
00:30:18,464 --> 00:30:23,840
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

500
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,792
Sit.

501
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,840
Eat a lot, Ping An.

502
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,020
I'm going to be a father.

503
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,940
To be honest, I'm pretty nervous.

504
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,040
We're alike, you and I.

505
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,180
Both abandoned, then adopted.

506
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:59,100
But I hope he won't go through that.

507
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,560
I'll work hard to be a good dad

508
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,720
and give him a wonderful childhood.

509
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,720
You'll be an uncle soon.

510
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,980
Take family more seriously.

511
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,940
If the baby's upset, you wag your tail.

512
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,840
If he climbs high, be his cushion.

513
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,400
If it's a girl...

514
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,480
If she chases boys like her mom did, you...

515
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,100
Never mind, I'll handle that myself.

516
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,260
In short, I just hope

517
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,780
he can grow up happily and healthily.

518
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,480
No wonder you've been feeding
the dog so long today.

519
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,260
So this is where you were
confessing your love to our baby.

520
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,840
Not just to our baby.

521
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,480
But also to our baby's mom.

522
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,860
Thank you two for making me no longer lonely.

523
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,180
What's this about a girl chasing a boy
you mentioned earlier?

524
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,420
I think it's perfectly fine.

525
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,300
Otherwise how would I have gotten
such a beautiful wife? Right?

526
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,800
It's great you understand that.

527
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,560
But if our child is a girl,
she won't be allowed to.

528
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,980
Say that again.

529
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,060
Come on, let's go rest inside.

530
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,680
Godmother, I bought gifts
for the baby in your belly.

531
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,760
We've been waiting for you. Hurry up.

532
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,100
Sweetheart, stop jumping around.

533
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,340
Walk slower.

534
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,384
Don't worry. I'm fine.

535
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:09,980
The three of us are waiting for you to play.

536
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,340
We're jumping straight to the game table?

537
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,760
This is making me feel a bit embarrassed.

538
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,420
Come in quickly. My dad's waiting.

539
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,800
- Come on.
- Let's go.

540
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,140
The problem is that I don't know how.

541
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,260
I'll teach you.

542
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
How about poker?

543
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,348
That could work.

544
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,448
There actually is.

545
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,220
If you don't know, learn.

546
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,260
When you become a father,

547
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,420
you'll need to master all kinds of skills.

548
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,600
Understood.

549
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,880
Don't think rolling dumpling wrappers is easy.

550
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,720
Actually, it's a thankless job.

551
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,220
This is just like managing a family.

552
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,060
To maintain family happiness,

553
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,420
first, you need to apply effort correctly.

554
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,300
Do it right, and both substance
and appearance will shine.

555
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,140
Plus, it's resilient.

556
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,520
You're right.

557
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,680
The dumpling wrappers you roll
are especially resilient.

558
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,224
They don't leak even when overstuffed.

559
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:05,380
Let me tell you--

560
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,520
Mr. Ye, why don't you take a break
and drink some water?

561
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,340
Don't just teach your son-in-law everything.

562
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,720
- Teach me, too.
- This.

563
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Yes, yes, more filling. A bit more.

564
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,100
Otherwise we'll just be eating dough.

565
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,320
Okay, first pinch the middle.

566
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,100
Right, tuck the sides in.

567
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,020
Thanks, Dad.

568
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,380
For the postnatal meals
and dumpling recipes later,

569
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,008
I'll still need your guidance.

570
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:36,800
You want to learn that, too?

571
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,900
You know, there's a lot to this.

572
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,760
You should start by learning to make wrappers.

573
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,672
Give it a try.

574
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,020
Isn't this favoritism?

575
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,480
Go keep her company.

576
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,060
Jin Yu, I've finished prepping all the vegetables.

577
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,140
Can I go play now?

578
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,020
No playing. Go wash more water chestnuts.

579
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,400
Your sister-in-law loves
mushroom and water chestnut filling.

580
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,380
I don't want to hang out with you guys anymore.

581
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,420
Making us work with you every day.

582
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,980
If I'd known, I wouldn't have come here with you.

583
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,640
Get moving.

584
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Mai, when did you learn this skill?

585
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,920
Self-taught.

586
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,480
Good chance to practice.

587
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,980
If her fingers aren't enough,
she can use her toes, too.

588
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,180
Grandma, school's starting soon.

589
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,840
I need to earn some pocket money.

590
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,320
Don't worry. My skills are top-notch.

591
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,420
I trust you.

592
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,380
Grandma, pick a design and I'll do yours next.

593
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,840
How about the pink leopard design
to match your red heels?

594
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,020
Super trendy, I'm telling you.

595
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,980
These aren't long enough.

596
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,020
I want longer ones that glow in the dark.

597
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,480
When I wave my hands while dancing,

598
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,640
everyone at the square would be dazzled.

599
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,060
Put some fireflies on the nails, too.

600
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,720
- Okay, no problem.
- What do you know?

601
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,632
Mai, just use this French nude pink for me.

602
00:35:57,632 --> 00:36:00,760
- Understated.
- French style, huh?

603
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,340
I need my great-grandson

604
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:11,560
to feel my aesthetic taste
while still in the womb.

605
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,680
Meng, don't forget

606
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,300
to read Shakespearean sonnets
to my great-grandson every night.

607
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,180
Give it up. We've already planned.

608
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,920
He'll be a big boss, right, Meng?

609
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,020
Grandmas, the baby isn't even pea-sized yet.

610
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,920
Aren't you getting ahead of yourselves?

611
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,260
No, prenatal education must start in the womb.

612
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,600
Fine, I'll teach him Chinese cultural treasures.

613
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,880
She's being ridiculous.

614
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,980
Three of Characters.

615
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,760
I win.

616
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,640
- I win with that, too.
- Really?

617
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,340
- I...
- That's a double win.

618
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,140
- Really?
- Let me see if that's true.

619
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,800
- It's true.
- Who played this?

620
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,140
- How dumb.
- It's Meng.

621
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,060
She threw the winning tile to you?

622
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,640
They say pregnancy lowers IQ. So true!

623
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,480
Meng wasn't exactly sharp to begin with.

624
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,100
Now, the baby's absorbing all her brainpower.

625
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,560
Enough already.

626
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,020
Baby, even though you'll take our surname,

627
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,420
your brains better come from your father.

628
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,680
Don't inherit your mom's intelligence.

629
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,560
I can accept defeat
but not humiliation. Play again.

630
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,568
Bring it on.

631
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:15,720
Meng, listen to me.

632
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,920
To make your baby smart, start supplementing now.

633
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,480
I've got new prenatal vitamins, fish oil

634
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,340
and baby DHA supplements

635
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,140
- which boost brain development.
- Okay.

636
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,480
I'll send you the info. Super effective stuff.

637
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,520
Okay.

638
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,560
You've pivoted your business quickly.

639
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,640
Selling maternal products now?

640
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,720
Last time you forced
those beauty supplements on me,

641
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,376
they made me vomit and have diarrhea.

642
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:42,420
Be careful.

643
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,260
That was your weak constitution's fault.

644
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,380
Nothing wrong with my products.

645
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,760
They're nationally certified.

646
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,800
Besides,

647
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,840
the government encourages multiple children now.

648
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,288
I'm riding the trend.

649
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:54,140
What do you know? You're just fooling around.

650
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,340
Now, I get it.

651
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,520
Why are you playing mahjong with us today

652
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,260
instead of greeting CEOs Wang or Li?

653
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,600
Because your target client's right here.

654
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,960
Enough.

655
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,140
I'm doing this for Meng's sake.

656
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,060
What do you know? Always stirring trouble.

657
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,640
- I'm not.
- Calm down, calm down.

658
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,260
Honey, check those maternal products
our aunt sent.

659
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,520
Look carefully.

660
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,380
- Got it.
- Already sent.

661
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,880
Already sent.

662
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,980
Look how fast she did it.

663
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,140
Dad, I'll check on Meng.

664
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,420
Alright, stop being mad.

665
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,520
Honey, tired yet?

666
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,420
Not tired. I'm just getting started.

667
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,640
I'll beat them.

668
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,800
I'll help.

669
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,300
So it's team play now?

670
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,800
Double the loss when you lose?

671
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,720
- Deal.
- Double it is.

672
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,380
I'm good at mahjong, too.

673
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,640
Let me see, let me see.

674
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,344
You two, enough already!

675
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:46,380
Who pays if you lose?

676
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,840
Using assistants? Not playing then.

677
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,340
Wait! Let me help you.

678
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,760
We quit!

679
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,380
Don't.

680
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,680
Auntie's turn!

681
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,140
- You go.
- No, auntie first.

682
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,840
I'll check for you.

683
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,380
X-ray vision activated.

684
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,800
You win as soon as I come.

685
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,920
- You bring me luck.
- How does this start?

686
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,720
Come on.

687
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,608
- You start it.
- Roll the dice now.

688
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:09,680
You two.

689
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,340
Six! Six!

690
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,380
What's he doing?

691
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,272
Six across.

692
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,920
Take it easy.

693
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,720
No need to be so careful.

694
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,344
Come.

695
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,220
I love days like this.

696
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:18,100
Li Jin Yu, I've wanted to ask you something.

697
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,640
That first day we met at your door,

698
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,420
when you thought I wanted your WeChat ID,

699
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,060
who were you really calling?

700
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,340
I forgot.

701
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,720
Nonsense! You forgot?

702
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,680
With your perfect memory? How could you?

703
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,560
Come clean.

704
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,880
Actually, I wasn't calling anyone.

705
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,680
No call?

706
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:26,380
 

707
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,100
 Why is this a barbecue stall now? 

708
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,680
 Wasn't this Nantang Crab before? 

709
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,480
 Nantang Crab moved away ages ago. 

710
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,840
 Do you know where it is? 

711
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,816
 How would I know? 

712
00:42:58,084 --> 00:43:00,060
 
 I'd noticed you long ago. 

713
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,260
 I saw you approaching me, 

714
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,140
 so I pretended to be on a call. 

715
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,880
Li Jin Yu, you know the saying,

716
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,760
"The best hunters appear as prey."

717
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,420
You're something else.

718
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,860
Regretting it now? Too late.

719
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,032
No regrets.

720
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,720
Li Jin Yu,

721
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,220
the world loves you as much as I do.

722
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,260
See that cloud? Looks like your eyes.

723
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,060
Are you sure my eyes look like this?

724
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,020
Right, has anyone ever told you before

725
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,560
your eyes could make
looking at a trash can seem romantic?

726
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,800
No.

727
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,380
Actually, the world I used to see was colorless

728
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,420
until I saw you.

729
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,680
Then I realized I could taste the sweetness
of this world with my eyes.

730
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,640
Like tangerine-flavored sunsets

731
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,260
and watermelon-scented fireworks.

732
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,640
Alright, enough.

733
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,840
It's getting too cheesy.

734
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,800
Honestly, I now see something else in your eyes.

735
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,980
What is it?

736
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,520
I see your devotion to our family

737
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,900
and passion for life.

738
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,440
What else?

739
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,560
And me.

740
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,560
Who?

741
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,080
Li Jin Yu.

742
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,748
I'm here.

743
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:36,352
 

744
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,332
 ♫ You ♫ 

745
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:05,508
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

746
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,723
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

747
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:15,524
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

748
00:45:15,524 --> 00:45:21,444
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

749
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:25,604
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

750
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:28,068
 ♫ Go ♫ 

751
00:45:28,068 --> 00:45:30,084
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

752
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:34,212
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

753
00:45:34,212 --> 00:45:40,196
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

754
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:44,164
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

755
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:50,180
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

756
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:54,500
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

757
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,084
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

758
00:45:58,084 --> 00:46:04,164
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

759
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:08,925
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

760
00:46:08,925 --> 00:46:14,172
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

761
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:19,009
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

762
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,965
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

763
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:24,132
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

764
00:46:24,132 --> 00:46:28,932
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

765
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:31,076
 ♫ But why ♫ 

766
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:34,596
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

767
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:39,649
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
