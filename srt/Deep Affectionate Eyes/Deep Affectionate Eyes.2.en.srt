ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>DEEP AFFECTION EYES</i>
BY ER DONG TU ZI ON JJWXC.NET

2
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,920
Thanks for today.

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,080
Sis.

4
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,240
Sis, are you okay?

5
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,200
He left?

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,600
Yes. I've checked it.

7
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
Thank you. Sorry to trouble you.

8
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,520
No need to thank me.

9
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,840
If this happens again,

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,120
just come to me.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,840
My brother already told me

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,200
that you're loaded,
so you'll treat us right anyway.

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,200
How did you know?

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,440
Don't think we don't know.

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,400
- Just that--
- You go ahead first.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,760
Wasn't it you who said--

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,640
Alright then.

18
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,240
Sis, I'm just a call away.

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,120
Thanks.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,480
- So handsome!
- That guy in the bathroom just now…

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,600
That was him, right?

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,280
That's him.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,080
You sent Maimai to distract Cheng Kairan.

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,560
What makes you so sure she can fool him?

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,560
It's simply that I'm quite familiar
with Mr. Cheng's character.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,200
This kid's not just a good actor,

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,160
he understands people.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,000
Smart kid.

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
What do you want from me?

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
I came to apologize

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,120
about what happened with Jiang Luzhi. I--

32
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,000
Got it. Anything else?

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,800
Add my WeChat.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,720
You tanked your rep for me today.

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,080
I'll make it worth your while.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,600
I'll transfer the money soon. Scan me.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,640
Just ignore my sister's nonsense.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,640
Not necessary.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920
<i>Meng,</i>

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,520
<i>Dr. Gao's appointment is set.</i>

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,280
<i>No more no-shows.</i>

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,880
Then, let's try
a different kind of compensation.

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,000
Date me instead.

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm way more reliable than Jiang Luzhi.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
What happened to you ladies?

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,840
This eager to get married?

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,160
Are you really younger than me?

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
Two years younger.

49
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,920
How do you know?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
I accidentally saw your ID

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,320
<i>when paying at the hospital today.</i>

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,560
YE MENG

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,440
Are you following me?

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,360
You're overthinking.

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,480
I'm not that bored.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Alright then.

57
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
How do you feel about age gaps?

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,760
I only like them younger.

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,800
Preferably

60
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,120
the sweet, gullible type.

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,040
Get me?

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,080
You really do love playing the hero.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,640
You risked your reputation today for me,

64
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,000
all to make Jiang Luzhi jealous.

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,160
Was it worth it?

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,280
None of your business.

67
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,480
Hurry. Off you go.

68
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,680
Can I add you on WeChat?

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,280
This kid needs to learn
to protect himself too.

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Guard your reputation carefully.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
- One more skewer of this.
- This one?

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,200
- Yes.
- Okay.

73
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,320
- What else?
- And I'll take

74
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
another tofu skewer too.

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,720
- And meatballs.
- Meatballs.

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,240
- This one. Okay.
- How much is it?

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Twenty yuan.

78
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,960
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,480
I was still hungry all afternoon.

80
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
Here, you eat.

81
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
Ms. Mei, how much is it in total?

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
Ten yuan.

83
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,200
- Thank you, Ms. Mei.
- Sure.

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,920
Thank you for tutoring with me.

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,960
Aren't you just making up for it
by buying me food?

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Don't run away!

87
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,800
Don't chase me!

88
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,320
Is it Kai?

89
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
- What trouble is he in this time?
- Don't chase me!

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,640
- Can he win?
- Stop right there!

91
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,040
Don't run away!

92
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,160
No way he can win.

93
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,280
Help me, Ya'en Ye, Ye Meng!

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
- Stop!
- Help me!

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,160
Don't run away!

96
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,800
Hurry up!

97
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,600
- Don't run away!
- Don't run away!

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,320
FANG YA'EN

99
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,840
YE MENG

100
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
NO BULLYING KAI

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,840
Meng, who would've thought?

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,720
Even after all those years in Jiangbei,

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
you've kept your habit of early mornings.

104
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,480
Good.

105
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
From now on, you'll join your old grandma

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,120
at the morning market every day.

107
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,360
Grandma,

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm into running.

109
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,120
That's why I'm up early.

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,600
You stick to your grocery shopping.

111
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
Morning runs are perfect.

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,280
Dr. Gao's early shifts start around then.

113
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
You two could squeeze in a date.

114
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,480
Do you know how many girls

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
are lining up for him?

116
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,480
Listen here.

117
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
Even if your legs break tomorrow,

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,800
you'll crawl there dressed to impress.

119
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,360
You listening?

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
And don't pretend
you didn't hear me this time!

121
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,800
Alright, I know. Let's go.

122
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,120
- Everyone's waiting at home.
- Are you going?

123
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,960
Yeah, I'll go tomorrow.

124
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,720
Hello.

125
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
<i>What has Cheng Kairan been up to lately?</i>

126
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,360
Cheng Kairan?

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,880
Well, he's made something of himself now.

128
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,560
But his whole situation…

129
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,760
I can't really explain it over the phone.

130
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,920
<i>After I married, Chen Jian forbade me</i>

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,120
<i>from keeping in touch with him.</i>

132
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,320
<i>So, we haven't seen each other in years.</i>

133
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
That scar on his face…
Is that from back then?

134
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
<i>Exactly.</i>

135
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,560
<i>He was a handsome kid once.</i>
<i>Now that scar's ruined his face.</i>

136
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,640
And he's been hunting for you.

137
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,440
<i>For years,</i>

138
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,760
<i>he stalked your old house</i>
<i>by Nantang Temple.</i>

139
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,120
<i>Only when your grandma</i>
<i>moved in with Big Aunt</i>

140
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,360
did he back off.

141
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,960
But he swore you'd pay.

142
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,160
<i>Every last bit.</i>

143
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
<i>Then I'll go talk to him myself.</i>

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
No, wait for me.

145
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,560
Wait until I get out of the hospital,
then I'll help you find him.

146
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,360
You're supposed to be
the "perfect wife and mother."

147
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
Why are you meddling in this?

148
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,040
Don't worry.

149
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
I'll handle it myself.

150
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,120
CONQUER THE NEW SEMESTER

151
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,800
What a coincidence.

152
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,120
You show up at my bar

153
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
with some "what a coincidence" act?

154
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,600
Why aren't you dodging anymore?

155
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,000
Do you have time?

156
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,760
Let's talk about the past.

157
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,960
Sure.

158
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,520
I know you've been haunted
by what happened back then.

159
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
<i>Today, I came to tell you the truth.</i>

160
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
<i>I did call the police,</i>

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
<i>but they couldn't find any of you.</i>

162
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,480
<i>Because none of you wanted</i>
<i>to set foot in a police station,</i>

163
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,360
<i>those guys fled, and you ran too.</i>

164
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,360
Hello. 110?

165
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,840
I need to report a crime.

166
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,440
Call the police?

167
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,760
We were so close back then.

168
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,039
You watched them drag me away.
Didn't lift a finger to save me.

169
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,039
I didn't realize how serious it was.

170
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,600
You were constantly
picking fights every other day.

171
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
- So, I didn't know--
- Cut the act!

172
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
What's the point of all this now?

173
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,520
Fine.

174
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,040
You're determined to pin
everything on me. Is that it?

175
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,920
Yes!

176
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,840
Then just stab me too.
Will that finally satisfy you?

177
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,040
You think I don't dare?

178
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,800
Kai.

179
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,520
No matter what happened,

180
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,960
a real man doesn't lay hands on a woman.

181
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,920
That's just not right.

182
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,280
Release it.

183
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,280
Brother, Jinyu,

184
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,720
what are you doing?

185
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,360
- Why are you here?
- How did you hurt your hand?

186
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,840
What are you doing here?

187
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
Jinyu has a performance tonight.

188
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,040
Since I finally have a day off,
I came to watch

189
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,320
and maybe get some extra tutoring
from him after.

190
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,880
Kai,

191
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,280
I truly want you to live well.

192
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,120
If that scar bothers you so much,

193
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,080
I know a doctor who could remove it.

194
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,520
Jinyu, are you okay?

195
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Jingjing, let's go.

196
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
I'm coming.

197
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,760
- Show me your hand.
- It's okay.

198
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,800
How long exactly
are you planning to follow me?

199
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,640
Not following you.

200
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,920
My place is this way too.

201
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,800
Thanks for today.

202
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,720
Though that girl back there,

203
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,240
sweet and innocent,

204
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
totally your type, right?

205
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,080
I won't cross Cheng Kairan,

206
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,880
nor do I have the interest or energy

207
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,440
for your little dating games.

208
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,120
What about Jiang Luzhi?

209
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
Why did you date her then?

210
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,560
Because she is prettier than you.

211
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
You're the kid I've ever met
with the most terrible taste.

212
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,400
But you are the one with good taste to me.

213
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm home now.

214
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,880
Guess our paths don't align anymore?

215
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
Super on your way.

216
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,120
I forgot my keys today.

217
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,360
Mind if I borrow
your place to get to mine?

218
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,000
Thanks.

219
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,800
Wanna come over to my place?

220
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
Nah, I'm good.

221
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,880
I'm leaving then.

222
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,920
Are you still alive?

223
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Still alive.

224
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,240
I'll make sure to include

225
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,920
your injury compensation when I pay you.

226
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,360
What, are you made of money?

227
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,040
You're always paying for everyone.

228
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,040
Don't forget to treat that wound.

229
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,720
All these years.

230
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,840
Only you're still here.

231
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,360
NINGSUI BEER, EDGE-LESS TOAST BREAD

232
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,320
What are you doing up here?

233
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
OCEAN BLUE BAY PHASE III NOW LEASING

234
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,360
<i>Baby,</i>

235
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,320
<i>are your eyes tired?</i>

236
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,520
Mom, I'm so tired.

237
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,480
Here, have some milk first.

238
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,440
Let's just finish this last one,
then it's straight to bed, okay?

239
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,520
Mom, I don't wanna do this anymore.

240
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Why giving up now?

241
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,200
If you quit, you'll repeat the year.

242
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,840
Listen to Mom. Drink your milk first.

243
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,280
It'll give you energy.

244
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,120
Come on. Just a few sips.

245
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,240
<i>Look how well you're doing!</i>

246
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,800
<i>My clever girl!</i>

247
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,880
AUDIO MESSAGE

248
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,160
<i>You asleep?</i>

249
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,760
<i>Seems like you've been doing well lately.</i>

250
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,600
<i>I'm good.</i>

251
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,720
<i>Just checking in. How's life over there?</i>

252
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,640
<i>I'll be traveling for work soon,</i>

253
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,680
<i>so maybe I can swing by and see you.</i>

254
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,000
Dr. Gao,

255
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,000
I've already shipped you the first batch.

256
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,880
This is their newest product.
Check it out.

257
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,560
The results are unreal.

258
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,079
One day post-op, next day walking.

259
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,000
- You're the doc, you know--
- You're back.

260
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,480
Finally decided to show up?

261
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,440
Dr. Gao's been waiting forever.

262
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,240
Were you too busy keeping company

263
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,880
for your lady friend at the hospital?

264
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,800
Meng's got a heart of gold.

265
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,000
Nah.

266
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,640
Hit the club last night.

267
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,640
Danced till sunrise.

268
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
- Was too wrecked to come back.
- Classic you. So damn cool.

269
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
Miss Ye.

270
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,920
We meet again.

271
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,280
You two know each other?

272
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,160
Meng, come sit over here.

273
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,840
- Scoot! Make room!
- No…

274
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,280
Come here.

275
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,600
Didn't sell, did it?

276
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,160
Sit here.

277
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,320
Dr. Gao,

278
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,080
last time you visited,

279
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,920
Meng was swamped with work,

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,320
but she's free today.

281
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,560
You youngsters should talk.

282
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,600
Really talk.

283
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,400
Grandma, where are you off to?

284
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
It's so much nicer when we chat together.
Come on. Sit down.

285
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,160
Right here!

286
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,080
Dr. Gao,

287
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,840
since we've already met

288
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,800
and you know all my information,

289
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,800
let's go through my humble requirements.

290
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,160
Sure.

291
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,120
After marriage,
we'll live at my parents' home.

292
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,960
On weekdays,
you'll wake up before 6:30 a.m. daily.

293
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,880
I value family-oriented partners,

294
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,320
so you'll need

295
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
to cancel all work-related

296
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,560
social engagements, okay?

297
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,760
With so many at home,
breakfast needs separate prep.

298
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
Grandma's teeth need extra attention.

299
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
Her congee must be extra soft.

300
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,880
Big Aunt loves
South Street's oily sugar cakes.

301
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,600
Use paper towels to blot all that grease.

302
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,040
Middle Aunt prefers
West Street's soup dumplings. Right?

303
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,360
That shop's always packed.
Go queue 30 minutes early

304
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,600
- or we'll miss out.
- None for me. I'm on a diet.

305
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,960
Aren't those your fave?

306
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,000
Then there's Little Aunt.

307
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,640
She's back from abroad,

308
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,040
so she's all about Western food.

309
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,040
Bagels, toast, all that needs to be ready.

310
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,320
And the coffee has to be
freshly-ground, obviously.

311
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
How'd I do?

312
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,760
Anything to add, everyone?

313
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,280
Why did you hit me?

314
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,920
Grandma needs soft food.

315
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,440
Big Aunt prefers low-grease sugar cakes.

316
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,160
Middle Aunt craves
South Street's soup dumplings.

317
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,520
Gotta queue early.

318
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,760
Little Aunt's all about bagels.

319
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,800
Don't forget freshly-ground coffee.

320
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,280
Okay.

321
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,400
Got it. Every detail locked in.

322
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,640
Good thing

323
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm an early riser anyway.

324
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,520
Future kids will take my surname,

325
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,440
Ye. No objections, right?

326
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm the last heir in this family,

327
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,200
so I've decided to follow
the nation's initiative

328
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
to have two kids, both Ye's.

329
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
You'll raise them.

330
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,160
That works for you?

331
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,920
Childbearing's hard on women.

332
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
I get why you'd ask.

333
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,480
And the surname doesn't matter to me.

334
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,760
We're family either way.

335
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,840
Dr. Gao, out with it.

336
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,360
How much did my grandma
pay you to marry me?

337
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,600
Grandma says after marriage,

338
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
I won't need to buy a house or car.

339
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,800
The old family home at Nantang Temple
gets put in my name…

340
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,720
Only after I turn 50.

341
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,720
By 50, that place
will be a condemned wreck.

342
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,200
Fine.

343
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,400
If Dr. Gao doesn't agree,

344
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,960
then we're done here.

345
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,680
I was joking about the house thing.

346
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,760
I already have a place and a car.

347
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,520
What I mean is,

348
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,680
I agree.

349
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,600
That's wonderful.

350
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,600
Let's chat some more--

351
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,600
- You, sit down.
- What are you doing?

352
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Dr. Gao,

353
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,560
- shall we exchange contacts?
- What are you doing?

354
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,080
- Sure.
- Alright.

355
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
- Why is that?
- You youngsters chat away.

356
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,640
- Like you're the only one allowed to?
- Here, scan my code.

357
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,560
- Take it back.
- Okay.

358
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,360
- You try it first.
- You like drinking coffee too.

359
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,360
- Dr. Gao.
- Nourish yin, boost kidneys.

360
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,880
Dr. Gao!

361
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,320
You like drinking coffee too.

362
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,240
You're so annoying.

363
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,760
I've been to this shop too.

364
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,880
What coffee?

365
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,160
Since when do Chinese people
drink coffee every single day?

366
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,280
Come on. Better than

367
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,920
- the health products you sell.
- Take nutritional supplements.

368
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,680
Li Jinyu.

369
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,960
Li Jinyu, are you at home?

370
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,680
Li Jinyu!

371
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
Morning.

372
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,400
Good morning!

373
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,040
Did you sleep well?

374
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,400
327-3 XINGYI ROAD

375
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Climb over my wall
to get to your place again?

376
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,400
No need today.

377
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
I've got my keys this time.

378
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
What do you want then?

379
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,360
Since our power is out,

380
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,480
could I borrow a toolbox?

381
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,560
Is that your puppy?

382
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,600
So adorable. What's their name?

383
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,880
Ping'an.

384
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,320
Hi, Ping'an.

385
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,640
I just moved in next door.

386
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,360
That makes me your new neighbor sister.

387
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,640
What's it doing up there? Not coming down?

388
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,440
It's obsessed with getting to the rooftop

389
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,400
but can never make it.
Stubborn little thing.

390
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,600
Sounds just like you. Good luck!

391
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,920
- How's your hand doing?
- No big deal.

392
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
Glad it's okay.

393
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,040
If anything happened to your hands
that put you off your piano,

394
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,480
I could never repay the loss.

395
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,920
Thank you!

396
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,720
Goodbye.

397
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Li Jinyu.

398
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,080
Anything else?

399
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,880
I just realized
I'm not great with toolkits.

400
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,920
So, I'd like to hire an electrician
by the hour instead.

401
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
Thank you.

402
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,560
Meng.

403
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,960
"I've moved in with Fang Ya'en."

404
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,400
This kid!

405
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,680
I found the circuit diagram. Take a look.

406
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,240
Got it?

407
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,160
When I was at the hospital that day,

408
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,240
I noticed you have a crazy good memory.

409
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,040
Didn't memorize it.

410
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,920
How are you supposed to fix it?

411
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,960
I already know how.

412
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,320
You're just full of skills.

413
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,560
- Fixed.
- So fast.

414
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,520
Thanks.

415
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,800
But the lights still aren't on.
You sure you fixed it?

416
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,040
Turns out nothing needs fixing.

417
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,280
You just forgot to pay the electric bill.

418
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,360
Don't forget to clock my hourly rate.

419
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,840
What's wrong?

420
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,880
Give me your contact.

421
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,160
I'll transfer the money to you.

422
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,360
Payment QR code.

423
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,440
Paying by the hour.

424
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,920
I'll send you for one hour.

425
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,920
Fifty yuan enough?

426
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,360
What are you drinking?

427
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,160
My water dispenser's still broken,
and I'm parched too.

428
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,560
There's water in the fridge.
Help yourself.

429
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,440
<i>MEMORY PALACE</i>

430
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,920
<i>MEMORY PALACE</i>

431
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,800
<i>Memory Palace.</i>

432
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,200
I've seen that book before.

433
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,080
From what I hear,

434
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,800
it teaches you

435
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,960
to use familiar mental spaces

436
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,960
to memorize new, unfamiliar information,

437
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,600
like having rooms

438
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,840
in your mind

439
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,840
where each one
stores massive amounts of data.

440
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,760
Right?

441
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,880
Pretty much.

442
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,320
But it doesn't have to be a house.

443
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,600
It can be simplified.

444
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,120
It could be a person,

445
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,680
<i>- even a single phrase.</i>
- You bastard,

446
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,240
- Mom!
- get out of here!

447
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,280
- Get lost!
<i>- Just close your eyes</i>

448
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,480
- Mom!
<i>- and picture any familiar object.</i>

449
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,520
<i>When you need the memory,</i>

450
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,440
<i>use your association skills to link</i>

451
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,880
<i>new information to these mental anchors.</i>

452
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,640
It will be a bit easier

453
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,120
to remember things this way.

454
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,080
That's impressive. What's your alma mater?

455
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,000
No college degree.
Just a high school diploma.

456
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,040
High school diploma.

457
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,680
What?

458
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,200
Your fancy college degree

459
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,720
make you look down
on us high school grads?

460
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,040
How could I?

461
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,760
I didn't go to a prestigious university.

462
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,000
Jiang Luzhi did,

463
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,920
but she never looked down on you.

464
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,760
Why would I?

465
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
I've already broken up with her.

466
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,880
Yeah, ex-girlfriend.

467
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,400
But seriously, this <i>Memory Palace</i>
looks legit impressive.

468
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,800
A razor-sharp memory

469
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
isn't always a blessing.

470
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,280
What's the downside?

471
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
If I'd learned this back then,

472
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,880
maybe I could've outscored Jiang Luzhi.

473
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,600
You have no idea.

474
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,200
I memorized until
my hair literally thinned

475
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,400
and still failed.

476
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Why do you always
compare yourself to Jiang Luzhi?

477
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,600
Not necessarily.

478
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,640
But didn't you say she's prettier than me?

479
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,360
There's always someone prettier.

480
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,600
That'd be endless competitions.

481
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,720
Who are they? Tell me.

482
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
Anything else?

483
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,720
Nothing really.

484
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,160
I mostly came by to ask,

485
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,680
are you free tomorrow?
I'd like to take you out to eat.

486
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,400

Jinyu, what's wrong with you?

506
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,600
What's wrong?

507
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,080
Dad, Mom doesn't want me anymore.

508
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,080
How could she ever not want you?
Mom's just upset right now.

509
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,000
It'll pass, I promise.

510
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,200
Please take me abroad with you.

511
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,840
- Don't leave me behind.
- Okay.

If I cheer you up,
will you rank up with me?

534

Has anyone ever told you
you're impossible?

No desserts for difficult people!

539
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,320
What?

540
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,320
You asked Li Jinyu

541
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,120
if he wants to date you.

542
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,440
A little louder and I'll be deaf.

543
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,600
I haven't even scolded you

544
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,280
for dropping big news while I was eating.

545
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,520

specially delivering this milk pudding.

547
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,720
Do I really seem like the type
to ditch friends for a pretty face?

548
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,680
- Aren't you?
- Then don't eat it anymore.

549
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,600
Give it to me.

550
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,280
Wow, talk about a face-slap.

551
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,080
Just days ago,

552
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,720
you swore you'd never

553
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,840
date Jiang Luzhi's ex.

554
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
And now? Full-on simp mode?

555
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,880
Me? A simp?

556
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,840
Please, he just happens to be my type,

557
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,400
and my family
won't stop nagging me to marry.

558
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,080
- I need a boyfriend as a cover.
- Cut the crap.

559
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,280
You're only after him
because Jiang Luzhi has been

560
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,280
outshining you for years.
This is your petty revenge plot.

561
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,360
Well, this backfired,

562
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,200
and now the kid's being difficult too.

563
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
Well, well, if it isn't the kid himself.

564
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,280
What's he doing here?

565
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,560
We just got new inventory in,

566
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,480
and I need muscle.
Granny Tou mentioned he's free

567
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,760
for part-time work.
Might as well keep it in the family.

568
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,280
Ya'en.

569
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,360
Ye Meng bought me this
double-skin milk pudding.

570
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,840
Try some. It's incredibly sweet.

571
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,520
No, thank you.

572
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,080
Well,

573
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,800
your main tasks today.
Hang up these new arrivals.

574
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,960
Pack some items for warehouse storage.

575
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,880
And sort the rest for today's shipments.

576
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,200
- No problem.
- Sure.

577
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,400
For specifics, ask Ye Meng.

578
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,800
She knows the details.

579
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,160
I'll sort out the shipping orders.

580
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,520
- I'll help you up.
- No need.

581
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,440
Do your stuff.

582
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,160
Oh, now you can speak properly?

583
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,000
You can greet her in good manners.

584
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,800
But treat me with such an icy poker face?

585
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,960
If you want smiley service,
that's gonna cost you extra.

586
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,000
What are you doing here?

587
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Boss,

588
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,480
you don't mind if I pick up
some part-time work, right?

589
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,920
Go ahead with your work.

590
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,240
Here for Ya'en?

591
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
- Let me call her for you.
- No.

592
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,720
I'm here for you.

593
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Let's talk outside.

594
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,080
What's the matter?

595
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,280
I…

596
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,880
I came to apologize.

597
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,680
I know

598
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,440
you were provoking me on purpose that day.

599
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,280
You knew

600
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,160
I'd never actually hurt you.

601
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,240
But I also can't

602
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,160
pretend we can just stay strangers.

603
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,400
Alright, I understand.
Was there anything else?

604
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,560
What's your relationship with this guy?

605
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,320
You're younger than him.

606
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,200
Stop calling him "this guy."
He has a name.

607
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,240
Listen, you need to stay away from him.

608
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,520
Don't be fooled by how nice
he is to the old lady now.

609
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,560
That filial piety is all fake.

610
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,080
When he first got here,
he got into a fight

611
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,400
and sent someone to the ICU.

612
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,200
If she hadn't spent her life savings
to pay over the compensation,

613
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,240
he'd be finished by now.

614
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,680
Cheng Kairan, don't tell me
you never fought as a kid?

615
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,480
We've all been young and reckless.
Who hasn't made mistakes?

616
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Honestly,

617
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,520
I could expose this bastard's scandals
for three days straight!

618
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,240
He's a total scumbag.

619
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,640
At my bar,

620
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,800
he's always swimming in women.

621
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,160
Has every auntie in town
wrapped under his tricks.

622
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,120
Remember Granny Zhang from town?

623
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,720
The one with all-white hair?

624
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,160
Well, two days ago,
in my shop's women's restroom,

625
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,960
she and another woman were…

626
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
- I know.
- I can't even say it out loud.

627
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,280
I know.

628
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,360
You know?

629
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,640
So, it was you in the booth that day.

630
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,400
When did you two meet?

631
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
- We just met.
- Just met?

632
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
Just met, and he's already
helping you lie to me?

633
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,680
That little brat must've

634
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,160
forgotten who's paying his salary.

635
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,840
Wait.

636
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Don't tell me he likes you?

637
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,440
Cheng Kairan,

638
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,920
don't try anything funny.

639
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,840
When I lose control,
even I can't predict what I'll do.

640
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,320
Listen carefully.

641
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
if anyone messes with him in the future,

642
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,880
I'm holding you accountable.

643
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,720
Why are you still here?

644
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
- No, Ye Meng, I…
- Oh?

645
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,640
To what do I owe the honor, Kai?

646
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,800
Marching into my place

647
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,000
looking ready to throw hands.

648
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,000
Here to pick up fights?

649
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,120
You're crippled, Ya'en.

650
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,840
Don't worry about it.

651
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,120
I've been cursed.

652
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,080
Next time

653
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,000
you need help with anything,

654
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,000
just tell me directly.

655
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,560
I'll send someone from my bar.

656
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,960
Oh, please, with your people

657
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,760
standing guard, who'd dare come in?

658
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,200
I'll be out of business in days.

659
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,720
No big deal.

660
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,200
- I'm okay.
- Bit busy right now.

661
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
What are you here for?

662
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,640
Heard you hurt your leg.
Just came by to check on you.

663
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,320
Stop the act, alright?

664
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,720
I've told you.

665
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,640
Once this waiting period's over,
we shall get the paperwork done.

666
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,480
I want to take my son back for a few days.
Grandma's missing her grandson.

667
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,360
Now you want to be a good dad?

668
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,680
Ye Meng.

669
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,560
Rumor has it
you're barely scraping by in Jiangbei.

670
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,560
Pathetic.

671
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,200
All those retakes

672
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,360
just to flunk into some third-rate college

673
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,640
and still a nobody.

674
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,240
Just move back home already.

675
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Get a stable job.

676
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,440
Maybe even land yourself
a respectable husband.

677
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,640
Who are you?

678
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,000
- Looking to get smacked in the mouth?
- Who are you?

679
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,040
Allow me to grandly introduce

680
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,480
Chen Jian,

681
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,760
our dear Ya'en's
wonderfully proper ex-husband.

682
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,040
A truly upstanding decent man.

683
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,480
Watch your mouth!

684
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,840
And what do you mean "ex-husband"?
We're not even fully divorced yet.

685
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,000
Soon, very soon.

686
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,680
If you want

687
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,280
to skip the waiting period, fine.

688
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,400
Ya'en can file for divorce immediately.

689
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,520
She's showing you mercy

690
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,080
only because you're
the father of her child.

691
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,200
Just leave already.

692
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,880
As for your request, noted.

693
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,800
I will ask Jiayu when he returns.

694
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,720
Fine.

695
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,840
But watch who you associate with.
I won't have you corrupting the child.

696
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,760
Ye Meng, this is the guy you vouched for?

697
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,080
Won't even stand up for you

698
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,600
when you're being bullied.

699
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,240
Do you need it?

700
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,840
Do I need it?

701
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,520
Perfect!

702
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,960
Then you don't need to go to my bar,

703
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,640
since you've already
found a side gig, right?

704
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,240
If anything else comes up,
go find your Lady Ye.

705
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,400
Kai, take some fruits with you.

706
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,840
You two keep these for yourselves.

707
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,680
