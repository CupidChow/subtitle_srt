1
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:11,845
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,459
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,244
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:20,773
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:25,925
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:31,173
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:34,661
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:38,125
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:42,757
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:49,029
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:53,765
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,845
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,845 --> 00:01:01,029
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:03,045
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:06,013
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,909
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,237
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,292
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,269
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:20,284
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:30,720
 

22
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,909
Are you satisfied with my makeup skills?

23
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,109
Yes.

24
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:42,389
Let me take a look.

25
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:45,529
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.

26
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,989
What's this? Are you crying? Don't cry.

27
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,589
I worked so hard on your makeup.
Don't ruin it now.

28
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:53,429
I'm just overwhelmed with joy.

29
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:56,096
I know. Here.

30
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:02,109
Look at us. You're not doing much better.

31
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:04,649
Happy wedding day, my dear.

32
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,249
You'll take on many roles in the future.

33
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,649
As a wife, a mother...

34
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,109
But to me,

35
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:18,649
you'll always be that carefree child
who does as she pleases.

36
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,729
Alright, alright, Fang Ya En.

37
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,329
I'll always be here for you, you know that?

38
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:24,429
I'll be here for you, too.

39
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,649
No, no, be careful.

40
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,289
Don't think I don't know.

41
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:33,389
I can see Cheng Kai Ran's intentions.

42
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,309
What do you think about it?

43
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:41,109
There's really nothing between us.

44
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:46,749
And I truly don't plan
to start any new relationship.

45
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,249
Because of Jia Yu?

46
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:52,689
Not entirely.

47
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,528
To be honest,

48
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:57,389
it feels really awkward.

49
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,369
Kai used to like you.

50
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:02,949
Right? Isn't that true?

51
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,289
Now, he suddenly shifts his attention to me.

52
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:08,649
It just feels so strange. No, absolutely not.

53
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,289
This is all so confusing.

54
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,809
Does he really like me? He mistook me for you.

55
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:17,489
Don't dismiss him
because of these ridiculous things.

56
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,509
Anyway, I'm perfectly fine as I am now.

57
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,909
I just want to keep living
this simple and quiet life.

58
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:30,729
But don't overthink things, okay?

59
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:34,109
Alright, it's your big day. I get it.

60
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:38,069
People should still believe in love, right?

61
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,549
Exactly.

62
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,649
Ya En, you'll definitely find your happiness.

63
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,709
Close the door! Close it!

64
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:55,689
Ladies, ladies, have mercy!

65
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,109
Ladies, please go easy on us.

66
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,069
If you want to take the bride,
you must pass our test.

67
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,769
- Listen to the challenge.
- Listen.

68
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,109
- Here's the question.
- Question.

69
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,429
Name ten loving nicknames
for the bride in 20 seconds. Ready? Go!

70
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:16,429
This is impossible!

71
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:18,689
- Why the rush?
- Sweetheart.

72
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:19,889
Meng.

73
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:20,909
Louder!

74
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:23,369
Darling.

75
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:25,909
Can I just give red envelopes instead?

76
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:27,549
No way!

77
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:28,989
- They must be affectionate!
- Beauty.

78
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,329
- Yeah!
- Gorgeous.

79
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,249
Next question! Change the challenge!

80
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,509
Red envelopes! Quick, quick!

81
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,369
- There's more where that came from.
- Right.

82
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:39,429
Now for the second question.

83
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:44,049
Share your most memorable moment
during your courtship.

84
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,989
I forced you to marry me.

85
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,109
You! Stay out of this!

86
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:50,389
- I'm asking him!
- Traitor!

87
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:53,069
Speak!

88
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,209
Quick, think of something!

89
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,469
Any nickname is fine as long as it's for you.

90
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:01,429
You never forced me. No aggressive pursuit.

91
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,649
I expressed my feelings very early on.

92
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:07,349
I said I knew I would inevitably fall for you.

93
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:13,209
Fair ladies, does this answer suffice?
Let us through.

94
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:16,169
These red envelopes are packed full. I'm rich now.

95
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,048
Right!

96
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:20,729
We're being too kind.

97
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,509
Quick, get in! Move, move!

98
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,069
Red envelopes! Here! Ladies!

99
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,589
Red envelopes! Take them, take them!

100
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,069
- Grabbing so quickly?
- Gone! All gone!

101
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,209
 

102
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,089
The bride and groom,
please serve tea to your father.

103
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:43,229
Dad, have some tea.

104
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,789
Dad, please have some tea.

105
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,209
Here, take this.

106
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,664
Thank you, Dad.

107
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,296
Mom.

108
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:11,789
The bride and groom,
please serve tea to both families' elders.

109
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:19,909
Grandma, please have some tea.

110
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,232
Be careful.

111
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,024
It's sweet.

112
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:34,729
Here.

113
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,529
This is for you.

114
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:38,729
Thank you, Grandma.

115
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,389
Wishing you eternal harmony and a child soon.

116
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,789
Yes, hurry up.

117
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,589
To your aunts.

118
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,520
Slow down.

119
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,369
Aunt.

120
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,109
Aunt.

121
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,609
May your hearts stay united forever.

122
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:03,329
Aunt.

123
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,589
Aunt.

124
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,729
Great wealth and honor.

125
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,209
All the money must go to Meng
from now on. Understood?

126
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,089
No problem. Definitely.

127
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,289
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

128
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:16,989
- What?
- Aunt.

129
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:18,469
Aunt.

130
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:23,589
Treat Meng well and stay happy forever.

131
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,849
- Thank you.
- Absolutely. Rest assured.

132
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:28,769
That's enough.
Time for the Western ceremony, right?

133
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,509
- Western style.
- Yes, go change your clothes.

134
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:32,649
- Change your clothes!
- Go quickly!

135
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:36,069
- I'll go change then.
- Go ahead.

136
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,689
- Hurry up.
- Come here.

137
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,689
I will hold these for you.

138
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,729
- There's another red envelope.
- Here's another one.

139
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,769
- Bring it over.
- Take them all.

140
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,029
I held it so long.

141
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:45,856
Hurry up!

142
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:50,528
 

143
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:11,872
 ♫ If the sun goes down, I'll come to you ♫ 

144
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:18,112
 ♫ I won't let you stay here in the dark alone ♫ 

145
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:26,176
 ♫ If you say you feel the night and cold ♫ 

146
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:33,056
 ♫ I'll light a candle
to warm your heart and soul ♫ 

147
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:39,936
 ♫ I'll run my fingers through your hair ♫

00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:46,848
 ♫ Then watch the stars shining down down down ♫ 

149
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:50,368
 ♫ I will go wherever you go ♫ 

150
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:53,856
 ♫ I will stop whenever you stop ♫ 

151
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:57,280
 ♫ Even far away from home ♫ 

152
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,470
 ♫ I will make you feel like home again ♫ 

153
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,096
 ♫ Just so put up your arms, scared, ready to fly ♫ 

154
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:07,488
 ♫ I will get you up whenever you fall ♫

 ♫ You will never ever be alone ♫ 

157
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,529
Meng, live well with Jin Yu.

158
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:24,429
Jin Yu, I entrust her to you.

159
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:27,709
Don't worry, Dad. I'll take good care of Meng.

160
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:32,524
 ♫ Nothing left to say ♫ 

161
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:37,568
 ♫ You were thinking he's the one to hold ♫ 

162
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:44,992
 ♫ But today he broke your heart and made you cry ♫

00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:58,912
 ♫ That's in my heart ♫ 

167
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:02,285
 ♫ I will go wherever you go ♫ 

168
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,952
 ♫ I will stop whenever you stop ♫ 

169
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:09,525
 ♫ Even far away from home ♫ 

170
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:12,529
- The most beautiful.
- Beautiful.

171
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,289
So beautiful, Meng.

172
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,409
- Look how gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

173
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,609
Dear family, friends, and neighbors.

174
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:29,689
Welcome to Mr. Li Jin Yu
and Ms. Ye Meng's wedding.

175
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:35,809
I'm today's bridesmaid and part-time emcee.

176
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:40,529
Of course, I'm also the first witness
to their love story.

177
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:44,729
Do you know when I realized
the groom had fallen for the bride?

178
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,849
- When?
- When?

179
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:51,069
After my stunning singing debut at Jubaoshi.

180
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:54,029
Ye Meng wasn't in Ningsui that day.

181
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,269
My brother sat in the yard reading
but didn't turn a page all afternoon.

182
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,189
- Right, Grandma?
- Yes, he zoned out.

183
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:03,309
He couldn't focus at all. He sat alone all day.

184
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,729
I asked him, "What's on your mind?"

185
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:08,409
Ye Meng, do you know what he said?

186
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,109
Speak honestly.

187
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:15,529
He said he had a memory palace
and wanted to put you inside it.

188
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:19,309
So he could see you whenever he closed his eyes.

189
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:21,689
Qiao Mai Mai, I didn't say it like that.

190
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,909
But that's the general idea.

191
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:25,769
Didn't you?

192
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,949
- He just said he missed you.
- That part's true.

193
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,649
Ye Meng, what I really mean is

194
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,889
that vows are just words,
but outsiders see clearly.

195
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,809
My brother truly loves you
and will treat you well.

196
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,729
Right, groom? Your turn to speak.

197
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:47,109
Give us your heartfelt speech
and confess to the bride. Come on.

198
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:48,909
Speak! Speak!

199
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,729
Say something, Li Jin Yu.

200
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:56,449
I've already said so much.

201
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,229
But today,

202
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:03,449
I want to thank you for your patience.

203
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,209
You once told me,

204
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:10,409
"The world means you no harm."

205
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,869
I never believed that before.

206
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,649
Now, I'm trying to believe it,

207
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:22,109
trying to feel this world anew

208
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:26,009
because I've found my moon.

209
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:30,144
Ye Meng,

210
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:35,989
meeting you is the greatest luck of my life.

211
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,129
I may not have been the best partner before.

212
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:48,009
But from now on, I'll strive to be a good husband.

213
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:51,249
Good! Qualified!

214
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,409
- Good!
- Nice!

215
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,609
- Bravo!
- Nice!

216
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,329
I believe my brother will be an excellent husband.

217
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:02,829
Bride, any words for the groom?

218
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,489
When I first met Li Jin Yu,

219
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:16,809
I thought, "How can someone
be so perfectly my type?"

220
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,409
I raised him well!

221
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:21,109
- You're so smitten!
- Good job, Grandma!

222
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,609
I truly feel fortunate.

223
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,309
After quitting my job, I met my crush.

224
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,369
- What crush?
- But deep down, I've always known

225
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:35,189
- It means someone you like.
- I'm incredibly lucky.

226
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,569
Because I have so many who love me.

227
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,376
Today, there's one more person who loves me.

228
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,269
Li Jin Yu,

229
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:53,889
from now on, my family will be your family,
and my friends will be your friends.

230
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:59,329
And I'll share all the love
and luck I receive with you.

231
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:06,816
- Good.
- Great!

232
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:14,269
Now, I should hand over the microphone
to Mrs. Tou Ju Hua.

233
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,349
She's been itching
to snatch the microphone from me.

234
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,569
- Come on, Grandma.
- Mrs. Tou.

235
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:21,349
- Take the stage!
- Mrs. Tou!

236
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:26,489
I was worried I'd get too excited
and forget what I wanted to say,

237
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:29,869
so I prepared a little notebook last night.

238
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,849
Meng, the first time I saw you,

239
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:39,769
I knew at first glance
you'd be my granddaughter-in-law.

240
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,309
Good.

241
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:44,544
This is fate, isn't it?

242
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:45,909
Right.

243
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:49,569
Exactly. You couldn't escape.
I liked you instantly.

244
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:52,849
You're so beautiful, truly stunning.

245
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:56,909
I don't even want to blink.
I could stare at you forever.

246
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:57,949
So gorgeous.

247
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:59,909
That's it.

248
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:04,729
Let me tell you, Ba Dou has some quirks.

249
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:10,649
He's timid, worries too much,
and keeps things bottled up.

250
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,189
But today, I see my dear grandson

251
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:16,809
has become a real responsible man, right?

252
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:18,029
- Right.
- Yes.

253
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:19,909
- Right.
- Yes.

254
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,689
We should thank Meng for this.

255
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:29,409
Thank you for being so understanding
and accepting of him.

256
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:33,849
Now, you two should live happily together
from now on.

257
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,729
If Ba Dou misbehaves, just tell me.

258
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,269
- Deal.
- Exactly.

259
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:43,449
Ba Dou, learn from me. Be fearless and outspoken.

260
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:45,269
Alright, I've talked enough.

261
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,649
Come on, Mei Lan, you say something.

262
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,689
Look at you crying. Was my speech too good?
You're overwhelmed.

263
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,309
Go ahead, say a few words.

264
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,649
No, I shouldn't.

265
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:58,529
Don't cry. This is a joyous occasion.

266
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:02,209
- Let me speak on behalf of my family.
- Go ahead.

267
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:09,349
Actually, I just have one sentence.

268
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:13,909
Live well together,
and may your love last forever.

269
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:18,029
Jin Yu, she's my only daughter.

270
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,229
I've cherished her like a treasure
since she was born.

271
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,889
If you treat her badly, I won't let you off easy.

272
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,649
- Exactly.
- None of us will.

273
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:26,769
And me too!

274
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,269
Don't worry, Dad.

275
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,909
I believe my brother will do great. Right?

276
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:32,569
- Right.
- Yes.

277
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:38,729
Now, we'll move
to the most sacred and romantic vow exchange.

278
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:44,529
First, the most adorable kid in the universe,
Chen Jia Yu,

279
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:47,789
will deliver the rings for our newlyweds.

280
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,069
- Good.
- Good.

281
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,649
- Good.
- Good.

282
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:58,229
Groom, do you take Ms. Ye Meng to be your wife?

283
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:02,409
From this day forward, for better or for worse,

284
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:06,449
for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health,

285
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:13,152
will you love and cherish her
until death parts you?

286
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:14,989
Yes, I do.

287
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:16,349
- Good.
- Good.

288
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:21,989
Bride, do you take Li Jin Yu to be your husband?

289
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:26,029
From this day forward, for better or for worse,

290
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:29,649
for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health,

291
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:34,989
will you love and cherish him
until death parts you?

292
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:36,889
- Yes, I do.
- Speak louder.

293
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,189
I do!

294
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,769
Now, please exchange rings.

295
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:48,032
 ♫ Even if all memories fade ♫ 

296
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:53,824
 ♫ I can't erase your figure in my mind ♫ 

297
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:58,304
 ♫ Every time I look at you, I want to get closer ♫

00:17:58,304 --> 00:18:01,088
 ♫ I'm unconsciously addicted ♫

300

 ♫ How could I bear to forget ♫ 

301
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,809
 ♫ If you understand my feelings ♫ 

302
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:14,349
You may now kiss your bride.

303
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:16,889
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

304
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:18,189
Kiss!

305
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:20,609
Kiss!

306
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:22,849
Kiss!

307
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,749
Kiss!

308
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:09,408
 ♫ Every time I look at you, I want to get closer.
I'm unconsciously addicted ♫ 

309
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:16,096

How could I bear to forget ♫ 

310

314
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:39,072
Great.

315
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,032
Good. Let's take another photo.

316
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:52,409
We're married!

317
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,209
Wait, wait. Hold on.

318
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:57,069
Okay, how's this? Good?

319
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:59,269
Looking beautiful? Yes? Okay.

320
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:02,609
Any thoughts on Ye Meng's wedding day?

321
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,529
It feels like sending off
my own daughter. So happy.

322
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,029
There's definitely some sadness.

323
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:13,349
Of course we're happy.

324
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,529
After all, she's our only daughter.

325
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,029
I want to remind Meng
women should be financially independent

326
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:20,769
and always keep control of their finances.

327
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:25,709
I thought today would be pure joy,
but there's some bittersweetness.

328
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:29,149
Are you thinking of Fang Ya En?

329
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:36,909
Everything feels so sweet.

330
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:41,229
Wishing her happiness and fulfillment.

331
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:45,489
May you two grow old together,
enjoying carefree happiness every day.

332
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:47,909
My brother has always been a good man.

333
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:50,769
We're at ease now.

334
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:56,409
My advice is to give each other space.

335
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,349
And have lots of babies. Several.

336
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:00,569
I'll help take care of them. I will help.

337
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:05,069
I want to say to Fang Ya En,

338
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:06,989
please reconsider carefully.

339
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:10,649
But I still feel some emotional weight.

340
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:16,489
I think being friends might be better.
But who knows about the future?

341
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:19,949
I haven't said anything.

342
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:24,729
Thank you, Kai. I feel like I've had so much fun
with you every day.

343
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:28,649
Right. When I heard Grandma's words today,

344
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:31,689
I suddenly realized
I shouldn't have any regrets in my life.

345
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,269
I want to be courageous.

346
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:38,769
So I've decided to reapply for college
and pursue music again.

347
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,704
Still doing rock music?

348
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,712
Not necessarily.

349
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,709
Don't be sad, Gou.

350
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,208
You still have me.

351
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,889
Honey.

352
00:21:57,889 --> 00:21:59,069
What's wrong?

353
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:03,189
When will you fix the bathroom door?
It's really inconvenient.

354
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,909
I'll fix it tomorrow. I forgot about it.

355
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,649
Promise?

356
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:07,889
What are you looking at?

357
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:10,309
Looking at photos.

358
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,109
My wife is so beautiful.

359
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,904
You just realized that now?

360
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:19,809
You're blushing.

361
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:24,889
No. It's just the red bedsheet's reflection.

362
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:28,069
I didn't expect someone
as shameless as you could still blush.

363
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:31,109
When was I ever shameless? What do you mean?

364
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,109
My husband is so handsome.

365
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,709
Here's something for you.

366
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:44,909
- What is this?
- Open it.

367
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:55,449
The puzzle piece I hid.

368
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,609
Why?

369
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:02,689
I used to feel like a puzzle
missing its final piece.

370
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:05,649
I wasn't complete

371
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,288
until I met you.

372
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:19,849
Really?

373
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:23,229
So you never had feelings for anyone else before?

374
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:26,569
Not even during puberty?
No curiosity about other girls?

375
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:34,809
Maybe sometimes.

376
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:39,609
But real feelings? Never.

377
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:42,409
Truly?

378
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,569
You never thought about chasing other girls

379
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:47,409
or making someone else your girlfriend?

380
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,269
Like what we have now?

381
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:52,849
I swear, you've been my only one.

382
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,649
You're getting smoother with words.

383
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,504
Not really.

384
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:08,209
Actually, after you asked for my WeChat
at the beach, I dreamt about you.

385
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,729
I know.

386
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:14,109
You know?

387
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:16,249
How could you possibly know?

388
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,529
Why couldn't I?

389
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:23,309
Remember the camera on Ping An?

390
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,529
It was lost, and you didn't believe me then.

391
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,649
I found it.

392
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:33,289
I heard everything you said to me
that New Year's Eve.

393
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,529
You heard all of it?

394
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:47,409
Li Jin Yu,

395
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:50,809
if you'd sent me that message back then,

396
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:54,029
we wouldn't have gone through
all these twists and turns.

397
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:59,689
Good thing I didn't lose you in the end.

398
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,849
What are you doing?

399
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:07,449
Someone used to say I wasn't proactive enough.

400
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:11,209
Now that I'm a husband, I should level up.

401
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:37,209
We're here. Jia Yu, wake up.

402
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,449
He's out cold. I can't wake him.

403
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:42,272
No problem. I'll do it.

404
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:48,909
You're home.

405
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:50,752
Easy to carry?

406
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:16,449
Thanks for today, Kai.

407
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,989
I can't believe
you carried his heavy self upstairs.

408
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:23,029
No worries. He's lighter than my dumbbells.

409
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,169
Though he'll get heavier with time.

410
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,529
I'll handle physical tasks like this from now on.

411
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,989
Please. I wouldn't trouble you.

412
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:35,389
Now that you're a big boss
handling the Hailan Bay project

413
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:38,309
and constantly busy,
I shouldn't add to your plate.

414
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:42,409
You're no trouble.
Nothing's more important than you and Jia Yu.

415
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:49,229
Being a big boss really boosts your EQ.

416
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:54,709
Fine. Go play with your bro Jia Yu.
I won't stop you.

417
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:06,409
Fang Ya En, how long will you keep pretending?

418
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,309
What? Who's pretending?

419
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:09,989
Calling me my by full name?
Forgetting your manners?

420
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:11,269
Just leave. Go home.

421
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:14,869
Attending Ye Meng's wedding
really messed with your head.

422
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,669
I'm serious.

423
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:21,949
I couldn't say it before
with your divorce pending.

424
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:23,072
Then don't say it.

425
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:25,069
I need to.

426
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:28,809
Fang Ya En, I like you.

427
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:32,029
I don't want
to just be your 'little brother' forever.

428
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:36,309
I know you're in a difficult situation now,

429
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:40,109
and you've always scolded or hit me
since childhood,

430
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:42,029
but I don't know... I just...

431
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,869
I can't control these feelings for you.

432
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:47,549
When I think about you saving my life...

433
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,529
What life-saving?

434
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:57,489
Senior year. In the school alley,
you saved a kid from being beaten to death.

435
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,909
That was me.

436
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:03,609
I didn't take it seriously before,

437
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:06,809
but after learning it was you,

438
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:10,709
I started paying real attention to you.

439
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:14,529
Kai, we're not compatible.

440
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:17,529
W-W-What's incompatible?

441
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,109
The peaceful life you want now,
the mundane daily life.

442
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:23,989
That's exactly the life I want to share with you.

443
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:29,029
I'm not ambitious. I just want to stay in Ningsui
for the rest of my life.

444
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:35,309
After morning workouts, we'll buy groceries
at the market and cook at home.

445
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:40,029
In the evenings after dinner,
we'll take walks by the sea to digest.

446
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:44,489
When Jia Yu grows older,
we'll go on road trips by ourselves.

447
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:48,769
Kai, I'm...

448
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,289
I know what you're going to say.

449
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:57,989
You just got divorced
and don't want new commitments.

450
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:04,029
But it's okay. I'll wait.
I'll always wait for you.

451
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,289
I really like you so much.

452
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:13,249
Don't reject me so quickly.

453
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:15,869
Please think carefully about what I've said.

454
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:20,789
I'll take my leave now.

455
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:52,192
 ♫ Go, where to go ♫ 

456
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:56,269
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

457
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:00,449
 You're no trouble.
Nothing's more important than you and Jia Yu. 

458
00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:04,029
 I couldn't say it before
with your divorce pending. Afraid to bother you. 

459
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:06,689
 - Then don't say it.
- I need to. 

460
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:10,789
 Fang Ya En, I like you. 

461
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:14,784
 I'm not ambitious. 

462
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,209
 I just want to stay in Ningsui
for the rest of my life. 

463
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:23,909
 After morning workouts,
we'll buy groceries and cook at home. 

464
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:28,649
 In the evenings after dinner,
we'll take walks by the sea to digest. 

465
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,029
 When Jia Yu grows older,
we'll go on road trips by ourselves. 

466
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:44,949
 Don't reject me so quickly.
Please think carefully about what I've said. 

467
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:50,249
 I'll wait. I'll always wait for you. 

468
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:04,109
Easy does it.

469
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:08,909
Others may think I'm moving
instead of checking into a hospital.

470
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:14,769
Better to have extra than not enough.
We don't want to go back for things later.

471
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:20,189
Fine, fine. My opinion doesn't matter anyway.
We'll do it your way.

472
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:22,209
Here, put on these slippers.

473
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:24,649
I've packed all your things neatly.

474
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,689
I've put the snacks in the cupboard.

475
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:31,689
- And about the other--
- Enough, enough.

476
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,989
I know hospitals better than you do.

477
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:36,309
Aren't you and Meng busy?

478
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:42,069
You two should get back to work.
Seeing you annoys me.

479
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:45,109
Do you dislike me already,
right after the wedding?

480
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:47,409
Don't you know
absence makes the heart grow fonder?

481
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:52,349
You'd get sick of looking at even a flower
every day. Though you're prettier than any flower.

482
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:55,149
Alright, let's go.

483
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,672
Hello?

484
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:04,069
 There's an emergency at Hailan Bay.
Come to the company, Jin Yu. Hurry up. 

485
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:06,789
 Listen, everyone here is demanding money. 

486
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:09,824
 Hurry up. 

487
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:13,889
We need to handle company business. We gotta go.

488
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:15,449
We're leaving now, Grandma.

489
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:17,280
- Mai, I left the food there.
- Okay.

490
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,569
- We're leaving.
- Bye.

491
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:22,029
Eat first.

492
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:23,904
Then keep playing.

493
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,949
Give us answers, you unscrupulous merchants!

494
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:29,869
Hurry up and explain!

495
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,829
Everyone, calm down.
We've reported this to the company.

496
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:34,909
Please stay calm and stop arguing.

497
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:38,349
Listen, everyone,
Hailan Bay has had issues before.

498
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:40,029
They engaged in fraudulent financing.

499
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:42,609
Now they're swapping construction materials.

500
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:44,729
We demand answers today!

501
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,009
- Exactly!
- Give us answers!

502
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,809
We need answers today!

503
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:52,689
I think you obtained these projects
through illegal means!

504
00:32:52,689 --> 00:32:54,729
You're deliberately scamming us ordinary people!

505
00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:57,689
No construction until you give us answers!

506
00:32:57,689 --> 00:32:59,029
Right, stop all work!

507
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:02,688
- Everyone, calm down.
- Stay calm!

508
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:04,809
- Kai, what's going on?
- What happened?

509
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:07,729
A wall collapsed at the construction site
this morning. A worker's leg was crushed.

510
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:10,189
Someone dug up Hailan Bay's past issues again.

511
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:13,029
People are furious and demanding explanations.

512
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:15,989
They're here. Their boss is here.

513
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:20,069
Stay put. Everyone, remain calm.

514
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:23,789
- Speak one at a time.
- Easy. Stay calm.

515
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:29,920
Ningsui police. We received a report.

516
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,504
Hailan Bay is suspected of using illegal materials
resulting in casualties.

517
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:35,909
We need you to cooperate with our investigation.
Come with us.

518
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:37,849
- No problem.
- Wait, Chen.

519
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,889
The investigation isn't complete.
You can't take him.

520
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:44,729
- What? Want to come with us?
- Kai.

521
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:49,149
Officer Chen, we didn't use illegal materials.
There must be a misunderstanding.

522
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:53,229
If they're innocent, nothing will happen to them.

523
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:55,609
Don't worry.

524
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:59,149
Just routine questioning.
I'll be back soon. Don't worry.

525
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:00,409
But...

526
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:03,349
Take care of yourself and Grandma.

527
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:05,184
Let's go.

528
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:11,409
Mr. Li was taken away. What do we do now?

529
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:14,109
Alright, the police
have now taken over the investigation.

530
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:15,309
Everyone, disperse.

531
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:17,689
Findings will be announced publicly.

532
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,089
Go home, everyone.

533
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:22,689
- We'll wait for updates.
- Yes, yes.

534
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:26,889
- We demand answers!
- Don't exploit us ordinary folks!

535
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,969
They will stand up for us.

536
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,989
- Trust them.
- They won't escape justice.

537
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,389
- Back to work. Nothing to see.
- Okay.

538
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,189
Understood, Ms. Ye.

539
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,189
How's the worker?

540
00:34:40,189 --> 00:34:41,889
He's fine now. Don't worry.

541
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:45,309
This is suspicious.
We'd never use illegal materials.

542
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:48,909
All construction plans
and designs were approved by every department.

543
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,649
Now, public opinion has turned against us
because of this accident.

544
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:56,689
So you mean someone's sabotaging us?

545
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:58,496
That's a possibility.

546
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:06,529
- Hello?
-  Did you see the news? 

547
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,409
 Li Ling Bai is holding
a press conference tomorrow. 

548
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:10,272
What?

549
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,069
What's wrong?

550
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,609
Li Ling Bai is holding a press conference.

551
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:16,229
We need to investigate everything
before the conference starts.

552
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:18,688
- Let's go to the construction site. Come on.
- Let's go.

553
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,432
 

554
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:31,529
The materials definitely don't match
the contract specifications.

555
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,309
Did anyone swap the materials?

556
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:34,349
Most likely.

557
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,889
 
When did you last come here?

558
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:39,489
I'll check the surveillance footage for this area.

559
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:43,689
Zhou Yu.

560
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:45,536
Zhou Yu?

561
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,409
Stop! Stop right there!

562
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:50,304
Zhou Yu.

563
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:53,609
What are you doing here?

564
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,229
I'm telling you.

565
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:57,888
I've got evidence of your material swap scheme!

566
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,409
- What evidence?
- What evidence? Still talking tough?

567
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,949
What evidence? Look!

568
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,229
- This...
- See clearly now?

569
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:14,809
Accuse the other side
of that which you are guilty.

570
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,569
Are there any decent people in Hanhai Group?

571
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:19,989
You're all in cahoots with Wang Xing Sheng!
Liars! Scoundrels!

572
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:22,149
- Get lost!
- Who are you calling names?

573
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,869
You go back. I'll talk to him.

574
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:27,769
Stop!

575
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,189
I want all the recent surveillance footage
from Hailan Bay, Ming Xiao.

576
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,096
Everything.

577
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:34,752
Let's go.

578
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:54,112
- Grandma.
-  Meng. 

579
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:58,649
Why isn't Ba Dou answering the phone?
Did anything happen?

580
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,729
You can't reach him?
He's probably swamped with overtime work.

581
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:04,309
 As long as he's okay. 

582
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:06,880
What's wrong with this company?

583
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,109
No time to answer a call? Always working overtime.

584
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:13,769
But you two must eat properly.

585
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:18,109
Don't worry. Rest early.
We'll visit when things settle down.

586
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:24,189
No need to accompany me.
He should spend time with you. You're newlyweds.

587
00:37:24,189 --> 00:37:26,789
 I'll give him a good scolding when I see him. 

588
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:31,309
Alright, go to bed early.

589
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:34,689
Okay, hanging up now. Be good.

590
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:42,029
Well? She didn't notice anything?

591
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:46,909
Not yet, but she will if we delay longer.

592
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:49,849
You've been watching long enough. Take a break.

593
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:51,849
Maybe we should consider other approaches.

594
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,789
This isn't making progress.

595
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,409
Look at this video.

596
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:13,229
This was recorded when accompanying Lin Yang Yang
to the construction site.

597
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:15,409
The materials here comply with regulations.

598
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:18,269
Completely different from the current ones.

599
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:19,909
And this.

600
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:22,109
Look here.

601
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:25,109
This section of footage has been altered.

602
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:26,529
Exactly.

603
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:29,489
Now it's up to Cheng Kai Ran to catch Zhou Yu.

604
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:33,949
- Well? Did you catch him?
- I got him.

605
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:35,309
And then?

606
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:40,409
Zhou Yu refuses to help clear Li Jin Yu's name.

607
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:44,829
He's hated Hailan Bay since childhood.
He wishes it would collapse.

608
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:48,989
But without Zhou Yu,
this video evidence is useless.

609
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:00,349
Zhou Yu, play here!

610
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:02,649
Zhou Yu.

611
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:04,809
- Zhou Yu.
- Oh no.

612
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,809
Stay here. Come back. Come here.

613
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,789
- Stay put.
- Move aside.

614
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:13,309
Stop running. You never outrun me.

615
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,029
You'll fall again if you keep this up.

616
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:19,029
Why are you back? I've told you countless times

617
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:20,809
I don't help people escape guilt.

618
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:25,109
I've told you repeatedly Li Jin Yu
had nothing to do with the material swap!

619
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:26,649
This wasn't us.

620
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:30,529
By staying silent,
you're aiding the real culprits. Understand?

621
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:36,989
Zhou Yu, I'm here for Li Jin Yu,
but I'm not asking you to fabricate evidence.

622
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:39,569
Just state the facts you witnessed.

623
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:42,689
People will judge the truth themselves.

624
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:51,809
The children here at the orphanage adore you.

625
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,769
They see you as their role model.

626
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,189
But if you stay silent now,

627
00:39:56,189 --> 00:40:00,449
you might protect a criminal
and frame an innocent person.

628
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:05,689
That's not the outcome you want, is it?

629
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,889
Think about it again.

630
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:14,809
The conference is starting.

631
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,229
Go.

632
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:18,109
Think carefully.

633
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:32,736
 

634
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:37,612
 

635
00:40:37,612 --> 00:40:41,509
 

636
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:45,509
Coming!

637
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,349
 

638
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:51,189
Yang Yang,
sorry about this embarrassing situation.

639
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:53,409
Hurry! Give us an explanation!

640
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:57,069
Later, we'll need your cooperation
for a joint statement.

641
00:40:57,069 --> 00:41:01,209
No problem. I just want to help Jin Yu.

642
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,429
Ms. Li.

643
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,689
Yang Bing Zhang is on the way.

644
00:41:06,689 --> 00:41:08,029
What about Wang Xing Sheng?

645
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:10,869
Quiet. Being watched, he can't make trouble.

646
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,736
Lawless scum.

647
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:17,089
Wait! You can't leave.

648
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:21,056
 

649
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:32,992
 

650
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:39,689
 

651
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:42,449
Hello, everyone, I'm Li Ling Bai.

652
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:45,529
Tomorrow is Hailan Bay's opening ceremony.

653
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:49,229
I never imagined meeting you
under these circumstances.

654
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:52,729
 
Regarding the Hailan Bay Phase II collapse,

655
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:55,109
as Hanhai Group's chairwoman,

656
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:59,869
I first offer my sincere apologies.

657
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,909
 The project leader was my eldest son, Li Jin Yu. 

658
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:14,189
 Our group will take full responsibility. 

659
00:42:14,189 --> 00:42:17,729
 I will deal with Li Jin Yu seriously. 

660
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:22,589
Ba Dou works in Li Ling Bai's company.

661
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:57,317
 ♫ You ♫ 

662
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:59,493
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

663
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:02,708
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

664
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:09,509
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

665
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:15,429
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

666
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:19,589
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

667
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:22,053
 ♫ Go ♫ 

668
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:24,069
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

669
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:28,197
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

670
00:43:28,197 --> 00:43:34,181
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

671
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:38,149
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

672
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:44,165
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

673
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:48,485
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

674
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:52,069
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

675
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:58,149
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

676
00:43:58,149 --> 00:44:02,910
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

677
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:08,157
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

678
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:12,994
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

679
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:15,950
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

680
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,117
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

681
00:44:18,117 --> 00:44:22,917
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

682
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:25,376
 ♫ But why ♫ 

683
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:28,581
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

684
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:33,634
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
