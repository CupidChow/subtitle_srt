1
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:11,894
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:15,508
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:17,293
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:20,822
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:25,974
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:31,222
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:34,710
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,174
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:42,806
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:49,078
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:53,814
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:55,894
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,894 --> 00:01:01,078
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,094
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:06,062
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:07,958
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,286
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:13,341
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,318
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:20,333
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:30,838
 

22
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:33,558
Come in. Wait, let me turn on the lights.

23
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,358
Yeah, the lights.

24
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:42,598
Come in. Ju Hua, come help.

25
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:46,938
Okay, coming. Let me help you.

26
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:55,558
What now?

27
00:01:55,558 --> 00:02:00,378
I told our grandmas
that I got a new job at Hailan Bay,

28
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:03,318
which is a bit confidential.

29
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:09,218
You don't want them to know we fought, right?

30
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:15,058
Here we go. The soup's ready.

31
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,058
Hurry up.

32
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:21,638
Sit there. Go on. Sit and wait.

33
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:26,098
Come on. Here.

34
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:29,098
Come on. Sit there.

35
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:34,218
Meng. Take a seat.

36
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:40,318
Here. Meng, have some soup.

37
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:47,758
Meng, you've already lost weight
since you went to work in Jiangbei.

38
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:50,218
Look at your face. So pale.

39
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:52,098
There's no such thing.

40
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:55,558
That's just the foundation.
She's light-colored in the first place.

41
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:59,598
Jin Yu, have some soup.

42
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:01,398
Thank you, Granny.

43
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:08,638
Meng's aunt made this specifically for you.
It's nourishing. Have it all.

44
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:10,478
Yeah, have it all.

45
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:17,098
Grannies, I just had a big dinner.
I can't finish this now.

46
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,978
I have work to do. I'll drink it after I'm done.

47
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:22,478
Work can wait. It's after hours now.

48
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:28,378
How dare that nasty boss of yours
make you work overtime?

49
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,718
What's more important? Health or work?

50
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:35,018
- Family comes first.
- Yeah, that's right.

51
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:38,218
I'll give your boss a good talking-to later.

52
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,318
- Yeah.
- Feel free to just quit.

53
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:43,138
- Yeah.
- Grandma's absolutely right.

54
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:44,638
- Yeah.
- Teach him a lesson.

55
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:45,818
He's such a jerk.

56
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:51,398
What a jerk. Have some soup, Meng.

57
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:56,718
Have it. Good girl.

58
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:57,838
Have some more.

59
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,518
No, thanks.

60
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:03,278
Are you staying more?
Would you like to rest early?

61
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:06,098
- We're staying.
- We're staying.

62
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:08,638
- Let's play mahjong.
- Yeah, mahjong.

63
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,878
- Have more.
- Set up the table.

64
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,418
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

65
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,778
- Over there.
- Bring it here.

66
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:21,878
Want more soup?

67
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,678
No, thanks.

68
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:29,518
Should we go in?

69
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,318
Wait a bit more.

70
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:34,478
Sure.

71
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,418
What exactly did Granny Ye tell you?

72
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:39,418
S-She told me to wait for the signal.

73
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,218
Is it so difficult? What signal?

74
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:45,258
She didn't say. She just told me to wait.
Maybe she'll call.

75
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:46,718
Did she mention a time?

76
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,758
No. I don't know anything.

77
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:51,138
Useless.

78
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:53,218
Let's go eavesdrop.

79
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:54,218
You go?

80
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:55,218
You go.

81
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:56,838
I can't. I might get caught.

82
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,478
- Hug.
- Come here.

83
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:11,218
I'm the dealer. Three. Yours.

84
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,598
Granny, I really need to work.

85
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:17,058
We've played eight rounds already.
Let's stop here today, okay?

86
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:18,418
- Two more rounds.
- Two more rounds.

87
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,978
Only two.

88
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:25,098
By the way, since we're all here tonight,

89
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,638
let's discuss the wedding plans.

90
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:29,718
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:35,978
Since you both work at Hailan Bay,
take advantage of your positions.

92
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:38,778
- Yeah.
- Any thoughts about your marital home?

93
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,098
We're not in a rush.

94
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:45,558
How come you're not in a rush, Meng?

95
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:51,918
Rest assured. I've saved up for Ba Dou.
We'll sell the garden if needed.

96
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,258
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:56,978
There's no time to waste.
Let's house-hunt tomorrow.

98
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,758
Yeah, first thing.

99
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:02,598
Grannies, I'm getting sleepy.
I'd like to go to bed.

100
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:04,718
Rest early, okay?

101
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:07,558
Alright, I'll call your aunt and Mai.

102
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:08,978
- Call Mai.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:09,978
I'll call them.

104
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,338
They live far. Don't bother them.

105
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,678
It's fine.

106
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:14,678
Mom.

107
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,018
Grandma.

108
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:21,418
Call me earlier next time. I have things to do.

109
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:22,418
Why are you here?

110
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,218
Why are you here?

111
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:31,058
Y-You called me to come play mahjong.

112
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,358
She hasn't called yet.

113
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:36,758
Just passing by?

114
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:37,758
Just passing by.

115
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:38,798
Yeah.

116
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,558
I'm just passing by, too. What a coincidence.

117
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:43,838
Stop standing there. Hurry up.

118
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:44,838
- Come on.
- Hurry.

119
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,598
- Come on.
- Have fun. We're going to bed.

120
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:48,758
Time to sleep.

121
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,598
- Sleep tight with your wife.
- Go on.

122
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:52,398
Hold her tight.

123
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,978
You idiot. You almost blew our cover.

124
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:03,138
It's freezing outside. We may catch a cold.

125
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:04,298
Freeze out there.

126
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,638
None of that matters.
The key is to finalize the wedding plans tonight.

127
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:11,838
No one leaves until we settle this.

128
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:12,838
Okay.

129
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:14,638
We got this.

130
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:31,598
Honey, why don't you leave the work for tomorrow?

131
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,718
You're exhausted. Get some rest.

132
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:38,598
The work won't finish itself.
Are you so eager to kick me out?

133
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:51,138
Li Jin Yu, why did you
get our grandmas to put on this show?

134
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,378
I didn't. They...

135
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:56,178
Be serious.

136
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,138
They noticed you've been overworked.

137
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:06,338
So they wanted to check on you
and bring you chicken soup.

138
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,298
What an actor.

139
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:15,218
Honey. I didn't ask them... to come here.

140
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:24,278
Mei Lan. Your turn.

141
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:34,278
Nine of Bamboos.

142
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,598
I can't keep playing.

143
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:45,918
Mai, find me some heart attack medicine. Hurry.

144
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,678
Granny, I can't keep up either.

145
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:50,718
Auntie, come on.

146
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:54,938
Get me some coffee.

147
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,178
Pong!

148
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:18,838
Three of Bamboos.

149
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:20,058
Three of Bamboos.

150
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:23,218
It's my turn.

151
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:26,718
Four of Characters. I don't need it.

152
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:32,598
What?

153
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,378
No need. I got this.

154
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,178
I'll do it.

155
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:44,398
Be careful with your head.

156
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:24,878
What are you doing?

157
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,058
I'm going to sleep.

158
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:29,978
Then sleep. Get your hands off me.

159
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:31,738
Li Jin Yu.

160
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:32,738
No, I won't.

161
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:35,798
How did you become so shameless?

162
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:37,918
I just won't.

163
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,718
So annoying.

164
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,978
Ye Meng.

165
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:26,018
Ye Meng.

166
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:30,018
Ye Meng, our project's promotional video

167
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:34,618
has a malicious comment about formaldehyde,
which is rising in rankings.

168
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,878
Mr. Li, the revisions are done.

169
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:01,918
Please sign if there are no issues.

170
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:09,109
 

171
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,418
- Li, I checked it.
- Mr. Li.

172
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,598
Some data isn't clear enough.

173
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:18,678
Okay, let me revise it. Just a minute.

174
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:21,598
Mr. Li, I need to brief you on something.

175
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:23,398
Okay.

176
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:44,598
In Phase Three,
I'll analyze data from previous phases

177
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:47,638
to adjust our marketing strategy
to form replicable models.

178
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,438
Please take a look.

179
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,832
 

180
00:14:57,978 --> 00:15:00,858
We have a problem. Check the official account.

181
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,098
 

182
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,880
Formaldehyde levels exceeded?

183
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,858
You're in charge of the project.
Shouldn't you give us an explanation?

184
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:14,418
The official account
is now filled with malicious comments.

185
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,678
If it goes on like this,

186
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:20,338
Hailan Bay will be associated
with formaldehyde overexposure.

187
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:22,758
This would be a major crisis for the project.

188
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,838
Your team managed
all the accounts during this period.

189
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,898
Theoretically, you bear the primary liability.

190
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:36,018
Mr. Li wanted impressive metrics
without overspending, right?

191
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,558
Here's my proposal.

192
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:40,218
 

193
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:44,978
The Ningsui Environmental Regulatory Department
reposted our video and validated our claims.

194
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:49,558
I noticed that malicious comment
the moment I took over this account.

195
00:15:49,558 --> 00:15:53,978
Ye Meng, our project's promotional video
has a malicious comment about formaldehyde,

196
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:56,878
 
which is rising in rankings.

197
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:59,878
Keep an eye on it. Keep me updated.

198
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:01,258
Okay.

199
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:05,978
Since someone is helping us save money,
let's change tactics.

200
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,478
 

201
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:13,058
The public opinion has started to change.

202
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,418
Yeah.

203
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:16,718
It's happening so fast.

204
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:23,258
With the authority's announcement,
the malicious comments must be decreasing.

205
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:24,798
We also boosted traffic.

206
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:28,018
Mr. Li, this is my cost-efficient proposal,

207
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:31,058
which halved your budget.

208
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:36,518
Seems like this position is mine to keep.

209
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:46,218
I concede. You surpass my expectations, Ms. Ye.

210
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:48,018
Thank you.

211
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,278
Done.

212
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:00,218
Not bad.

213
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:02,098
Did you track that IP address?

214
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:03,898
I'll send it to you.

215
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:23,598
Zhou Yu, take a look.
Don't forget what I asked you to do.

216
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:31,478
The malicious comment was sent here?

217
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,558
Isn't that Jiang Lu Zhi? Ye Meng is also here.

218
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,678
Follow Jiang Lu Zhi. I'll follow Ye Meng.

219
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:55,478
Got it.

220
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:18,378
Why are you following me?

221
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:22,318
I... Calm down.

222
00:18:46,478 --> 00:18:48,438
It's fake?

223
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,018
Are you hurt?

224
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:57,878
- Stop it. Isn't he working for you?
- What?

225
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:02,338
Jiang Lu Zhi did this.
You hired her to drive me away, didn't you?

226
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:03,378
You're overthinking it.

227
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,378
I just feel we can't--

228
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,018
Stop making excuses.

229
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:10,598
If you're so afraid of getting exposed,
sign the divorce papers now.

230
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:13,378
No way. Don't even think about it. Ye Meng.

231
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:16,058
Let go, Li Jin Yu.

232
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:18,258
Li Jin Yu!

233
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:22,758
What are you doing? Let go.

234
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:23,758
Are you okay?

235
00:19:23,758 --> 00:19:25,558
I'm fine.

236
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:30,558
Ye Meng's on my team.
You're just a client. Stop being bossy.

237
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:33,298
It's our private business.

238
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,098
There's nothing private.

239
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:39,898
Ye Meng.

240
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:00,518
Ms. Wang.

241
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:03,258
Lu Zhi, long time no see. You're here to...?

242
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:05,098
I'm visiting my mom.

243
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:07,478
Okay. Drop by the school when you're free.

244
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:09,278
Alright, bye.

245
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:17,978
W-What are you doing here?

246
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:21,138
Why don't you tell me what you're doing here?

247
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,138
Jiang Lu Zhi lives here, huh?

248
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,258
What? Lu Zhi, who?

249
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,258
Stop pretending.

250
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:29,878
Were you about to update your buddy?

251
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:33,358
No, I-I just missed him a bit.

252
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:40,098
You're stalking me?
Didn't you say we should keep a distance?

253
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:42,178
Yeah, we kept our distance.

254
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:45,218
I happened to see you passing by
and wanted to say hi.

255
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:47,878
How's that stalking? Seriously.

256
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:52,478
Well... You said hi. I'll be going.

257
00:20:52,478 --> 00:20:55,978
Hold on. Why do you look so nervous?

258
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:59,098
N-Nervous? I'm not.

259
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:02,018
You're clearly nervous. Tell me.

260
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:06,638
Is Li Jin Yu still seeing his ex-girlfriend?
Are you helping him cheat?

261
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,518
N-Nonsense. I don't understand.

262
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:09,798
I'm calling Ye Meng right now.

263
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:14,978
No, no. Jiang Lu Zhi changed her job.

264
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:18,558
I find it suspicious, so I'm looking into it.

265
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,098
Let's see if Ye Meng buys it.

266
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:24,758
Come on, don't. Stop threatening to call her.

267
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:29,018
I'm just following orders.
Don't make this hard for me.

268
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:33,598
Cheng Kai Ran, who do you stand by,
Ye Meng and I or Li Jin Yu?

269
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,718
Of course, I stand by you.

270
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:43,718
But do you remember this alley?

271
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:50,978
Don't change the subject. Listen.

272
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:56,098
Keep me updated
about Li Jin Yu's every move. No secrets.

273
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:59,638
So should I contact you or not?

274
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:04,138
You absolutely should contact me about this.

275
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:08,218
Keep me updated. I'm off.

276
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:13,058
Ya En. Did you really forget about this alley?

277
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:15,638
What nonsense?

278
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:25,978
I'm home. Why are you still following me?

279
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,918
What's your relationship with Li Jin Yu?

280
00:22:27,918 --> 00:22:30,478
I told you already. Client and contractor.

281
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:35,058
Wait. I've known him forever.
He's cold to everyone.

282
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:38,258
I've never seen him like that.

283
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:41,798
Are you hiding something from me?

284
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:44,838
We don't get along. He's a difficult client.

285
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:46,758
I'm not joking. Seriously.

286
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:47,798
Go back to work.

287
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:54,098
Wait, it's still early.
I haven't seen your place. May I come in?

288
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:55,898
No.

289
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:58,138
Sister-in-law.

290
00:22:58,138 --> 00:23:02,418
Mai, here to feed the dogs again?

291
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:04,318
Dogs?

292
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:07,678
Who's this?

293
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,598
My boss.

294
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,018
Nice to meet you. I'm Qiao Mai Mai.

295
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:16,318
This is my sister-in-law,
who's married to my brother.

296
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,418
You're here to see me?

297
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:22,718
Yeah, my brother's at Jubaoshi. Want to join us?

298
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:24,018
Jubaoshi?

299
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:26,818
It's a local bar.

300
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:30,378
I have work to do. Go ahead.

301
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:35,218
Okay. Tell me when you're done. Bye.

302
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:39,718
Stop spacing out. Get going.

303
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,758
Can't I visit your place a bit?

304
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:43,878
Didn't you hear what she said?

305
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:48,718
My husband runs a bar out there.
And you still want to come in?

306
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,418
Ye Meng.

307
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:53,138
What now?

308
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:58,438
You've disappointed me.
How did you become like this?

309
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,858
Unbelievable.

310
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:22,378
Li Jin Yu will come later.

311
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:30,618
I didn't mean to contact you, you know.

312
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:53,678
S-Stop looking at me like that.

313
00:24:53,678 --> 00:24:55,858
It's quite unsettling.

314
00:24:58,138 --> 00:25:00,758
I-I sent you the photos earlier.

315
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:03,638
Check them yourself.

316
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:11,718
Jiang Lu Zhi went back to her parents' place
after meeting that guy.

317
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,178
Nothing else. Don't worry.

318
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:16,598
They spotted you, huh?

319
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:21,098
How could anyone spot me? I'm an expert at hiding.

320
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:24,518
I can follow her again tomorrow morning.

321
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:37,298
Li Jin Yu, are you crazy? Fine.

322
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:42,838
I ran into Fang Ya En
when I was tailing Jiang Lu Zhi.

323
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:46,758
I think Ye Meng sent her to watch me.

324
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:50,678
Stop putting me in a dilemma.
I'm torn between both sides.

325
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:53,058
And this knife...

326
00:25:56,058 --> 00:26:00,718
It's a toy knife? Seriously! You scared me.

327
00:26:00,718 --> 00:26:06,058
Ye Meng was attacked by the guy
who met Jiang Lu Zhi. This is his knife.

328
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:07,518
How's she doing?

329
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:08,718
She's fine.

330
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:14,178
The attacker's name is Zhou Yu.
We hired him as an intern for the project.

331
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:17,398
I suspect he's also behind the malicious comments.

332
00:26:18,258 --> 00:26:21,778
I've already retrieved his personnel file.

333
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:26,938
Look into his background for me.

334
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:02,678
Jin Yu, what are you doing here?

335
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:06,058
To talk business with him.

336
00:27:07,678 --> 00:27:09,478
Mr. Gou.

337
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:11,878
Who are you?

338
00:27:11,878 --> 00:27:16,138
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Cheng Kai Ran, the owner of this bar.

339
00:27:18,418 --> 00:27:20,218
So you're the owner.

340
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:26,838
I've heard so much about you.
That makes me very curious.

341
00:27:26,838 --> 00:27:29,798
About what?

342
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:34,558
Your charm, naturally.
I'm particularly curious why Ye Meng married you.

343
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,258
I want to see what's so special about you

344
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:40,598
that convinced her to marry you.

345
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:48,096
As for charm, that's self-evident.
But marrying Ye Meng...

346
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,258
Kai, you grew up with Ye Meng.

347
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:57,638
Outsiders can't possibly
understand your relationship, right?

348
00:27:57,638 --> 00:28:02,018
Gou Kai, stop being jealous
and approaching a married woman.

349
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:05,018
Look within yourself to see
why you're not appealing to someone.

350
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,598
Yeah, reflect on yourself.

351
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:11,878
Ye Meng's always had high standards.
Ordinary people can't win her over.

352
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:15,798
She doesn't care for flashy types like you.

353
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:22,518
She prefers someone more down-to-earth.
I'm not referring to you.

354
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:27,138
Mr. Cheng, huh?

355
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,298
Yeah.

356
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:31,678
Let's cut to the chase. Ye Meng is not for you.

357
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:38,598
Plus, I heard that you're
getting divorced. Name your price.

358
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:43,478
He even knows about the divorce.

359
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:56,218
Well... you hurt my feelings.
Shall I name my price?

360
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,858
Five million.

361
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:06,438
Pay me and I'll never see Ye Meng again.

362
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,058
How much?

363
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:10,858
Five million.

364
00:29:12,678 --> 00:29:14,598
You've got some nerve.

365
00:29:14,598 --> 00:29:19,098
Shouldn't you offer me an empty check
like they do on TV shows?

366
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:22,138
Stop acting rich here
if you don't have that kind of money.

367
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,798
Considering our brief acquaintance,

368
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,718
I'll give you a discount, two fifty.

369
00:29:27,718 --> 00:29:28,838
What do you mean?

370
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:30,518
I mean 2.5 million, you fool.

371
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:35,258
With all your wealth, you hesitate to pay.
I guess you don't really love her.

372
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:38,558
Li Jin Yu, who do you stand by?

373
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:40,358
True love.

374
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:45,018
Fine. I'll wire you the money.

375
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:47,258
You're actually paying? I was joking.

376
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:48,418
Do I look like I'm joking?

377
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:52,378
Do I seem like someone who needs pocket change?

378
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:56,138
Here's the thing. True love is priceless.

379
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:06,598
Alright, let's see how much your love weighs then.

380
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:29,138
Things are going well at Hailan Bay.

381
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:33,558
Good work. Come to Ningsui for team-building.

382
00:30:35,678 --> 00:30:42,138
Is this guy brain-damaged?
Why would he think Ye Meng and I are a couple?

383
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:44,418
I bet he would seriously pay me.

384
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:48,638
You're also brain-damaged.
Ye Meng's only worth five million?

385
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,018
You didn't even have 500 yuan back then.
Look at you now, all loaded.

386
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,878
Classic nouveau riche mentality.

387
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:59,898
Seriously, how long will you
keep your marriage a secret?

388
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:06,818
Until the project is completed
and Li Ling Bai leaves Ningsui.

389
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,018
You owe me five million.

390
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:20,178
Don't pay if you don't want to. We're buddies.

391
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:30,598
 
You paid for people to post those comments, huh?

392
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:35,098
Do you think your job is a game
to scheme against Ye Meng?

393
00:31:36,098 --> 00:31:38,058
She complained to you?

394
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:42,018
I did what I wanted to do.
Don't set up rules for me.

395
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:49,718
Our deal didn't include
tarnishing the company's reputation.

396
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:54,798
If I catch you playing tricks
to hurt Ye Meng again,

397
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,638
our deal is over.

398
00:32:03,918 --> 00:32:05,718
Jin Yu.

399
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:13,218
Why's she still here?

400
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:16,178
None of your business. Why are you here?

401
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:19,058
Team-building. I came to check on you.

402
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:26,798
You know, Ye Meng's finally
divorcing that small-town husband.

403
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:28,178
Who told you that?

404
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:31,418
Gou Kai. Why else would he suddenly
organize a team-building event

405
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:34,598
and have me prepare a confession setup?

406
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:38,878
Confession? Where?

407
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:44,058
Jiguang Racetrack. Join us. His treat anyway.

408
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:50,818
I have so much to do.
How do I decorate the confession spot?

409
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:20,378
Shouldn't someone be enjoying her luxurious life
instead of pretending to be diligent this late?

410
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:24,718
Don't tell me your secret marriage backfired.

411
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:28,318
I'm working overtime because of you.

412
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:31,638
I don't understand.

413
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:35,518
Check your WeChat.

414
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:44,918
Not even my mom can recognize me like this.
This is how you're going to frame me?

415
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:46,718
Frame you?

416
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:50,978
If I wanted to frame you,
I could have called the police

417
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:55,058
and shown them the photo
when Zhou pulled the knife on me.

418
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:58,818
Zhou Yu attacked you? No way.

419
00:34:00,598 --> 00:34:05,178
I only mentioned "Zhou", not "Zhou Yu".

420
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,678
You set me up.

421
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:12,518
Zhou Yu attacked me.

422
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:17,338
But given your guts, I bet you only had him
post some malicious comments.

423
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:19,178
Nothing else.

424
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:28,758
What's going on?

425
00:34:28,758 --> 00:34:31,318
I'm giving you a chance to apologize.

426
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:39,378
What are you doing? Bottoms up.

427
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:42,358
I'm done. I can't drink anymore.

428
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:50,778
Fine, I'll drink. Consider this my apology, okay?

429
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:58,318
I just don't get it. You've been
against me since third grade.

430
00:35:01,138 --> 00:35:05,518
And you're still pinching your fingers
when you're nervous.

431
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:13,798
You know me well.

432
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:17,378
You know me well, too, don't you?

433
00:35:17,378 --> 00:35:19,558
You think I want to?

434
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:23,558
You always scored lower than me at school,
but you never cared.

435
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:27,798
Teachers and classmates praised me,
but you never cared.

436
00:35:27,798 --> 00:35:31,678
With that pretty face,
you've lived more boldly than anyone.

437
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:39,478
If I truly didn't care,
would I have quit just to save face?

438
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:43,418
You envy me for my "pretty face"?

439
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:47,638
I envy you more for your academic ability.

440
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:52,838
Seriously, Jiang Lu Zhi. Don't you have a life?

441
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:55,058
Why are you always watching me?

442
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:59,018
You're not into Gou Kai.
You're interested in me, right?

443
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:01,678
Are you insane?

444
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:15,338
But to be fair, I only joined Gou Kai's company

445
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:21,298
because I thought you were into him
and wanted to annoy you.

446
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:26,318
See? I knew you cared the most
about me. Stop denying it.

447
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:32,018
But I ended up being the clown.

448
00:36:35,218 --> 00:36:39,778
Have you come around to it?

449
00:36:49,258 --> 00:36:56,598
I still remember
your high school graduation speech.

450
00:36:56,598 --> 00:37:01,178
You sparkled on stage while sharing your dreams.

451
00:37:03,178 --> 00:37:10,218
You said you gave it your all
to study to achieve your dreams

452
00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:12,608
in the big city.

453
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:15,258
Because you wanted to discover yourself,

454
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:18,678
delight yourself, and transcend yourself.

455
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:28,898
So cringe. I've forgotten all about it.
How come you still remember?

456
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:40,098
Jiang Lu Zhi, you should live for yourself.

457
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:55,438
But I still hate you.

458
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:03,018
Same here.

459
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:20,578
I'm off.

460
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,978
A headhunter is offering me

461
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:26,278
better pay than what I'm getting now.

462
00:38:26,278 --> 00:38:29,678
I don't have to work for you two lovebirds.

463
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:38,298
By the way, Li Jin Yu brought me back

464
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:41,792
because I threatened to expose your marriage.

465
00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:44,378
He wanted to protect you.

466
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:45,918
But tell him not to worry.

467
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:49,978
I'll keep my word even if I quit now.

468
00:38:49,978 --> 00:38:51,938
Your secret's safe.

469
00:38:58,098 --> 00:39:04,318
Ye Meng, be happy.

470
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:41,678
Feel free to roam around.
Come with me if you want free food and drinks.

471
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,678
Or you can just chill over there.

472
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,558
Okay? It's Mr. Gou's treat.

473
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:47,558
- Alright.
- Let's go.

474
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:53,098
This is one of our future projects.
Let me show you around.

475
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:54,418
No need.

476
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:59,178
You'll work on the racetrack proposal.
Inspect it as the person in charge.

477
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,098
What brings you here?

478
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:32,978
Tai Ming Xiao invited me.
I haven't driven in ages. Want to race?

479
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:36,838
How long has it been?
Your driving skills must've gotten rusty.

480
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:38,638
Scared to lose?

481
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:43,058
Get in.

482
00:40:43,058 --> 00:40:44,858
Wait.

483
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:50,878
I have some ideas about the project
to discuss with Ms. Ye.

484
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:53,718
Let's talk in my car.

485
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:57,518
Li Jin Yu, what do you want?

486
00:40:57,518 --> 00:41:03,058
Also, I've wanted to say this earlier.
What's with your outfit? It's on purpose, huh?

487
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:09,678
As the contractor, you shouldn't mind, right?

488
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:23,938
Ye Meng, be careful.

489
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:27,298
You were the eyewitness
to my mom's suicide case, weren't you?

490
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,142
 ♫ You ♫ 

491
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:03,318
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

492
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,533
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

493
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:13,334
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

494
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:19,254
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

495
00:43:19,254 --> 00:43:23,414
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

496
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:25,878
 ♫ Go ♫ 

497
00:43:25,878 --> 00:43:27,894
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

498
00:43:27,894 --> 00:43:32,022
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

499
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:38,006
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

500
00:43:38,006 --> 00:43:41,974
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

501
00:43:41,974 --> 00:43:47,990
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

502
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:52,310
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

503
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:55,894
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

504
00:43:55,894 --> 00:44:01,974
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

505
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:06,735
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

506
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:11,982
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

507
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,819
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

508
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:19,775
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

509
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:21,942
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

510
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:26,742
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

511
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:28,886
 ♫ But why ♫ 

512
00:44:28,886 --> 00:44:32,406
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

513
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:37,459
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
