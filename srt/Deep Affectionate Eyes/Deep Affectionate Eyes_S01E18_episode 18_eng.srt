1
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:11,845
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,459
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,244
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:20,773
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:25,925
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:31,173
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:34,661
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:38,125
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:42,757
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:49,029
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:53,765
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,845
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,845 --> 00:01:01,029
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:03,045
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:06,013
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,909
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,237
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,292
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,269
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:20,284
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:30,720
 

22
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:15,717
You said you couldn't drive.
Are you still lying to me?

23
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:20,297
I have the surveillance footage.
I'll give it to you.

24
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:24,957
The club's video is related to
both Wang Xing Sheng and Li Ling Bai.

25
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:27,584
Moreover, Wang Xing Sheng has disappeared.

26
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:32,337
I kept stopping your investigation
because I feared Li Ling Bai would harm you.

27
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:36,477
What about my mother's suicide case?
You were the eyewitness, right?

28
00:02:56,717 --> 00:03:00,917
Back then, I only saw
Wang Xing Sheng's license plate number.

29
00:03:01,637 --> 00:03:03,584
Then why did you change your testimony?

30
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,717
Li Ling Bai provided him
with an alibi at that time.

31
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:12,057
The heavy rain made me doubt what I saw.

32
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:39,297
I really don't know whether to believe this.

33
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:46,337
Ye Meng, I've already lost my father.

34
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:52,297
I don't want to lose you too.

35
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:13,997
 Jin Yu, stop the car. 

36
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:26,304
 Dad, I need to ask you something. 

37
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,192
 Go ahead. 

38
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:37,577
 Am I not your biological son? 

39
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:53,577
 So you knew I wasn't your son all along
and kept it from me? 

40
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:56,057
 Why didn't you tell me the truth? 

41
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:01,597
 - I always treat you as my own child.
- But I'm not. 

42
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:32,817
 And my biological father. Who is he really? 

43
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:36,017
 Why has he never appeared all these years? 

44
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:40,637
 And my mother's hatred for me.
Is that because of him? 

45
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:42,737
 Jin Yu, stop asking these questions. 

46
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:47,168
 - Just know I'm your father.
- I need to know the truth. 

47
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:57,152
 Jin Yu, watch out! 

48
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,624
I've been thinking,

49
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:29,792
if I had been capable of protecting him back then,

50
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:34,477
would things have turned out differently?

51
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,432
 Yu, Yu. 

52
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:17,997
 Yu, wake up. 

53
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,104
 Yu. 

54
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:31,360
 Yu, wake up, Yu. 

55
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:37,537
 Yu, wake up, Yu. 

56
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:56,352
 Yu. 

57
00:07:57,237 --> 00:08:01,377
 Jin Yu, Jin Yu, Yu. 

58
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:04,448
 Yu, wake up. Wake up! 

59
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,880
 Jin Yu, Jin Yu. 

60
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:32,000
 Get out now. 

61
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,757
 Dad, let's go. 

62
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,537
 Come with me. 

63
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,057
 Move! 

64
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:08,697
 Come out, Dad! 

65
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:14,677
 Jin Yu, leave me. Leave me. 

66
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:30,857
 Dad! 

67
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:49,917
I know I've kept many things from you.

68
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:54,677
My ways of protecting you were too extreme.

69
00:09:56,617 --> 00:10:04,617
But I've never cared for anyone before.

70
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:08,177
This is the first time.

71
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,477
That's why I'm truly scared.

72
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:25,277
I don't want to lose someone I love again.

73
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,851
 ♫ Are like meteors in the dark night ♫ 

74
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:42,784
 ♫ Streaking across the icy border ♫ 

75
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:45,517
 ♫ Reaching the depths of my heart ♫ 

76
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:53,517
Stop driving. You're worse than me. Get out.

77
00:10:55,712 --> 00:11:01,314
 ♫ Got stranded in the desert ♫

 ♫ Because I care too much ♫ 

89
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:39,437
Sit tight.

90
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:43,937
Are you changing the project leader?

91
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,008
No.

92
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:49,725
 ♫ I'll embrace you ♫

 ♫ Don't doubt ♫ 

94
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,817
I'm such a genius.

95
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,297
- The pink flowers need more exposure.
- Got it.

96
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,697
Move that forward a bit.

97
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:31,377
Hang up the 'e' in LOVE.

98
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:41,477
Charging for love.

99
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:43,157
Gou.

100
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:44,457
- Shift it right.
- How does this look? How?

101
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:45,977
Plans have changed. Let's pull out.

102
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:47,317
"Plans have changed"? What's going on?

103
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,137
Li Jin Yu came.

104
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:50,717
I invited him for team-building.

105
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:52,677
Are you insane?

106
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:55,397
Find a room and prepare
the confession scene. Understood?

107
00:12:55,397 --> 00:12:57,757
I told you proposing here was unreliable.
Too many variables.

108
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:58,817
Clear now?

109
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,217
I get it.

110
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:03,077
Leave immediately. Thank you.

111
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:05,837
- Hurry.
- Okay.

112
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:07,637
I'm heading there.

113
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:11,457
Where are my balloons?

114
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:29,937
Wait, why are you driving?
It's my race against him.

115
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:32,577
Watching you drive made my hands itch to try.

116
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:35,457
Congratulations on winning the race, Mr. Gou.

117
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:39,417
Let's go. Everyone's here
for company team-building.

118
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:46,657
Why are you following? This is our internal event.

119
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:49,837
Problem? Not welcoming your client?

120
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,957
Everyone's here.

121
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:01,077
- Mr. Gou.
- This armor replica is spot-on.

122
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:04,637
En, you did well today. Learn more from your boss.

123
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,217
But don't copy the temper, right?

124
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:10,077
- You're still so witty. He's hinting at you.
- Drink a lot and enjoy today.

125
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,977
Mr. Gou and I have something
to discuss. Keep chatting.

126
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,157
Fine. Let's talk later.

127
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:16,717
Waiting for you, Mr. Gou. Come back soon.

128
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,197
I'm all set.

129
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:21,317
Where?

130
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,117
Take me up.

131
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,237
Come.

132
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:30,537
Excuse me, we're done here.
You can leave now. Thank you.

133
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,457
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

134
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:34,277
- You're welcome.
- Come on.

135
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:40,097
Well? Romantic enough?

136
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:48,737
Look at this. Warrior charging
for love. Be your own sun.

137
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:52,117
You made this? Thoughtful.

138
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:56,097
I told you, bro. Only I could create this.

139
00:14:56,097 --> 00:15:00,217
No duplicates found. Every detail covered.

140
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:06,077
What's this ugly thing? Who brought it?

141
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:13,157
A camera? How perverse.

142
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:21,517
I brought it. Shut up
if you don't know how to talk.

143
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:25,017
Placing it here isn't appropriate.

144
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:42,497
Narcissistic much? Recording your confession?

145
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:47,457
What do you know? These will be sweet memories
once Ye Meng and I get together.

146
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:50,517
Is this appropriate?

147
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:55,637
Ye Meng isn't even divorced yet.
Don't you think this will bring karma?

148
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,997
Let me put it this way.

149
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:03,177
Cheng Kai Ran is just a money-hungry loafer.

150
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:06,577
When I told him to divorce Ye Meng,
he had the nerve to demand five million.

151
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:09,517
Five million? He's insane.

152
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,837
That's indeed not small change.

153
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,237
Right? So bargaining with him is normal, right?

154
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:18,357
He even called me an idiot. Has he lost it?

155
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:20,817
Outrageous.

156
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:23,677
Ye Meng is being kept in the dark
about his true nature.

157
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:25,877
That's why I'll record this video
and send it to her husband.

158
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:30,717
It'll make him face reality and give up sooner.
Makes sense, right?

159
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:34,157
You're sending it to her husband?
That's unethical.

160
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:38,737
Unethical? Still want your bonus?

161
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,997
Leave it here. Perfect spot.

162
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:46,857
Let me figure out how to connect this for you.

163
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:52,377
Also, remember during dinner...

164
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,497
To set the mood.

165
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:56,637
Perceptive.

166
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:59,077
- Do it.
- It'll be done.

167
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:09,957
Ye Meng, look how clear the sea is.

168
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:14,037
Like my love for you, pure and flawless.

169
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:17,617
Innocent. Without a single flaw.

170
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:27,917
I love you. I love you.

171
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:39,537
Why did your family join our team-building today?

172
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:43,357
Our companies collaborate,
so I wanted to get to know everyone.

173
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:46,277
Great. Delighted to have you.

174
00:17:57,737 --> 00:17:59,537
Bonus.

175
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:13,157
Everyone's had enough fun and food, right?

176
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:17,637
Let's play a game.

177
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:22,797
Ye Meng, come. Sit, sit.

178
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:28,677
With so many people, let's keep it simple.

179
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:34,437
Truth or Dare, company edition. Want to play?

180
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,897
Do I make everyone uncomfortable?

181
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:39,997
No, no, not at all.

182
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:41,077
Absolutely not.

183
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:43,077
Good. That's good.

184
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:44,797
We can play? Okay.

185
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:45,937
Yes, we'd love to.

186
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:48,417
- We want to play.
- Alright.

187
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:54,317
Let's see. Who goes first?

188
00:18:57,997 --> 00:19:00,997
Mr. Gou, you draw first.

189
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:04,617
Fine. I'll set an example. Okay.

190
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:06,477
I'll just randomly pick one.

191
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,577
Pick any card.

192
00:19:23,757 --> 00:19:26,997
Let me read. Lots of text here.

193
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:35,997
Tai Ming Xiao,
you're Gou Kai's favorite lieutenant.

194
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:40,397
But since Ye Meng arrived,
you've fallen from grace.

195
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:44,137
Mr. Gou, do you like Ye Meng?

196
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,037
What kind of question is this?
Does this even exist?

197
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:53,097
Stop making things up.

198
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,077
Could there be?

199
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,237
If there is, just say it. Right?

200
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,677
Yes. There is.

201
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:02,717
Okay.

202
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:06,577
Ming Xiao usually doesn't lie. Fine, I'll answer.

203
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,597
Yes, I do.

204
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:15,317
Don't you all like her?

205
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:17,217
- Of course we do.
- Who wouldn't like our boss?

206
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,117
- Absolutely.
- Definitely.

207
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:24,597
As a boss, it's natural
to favor more competent employees.

208
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:26,677
Next.

209
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:28,477
Let's follow the order then.

210
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:31,077
I'll go later.

211
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,117
Let me start first.

212
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:33,317
Alright, Jin Yu goes first.

213
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,077
The first one.

214
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:37,477
The first one?

215
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:44,517
Do you support workplace romance?

216
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,517
That's definitely not allowed.
Our company is quite traditional.

217
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:50,517
I support it as long as it doesn't affect work.

218
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:57,457
Why do you support it?
Do you have someone in mind? Who is it?

219
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,904
Mr. Li, who do you like?

220
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:02,496
Who is it? Who?

221
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,397
Manager Ye.

222
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:07,677
He likes Ye Meng.

223
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:15,517
I'm done. Your turn.

224
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:19,477
Why are you pausing like that? You scared me.

225
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:24,597
Ye Meng's turn.

226
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:26,397
This.

227
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:31,557
Free-form question.

228
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:38,677
Let me ask one then.

229
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:45,997
Ye Meng, you're both Mr. Gou's subordinate
and Li Jin Yu's client.

230
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:52,637
If forced to choose between them
for a project, who would you pick?

231
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:01,897
I choose Mr. Gou.

232
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:13,717
I'm not happy with that answer.

233
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:20,197
You're excellent, but being more lenient
with subordinates would be better.

234
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:22,057
I need to step out for a moment.

235
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:27,197
Taking a break. Where are you going?

236
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:29,637
Using the restroom. May I, Mr. Gou?

237
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:31,437
Sure.

238
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:35,577
Use the restroom downstairs. That one's empty.

239
00:22:41,837 --> 00:22:44,297
Aren't you hot wearing leather
in this stuffy room?

240
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:47,097
Take it off. Enjoy yourselves.

241
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,937
Jia, you take over hosting.

242
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:51,417
Okay.

243
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,757
Shall we continue, Mr. Li?

244
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:54,797
Mr. Li, are you...?

245
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:57,877
He left.

246
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,677
The boss wasn't playing the game.
He was toying with our nerves.

247
00:23:18,317 --> 00:23:23,397
Choosing your boss over your husband?
How dramatic he is.

248
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:29,297
Are you jealous?

249
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,277
He's really pulling out all the stops.

250
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:36,437
Flowers and balloons.
He's determined to confess to you.

251
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:39,757
I swear I didn't know beforehand.

252
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:45,397
Besides, I haven't fully forgiven you yet.

253
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:56,597
Can you forgive me now?

254
00:23:57,597 --> 00:23:59,737
Aren't you afraid someone might see?

255
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:05,637
Don't you find this more exciting?

256
00:24:37,557 --> 00:24:42,437
Gou Kai, this is just terrible.

257
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,117
 What's wrong? 

258
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:04,877
When I remember how Gou Kai looked at you,
I want to gouge his eyes out.

259
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:08,317
Quite possessive.

260
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:12,397
Why compare with him? I'll leave with you anytime.

261
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:17,577
 Bro, I'm going in. 

262
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,697
Oh, no!

263
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:24,017
Wait, wait!

264
00:26:03,137 --> 00:26:05,937
Gou, don't!

265
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,757
Are you crazy?

266
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:22,477
You can't go in. Not ready inside.

267
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:26,637
I saw Ye Meng enter. Move aside.

268
00:26:27,437 --> 00:26:29,637
I have something extremely important to tell you.

269
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:33,537
This determines
whether we can remain good buddies.

270
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:40,517
I'm advising you to cancel today's confession.

271
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:44,877
She's married. This isn't appropriate.

272
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:47,357
Don't tell me you like Ye Meng too?

273
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:50,597
Why would I compete with you guys for women?

274
00:26:50,597 --> 00:26:52,117
"You guys"?

275
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:55,077
No, no, I'm just looking out for you.

276
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:58,557
If you care, move aside. Stop this nonsense.

277
00:26:59,797 --> 00:27:06,437
Gou, listen to me. Don't go!

278
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:08,237
Let's go home.

279
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:13,137
Don't go! Don't!

280
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:14,237
Move.

281
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:18,077
Don't! Don't go!

282
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:22,137
Stop! Don't!

283
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:25,757
Where is she?

284
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:31,597
She left. I told you we weren't ready.

285
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:34,957
That can't be. She entered the room earlier.

286
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:40,957
She said there was an emergency.
She definitely didn't leave with Li Jin Yu.

287
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:43,757
It's true, I swear.

288
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:52,777
Where are you going?

289
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:54,577
Checking surveillance.

290
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:05,517
Gou! Gou!

291
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:11,597
The surveillance system i-i-is broken.
Nothing was recorded.

292
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:15,957
Are you hiding something from me?

293
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:17,557
Of course not.

294
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:18,557
Really?

295
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:21,877
No. Absolutely not.

296
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:23,917
Show me.

297
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,517
The computer's broken.

298
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:27,317
What's wrong with it?

299
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:37,917
It looks fine to me.

300
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,717
What's this about?

301
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:51,157
It's broken.

302
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:52,957
Broken.

303
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:59,017
You, come. Come.

304
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:01,317
Stay away. Listen to me. Listen.

305
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:03,957
Don't be mad. Don't be mad. Listen to me.

306
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:08,157
I just reconsidered.
Today's not the right time for confession.

307
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:10,957
I prepared everything.
You're telling me the timing's off?

308
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:16,117
I'm totally on your side.
Really. But think about it.

309
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:21,477
Even if Ye Meng's husband is terrible,
they're still married.

310
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:26,477
You don't understand
their relationship dynamics at all.

311
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:29,317
Aren't you breaking up a family?

312
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:31,117
Done talking?

313
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:32,757
Let me see if I can fix it.

314
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:37,997
I told you. It's broken. Why don't you believe me?

315
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:43,597
Confessions need one perfect shot.
No second chances.

316
00:29:43,597 --> 00:29:48,457
We're exposed. Infiltrate their ranks.
Destroy from within.

317
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:54,976
Don't make Ye Meng think we're immoral.

318
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:59,197
Or everything will be ruined. Understand?

319
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:06,037
I support you.

320
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:13,477
I'll go investigate her husband right now.

321
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:16,477
Wait for me.

322
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:28,177
Move aside.

323
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,917
Send me her husband's info.

324
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,752
 

325
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,637
Where's your boss?

326
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:49,697
The guy on the sofa. White pants.

327
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:53,837
Right. I need a good designer.

328
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:01,537
You're Ye Meng's husband?

329
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:07,477
Another one? This never ends.

330
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:20,397
Hi. I'm Tai Ming Xiao, Ye Meng's friend.

331
00:31:20,397 --> 00:31:24,917
She married quietly. I thought I should see you.

332
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:29,077
Sit. Let's drink and talk.

333
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:40,877
Big place. It must be busy normally.

334
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:43,037
Let me be blunt.

335
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:47,197
As said before, 2.5 million minimum.
Not a penny less.

336
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,317
I have principles.

337
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:54,437
What 2.5 million? I'm not here about money.

338
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:57,797
I just want to discuss Ye Meng's relationship.

339
00:31:57,797 --> 00:32:00,997
No money? Just chatting?

340
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:04,917
Impossible. I'll never leave Ye Meng. Period.

341
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:07,677
That's the spirit, buddy.

342
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:11,957
You can't just talk.
You need to spend time with her.

343
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:15,597
She doesn't want me around.

344
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:19,397
So if she doesn't ask, you don't go?

345
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:22,597
Listen. Women are equal to men now.

346
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:25,477
Control her. Don't give too much freedom.

347
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:30,677
For a beauty like Ye Meng, men swarm around her.

348
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:34,477
You don't watch her. You're okay with that?

349
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:38,277
Relax. I know her best.

350
00:32:38,277 --> 00:32:40,397
You know her best.

351
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:44,797
You're cuckolded. You know her?

352
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,617
What did you say?

353
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:52,877
You know her, but you don't know
the people around her.

354
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:56,337
What if someone shameless tries to cuckold you?

355
00:32:56,337 --> 00:33:00,957
Shouldn't you watch out?

356
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:04,357
What's Gou Kai done now?

357
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,957
Gou Kai?

358
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:12,397
You mentioned someone trying to cuckold me.

359
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:13,717
Isn't that Gou Kai?

360
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:17,117
Besides, Ye Meng wouldn't choose him.

361
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:20,317
If he steals her heart, I'll eat my hat.

362
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:22,237
Come on. Drink up.

363
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:25,437
Not Gou Kai. I didn't mention him.

364
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:30,677
A new rival appeared?

365
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,477
I...

366
00:33:35,277 --> 00:33:42,237
This one's trickier than Gou Kai.

367
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:45,757
Every woman falls for him.

368
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,737
A legendary heartthrob?

369
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:52,637
Do you know Hailan Bay's new manager?

370
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:56,877
Hanhai Group's heir, Li Jin Yu. You know him?

371
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:58,637
Li Jin Yu?

372
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,717
Exactly.

373
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:04,317
I thought you meant someone else. My good buddy.

374
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:10,517
Beware of close friends. Closest ones hurt most.

375
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:13,357
Look, I know you mean well.

376
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:16,477
But Li Jin Yu's fine. We share everything.

377
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:20,197
You guys are that open?

378
00:34:20,197 --> 00:34:24,437
Not about that. Broaden your perspective.

379
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,077
Broaden your perspective.

380
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:28,877
If you're really bored,

381
00:34:28,877 --> 00:34:32,357
worry about Mr. Gou.

382
00:34:32,357 --> 00:34:34,717
Mind his business.

383
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:39,517
What a broad perspective.
Crazy. The world's gone mad.

384
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:42,917
How'd Ye Meng stoop to marrying you?

385
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,077
How dare you speak like that?

386
00:34:45,077 --> 00:34:49,117
If you're done, I'll leave.

387
00:34:49,117 --> 00:34:50,917
Well.

388
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:55,957
- A drink for you.
- Thanks.

389
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:58,197
Drink here.

390
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:01,037
- Make him pay later.
- Got it.

391
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:02,837
Hey, man.

392
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:06,637
I didn't open it.

393
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,017
Scan to pay later.

394
00:35:25,717 --> 00:35:27,077
What?

395
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:28,877
I need to wash my hands too.

396
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:31,477
Okay.

397
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:01,597
No one else now, right?

398
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,717
Li Jin Yu.

399
00:37:14,237 --> 00:37:17,437
Li Jin Yu. Li Jin Yu!

400
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:25,317
Hurry! Go away.

401
00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:27,337
Faster, Li Jin Yu! Faster!

402
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:33,477
The dog's biting me!

403
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:35,277
Why are you here?

404
00:37:36,397 --> 00:37:41,157
What's going on between you and Ye Meng?

405
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:49,277
Quit the act.

406
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:54,037
I saw what you two were doing in that room.

407
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:56,397
You saw it?

408
00:37:56,397 --> 00:37:59,637
I saw it all. Too embarrassed to even describe it.

409
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:01,437
Good.

410
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:05,397
What's good?

411
00:38:05,397 --> 00:38:08,197
I wish I'd gone blind and never witnessed that!

412
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:13,317
How could you stoop so low?

413
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:16,517
Yes, you're a man. I get it.

414
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:19,117
Ye Meng is stunningly beautiful
with that smoking hot body.

415
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:21,637
How could any man resist such a beauty?

416
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:24,237
But she's married. Her husband...

417
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:28,557
Even if her husband doesn't mind...

418
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:31,317
Even if he's fine with it,
you three can't possibly live together!

419
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:33,477
That's complete chaos!

420
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,817
And Ye Meng. How could she
degrade herself like this?

421
00:38:37,477 --> 00:38:39,277
Who are you calling 'degraded'?

422
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:48,437
You...

423
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:55,277
Living together?
You three are absolutely disgusting.

424
00:38:55,277 --> 00:39:01,557
You're the disgusting one. Our relationship
is completely legitimate. Understand?

425
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:05,557
Legitimate?

426
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:06,877
Li Jin Yu, are you even speaking human language?

427
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:11,837
You're destroying a marriage,
and you're having an affair while married.

428
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:16,797
Have either of you considered
that poor husband on the marriage certificate?

429
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:22,037
Honey, do you feel pitiful?

430
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:27,997
A bit. Having such a beautiful wife
I can't publicly claim.

431
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:35,957
Morality's decaying in this depraved world!

432
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:41,257
Li Jin Yu, you home wrecker. Have you no shame?

433
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:45,317
I'll get it. Wait here.

434
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:51,697
Where are you going?
I'm still here. Show some respect.

435
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:55,557
For the sake of our friendship...

436
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:58,797
- What is this?
- Open it.

437
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,597
Marriage certificate.

438
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:05,397
Look closely.

439
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:14,757
Holder, Li Jin Yu.

440
00:40:20,677 --> 00:40:26,997
That's right. I'm the 'poor husband'
of Ye Meng you mentioned.

441
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:29,477
How did this happen?

442
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:54,597
So you're keeping the marriage hidden?

443
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:01,517
Why the secrecy?

444
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,677
It's related to Wang Xing Sheng.

445
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:14,037
Then what's Cheng Kai Ran's role in this?

446
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:18,477
He's just a decoy
for investigating Wang Xing Sheng.

447
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:20,237
Alright.

448
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:24,597
Hailan Bay is opening soon.
Li Ling Bai will arrive in Ningsui shortly.

449
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:27,597
That's why our relationship must remain secret.

450
00:41:27,597 --> 00:41:33,077
Fine. Okay, okay.

451
00:41:33,077 --> 00:41:36,277
If you wanted secrecy, why tell me then?

452
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,597
Now I know too much.

453
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:41,357
If your mother comes after me, I'm in danger.

454
00:41:41,357 --> 00:41:44,077
Exactly. So you have a choice.

455
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:46,677
Either help keep our secret or--

456
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:50,877
Stop pretending this is democratic.
What choice do I really have?

457
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,597
Thanks.

458
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:58,757
Not at all. Poor me.

459
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:06,877
Careful with the dog, Ping An.
