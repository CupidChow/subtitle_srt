 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:11,826
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

3
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:15,340
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,625
 ♫ With a sense of excitement You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:25,706
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:31,154
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:34,642
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,206
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:42,838
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:48,810
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,946
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,946 --> 00:01:01,126
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

13
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:06,026
 ♫ All I possess is drowned The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

14
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:11,190
 ♫ Has never changed If miracles could exist ♫ 

15
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,373
 ♫ Promises would be kept Please remember ♫ 

16
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:20,265
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

17
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:27,026
Deep Affectionate Eyes

18
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:29,920
 

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,310



20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,554
Let's go.

21
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,234
- Let's go back later. 
 - Why?

22
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:42,904
My mom asked my godmother
to pick me up because Dad's back.

23
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:45,754
She doesn't want me to see them arguing.

24
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:52,924
You're so weird. It's bad enough
that you hang out with Ye Meng yourself.

25
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:57,074
Aren't you afraid she'll be a bad influence
on the child by letting her take care of him?

26
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:59,974
I'm warning you, stop talking about Ye Meng.

27
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:04,374
Can't you see she's mentally ill?
I'm worried my son will get a bad upbringing.

28
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,114
She's mentally ill? And you're not?

29
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:10,754
I'm warning you, stop using our son as leverage.

30
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:14,112
I'm not threatening you.

31
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:16,960
I just think now the best choice for our child is for us to remarry

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,094
and give him a complete family, right?

33
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:24,234
You're ridiculous.

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,394
Is this your attitude?

35
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:36,196
Are you deaf? Can't you hear me?

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,974
Chen Jian, have you forgotten what you've done?

37
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:49,754
You don't even remember
why I want to divorce you, do you?

38
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,814
It's because of your domestic abuse.

39
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:59,234
From the moment you laid hands on me,
our marriage was over.

40
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:05,654
I've changed. You provoked me earlier.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done this.

41
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:06,854
Don't touch me.

42
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:11,634
I'm used to this. They never
see each other without fighting.

43
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:14,754
That's enough. I'm warning you.

44
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:18,694
- Even if we divorce, I'll get custody.
- In your dreams!

45
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:21,034
Who are you pointing at? Point again!

46
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,594
I'm trying to be civil. Can't you do the same?

47
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:25,094
Touch her again and see what happens.

48
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:32,094
You again? Fang Ya En, we're still married.

49
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:34,314
Can't wait to hook up with this punk, huh?

50
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,434
Your mouth really needs shutting.

51
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:42,094
I need to shut up? For visiting my wife and son?

52
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:44,034
How do you visit? With your hands?

53
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,914
- None of your business!
- With your hands, right?

54
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:47,714
Dad.

55
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:55,394
You're back.

56
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:59,314
Dad, if you want to see me, just call me.

57
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:03,194
Mom got me a smartwatch for calls and video chats.

58
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:07,414
- Okay.
- Then it's settled. Contact me directly.

59
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,914
I'll contact you another day.

60
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,154
Are you okay?

61
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,474
Did we scare you, sweetheart?

62
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:28,814
No. I'm used to your years of fighting.

63
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:38,654
What brings you here?

64
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:42,794
Ye Meng and Li Jin Yu went dating,
so I brought Jia Yu back first.

65
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,474
She said you didn't eat dinner,
and neither did he.

66
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:48,994
We brought you special treats. I'll head back now.

67
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:50,894
Let's eat together.

68
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,554
Join us.

69
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:01,654
Let's go see these treats.

70
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:03,334
He said these are all your favorites.

71
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,894
Really? Thanks.

72
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:08,714
Let's go.

73
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,334
I'm home.

74
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,294
Go to bed early.

75
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:46,554
Won't you come in?

76
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:51,774
We just sat at my place.
It's barely 50 meters apart.

77
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:57,894
And now, you invite me to go in.
What are you planning?

78
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:03,234
Li Jin Yu, what do you take me for?
Is that all I think about?

79
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,774
Isn't it?

80
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:07,534
Yes, exactly. You know me well.

81
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,794
Let's go.

82
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:10,094
Get some sleep.

83
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,814
- Heartless.
- Are you going in or not?

84
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:13,214
Cold-hearted.

85
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:14,974
- Three...
- You're being unreasonable.

86
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,354
- Two...
- This is our first day dating.

87
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:20,214
- One.
- I got it. I'm leaving. Bye.

88
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:24,234
Alright, enough. Good night.

89
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:26,034
Good night.

90
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,594
Good night.

91
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:37,834
Good night.

92
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:52,334
Don't stay up late.

93
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,694
Good night.

94
00:06:56,694 --> 00:06:58,394
Good night.

95
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,400
 

96
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:17,234
Time for bed.

97
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:25,414
Tired after playing all day?

98
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:37,654
Jia Yu, Mom and Dad had some disagreements today.

99
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:41,754
But it doesn't affect how much we love you, okay?

100
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:45,394
So don't be sad about this, alright?

101
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:48,574
Mom, I'm happy when you're happy.

102
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,534
Having you here makes Mom happy.

103
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:57,434
Mom, I'm sleepy. I want to sleep.

104
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,894
Go to sleep now.

105
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:23,794
Is he asleep?

106
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,594
Yes.

107
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:46,774
Are you in a hurry to go home?

108
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,634
 

109
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,268
Cheers.

110
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:11,414
Slow down, Ya En.
You've already finished a whole bottle.

111
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:15,174
I can handle my liquor.

112
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:21,174
And let me tell you,
mothers never truly get drunk.

113
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:29,554
The moment you think of your child,
intoxication becomes impossible.

114
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,754
Come on, pour me another drink.

115
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,234
What's wrong?

116
00:09:56,274 --> 00:10:01,740
Ye Meng, I know her best.

117
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,390
She wasn't trying to abandon you back then.

118
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:07,296
It wasn't Ye Meng.

119
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:16,754
I only see her as a friend now.

120
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:21,940
That's good.

121
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,130
We're all friends.

122
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,950
...

123
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,654
Let's leave all those
unpleasant memories in the past.

124
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,354
Have you moved on from your past?

125
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:15,674
Do you look down on me too?

126
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:23,614
Your once-respected boss has fallen so low.

127
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:28,754
I don't know why.

128
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:36,334
How did I become so pathetic in marriage?

129
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:43,274
Not pathetic, just exhausted.

130
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:59,274
What's your plan now?

131
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:03,150
I don't know.

132
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,290
We share a child.
I can't stop him from seeing Jia Yu.

133
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:17,350
That's why marriage requires caution.

134
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,070
There's a saying.

135
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,040
The right person

136
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,810
will pull you back to earth even from hell.

137
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,640
The wrong person

138
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:44,694
will torture you and drag you to hell even from heaven.

139
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:49,192
I wasn't that lucky.

140
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:56,574
I took the wrong path
the moment I dropped out of school.

141
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:05,274
So it's normal to meet the wrong person sometimes.

142
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,834
 Ya En. 

143
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,660
 Kai. 

144
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:18,054
 Ya En, why did you leave without saying goodbye? 

145
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:21,274
 School's boring. I'm going out to make my own way. 

146
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:25,594
 Why leave now? Aren't you about to take
the college entrance exams? 

147
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:31,394
 I dropped out. My grades were never good anyway. 

148
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:34,754
 Better to find work now
and gain some real-world experience 

149
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,334
 than waste days fooling around in Ningsui. 

150
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,394
 Just finish the semester.
The exams are almost here. 

151
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:42,674
 My scores won't get me into college anyway. 

152
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:47,274
 Unlike Ye Meng, my family
doesn't expect much from me. 

153
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:51,114
 I might as well start working early
and help my family. 

154
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:55,074
 If you leave, what about us? 

155
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:57,334
 If Ye Meng knew you were leaving,
she'd stop you too. 

156
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,934
 She knows. 

157
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:07,054
 So I'm the last to know?
Did you ever consider me a friend? 

158
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:08,800
 Kai, 

159
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,154
 stop messing around. Study hard and get serious. 

160
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:15,690
 Be good. 

161
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,850
 Alright, I'm leaving. 

162
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:53,314
What are you doing?

163
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:04,730
Your mom's drunk.

164
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,090
I'll go now.

165
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:08,630
Stop.

166
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,710
Do you like my mom?

167
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:14,914
Don't talk nonsense.
How could I possibly like your mom?

168
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:20,754
I don't hate you,
but my parents aren't divorced yet.

169
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:23,494
And I'm not ready for a new dad soon.

170
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:26,754
Go home and think about it. Don't rush.

171
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:30,854
I don't want to be your new dad.
What's there to consider? I'm leaving.

172
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:34,634
Tuck your mom in.
Take her shoes off and look after her.

173
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:35,834
Wait.

174
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,114
What now?

175
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,574
Turn off the light and lock the door.

176
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:41,774
Yeah, yeah. So many instructions.

177
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:48,434
Your light is broken.

178
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:06,554
That little brat.
How could I possibly like your mom?

179
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:11,274
Cheng Kai Ran likes Fang Ya En.

180
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:18,274
Cheng Kai Ran likes Fang Ya En? Is that possible?

181
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:22,894
Ran, could you really love Fang Ya En?

182
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:27,514
After all these years... How can he...?

183
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:40,654
Phone number ending 1490?
Hello, I'm your designated driver.

184
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:43,274
- Put your things in the back.
- Okay.

185
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:44,974
Thank you.

186
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,234
Use a cloth padding.

187
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:00,994
Mai, over here.

188
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,994
Li, did you pay Amy her 50,000 yet?

189
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:04,474
Paid first thing this morning.

190
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:07,614
Live stream starts soon. Look alive.

191
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:09,414
Mai, sit here.

192
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:12,414
Get me coffee.

193
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:13,814
Okay.

194
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,614
Being an influencer is that profitable now?

195
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:20,834
You mean Amy? She's our new star.
That's just her ad commission.

196
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,074
One ad pays that much?

197
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:25,614
Not much. More coming later.

198
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:29,974
At least a few more by year-end.
Guaranteed six figures minimum.

199
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,610
Thank you.

200
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:35,974
I don't have any grand dreams.

201
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:38,034
I just want to leave this small city.

202
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,794
I want to sing and be seen by lots of people.

203
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:43,314
I want my own stage.

204
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,694
No problem. We'll train you first.

205
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:47,934
Once you debut, you'll get your stage immediately.

206
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,734
Really? How long's the training?

207
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:55,574
It depends. Generally under two months.

208
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:58,514
But first, you'll need to pay the training fee.

209
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,554
How much?

210
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,614
- 100,000. 
 - That much?

211
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,554
Not much. Think about it.

212
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:09,654
Posture, styling, and professional skills.
All need training.

213
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:11,794
And trainers cost money, right?

214
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:15,214
We can discuss business
and collaborations in the later stages, right?

215
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:16,220
But don't worry.

216
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,700
When you become
a top-tier influencer with millions of followers,

217
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,394
you'll earn this money back in a day or two.

218
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:26,274
But I've already taken out a 50,000 yuan loan.

219
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:30,754
No problem. Think it over. I'll get back to work.

220
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,414
Regarding our live-streaming operations--

221
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:36,594
I'll pay. Just get me
more brand endorsements later.

222
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:38,934
Minor issue. The key is your own effort.

223
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:40,994
I'll definitely work hard.

224
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:43,034
Li, draft a contract for Mai.

225
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:44,074
Got it.

226
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:46,454
- Have a seat. I need to work.
- Thank you.

227
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:50,614
Let's focus on creating a better ambiance
during the live stream later.

228
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:51,754
- Understood.
- Okay?

229
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:55,694
Those two models pay more attention
during the shoot.

230
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:02,734
Are you sure I shouldn't visit your grandma?

231
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:07,834
Do you really want to visit my grandma,
or are you just trying to see Dr. Gao?

232
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:11,034
Exactly. I want to check on Dr. Gao.

233
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:15,074
See if he's struggling without me.
Maybe he needs my comfort.

234
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:18,634
Fine. Go comfort him then.

235
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:23,114
Then figure out how to comfort me tonight.

236
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:31,074
You're improving. Learning to counterattack now.

237
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:34,734
Ye Meng.

238
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,114
Mai.

239
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:39,614
You two are together now?

240
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:44,134
- What brings you here? 
 - I'm here to see Grandma.

241
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:46,514
Hello.

242
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:47,894
And this is?

243
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:50,074
This is my agent, Wang.

244
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,974
Wang, my brother and his girlfriend.

245
00:20:52,974 --> 00:20:55,774
- Your family has great genes. 
 - Impressive, right?

246
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:58,714
Do you have social media accounts?
Let me look you up.

247
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:01,214
Currently, you can pay a 50% deposit
for product placements. Live stream earnings...

248
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:04,694
We're influencer agents,
developing artists and internet celebrities.

249
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:08,514
You both have great potential. Guaranteed success.

250
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:09,974
Care to consider it?

251
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:11,894
Not interested.

252
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:17,554
Don't reject so quickly. Here's our business card.

253
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,074
Thank you.

254
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:22,614
Check out our streamers. They get massive traffic.

255
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,694
We're not kids anymore.
Still suitable for being influencers?

256
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:29,294
Wang, the brand wants to talk to you.

257
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:32,754
Excuse me, I need to work. Call me if interested.

258
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:34,654
- Mai, you go ahead with your work. 
 - Okay.

259
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:37,654
Amy? Yeah, Amy. Alright.

260
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:41,894
Focus on your job. Stop daydreaming.

261
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:43,874
None of your business.

262
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:51,094
Deal. Settled then.

263
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:53,894
Grandma, feeling better?

264
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:58,694
You shouldn't have brought gifts.
Just coming is enough.

265
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,074
You're not earning yet. No gifts next time.

266
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:05,274
No worries. I'll start
making money soon. Trust me.

267
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:07,614
What money are you talking about?

268
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:09,994
Give me your phone. Help me with a discount.

269
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,214
Fine, I'll help you.

270
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:13,834
- Hurry. Check the progress.
- Checking.

271
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,334
Grandma.

272
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:19,174
Grandma.

273
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:26,274
My granddaughter-in-law's here! Am I dreaming?

274
00:22:26,274 --> 00:22:28,314
You're together now?

275
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,034
Li Ba Dou proposed it.

276
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:34,274
You brat finally came to your senses.

277
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:38,114
I'm so happy seeing you together.

278
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:42,334
Hold still. Let me take your picture.

279
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:46,634
- Grandma. 
 - Good. Turn this way. Perfect.

280
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:50,734
So beautiful. No photo editing needed.

281
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:57,334
Truly a match made in mischief.
Look how perfect they are.

282
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,614
At least, she didn't call us 'partnered vermin'.

283
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:06,934
Oh, someone wants to rent my flower garden.

284
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:10,594
Go get my business license from home.

285
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:13,554
It's in my bedside drawer. Bring it here.

286
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:17,214
You wanted to grow something yourself.
Why rent out now?

287
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:20,094
I got a good offer. The price is right.

288
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:22,934
50,000 a year. 200,000 over four years.

289
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:28,834
Weddings cost money.
Raising kids isn't free, right?

290
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:31,114
What kids? We're not having any.

291
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:33,834
You brat. But don't worry.

292
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:37,414
Any fertility issues can be fixed with medicine.

293
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:39,694
Relax. Everything's fine.

294
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:43,034
Nonsense. We're just not planning kids yet.

295
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:44,654
Stop laughing.

296
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:45,694
You...

297
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:48,794
If you really want kids around,

298
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,454
I'll find you a part-time job at a kindergarten.

299
00:23:51,454 --> 00:23:54,894
Look how good Ye Meng is. You're being ridiculous.

300
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:58,272
Grandma, we just started dating.

301
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:01,614
I haven't planned that far ahead
for marriage or kids.

302
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:04,594
A girl shouldn't rush into marriage, right?

303
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:08,274
Especially having children.
It needs thorough consideration.

304
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:12,314
Ms. Tou Ju Hua, just change
your name to 'Tou Double Standard'.

305
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:15,454
How dare you speak like that!

306
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:21,514
Mai, go home and pack clothes for me.

307
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:24,074
Got it. Ask my brother
to wash any fruits you want.

308
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:26,374
- Don't forget to help me with that discount. 
 - Okay.

309
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:28,414
Finish your meal now.

310
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:16,610
That's not yours.

311
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,690
Put it down.

312
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:25,834
The agency said I need training before debuting.

313
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,274
I don't have that much money on me right now.

314
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:31,174
I want to mortgage Grandma's flower garden.

315
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:33,474
I'm just borrowing it. It's just a temporary loan.

316
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:35,474
I'll pay Grandma back
as soon as I make some money.

317
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:39,074
Please. Just help me this once. I'm begging you.

318
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:44,634
Put it down now,
and I'll pretend nothing happened.

319
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:47,354
Or I'll call the police.

320
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:50,020
How can you be so selfish?

321
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:54,454
Li Jin Yu, now, your girlfriend supports you,
so you don't have to worry about anything.

322
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:57,114
But what about me?
You know how much I love singing.

323
00:25:57,114 --> 00:26:00,654
But I'm stuck doing odd jobs at the bar
without any singing gigs.

324
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:03,274
So you steal from Grandma?

325
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:06,374
I'm not like you.

326
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:09,554
You're content staying
in this town forever. I'm not.

327
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:11,034
I will make something of myself.

328
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:14,214
I want to go to the city like Ye Meng did,
making great money and seeing the world.

329
00:26:14,214 --> 00:26:18,794
Nobody's stopping your ambitions,
but don't use Grandma's things to get there.

330
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:22,994
Stop calling her Grandma.
You're not even her real grandson.

331
00:26:34,514 --> 00:26:37,154
- What are you doing? 
 - Put it down.

332
00:26:37,154 --> 00:26:39,114
What?

333
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:54,814
Mai.

334
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,734
Where's the puzzle?

335
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:13,290
I bought Ping An salmon-flavored
dog food. Smells great.

336
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,860
Look.

337
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,694
Let me say thank you for it.

338
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:27,214
I saw Mai leaving earlier. Did you two fight?

339
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:37,174
I'm craving seafood.
Let's get crab at your uncle's place.

340
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:41,834
Not hungry. You go.

341
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,354
Really not hungry?

342
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,214
No appetite today.

343
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:04,734
Fine. I'll leave you to your puzzle.
Don't regret this.

344
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:15,594
Puzzles, puzzles, puzzles. Marry your puzzles!

345
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:56,614
Where's the piece?

346
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,594
What piece?

347
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:00,494
Stop playing dumb.

348
00:29:02,514 --> 00:29:05,314
Kiss me and I'll give it back.

349
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:13,174
That was the most robotic kiss ever.
It doesn't count.

350
00:29:13,174 --> 00:29:15,534
Don't push your luck.

351
00:29:16,614 --> 00:29:22,534
You were so cold earlier. I'm so sad.
Can't you just comfort me?

352
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:25,714
Alright, my bad.

353
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:37,494
Here. Take it. I'm leaving.

354
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:41,834
Sorry. I shouldn't have been so distant.

355
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:43,614
Come on. Let's get food.

356
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:45,514
Really? You mean it?

357
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:50,414
If you back out, your puzzles
will forever miss one piece.

358
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,274
Noted. Let's go.

359
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:55,934
Carry my bag then.

360
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:57,274
Sure.

361
00:29:57,274 --> 00:30:01,374
The key, too. And lock the door.

362
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:11,634
Let's go.

363
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:17,794
Coming. Careful, it's hot.

364
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:23,694
Meng, eat a lot. Keep serving her.

365
00:30:31,894 --> 00:30:36,794
What's wrong? Still upset about your sister?

366
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:46,014
Eat something. Your grandma
would want you nourished.

367
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:55,614
I'm not Grandma's real grandson.

368
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:08,794
Her son was my stepdad.
My brother's her blood relative.

369
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:13,594
Li Zhuo Feng, the one I donated my marrow to.
He's her real grandson.

370
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:17,794
After my dad died, I wasn't myself.

371
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:22,614
Grandma worried I'd self-destruct
if left unchecked.

372
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,114
So she dragged me back from Jiangbei.

373
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:31,974
But in her heart, you're her true grandson.

374
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:35,034
Your sister adores you. You're family.

375
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:38,694
Family? She's just clingy.

376
00:31:38,694 --> 00:31:42,894
Never stopping with the "Brother" crap.
I can't shake her.

377
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:46,074
 Eaten lunch? I knew you were still not up yet. 

378
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:48,874
 I got seafood noodles
from Uncle's place. Get up and eat. 

379
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,094
 No. 

380
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:54,734
 Stop moping indoors all day. 

381
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:58,554
 Come to my friend's
new escape room later. Free entry. 

382
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:00,934
 No interest. 

383
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:03,074
 Do you hate me? 

384
00:32:03,074 --> 00:32:07,174
 Every time I ask,
you're either busy or uninterested. 

385
00:32:09,214 --> 00:32:13,474
 Please. Just once. 

386
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:18,034
 - Stop this.
- Get up first. Up, up. 

387
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:21,394
 Stand. Let's go. Move. 

388
00:32:21,394 --> 00:32:25,934
 Shoes, shoes. There we go. Let's go. 

389
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:36,934
 This cell matches the clue.
Split up and search for clues. Hurry. 

390
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,834
 - How's it?
- What's your problem? 

391
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:39,934
 What? 

392
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:43,234
 - Why did you touch me?
- So what if I did? Quit pretending. 

393
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:45,654
 What do you mean? Say that again. 

394
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:46,934
 How dare you! 

395
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:52,234
 - What are you doing? Open the door!
- Scream then! 

396
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:55,374
 You'll pay for this. Brother, Li Jin Yu! 

397
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,314
 Brother! They're harassing me! Help! 

398
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:01,554
 - What happened?
- That creep groped me! 

399
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:03,974
 You're her brother? Don't start trouble. 

400
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,454
 You harassed her? 

401
00:33:05,454 --> 00:33:07,994
 So what if I did? 

402
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,314
No wonder Cheng Kai Ran calls you a lunatic.

403
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:26,934
The time you hospitalized someone?

404
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:29,074
Probably.

405
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,754
You act annoyed, but you'd die for her.

406
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:34,794
She loves you too.

407
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:41,034
Come on, smile. You've been gloomy all night.

408
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:46,774
Maybe I'll be happy if you call me brother.

409
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:55,274
Fine. Brother, brother. Let me feed you.

410
00:33:55,274 --> 00:34:00,274
Open up, Brother. Good, right?

411
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:04,814
See? You look great when you smile.

412
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:07,314
- Eat. 
 - You eat too.

413
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:19,470
Li Jin Yu.

414
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:24,100
Li Jin Yu.

415
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:27,954
- Li Jin Yu. 
 - What's the matter?

416
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:30,174
- I want to ask you something.
- Go ahead.

417
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:33,394
Why do dolphins always seem to smile?

418
00:34:33,394 --> 00:34:37,854
Dolphins can't actually smile.
It's the world's biggest lie.

419
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:42,054
I'm trying to joke with you. Could you play along?

420
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:45,434
Fine. Then tell me, why do dolphins smile?

421
00:34:45,434 --> 00:34:50,214
Because underwater jokes are all told by shrimp.

422
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:54,914
- That's a bit lame. 
 - Not at all.

423
00:34:56,534 --> 00:34:58,274
What's wrong?

424
00:34:58,274 --> 00:35:01,694
I have night blindness.
Turn on your phone's flashlight.

425
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:04,634
Are you serious, Ye Meng?

426
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:09,614
Just kidding. But really, turn it on.
I can't see the path.

427
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:11,110
No.

428
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,710
I just realized, having someone
throw themselves into my arms feels nice.

429
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:19,634
So you like this kind of thing?

430
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:24,234
Then I should've rushed into your arms
when we first met.

431
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:26,734
That wouldn't have worked.

432
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:34,634
Look at that flickering light. Does it remind you
of when you were with Mai in the escape room?

433
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:37,534
How did you guys get out that day?

434
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:43,214
 This light's blinking resembles Morse code.
Should we try decoding it? 

435
00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:45,434
 Using this? 

436
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:51,734
B, H, P,

437
00:35:54,874 --> 00:36:00,034
G, G, Z.

438
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:06,794
What does it mean?

439
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:09,034
Are you sure you want to know?

440
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:16,594
Don't be scared. Your brother's here.

441
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:28,354
- You're way lamer.
- Let's go.

442
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:29,694
Brother, where are you going?

443
00:36:29,694 --> 00:36:31,434
Going home.

444
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:32,914
Brother, your walk is so cool.

445
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:35,214
Thanks.

446
00:36:35,214 --> 00:36:40,320
Brother, you're my 'brother' now.

447
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,340
 

448
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:56,774
Feel free to browse.

449
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,314
Ya En.

450
00:37:00,314 --> 00:37:02,174
Kai, what brings you here?

451
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:05,914
- I-I brought you some snacks since I was nearby.
- Thanks.

452
00:37:05,914 --> 00:37:10,014
I bought a suit recently that's slightly too big.

453
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:13,174
I want you to alter it for me.

454
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:16,754
Sure. Leave it there and I'll check later.

455
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:23,654
Anything else?

456
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:29,094
Well...

457
00:37:29,094 --> 00:37:34,154
We drank too much yesterday, right?

458
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:40,854
Then you... you know...

459
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:47,074
What's wrong with this? Oh my.

460
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,394
It's broken. Go on.

461
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,334
But I didn't take it seriously.

462
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:57,054
I'm just worried Jia Yu might spread nonsense

463
00:37:57,054 --> 00:37:59,914
and make you misunderstand me.

464
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:02,474
Let's pretend nothing happened.

465
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:06,394
From now on, we're still good buddies.

466
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:11,114
Goodness.

467
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:21,114
Kai, I drank way too much
last night and blacked out.

468
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:27,300
If I really took advantage of you,

469
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:32,776
I really can't take responsibility for you. You understand that, right?

470
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:37,054
No! That's not what I meant at all!

471
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:40,134
I meant we could continue...

472
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:48,474
Mom, don't drink much. Mr. Cheng Kai Ran
carried you to the couch last night.

473
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:56,534
Then he turned off the light.

474
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,150
After that,

475
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,130
he left.

476
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:09,694
Thanks, Kai.

477
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:11,034
Not at all.

478
00:39:11,034 --> 00:39:15,114
Well, if there's nothing else, I'll head out.

479
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:16,854
Okay, I'll fix your clothes another day.

480
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:21,654
By the way, have you thought
about what I asked last night?

481
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:23,654
What thing?

482
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:28,614
Jia Yu asked if I could teach him boxing.

483
00:39:28,614 --> 00:39:32,354
- But he doesn't like boxing. 
 - He'll grow to like it.

484
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:35,354
I'll take this trash out for you.

485
00:39:35,354 --> 00:39:36,834
Thanks.

486
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,974
Mom, I'll go ask him about his answer.

487
00:39:38,974 --> 00:39:41,734
- What?
- Stop!

488
00:39:41,734 --> 00:39:43,694
Feeling guilty?

489
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:45,654
M-me? Why would I be?

490
00:39:45,654 --> 00:39:48,594
Then why are you afraid to tell Mom
what happened yesterday?

491
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,594
Shh. Your mom and I have a comradely friendship.

492
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:54,274
Let's drop this.

493
00:39:54,274 --> 00:39:58,134
Our decade-long friendship
shouldn't get awkward over this.

494
00:39:58,134 --> 00:40:02,134
Not sure about my mom,
but you look super awkward now.

495
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:04,540
Keep it down.

496
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,414
Yu, bro, I'm begging you.

497
00:40:10,414 --> 00:40:13,114
Never mention this to your mom again.

498
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:17,554
Order me around anytime. I'll be at your service.

499
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:25,574
Fine. I'll reluctantly agree
to keep this between us brothers.

500
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:27,954
But calling me bro messes up the seniority.

501
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:30,834
Want to address each other separately?

502
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:34,734
Fine.

503
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:39,174
Then it's settled. We call each other bro.

504
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:45,734
Alright, bro. Do think about the boxing lessons.

505
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:50,494
I'll make you a martial arts master
so you can protect yourself and your mom.

506
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:54,014
No. Using fists only solves problems temporarily.

507
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:57,554
Arming yourself with knowledge
is the lasting solution.

508
00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:02,014
Enough. I can protect Mom already. Go back.

509
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:38,014
Daily rehabilitation isn't helping. I quit.

510
00:41:38,014 --> 00:41:41,534
Keep going. 20 more minutes.

511
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:43,380
I'm done.

512
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,830
Leave. Seeing you makes it worse.

513
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:54,454
Look at how warm other families are.

514
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:59,574
Encouraging them, "Keep going. Work hard."

515
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:04,394
Staying positive helps recovery, right?

516
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:07,134
People would think you're guarding a prisoner.

517
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:12,634
Even prisoners obey better.
Hurry up, I'm timing you.

518
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:17,914
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.
Maybe low blood sugar. Get me something to eat.

519
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:23,654
I'll go after you finish this.

520
00:42:24,694 --> 00:42:27,054
What are you doing? Guarding prisoners?

521
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:31,594
Exactly. See how girls
understand each other better.

522
00:42:31,594 --> 00:42:33,234
Come on. Have a seat.

523
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:34,654
Grandma, I'll accompany you in rehabilitation.

524
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:39,214
Let me play some music. It'll motivate us.

525
00:42:39,214 --> 00:42:41,854
- Put on a tune. 
 - Let me pick one for you.

526
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:44,654
- This song works.
 - Hurry. Turn it up.

527
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:52,134
See how energized I get? Look at this.

528
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,914
I'm staying with Grandma
for rehabilitation. You can leave.

529
00:42:54,914 --> 00:42:57,134
I'm leaving.

530
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:58,834
Bye-bye.

531
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:05,134
Brat.

532
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:07,654
- Just pretend a bit. Aren't you tired?
- I'm fine.

533
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:10,294
Not bad. Let me massage it for you.

534
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:13,094
Honestly, what's with his attitude?

535
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:14,860
Yeah.

536
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:24,900



537
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,666
 'You' - Xia Heng 

538
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,938
 ♫ You ♫ 

539
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:44,414
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

540
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,429
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

541
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:54,130
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

542
00:43:54,130 --> 00:44:00,050
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

543
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:04,210
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

544
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,674
 ♫ Go ♫ 

545
00:44:06,674 --> 00:44:08,690
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

546
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,718
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

547
00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:18,802
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

548
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:22,770
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

549
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:28,886
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

550
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,106
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

551
00:44:33,106 --> 00:44:36,590
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

552
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:42,670
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

553
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,931
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

554
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:52,678
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

555
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,715
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

556
00:44:57,715 --> 00:45:00,771
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

557
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:07,438
 ♫ If love means letting go Let's sever all connections ♫ 

558
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,082
 ♫ But why ♫ 

559
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:13,202
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

560
00:45:13,202 --> 00:45:17,955
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
