1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,904
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:15,518
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,303
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:20,832
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,984
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:31,232
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,720
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,184
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:42,816
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:49,088
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:53,824
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,904
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,904 --> 00:01:01,088
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,104
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,072
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,968
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,296
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,351
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,328
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:21,143
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,048
 

22
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,440
We've completed the fire safety inspections

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,360
and system linkage tests
before Phase I of Hailan Bay's opening.

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,200
The countdown advertisements
for the opening have been released.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,640
On-site preparations for opening day,

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,580
including venue setup,
equipment testing, and guest reception,

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,520
have been assigned to relevant departments.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,560
This week, we'll finalize
the media press release for the event day.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,100
The PR team will further explore potential clients
from marketing perspectives.

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,320
Alright, let's wrap up for today.

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,120
Okay.

32
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,560
Ye Meng, let's review this proposal after lunch.

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,160
- I feel like--
- Let's go!

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,616
- I agree with--
- Go!

35
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:20,700
- I got it.
- No.

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,888
- You...
- Let go!

37
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:24,700
Leaving now, Mr. Li.

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,420
Ms. Ye, thank you for your work today.

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,040
No one's here.

40
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,240
- No one here?
- Really.

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,100
How was your day, honey?

42
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,448
- Tired today?
- What are you doing?

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,616
Come on, let's go to the restroom.

44
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:00,740
I don't need to go.

45
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,040
I need to go. Accompany me.

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,260
- Accompany me.
- What's this got to do with me?

47
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,776
I...

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,480
You're crazy.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,936
She's left.

50
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,100
Nobody noticed.

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,980
What's wrong with you lately?

52
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,320
We asked you to cover for us, not act suspicious.

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,380
Stop watching me. Keep an eye on Gou Kai.

54
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,180
As long as he's not watching me
and Ye Meng, we're fine.

55
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,780
Makes sense. Makes sense.

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,940
You still need to use the restroom?

57
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,820
I never needed anyway.

58
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,280
Then go ahead.

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,600
Tai Ming Xiao is overcompensating.

60
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,560
Oh, honey, give me some feedback
on that proposal later.

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,940
You need my advice?

62
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,180
Others might not know, but you should.

63
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm just self-taught.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
You're the real expert in practice.

65
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,940
I'll give feedback tonight at home.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,760
Ye Meng, why did you leave early yesterday?

67
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,660
Something came up yesterday. I had to leave.

68
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,740
I was hoping to--

69
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,060
Mr. Gou, I've been looking for you.

70
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,280
I need your signature on a contract.

71
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,840
- What now?
- Sign the contract.

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,672
What do you want?

73
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,940
Tai Ming Xiao, be straight with me.

74
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,260
What've you been up to these days? Acting shady.

75
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,940
What do you mean?

76
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,180
Keep ruining my plans repeatedly.

77
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,940
Guarding against me like some thief.

78
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,780
Is this how friends treat each other?

79
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,000
- Something is wrong with you.
- I just--

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,220
Enough arguing.

81
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,940
Mr. Gou, you want to know where I went yesterday?

82
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,320
I went to reconcile with my husband. We made up.

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,460
Wait, you and he...

84
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,880
That's enough.

85
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,880
She said they'd reconciled.

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,620
Drop it already, Gou Kai.

87
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,400
Is this any of your business?

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,160
Is it yours then?

89
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,440
- How's it not my business?
- How is it your business?

90
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,720
Stop arguing.

91
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,432
Neither of you stands a chance.

92
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,040
Does that concern you?

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,552
You've got issues.

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,760
It kinda does concern me.

95
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Stop staring. Any of your business?

96
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,980
Mr. Gou, give it here.

97
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,540
Gou, where are you going?

98
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,260
Leaving, Gou?

99
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,000
I need to return to Jiangbei. Emergency.

100
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,600
I never meant to sabotage you.

101
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,520
I always consider you a good friend.

102
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,396
I have some unspeakable difficulties right now
and can't help you.

103
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,760
But you don't have to feel humiliated

104
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,100
and hide back in Jiangbei
because of a failed confession?

105
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,460
- This isn't embarrassing at all.
- Just shut up already.

106
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,600
What failed confession?

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,660
I haven't even started properly yet.

108
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,540
This hasn't even begun?

109
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Forget it. Just keep watching Ye Meng for me.

110
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,700
Keep an eye on men
approaching her, especially Li...

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,900
Don't be mad at me then.

112
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,860
You'll understand one day.

113
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,820
Get it, Gou?

114
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,640
 

115
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,420
Ms. Ye, come to my office.

116
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,048
Okay.

117
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,300
What's the matter?

118
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,860
Don't keep bothering Ye Meng without reason.

119
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,220
You can come to me instead.

120
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,340
Mr. Tai.

121
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,060
That's enough already.

122
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,928
Work.

123
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,660
What are you doing, Li Jin Yu?

124
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,760
Gou Kai is already gone.

125
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,100
We still can't be open about this?

126
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,660
Open about what?

127
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,340
Can't you wait until we get home?

128
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,640
What if people see us in public?

129
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,780
I can't hold back at all.

130
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,780
Especially the way you rejected Gou Kai
right to his face was super cool.

131
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,100
Both cool and sexy.

132
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,860
Kinky tastes, Li Jin Yu?

133
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,956
- Not at all.
- Enough.

134
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,580
- Where's Mr. Li?
- Inside.

135
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,536
Lin Yang Yang.

136
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,544
Don't.

137
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,296
Li Jin...

138
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,168
Hello.

139
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,340
Jin Yu, long time no see.

140
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,640
Lin Yang Yang.

141
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,640
It's me. I'm back in the country.

142
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Why avoid me?

143
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,540
Not welcoming me?

144
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,240
Why did you come here?

145
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,640
To discuss projects with you.

146
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,460
I met Ms. Li the day before yesterday.

147
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,840
She said you took over the Hailan Bay project.

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,200
Coincidentally, my father wants me
to handle hotel operations.

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,520
She suggested I come inspect your work.

150
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,056
Maybe we can collaborate.

151
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,460
You two chat. I'll get back to work.

152
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,408
Taking a call.

153
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,680
Jin Yu, Yang Yang's with you, right?

154
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,660
 I remember you two got along well in college. 

155
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,900
 She still thinks about you often. 

156
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,136
She has a business
that aligns well with our Hailan Bay project.

157
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,640
Have a talk.

158
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,360
Okay, understood.

159
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,660
 She came all this way. 

160
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,460
 Treat her well. 

161
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,840
Take her out for meals and sightseeing.

162
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,528
Got it.

163
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,860
The one you saw earlier

164
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,340
is Manager Ye, our project lead.

165
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,640
How about I give you a tour?

166
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,400
Ask directly if anything's unclear.

167
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,216
Okay.

168
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,516
Ms. Ye, I need you to accompany me to the site.

169
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,272
Alright.

170
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,728
Trouble brewing.

171
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,700
This area is our residential zone.

172
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,660
Scheduled for completion in Q3 next year.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,736
Open this for me.

174
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,456
Thanks.

175
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,060
I'm certain they're innocent.

176
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,120
Innocent. Completely innocent.

177
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,180
I'm not even angry. Why tell me?

178
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,904
That gravel area isn't safe.

179
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:05,700
Let's stop here for today.

180
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,760
I'm tired from walking anyway.

181
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,328
I rarely come back. Let's have dinner together.

182
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,824
Great, let's all go together.

183
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,240
Everyone's worked hard today.

184
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,400
Sure, let's go together.

185
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Alright then.

186
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,480
- Okay.
- Let's go.

187
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,080
This way.

188
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,640
Very happy to be in Ningsui.

189
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,360
Thank you for accompanying me all day. Cheers.

190
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,400
Our pleasure.

191
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,600
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

192
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,580
How is it?

193
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,640
This wine was secretly taken from
my dad's collection.

194
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,760
His prized collection. He rarely drinks it.

195
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,700
We don't know about wines.

196
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,940
Such a waste to serve us.

197
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,040
Exactly, Yang Yang.

198
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,520
With that said, should we drink or not?

199
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,336
No need for formalities.

200
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,940
Besides, I'm happy to see Jin Yu.

201
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,060
Just a bottle of wine. No big deal.

202
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,300
Thank you for the treat, Miss Lin.

203
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,360
Miss Lin, Mr. Li, are you two close?

204
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,540
How should I put it?

205
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,480
Back in school, I had a crush on Jin Yu.

206
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,080
I'd say that counts as being close.

207
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,700
When exactly did that happen?

208
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,080
Why don't I remember this?

209
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,640
It's been so many years. So many years.

210
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,400
Besides, you've been abroad.

211
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,820
After all those years overseas,
you must've met every type of man.

212
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,000
 
You can't still fall for naive guys.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,940
You think foreign guys are better
than Chinese ones?

214
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,900
On the contrary,

215
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,520
-  I swear I clearly rejected her long ago. 
- going abroad

216
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,856
has made me more certain

217
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:04,760
I prefer someone like Li Jin Yu.

218
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,120
Ms. Ye, what do you think?

219
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,940
Miss Lin, you're sincere, loyal, and beautiful.

220
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,360
It's Mr. Li's honor.

221
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,940
Great minds think alike.

222
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

223
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,140
Let's all drink together. Me too.

224
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,420
Everyone, let's drink. Come on.

225
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,300
- Come on.
- Let's all drink together.

226
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,140
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

227
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,344
Ms. Ye.

228
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:44,064
Miss Lin.

229
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,000
Ms. Ye, can I ask you something?

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Does Li Jin Yu have a girlfriend now?

231
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,080
I don't know. We're not that close.

232
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,120
Then I'll assume he's single.

233
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,720
So I plan to pursue him again.

234
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,720
Do you think I'm being too shameless?

235
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,360
I truly admire your straightforwardness.

236
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,520
I acted the same way when pursuing my husband.

237
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,300
You're married?

238
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,360
I couldn't tell at all.

239
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,520
You must know how to win men's hearts.

240
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,760
Ms. Ye, let's exchange WeChat contacts.

241
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,700
I don't stay in Ningsui often.

242
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,520
With a man like Li Jin Yu,

243
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,720
someone might snatch him up any day.

244
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll need you to be my insider.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,640
If you notice anyone liking him...

246
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,240
Never mind. He wouldn't
settle for ordinary people.

247
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,240
But if you see him acting differently
toward someone,

248
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,540
please let me know.

249
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,660
- Well...
- Please.

250
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,760
Fine. Let's add each other on WeChat.

251
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,432
I'll scan your QR code.

252
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,280
I let my driver leave earlier.

253
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,360
You can drive me home later.

254
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,760
Then let's all leave together.

255
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,780
Ms. Ye, how are you getting back?

256
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,420
I won't go with you. A friend is picking me up.

257
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,280
Ya En.

258
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,180
Let me introduce my good friend Ya En.

259
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,344
Let's go now, Jin Yu.

260
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:43,552
Bye.

261
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:44,560
- Well...
- Bye.

262
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,500
Bye. Take care on your way.

263
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,624
- See you around.
- Bye.

264
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:55,700
- We're leaving too.
- Goodbye.

265
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

266
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,664
So that's why you suddenly asked me
to pick you up.

267
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:03,360
What's going on here?

268
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,080
Let's have drinks at Jubaoshi.

269
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,880
I won't escort you back. Get some rest.

270
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,480
No rush. It's still early.

271
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,520
I have many project-related questions for you.

272
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,280
Discussing it is too late for now.

273
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,660
Let's schedule a meeting at the office tomorrow.

274
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,556
Li Jin Yu, have you been well these years?

275
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,820
I've been fine.

276
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,940
I've missed you a lot.

277
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,660
That's why I came when Ms. Li invited me.

278
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,856
You must know what this means.

279
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,900
Ningsui is nice,
but you belong in glamorous cities.

280
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,328
I remember how dashing you looked

281
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:56,700
in car racing and the World Memory Championship

282
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,300
when you were in college.

283
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,000
No one suits each other better than us.

284
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,120
You've misunderstood.

285
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,820
I thought you came for business collaboration.

286
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,280
Marriage is also a form of collaboration.

287
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,540
Our union would create
synergies greater than the sum.

288
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,040
People of our status

289
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,580
don't have the luxury of free romance.

290
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,880
Arranged marriage? That's too dramatic.

291
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,540
I have no status. You overestimate me.

292
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,020
If there's nothing else, get some rest early.

293
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,780
Do you have someone you like?

294
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,180
What the... wow.

295
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,520
See this yacht?

296
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,540
The car, the bags... It's all too...

297
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,900
What's the use of being rich?

298
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,120
No matter how rich she is,

299
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,900
you'll still be the only one on Li Jin Yu's mind.

300
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,420
There are too many admirers around him.

301
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,120
You knew about his admirers
yet chose a secret marriage?

302
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,960
If you're so bold, go public.

303
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,740
Or do you find sneaking around thrilling?

304
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,100
- A little.
- Just a little?

305
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,540
Just a little.

306
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,720
Well done.

307
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,300
What's with this little bit... what's going on?

308
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,860
So happy?

309
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,800
I'm laughing at this couple's secret affair.

310
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,100
Why don't you two just go public
with this secret romance already?

311
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,620
I'm risking my reputation
to protect your marital secret.

312
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,920
You know what?

313
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,480
If this rumor keeps spreading,
how will I ever find a partner in this town?

314
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,920
You have a reputation to protect?

315
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,860
Seems you're thoroughly enjoying this act.

316
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,000
- Five million.
- Exactly.

317
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,860
Who do you think
I keep shouting 'five million' for?

318
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,140
Search your conscience
and tell me who I'm doing this for!

319
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,380
Fine. You did help our relationship.

320
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,100
Let me toast to you.

321
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,820
That's more like it. Lower your glass.

322
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,640
Here, Kai.

323
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,320
Cheng Kai Ran.

324
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,000
But Kai's right.

325
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,560
Are you and Li Jin Yu really going
to keep up this act forever?

326
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,860
What about that investigation?

327
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,680
Ask him.

328
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,516
What's the progress on Zhou Yu's case
Li Jin Yu asked you to investigate?

329
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,624
Cheng Kai Ran.

330
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,896
- What?
- Stop playing dumb.

331
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:54,060
About Zhou Yu.

332
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,820
What's the status?

333
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,076
- Dong Yu? Which Dong Yu?
- I...

334
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,240
Long Island Iced Tea?

335
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,540
We didn't order that.

336
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,680
Cheng Kai Ran.

337
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,820
Just a second.

338
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,860
Behave yourself.

339
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,820
Li Jin Yu is the type
to silently stand by his friends,

340
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,820
but I wear my loyalty on my sleeve.

341
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,100
We made up.

342
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,360
Go ahead. Seriously.

343
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,940
- Really.
- Really.

344
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,816
You're both bluffing me.

345
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,740
This bottle's on me.

346
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,300
You...

347
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,680
Is it that hard to believe
Li Jin Yu and I reconciled?

348
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,516
That idiot...

349
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,420
Your divorce gets finalized tomorrow.

350
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:52,040
My single era is finally here.

351
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,696
Why am I getting nervous?

352
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,280
Please, Chen Jian.

353
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,240
He'd better show up tomorrow without any tricks.

354
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,620
Don't worry.

355
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,720
Even if he resists, I'll drag him there.

356
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,820
This divorce is happening.

357
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,896
- Your words.
- My words.

358
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,520
- Accompany me tomorrow.
- Absolutely.

359
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,520
What about me tomorrow?

360
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,840
None of your business. Go away.

361
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,720
We're schoolfellows.

362
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,380
For our alma mater, I must attend.

363
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,920
On this joyful occasion,

364
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,100
let's drink!

365
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,940
- Everything's in the drink. Bottoms up!
- Okay.

366
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,480
He drank the whole.

367
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,600
About Zhou Yu...

368
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,100
Men always stick together.

369
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,840
Unreliable.

370
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,360
Mr. Li, your presence is a great honor.

371
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,696
Why so late?

372
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,168
I brought you peach blossom pastries.

373
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,680
Fresh out of the pot.
I kept them warm all the way.

374
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,300
I wouldn't dare interrupt your date
with Miss Lin by coming home early.

375
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,200
These pastries are from
Miss Lin's hotel, aren't they?

376
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,440
How thoughtful.

377
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,100
You even escorted her back to her room?

378
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,540
I didn't go up with her.

379
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I waited till she went up,
and then I came back to buy these.

380
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,640
I swear, nothing happened.

381
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,100
Fine. Come in.

382
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,120
Not you. I meant Ping An can come in.

383
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,540
The dog stays. You leave.

384
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,620
Wait, hold on.

385
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,520
Am I lower priority than the dog?

386
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,720
This ungrateful creature

387
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,920
doesn't even bark when I'm back
after being away for weeks.

388
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,080
- He's badmouthing you.
- I...

389
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,620
rushed back to bring you food.

390
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,420
Won't you let me in?

391
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,516
What do you do? Were my words wrong?

392
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,620
Please, I was wrong.

393
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,920
Let me in.

394
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,640
Unbelievable.

395
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,040
Ping An, play in the yard for a bit.

396
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,520
She's just a marriage alliance candidate.

397
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,060
Why so guilty?

398
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,520
Trying to butter me up now?

399
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,320
No, I just don't want you upset.

400
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
I'm sorry, dear.

401
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,540
I had no choice today. I apologize.

402
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,340
You saw the situation.

403
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,016
It was...

404
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,180
Honestly, I...

405
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,220
Enough acting. Sit.

406
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,040
I'm not angry.

407
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
I actually find Lin Yang Yang quite endearing.

408
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,280
- Really?
- Really.

409
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
You're quite generous.

410
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,340
Of course I am.

411
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,040
But she added my WeChat in the restroom today.

412
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,620
She wanted me to be her spy.

413
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,620
You really added her?

414
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,100
She'll be furious when she finds out the truth.

415
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,920
I had no choice but to add her.

416
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,300
We were the only two left in the restroom.

417
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,356
She kept begging me. What could I do?

418
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,300
But she's the same type as my mother

419
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,200
who values benefits over love.

420
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Her 'like' isn't for me as a person.

421
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,900
She's after my family's business value.

422
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,860
We should stay cautious around her.

423
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,624
Okay.

424
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,720
Were you jealous today?

425
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,540
Why would I be jealous?

426
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,820
Good at pretending, but I noticed.

427
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,340
I was not jealous. Stop staring!

428
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,720
You're so narcissistic.

429
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,540
You look cute when jealous.

430
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,520
Nonsense. I wasn't jealous.

431
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,100
Stopping you.

432
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,680
You said you weren't jealous. Why not?

433
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,540
No, no, absolutely not.

434
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,920
Maybe in 15 minutes.

435
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,000
Fine.

436
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,280
You've got a WeChat message.

437
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,100
Who's calling so late?

438
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,920
Who is it, Li Jin Yu?

439
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,624
Cheng Kai Ran.

440
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,240
 

441
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,380
Hello? What's up?

442
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,440
Bro, listen...

443
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,100
Ye Meng and Fang Ya En came to my bar earlier.

444
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
 They interrogated me. 

445
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
 They put a knife to my throat. Can you believe it? 

446
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,580
But I didn't say anything.

447
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,340
 I remembered we were blood brothers. 

448
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,200
So I kept my mouth shut. Pretty loyal, right?

449
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Cheng Kai Ran, explain.

450
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,496
When did I hold a knife to your neck?

451
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:25,120
 

452
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,460
He hung up?

453
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,448
I went to Cheng Kai Ran's bar
and told him we got back together today.

454
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:34,300
I also asked him about Zhou Yu.

455
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,940
He'd rather die than talk. Super loyal.

456
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:41,820
 

457
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,040
 Bro, I've had enough. 

458
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,540
 Turns out I'm the only one
who cares about our brotherhood. 

459
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,680
 This really disappoints me. 

460
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,440
 My eyes are getting moist, you know? 

461
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
 Let's end it here. 

462
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,660
From what I remember,
I don't have any friendships. Only love.

463
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,900
 From what I remember,
I don't have any friendships. Only love. 

464
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,920
So, has it been 15 minutes yet?

465
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,140
- Not yet.
- It has.

466
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,440
Only three minutes passed.

467
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,860
No. Get away.

468
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,024
- Don't be jealous.
- I will.

469
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:18,100
You admit it now.

470
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,640
Not jealous. I wasn't jealous.

471
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,680
Want to try some? I'll get it for you.

472
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,960
You only bought these two, right?

473
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,660
- Four.
- You didn't give any to others?

474
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,720
You didn't notice, right?

475
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,460
There are four here.

476
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,800
Why would I buy them for others?

477
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,064
Have a taste.

478
00:28:11,716 --> 00:28:16,736
 

479
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,912
All packed, Jia Yu?

480
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,340
I can't take you to school today.

481
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,420
It's okay, Mom. I can go alone.

482
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,620
Then I'm off.

483
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,400
Jia Yu.

484
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,660
I need to tell you something.

485
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,140
I'm actually getting divorced from your dad today.

486
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,140
Mom, have you decided for sure?

487
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,300
I'm really conflicted inside.

488
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,620
I'm mostly worried about you.

489
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,100
Mom, don't feel sorry for me.

490
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,300
This is your life, your choice.

491
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,380
I'll respect whatever you choose.

492
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,520
Just like you respect me.

493
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,968
Don't be afraid.

494
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,920
Thank you, Jia Yu. Off to school now.

495
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,140
Don't be late.

496
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,848
Bye, Mom.

497
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,240
The court finds with conclusive evidence

498
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,380
defendant Chen Jian committed domestic violence
against plaintiff Fang Ya En.

499
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,540
Per Article 1084

500
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,820
of China's Civil Code,

501
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,620
and in the best interests of children,
the judgment is as follows.

502
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,340
 
First, divorce is granted.

503
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Second, the minor child Chen Jia Yu

504
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,720
shall be directly cared for
by plaintiff Fang Ya En.

505
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,240
Defendant Chen Jian
shall pay monthly child support.

506
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,820
Third, defendant Chen Jian
may exercise visitation rights by law,

507
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,520
provided it doesn't harm the child's well-being.

508
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,740
I'm officially divorced!

509
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,700
Let's celebrate tonight.

510
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,064
 

511
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,960
 

512
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,416
Use Plan B for that project.

513
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,896
Tomorrow. Or the day after.

514
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:53,560
 
Early the day after tomorrow. I gotta go.

515
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,100
Are you really turning this bar into a restaurant?

516
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,200
Yes, it's a sustainable plan.

517
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,200
What if Jia Yu's classmates ask about it?

518
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,276
Saying I own a bar
might create the wrong impression.

519
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,620
At least, you're not crazy enough
to open a family restaurant.

520
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,860
I actually considered it.

521
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,540
But this place is too small.

522
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,300
Play equipment couldn't fit.

523
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,520
Kai, the flowers are here.

524
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,200
Nice. These pears were freshly picked, right?

525
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,520
Super fresh.

526
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,540
They better be fresh.

527
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,360
Good pears. 'Pear' means separation, fitting.

528
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,340
When is Ya En coming?

529
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,860
Ye Meng texted me. They're not coming.

530
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,608
They're celebrating themselves.

531
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,680
Divorce papers signed! Happy freedom!

532
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,900
I'm ecstatic!

533
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,860
Ye Meng, look.

534
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,520
These young guys sure are energetic, huh?

535
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,820
I wasted so much prime time before.

536
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,180
I gave up all my choices for just one person.

537
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,100
Wasting on chasing the wrong men when young

538
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,200
and mistaking trash for treasure.

539
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,780
That's you, Fang Ya En.

540
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,820
True. My only saving grace is having Jia Yu.

541
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,200
Otherwise, I'd be totally screwed.

542
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,540
Now, I'm single.

543
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,300
Time to experience the joy of young lovers!

544
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay?

545
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:33,696
 

546
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,220
With all this fanfare, are you confessing today?

547
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,040
No. We're friends.

548
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,920
Just celebrating her escape from misery.

549
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,960
Good then.

550
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,720
I wouldn't want you crying to me if rejected.

551
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,100
What 'rejection'?

552
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,300
Watch your mouth.

553
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,480
Can't you wish me well?

554
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,100
She just escaped the hellfire of marriage.

555
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,960
Don't push her into another inferno.

556
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,720
Is that realistic? Possible?

557
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,100
No, no.

558
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,280
She's freshly single. Now's the time
when companionship matters most.

559
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,100
Wait too long and others will swoop in.

560
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,960
Be bold. Seize the moment.

561
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,860
Strike when the iron's hot. No hesitation.

562
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,780
Trust me. Women understand women best.

563
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,960
Go do something useful. Stop meddling.

564
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,620
Stop messing things up here.

565
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,040
Mai, sit.

566
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,520
Women understand women. I trust Mai's judgment.

567
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,480
You just don't understand women.

568
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,860
I don't understand women?

569
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,280
I'm a married man.

570
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,276
How could I not understand women?

571
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,340
You understand women?

572
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,620
If you do, why let Lin Yang Yang

573
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,360
keep harassing you nonstop?

574
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,496
Then tell me, any good solutions?

575
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,100
Let's give her a strong dose of reality.

576
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,560
Stage a show to drive her away for good.

577
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,640
No time like the present. Watch this.

578
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,340
- Hi.
- Jin Yu.

579
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Hello, hello.

580
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,540
Well...

581
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,340
- You're Jin Yu's friend?
- Long time no see.

582
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,760
What've you been up to?

583
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,240
Not performing here anymore?

584
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,300
I stopped performing here.

585
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,960
He reserved this booth for you.

586
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
This way.

587
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,260
Let's chat while seated.

588
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,520
Please sit.

589
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,840
All these flowers were his doing.

590
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,968
He even picked pears for you this afternoon.

591
00:35:43,968 --> 00:35:46,320
What'll you drink?

592
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,520
Mix this lady a Maiden's Heart.

593
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,140
Coming right up.

594
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,140
Are these pears?

595
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,488
Yes, "Korla pears," he said. Sweet.

596
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:56,540
- Come on.
- Add me on WeChat.

597
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,920
- Alright.
- Added, already added.

598
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,740
- Added, done.
- Added.

599
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,140
He's a regular here?

600
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,400
Let's keep in touch.

601
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,800
He spends four to five hours here daily.

602
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,480
If he goes home early, he can't sleep.

603
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,360
What I want to tell you today...

604
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,520
His dirt is too much for me
to spill within three days.

605
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,100
He just kills time here all day.

606
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,540
See him there? Always surrounded by women.

607
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,140
Look, finger games and arms around shoulders.

608
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,260
I hate that behavior most.

609
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,480
And Mrs. Li from the village.

610
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,620
Her hair has turned gray.

611
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,620
He even hits on her! Disgusting!

612
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,520
Two days ago, in the restroom,

613
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,000
he was with some young girl, moaning and...

614
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,620
I couldn't even listen! So embarrassing!

615
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,780
This is a proper establishment.
How could he do that?

616
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,960
Oh, right, and these flowers.

617
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,480
As he said, they're specially prepared for you.

618
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,560
I don't understand the meaning of these pears.

619
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,176
Don't be angry.

620
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:59,220
Who caught it?

621
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,336
- Seriously...
- Three, two, one.

622
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:16,800
Hello.

623
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,480
- Hi.
- Hello.

624
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,400
- What's up?
- You two are beautiful.

625
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,100
- Can we drink together?
- Yeah.

626
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,360
How old are you?

627
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,336
You look fair and pretty.

628
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:27,960
- We should be the same age.
- Right.

629
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,320
Such sweet talkers. Join us then.

630
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,840
- Alright.
- Let's mingle.

631
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,040
Come play with us.

632
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,260
Let's play. What's the game today?

633
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,800
Dice shaking. How's that?

634
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Know how to play, ladies?

635
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,960
Okay, how do we play?

636
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,800
We compare dice points.

637
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,100
- High-low game?
- Exactly.

638
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,220
- Let's go.
- Come on, everyone.

639
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,120
- Together.
- Together.

640
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,488
Watch me roll.

641
00:37:47,488 --> 00:37:49,060
 
How about this? You lost.

642
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,220
Drink up.

643
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,980
- Fine.
- We'll drink with you.

644
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,200
We'll match your drink.

645
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,920
Chug it down.

646
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,440
Let me refill your glass.

647
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,440
- Fill her up.
- Cheers!

648
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,800
What's Li Jin Yu doing? He's insane.

649
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,620
It's nothing.

650
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,660
Keep pouring.

651
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,740
Pour it for the lady.

652
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:22,592
 

653
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,184
Li Jin Yu!

654
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,096
Look, Jin Yu.

655
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,520
Where's this bar?

656
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,060
No bar in Ningsui escapes my knowledge.

657
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,320
Follow me. Let's go.

658
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,620
Excuse us for a moment.

659
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,340
- We'll be right back.
- Sorry about that.

660
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,048
Okay, reveal them.

661
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,100
You lost.

662
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,340
- I'll drink.
- You lost again?

663
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,040
First time playing?

664
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,740
Don't leave anything in the bottom.

665
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,520
- Exactly.
- Right.

666
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,580
Bottoms up.

667
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,000
We're out of alcohol?

668
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,100
Waiter! Over here.

669
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,400
What can I get you?

670
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,960
This bottle. And another of this.

671
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,360
- Got it.
- Go.

672
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,760
What's the meaning of this?

673
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,100
It feels like they've taken over our night.

674
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,360
They think we're pushovers. Let's leave.

675
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,100
Out. Now.

676
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,660
Don't leave.

677
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,800
The night's just starting.

678
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Nightlife's barely begun.

679
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,180
Why rush?

680
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,904
It's still early.

681
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:53,740
Let's go, Ya En.

682
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,840
Over there.

683
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,660
Stay a bit longer.

684
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,920
I'm done drinking.

685
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,520
Come drink with me.

686
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,580
Let's party together.

687
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,520
Drink with me. Come on.

688
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,336
Everyone, join in.

689
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,440
Enjoying drinks with my wife?

690
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,380
Our bad, bro. Sorry.

691
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:16,320
What brings you here?

692
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,960
My friend owns this place. Just dropping by.

693
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Perfect timing to celebrate your divorce.

694
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,360
Go ahead. Keep drinking.

695
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,540
- I'm out.
- Done playing?

696
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,700
Bye.

697
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,320
We came too early and ruined the vibe, huh?

698
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,320
It's okay. But you scared off the men.

699
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,840
Who'll drink with us now?

700
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,880
We'll keep you company.

701
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,480
We're good company, too.

702
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,920
Those boys are barely 20.

703
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,360
You're an oldie compared to them.

704
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,100
I'm an oldie?

705
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,960
We're schoolfellows, remember? You...

706
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,540
They called you an oldie.

707
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,800
Good thing I'm already married.

708
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,400
Unlike you. You're still single.

709
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,620
Don't poke the sore spot.

710
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,100
Come on. Youngsters can't satisfy you like we can.

711
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,620
Let's play a game.

712
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,976
Boring. I played enough.

713
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:12,060
I'm hitting the dance floor.

714
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,580
- Let's go, Meng.
- I'll join her.

715
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,800
We just arrived and you...

716
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,440
Wait up! Why so fast?

717
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,960
Let's drink.

718
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,920
I don't drink.

719
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,620
If you don't drink, what are you doing here?

720
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,620
I'll take Ya En home later.

721
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,960
Okay, watch our stuff.

722
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,100
I'll go check on Ye Meng.

723
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,752
Waiter.

724
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,320
Please keep an eye on our things.

725
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,488
Sure.

726
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:42,140
Ya En.

727
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,752
I'll take you home later.

728
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:03,800
What?

729
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,060
I'll take you home later.

730
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,220
I'm not in a hurry to leave.

731
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,700
I got divorced today. I'm celebrating.

732
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,660
Fine. Let's celebrate together.

733
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,140
You can drink with others at Jubaoshi,

734
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,540
but I can't dance with the younger guys?

735
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,740
I was cooperating with Cheng Kai Ran
to maintain my player persona

736
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,740
to drive away Lin Yang Yang.

737
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,140
Do you think I believe that?

738
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,520
As a married man, I have this much self-awareness.

739
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,760
No matter how great those guys are,
I only like you.

740
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,072

 ♫ Baby, just hold me

770
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,976
 ♫ Exchange exclusive memories ♫ 

771
00:45:22,084 --> 00:45:24,356
 ♫ You ♫ 

772
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:27,332
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

773
00:45:27,428 --> 00:45:30,540
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

774
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:36,548
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

775
00:45:36,548 --> 00:45:42,468
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

776

 ♫ Go ♫ 

778
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:51,108
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

779
00:45:51,108 --> 00:45:55,236
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

780
00:45:55,236 --> 00:46:01,220
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

781
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,188
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

782
00:46:05,188 --> 00:46:12,004
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

783
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:15,524
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

784
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:19,108
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

785
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:25,188
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

786
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:29,949
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

787
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:35,996
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

788
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:40,033
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

789
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:42,989
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

790
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:45,156
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

791
00:46:45,156 --> 00:46:49,956
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

792
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:52,100
 ♫ But why ♫ 

793
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,620
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

794
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:01,473
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
