2
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,680
Bro, we found that couple
who scammed you last time.

3
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,080
They're in Jiangbei right now.
Should we go teach them a lesson?

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
What lesson are you talking about?

5
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,040
All you know is brute force!

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,200
We live in a society of laws now.

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,360
Did you…

8
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,480
Did you learn nothing last time?

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,080
Did you leave your brain somewhere?

10
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,480
Bro, he…

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,200
Hello there, Mr. Qian.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Day drinking already?

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,440
Hide the bottles. Quick!

14
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,280
He likes to hit people with them.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,640
This time, please don't be nervous.

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
We're here to apologize.

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
Apologize?

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
Don't!

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,880
There's no need

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,600
for you two to apologize to me.

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,960
If anything, I should be

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,240
thanking you both.

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
If you hadn't

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
intervened last time and sent me away

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,480
to receive a lesson
in the rule of law,

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,400
I might have gone down a dark path

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,040
and made irreversible mistakes.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,080
You two

29
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,400
are my benefactors!

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Now you're being too formal.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,560
We genuinely came to apologize.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,840
It was all a big misunderstanding.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,600
We never expected things
to escalate like this.

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,640
By the way, this is

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
premium Lao Ban Zhang tea
I asked a friend to source.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,000
Please try it.

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,760
And we're also here
to discuss some business with you today.

38
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,160
Business, huh?

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,320
Sit!

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
Go ahead. Take a seat.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,640
Look, this teahouse

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,680
is the only proper business

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,560
I've got to my name. And let's be honest,

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
we're hardly acquainted.

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
What business could we possibly have?

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Don't get us wrong.

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,880
It's my wife. She's quite taken
with that thumb ring of yours.

48
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,240
Over my dead body.

49
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,560
It's not for sale.

50
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,720
We're not here to buy.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,880
I just need to track down

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,840
the seller who sold you this thumb ring.

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,120
Our line of work

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
requires discretion.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,680
I totally forgot, bro.

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
Mind helping me out? Really owe you one.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,240
Come on. You think

58
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,680
I'd sell out for cash?

59
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,600
Nah,

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,880
I can't take this. Seriously.

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
Sorry, I missed some things here.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,160
Could you…

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,320
go over it again?

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,360
No,

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,320
I'm not actually close with…

66
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,400
this guy.

67
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,720
I only met him a few times.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,000
His name is…

69
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,880
Wang Xing… Wang Xingsheng.

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, Wang Xingsheng.

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,640
Do you have a photo?

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
Yeah, I've got a photo.

73
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,280
Hold on.

74
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,520
‪Ah.

75
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
Wang Xingsheng.

76
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,160
It's him.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,600
I only know him

78
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,120
through a mutual friend.

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,560
No idea where he is now,

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
but I can call someone to check.

81
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,320
I appreciate it.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,240
Mr. Zhang, hello!

83
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,120
this is Fat Buddha.

84
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,400
I got a question for you.

85
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,400
The guy who sold me that thumb ring,

86
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Wang Xingsheng, do you know where he is?

87
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,160
In prison?

88
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
No contact since?

89
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,720
What did he get busted for?

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,880
No idea.

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,440
Alright.

92
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,400
Okay, goodbye.

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,040
Mr. Ma, hello. This is Fat Buddha.

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,600
Need some info.

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,040
That Wang Xingsheng,
the guy who sold me the thumb ring.

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,280
You know where he is now?

97
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,200
Got some…

98
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,000
goods to move.

99
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,800
Galaxy Hotel.

100
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,120
Perfect. Thanks!

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,680
Got it.

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,160
Galaxy Hotel.

103
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,200
He's at Galaxy Hotel now?

104
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,520
- Yes!
- Thanks!

105
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,760
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

106
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
Stay for some tea?

107
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,280
Boss Wang,

108
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,640
some guys were just asking for you.

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,320
I told them.

110
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Right.

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,480
They're on their way now.

112
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,840
No idea.

113
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
I don't know shit about this.

114
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,440
Fine.

115
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,800
Galaxy Hotel. This must be it.

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,600
Yeah, this is it.

117
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
But besides Galaxy Hotel,

118
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,800
there's a smaller Silver Lotus Inn.

119
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,720
Same pronunciation, different characters.

120
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,840
You take that side,
I'll hold position here.

121
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
- Sure.
- Stay in contact!

122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

123
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,240
Could you check
which room Wang Xingsheng's in?

124
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm sorry,
we cannot disclose guest information.

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm his colleague. I need to deliver
a contract to him immediately.

126
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Could you please register first?

127
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Thank you.

128
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,360
- Is this acceptable?
- Yes, let me check for you.

129
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,880
‪JIANG A D75032

130
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,640
Driver, could you go
a little faster, please?

131
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
Alright, I'll try my best.

132
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
I've paid.

133
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,040
Wang Xingsheng!

134
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,120
I sent you a location.

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,080
Get here now.

136
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,440
I've found Wang Xingsheng.

137
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
Mingxiao,

138
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,080
I'm sending you a location.
Can you come help me?

139
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,840
Okay, thanks!

140
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
<i>Wang. Long time no see.</i>

141
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,200
What brings you to me?

142
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,680
Can't I visit you for no reason?

143
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,880
You've been avoiding me all this time

144
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,680
since I got out.

145
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,400
We're old friends. Isn't it good
to catch up after so many years?

146
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,360
By the way,

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,880
I remember your husband

148
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,400
and that woman from Ningsui…

149
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,720
Didn't it happen around here?

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
You came

151
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,840
just for this?

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,640
I thought we were done with this matter.

153
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,600
Done?

154
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,520
Back then, you urged me
to acquire the Ningsui land,

155
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,040
promised

156
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
you'd have my back,

157
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,120
so I…

158
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,760
went all out raising funds.

159
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
But the moment I went to jail,

160
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,240
you pulled a mastermind move

161
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,720
and took over my project.

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,680
Now your Hailan Port business is booming,

163
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,600
and you've made a fortune.

164
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,800
That little you gave me,

165
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,280
do you think it's appropriate?

166
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,520
You took the money back then too.

167
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
We had an agreement.

168
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,120
I've changed my mind.

169
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,880
No rules anymore?

170
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
When you sought me out, didn't you like me
because I didn't play by the rules?

171
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,840
All these years,

172
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I've done so much for you.

173
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,440
Aren't you afraid
I might use your secrets against you,

174
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
that I'm holding evidence
of your misdeeds?

175
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,320
Hello!

176
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,400
Here!

177
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,000
Why meet here? Where's Gou Kai?

178
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,440
What does Gou Kai have to do with this?

179
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,680
Isn't this Gou Kai's club?

180
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,960
This is Gou Kai's club?

181
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,960
He opened it
with one of my airhead friends.

182
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,080
Do you know the password?

183
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
- Yes, I do.
- Come on!

184
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,880
Where's he?

185
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
Why are you panicking?
What are you looking for?

186
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,760
I just saw Wang Xingsheng.

187
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,800
Wang Xingsheng?

188
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,720
- Here?
- Yes.

189
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,560
Wait.

190
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,000
How does he know the password here?

191
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,440
This place has been abandoned for ages.
Why would he come?

192
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,920
I'm not sure,

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,640
but I just saw a car pulling out.

194
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,080
What if he was in it?

195
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,320
There are security cameras.

196
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,280
Check the footage.

197
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,520
Sure.

198
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,600
Why is the computer turned off?

199
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,040
Let me check it.

200
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,520
The cables look fine too.

201
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
Then, what's going on?

202
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
The case is still warm.

203
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,400
Someone's been here.

204
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,640
Did you see anyone else?

205
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,120
I was guarding
the entrance the whole time.

206
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
Only one car left.

207
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,960
There's a back door here. Check the back.

208
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,920
Okay.

209
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,280
Sorry for troubling you
to come all this way.

210
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,800
We had a theft at the company,

211
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,280
and the cameras were down.
Had no other choice but to call you.

212
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,680
No worries. Take your time checking.

213
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,680
Thank you.

214
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,480
FILE MANAGEMENT

215
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,600
Wait. Isn't this airhead?

216
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,600
Airhead?

217
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,480
Don't tell me airhead
deleted the surveillance footage?

218
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,920
That's from our college days.

219
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Airhead was quite handsome, wasn't he?

220
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
They seemed really close.

221
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,960
What drove them apart?

222
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,160
It all started

223
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,200
with the World Memory Championship.

224
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,160
Both of them
had prepared for seasons,

225
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,320
but Li Jinyu

226
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,720
dropped out abruptly the day
before the competition.

227
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
The team lost,

228
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,640
and he faced brutal backlash.

229
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,320
That's what drove them apart.

230
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,280
After that,

231
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,520
Li Jinyu left

232
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,920
and never came back.

233
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,840
Then why did he leave Jiangbei?

234
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
No idea.

235
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,800
Gou Kai and I suspect
it was because of his mother.

236
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
Don't be fooled by her title
as chairwoman of Hanhai Group.

237
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,520
She never truly treated him as a son.

238
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,280
LI LINGBAI

239
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,560
Stop the car!

240
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,160
Hello!

241
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,520
Is this Li Lingbai?

242
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,640
The one who just drove out was Li Lingbai.

243
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,760
Why did Li Lingbai come here?

244
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,000
To see her son, or to meet Wang Xingsheng?

245
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,600
If she came for her son,

246
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,000
why did they leave separately?

247
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,760
If it was for Wang Xingsheng,

248
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,080
then… Hanhai Group is involved too.

249
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,800
And…

250
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,440
What is airhead doing here?

251
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
This is messy.

252
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,600
I'm calling him to ask.

253
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,600
No answer.

254
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,880
How much are you…

255
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,800
asking for this time?

256
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,560
How vulgar.

257
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,720
Then why leave Ningsui?

258
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
What are you doing here?

259
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,640
Just here to enjoy the show.

260
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,160
What show?

261
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,600
Ask yourself that question.

262
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,520
Ms. Li, you haven't
driven yourself in years.

263
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,160
Yet today,

264
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,040
you made an exception.

265
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,280
Must be meeting someone important.

266
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,640
Some things never change.

267
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,560
You still have that sarcastic tone.

268
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,960
No need to be so harsh.

269
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,680
I was just concerned about you.

270
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,320
But you're more sentimental
than I thought.

271
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,720
Still keeping in touch with friends

272
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
from eight, nine years ago?

273
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,320
That doesn't seem like you.

274
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,520
What are you implying?

275
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,400
Remember that suicide case at Jiumen Ridge

276
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,880
years ago?

277
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,680
<i>I was driving past that day</i>

278
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,320
<i>and saw two people arguing in a car.</i>

279
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,520
<i>Never got a clear look</i>
<i>at the man's face though.</i>

280
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,480
<i>Then news broke about</i>

281
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,320
a woman's suicide at Jiumen Ridge.

282
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,880
I reported what I saw to the police,

283
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,800
including the license plate.

284
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,680
But the next day,

285
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,600
you stormed in
and confronted me out of nowhere.

286
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,760
With your current mental state,

287
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,680
you dare to be a witness?

288
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,320
Can you even take responsibility?

289
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,600
I'm certain.

290
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,800
The license plate I saw
was that exact number.

291
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,840
Correct. That license plate

292
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,080
belongs to Wang Xingsheng,
my business partner.

293
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,080
But at that exact time,

294
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,680
I was negotiating with him
on Chenghuai Road.

295
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
How could he possibly be at Jiumen Ridge?

296
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Impossible.

297
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,720
I distinctly remember seeing it clearly.

298
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,840
Are you off your meds?

299
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,160
Your memory's completely messed up.

300
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Li Jinyu,

301
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,400
wasn't it enough
that you got your father killed?

302
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,280
Now you're trying to ruin my business?

303
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,520
Do you even care about this family at all?

304
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,840
<i>I truly believed</i>
<i>my memory had failed me that day.</i>

305
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,760
I went to the police
to retract my statement,

306
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,560
but they

307
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,920
had already

308
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,760
closed the case,

309
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,680
ruled it a suicide.

310
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
So, I dropped it back then.

311
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,120
But seeing you two together today

312
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,680
suddenly brought it all back.

313
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,360
Something never added up about that case.

314
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,880
On the 15th, the day it happened,

315
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
you returned from your business trip

316
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,320
and landed in Jiangbei in the afternoon.

317
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,760
But at that time,

318
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,360
Chenghuai Road

319
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,480
was closed due to heavy rain.

320
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,240
So, how did you
and your so-called business partner

321
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,560
even get there?

322
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,480
This?

323
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
Go ahead and investigate.

324
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,840
No matter how you dig,
it won't lead back to me.

325
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,040
Not so fast, Ms. Li.

326
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,880
The show isn't over yet.

327
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,000
<i>Aren't you afraid</i>
<i>I might use your secrets against you,</i>

328
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,120
<i>that I'm holding evidence</i>
<i>of your misdeeds?</i>

329
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,320
If this blows up during the investigation,

330
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,080
don't you think I'd make
an excellent hostile witness?

331
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,520
When the time comes,

332
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll testify against you
with every detail.

333
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,400
You know the consequences.

334
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,680
<i>There's no need for things</i>
<i>to get this ugly between us.</i>

335
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,000
<i>You know me better than anyone</i>

336
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,760
<i>and exactly what I want.</i>

337
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,600
Give me what I need,

338
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,160
and I'll disappear forever.

339
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
I've always known you were too decent

340
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
to let me down.

341
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,480
What if I handed this over to…

342
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,840
The police?

343
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,520
Go ahead.

344
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,120
Who said anything about the police?

345
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,400
But if this reaches the board,

346
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,200
or worse, the media…

347
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,200
Remember how you snatched
the Hailan Port project

348
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,280
the moment Wang Xingsheng was jailed?

349
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,640
Years later, he got out
penniless and desperate,

350
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
came to you for money,

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,640
then vanished.

352
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,960
Will the public bite?

353
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,840
How deep will they dig?

354
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,760
You really think
you can survive the scrutiny?

355
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,840
Li Jinyu,

356
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,840
what exactly are you trying to achieve?

357
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,160
<i>Mr. Li, we lost Wang Xingsheng's car</i>

358
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,360
<i>near Hanhai Group.</i>

359
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
<i>This is</i>

360
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,400
<i>beyond our reach.</i>

361
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,440
<i>That organization operates too deep.</i>

362
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,080
<i>If we want answers,</i>
<i>it has to come from inside.</i>

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,400
‪ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
‪MOVE THESE 29 ITEMS TO THE RECYCLE BIN?

364
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,600
CONFIRM, CANCEL

365
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,160
COMPLETED

366
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,160
I assumed you'd take me

367
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,680
to the Hanhai CEO's office
to discuss this.

368
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,520
A transaction

369
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,120
this large

370
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,680
requires company procedures.

371
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,800
Perhaps…

372
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,200
you should stay here for a few days.

373
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,320
Playing games with me?

374
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,400
How could I play games with you?

375
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,400
This isn't small change.

376
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
I genuinely don't have
that much cash on hand.

377
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Fine.

378
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
One more day.

379
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,880
What are you doing?

380
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,640
Since you won't play by the rules,

381
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,120
let's play a different game.

382
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,600
A friendly reminder.

383
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,320
If I don't walk out of here,

384
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,840
all your evidence is already out there.

385
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,520
Think very carefully.

386
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,400
Well done.

387
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Get some rest.

388
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Take good care of him for me.

389
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
Li Lingbai, you've crossed a line!
Don't touch me!

390
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,120
- Sit.
- Don't touch me! I can do it myself!

391
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,120
Sit!

392
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,480
Did you have dinner?

393
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,720
Look at me. How could I possibly
be in the mood for dinner?

394
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,960
I've been calling you all afternoon.
Not a single answer.

395
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,960
What's going on?

396
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,440
My phone died.

397
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,960
I circled around
the Silver Lotus Inn area today.

398
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,160
Nothing turned up.

399
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,160
What about you?

400
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,400
Any sign of Wang Xingsheng?

401
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,560
No sighting.

402
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,640
Followed him to a club,

403
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,160
then he vanished.

404
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Place had a back exit.

405
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,600
Probably slipped out that way.

406
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,800
But I found something interesting there.

407
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,320
A photo

408
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
of you with Gou Kai.

409
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,360
Did you know each other before?

410
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,400
I've known Gou Kai since childhood.

411
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,880
Tai Mingxiao was my college roommate.

412
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,840
How come you never mentioned this before?

413
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,760
Back then, I thought

414
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,840
our paths would never cross again.

415
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,000
That's why I never brought it up.

416
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,680
So, that's how it was.

417
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,640
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,400
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

419
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,480
Truth is,

420
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,440
I wasn't at Silver Lotus Inn today.

421
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,840
I met with Li Lingbai.

422
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,840
Seems your relationship with your mother

423
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,200
isn't as bad as I thought.

424
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,680
Then again,

425
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,840
blood runs thicker than water, doesn't it?

426
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,240
- Actually, I--
- I booked a flight back to Ningsui.

427
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,800
- What about Wang Xingsheng?
- Dropping the investigation.

428
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,200
Waste of time anyway,

429
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,400
since we can't even locate him.

430
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,960
Should I move these clothes of yours

431
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,680
to my place?

432
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,080
What I mean is,

433
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,880
since we're legally married now,

434
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,080
should we move in together?

435
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,120
No. Give it to me.

436
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,480
- Granddaughter.
- Granddaughter-in-law.

437
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,000
- You're back!
- You're back!

438
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,680
Badou,

439
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,160
hurry home.

440
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,320
Granny made
a whole table of your favorites.

441
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Meng, come here!

442
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,680
And you too, in-laws,

443
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,960
join us.

444
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,960
Alright then,

445
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,360
I'll come taste for myself.

446
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,640
- Let's see if the meals here
- Let's go.

447
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,960
suit my granddaughter's taste,

448
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,680
since she married into your family.

449
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,880
- A whole table.
- What are you implying?

450
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,360
Hurry!

451
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,800
Look at your grandma!

452
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,400
Grandmas,

453
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,920
eat up

454
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,680
before it gets cold.

455
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,080
Xu Meilan, no need for false courtesy.

456
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,280
We're family now, right?

457
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,120
Come on, Meng.

458
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,680
Have some meat. Take more.

459
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,920
Eat up!

460
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Dig in!

461
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,840
I'm truly not being polite.

462
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,560
My stomach

463
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,120
just can't handle rich food

464
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,080
like this anymore.

465
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,160
Juhua,

466
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
I don't mean to criticize,

467
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,960
but you should really adjust

468
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,800
those unhealthy eating habits too.

469
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,080
You never bother reading newspapers
or books these days.

470
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,560
They say

471
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,680
modern young people

472
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,160
are…

473
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,600
over-nourished,

474
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,040
eating too much processed food.

475
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,800
Need more whole grains in their diet.

476
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,400
Haven't raised pigs in years.

477
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,360
Where am I supposed
to get whole grains nowadays?

478
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,720
- Right?
- No pigs, no whole grains?

479
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,360
Wait, let me finish!
Besides, I raised Badou.

480
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,120
When he first came to me,
he was skin and bones,

481
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,480
literally like paper.

482
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,320
Look at him now! Granny's doing, right?

483
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,280
Stand up and show her.

484
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,240
See how tall and healthy you've become?

485
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
That's my raising!

486
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,360
Why all the theatrics?

487
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,400
Sit down.

488
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,000
Our Meng

489
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,680
can't eat this kind of food.

490
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,800
Grandma, it's okay. I can eat it.

491
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,080
So, you can eat it?

492
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,400
You're used to it now?
See? Just listen to her.

493
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,000
You little rascal!

494
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,360
No wonder they say,

495
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,160
"A married daughter
is like spilled water."

496
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,680
You're not even wedded yet

497
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,480
and already siding with the in-laws!

498
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,800
Grandma,

499
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,040
don't worry.

500
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,680
I'll maintain a balanced diet

501
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,320
and take good care of Ye Meng.

502
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,000
That's exactly what Grandma loves

503
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,240
to hear from her favorite grandson-in-law.

504
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,600
By the way, Meng,

505
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
how did things go in Jiangbei?

506
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,840
- Not bad.
- Not bad, huh?

507
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,920
Then I must say something.

508
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,280
It's about time we start
preparing for the wedding, right?

509
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,800
I've already prepared something for you,
picked out a wedding dress.

510
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,280
That mermaid style from TV,
remember?

511
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,000
With the extra-long train!

512
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,120
My granddaughter-in-law will be

513
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,000
the most beautiful bride
in the world when she wears it.

514
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,480
Absolutely stunning, I tell you!

515
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,720
Truly!

516
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,600
Had enough of the performance?

517
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,280
What exactly do you mean by that?

518
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,080
When you chose the wedding gown,

519
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,240
why didn't you discuss it with me first?

520
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,600
And why should I
have discussed it with you?

521
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
- Why should I?
- Of course you should!

522
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,920
I'm planning
a traditional Chinese wedding for them.

523
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,160
Even had the <i>qipao</i> custom-made!

524
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,400
Traditional Chinese weddings are outdated.

525
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,720
Western style is trendy now.

526
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,000
Classy and luxurious.

527
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,320
- What's wrong?
- This…

528
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,639
What's wrong?

529
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,040
Why are you vomiting?

530
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,440
- Threw up.
- It's nothing.

531
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,800
- Feeling nauseous?
- Just a bit of stomach trouble.

532
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,360
How long have you been

533
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,600
feeling like this?

534
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,719
It's fine. Probably just ate too fast.

535
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,320
That's why my stomach's…

536
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,000
- Excellent news!
- Juhua,

537
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,280
we need to speed up
the wedding preparations.

538
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,600
Otherwise that custom <i>qipao</i> I ordered

539
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,280
might not

540
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,280
fit her anymore.

541
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,560
Then that

542
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,239
mermaid gown will need extra room too.

543
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,199
YA, READY-TO-WEAR, VINTAGE, HANDMADE

544
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,320
Welcome.

545
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,440
What can I do for you all?

546
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,480
So, you're Fang Ya'en, correct?

547
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,720
Yes.

548
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,280
Chen Jian is your husband, right?

549
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,400
Get him out here.

550
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,960
I don't know this person.
You've got the wrong one.

551
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,480
Relax, beauty.

552
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,160
We're not here to hurt anyone.

553
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,160
Your husband owes us money.

554
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,800
Debts demand repayment.

555
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,240
That's only right.

556
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,280
And you're still legally married.

557
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,880
We've confirmed that before coming.

558
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,680
Now get him out here to settle this.

559
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,240
He's vanished.
I genuinely can't reach him.

560
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,840
Enough with the act.

561
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,360
Is this really necessary?

562
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,600
Just get to it.

563
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,480
<i>Hello.</i>

564
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,360
<i>The number you have dialed is powered off.</i>

565
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
<i>Sorry…</i>

566
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,720
Fine. No problem.

567
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,160
I can wait here.

568
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,400
I've got all the time in the world.

569
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,240
Chen Jian, stop hiding.

570
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,560
Your debt collectors are at my door.

571
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,360
Get over here now!

572
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,560
And Badou, don't worry about
the wedding arrangements.

573
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,120
Focus on taking good care of Meng.

574
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,440
- Leave this to Granny.
- Right.

575
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,720
- I'll be the officiant.
- I'll be…

576
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
- <i>There's an emergency at my place.</i>
- Everything will be done my way.

577
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,600
- <i>Come quickly.</i>
- Everything will be done my way.

578
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,400
I'm the one hosting
this wedding for my grandson.

579
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,960
- You'll still have to listen to me.
- Grandmas!

580
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
There's an emergency
at my friend's place. I have to go.

581
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,000
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

582
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,000
Meng, do you prefer sour or sweet?

583
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,360
Tell Grandma!

584
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,600
Kai, there's an emergency
at Ya'en's place. Get here now!

585
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,000
Sorry I'm late, bro.

586
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,240
This whole situation's messy.

587
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,160
Bro,

588
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,120
I never said I wouldn't pay you back
from the start till now.

589
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,920
But showing up at her shop?
That's not right.

590
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,880
Chen Jian,

591
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,240
I don't care what kind of shitty debts
you've stirred up out there.

592
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,160
Get them out of here now.

593
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,320
Don't ruin my business.

594
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,920
If you hadn't disappeared,

595
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,920
we wouldn't have had
to track you down here.

596
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,440
Yes.

597
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Bro, how about this?

598
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,320
You head back first,

599
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,320
and I'll definitely
find a way to make it up to you.

600
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,640
How exactly do you plan to make it up?

601
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,760
My wife, kid, and shop are all here.
I'm not going anywhere.

602
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,160
We'll work something out.

603
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,120
Worst case,

604
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,720
we'll mortgage the house

605
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,280
or pay some interest first.

606
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,400
Would that work for you?

607
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,080
Make it quick.

608
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,480
Don't make us come back!

609
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Absolutely.

610
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Sorry for the trouble.

611
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,360
Take care, bro.

612
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,480
You…

613
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,000
really just redefined my worldview.

614
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
My business is just

615
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,960
facing some cash flow issues lately.

616
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,280
Honey, you have to help me.

617
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,520
Give me the property deed,

618
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,720
so we can get a mortgage loan
and overcome this hurdle.

619
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,640
Are you even hearing yourself?

620
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,920
You buy a new car
when you had cash flow issues?

621
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,160
You start a business with no funds?

622
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,440
I need to keep up appearances.

623
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,160
Without that,
no one will trust or cooperate with me.

624
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,240
Ya'en,

625
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,760
we're husband and wife after all.

626
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,560
- You can't just watch me drown.
- Stop right there!

627
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,600
Since when are we still married?

628
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,280
You didn't show up
for the divorce paperwork that day,

629
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,120
then vanished completely.

630
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,880
Now you reappear

631
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,200
and immediately ask me to pay your debts?
Have you no shame?

632
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,760
Listen clearly, Chen Jian.

633
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,160
This divorce…

634
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,920
is happening whether you agree or not.

635
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,480
Your debts are your own to settle.

636
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,280
Fang Ya'en.

637
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,640
Are you really
forcing me into this corner?

638
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,960
Then I have to remind you.

639
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,560
These debts are marital obligations!

640
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,720
You're half responsible!

641
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,560
What are you doing, Chen Jian?

642
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,720
Chen Jian!

643
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,560
Stop right there!

644
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,480
Fang Ya'en!

645
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,080
Fang Ya'en! Open the door!

646
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,160
Listen carefully, Chen Jian!

647
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,560
If you dare touch my property deed,
I'll fight you to the death!

648
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,280
What business doesn't take out loans?

649
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,400
I just need it for an emergency!

650
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,960
This house is my pre-marital asset.

651
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,720
Don't even think about touching it.

652
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,280
Fang Ya'en, open the door.

653
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,800
Let's sit down and talk properly, okay?

654
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,920
Are you opening it or not? Fang Ya'en!

655
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,960
Open up now!

656
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,080
Fang Ya'en!

657
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,240
Chen Jian, have you lost your mind?

658
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,400
- Where's the property deed?
- What are you trying to do?

659
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,800
- Where's the property deed?
- Over my dead body!

660
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,800
- Give it back!
- Let go!

661
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,840
Give it to me!

662
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,160
- Give it to me!
- Ya'en!

663
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,360
- Give it to me!
- Let go!

664
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,560
Chen Jian, what the hell are you doing?

665
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,160
Ye Meng! He's stealing my property deed!

666
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,960
You really have gone mad, Chen Jian!

667
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,280
- Fuck you!
- You dare hit me?

668
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,920
Hit me and it's intentional assault.

669
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,840
I'll make sure you end up in jail!

670
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
This is family business.

671
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,040
None of your concern!

672
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,960
Like hell it's none of my business!

673
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,280
Nobody leaves today.
I'm calling the police right now!

674
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,280
Move!

675
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,320
Give it to me!

676
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,280
Stop right there!

677
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,800
Kai.

678
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,320
Enough! Kai, stop fighting!

679
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,600
Kai!

680
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,800
Hello.

681
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
I need to report a crime.

682
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,160
RONGHAI MUNICIPAL PUBLIC SECURITY BUREAU

683
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,720
You shouldn't have held me back just now.

684
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,560
Should've let me get a few more kicks in.

685
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,280
And then what?

686
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,600
Beat him to a pulp

687
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,720
and join him in jail?

688
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,720
He got what he deserved.

689
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,040
No need for you to go down with him.

690
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,440
Anyway,

691
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,760
as long as you're okay.

692
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,880
Kai, go pick up Jiayu.

693
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,360
The house is a mess.

694
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,440
I'll help her clean up.

695
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,320
Got it. Leave it to me.

696
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,280
Ye Meng.

697
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,400
Are you okay?

698
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm fine.

699
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Let me take you home.

700
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,880
No need.

701
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,000
We'll take a taxi.

702
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,560
Jinyu,

703
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,760
could you and Kai go pick up Jiayu for me?

704
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,920
Take him out to play or get dinner.

705
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,600
Just don't let him find out what happened.

706
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,680
Alright. No problem.

707
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
Heading out.

708
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Let's go.

709
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,960
