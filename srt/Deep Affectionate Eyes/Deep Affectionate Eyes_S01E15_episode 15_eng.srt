1
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:11,840
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,454
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:17,239
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,768
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:25,920
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,168
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:34,656
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:38,120
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,752
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:49,024
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:53,760
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,840
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,024
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:03,040
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,008
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:07,904
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:11,232
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:13,287
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:15,264
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:20,279
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,496
 

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,500
Bro, we're here to pick you up today.

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,260
Where do you want to go tonight?

24
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,720
Wait. You are not Chen Jia Yu's parents.
Who are you?

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Are you Ms. Chen--

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,040
Stay back! I'll call the police
if you come closer!

27
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,460
Ms. Chen, they're not traffickers.
My mom knows them.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,400
Alright then. Call me
when you arrive home, understand?

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
Thank you.

30
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,920
Wait. I'm still worried.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,720
Leave me your number.

32
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,300
Surname Cheng. Thank you.

33
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,520
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,160
Let's go. Buckle your seatbelt.

35
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,700
Thank you. Head home early.

36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,040
Why did they send you guys to pick me up today?

37
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,640
Your mom's busy today, so she asked us to come.

38
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,440
What about my godmother?

39
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,520
Cheer up. Don't pull that face. He's right here.

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,540
Your mom's having a girls' night out.

41
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,380
So us three guys. Let's go have fun.

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,460
But I want to go home and do homework.

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,440
What homework? Play.

44
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,040
Go for it, bro. Lean harder!

45
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,100
More gas! More gas!

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,060
Lean harder!

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Bro!

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,100
I'm in the top 100! Charge!

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Bro!

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,860
- Here! Over here!
- Pass! Pass!

51
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,420
Block him! Block!

52
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,980
Finish line! Finish line!

53
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,700
Bro, high-five! High-five!

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,360
Only you could do this! Let's race!

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
Come on! You and me, one round.

56
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Forget it. Not fun.

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,100
One more round, okay?

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,640
Please, please. Just one round.

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,860
Please, please. Can we?

60
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,720
Alright, alright. Only one round.

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Stop pretending. I already figured it out.

62
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,260
Since my mom doesn't
want me home, I'll play along.

63
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,060
I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.

64
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,760
Bro, wait for me. What do you want to eat?

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,560
Fried chicken.

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,360
You've been acting with me
all this time. Must be tired.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,700
You didn't have to make excuses for me.

68
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,360
- Whenever mom keeps me away, it must be my dad.
- Jia Yu.

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
Adults have adult problems.
Kids have kid problems.

70
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,900
This time, I only got second in the Math Olympiad.
I can't forgive myself.

71
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,340
From this perspective, life is truly full of pain.

72
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,900
Jin Yu, you're handsome and clever.
What troubles could you possibly have in life?

73
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,200
My wife ignores me. Does that count as a problem?

74
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,140
What kind of problem is that? Phone.

75
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,060
Come on, let me show you how it's done.

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,240
Honey, I miss you. Kiss.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,520
You don't need to send me back. I'm fine.

78
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,480
I'll help you clean up.

79
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,960
Look at this mess. This needs tidying.

80
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,760
- Let me help you.
- No, thanks. I can do it myself.

81
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,560
Don't move a muscle. Come on.

82
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,880
All of this...

83
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,020
Cry. Cry if you want to.

84
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Days ago, I even thought he was pitiful
and decided not to divorce him.

85
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,480
How foolish of me.

86
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,320
Remember how good we had it
when we were young in Ningsui.

87
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,460
Who could've imagined I'd end up like this?

88
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,320
Let me tell you,
your taste in men is really awful.

89
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:56,060
Why are women always like this?
Too soft-hearted and getting conned.

90
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,480
I've been married for so many years
and have a kid.

91
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,880
Who would've thought
he'd be so different from his appearance?

92
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,180
Exactly.

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,620
What's wrong? Something's off
between you and Li Jin Yu.

94
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,120
Something happened in Jiangbei?

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,240
He's hiding something from me.

96
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't know. I feel like
he's becoming a stranger.

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,180
It's like I never truly knew him at all.

98
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,760
Maybe getting married was too rushed.

99
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,260
But both your families are already planning
to have a wedding.

100
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,780
You're not having second thoughts now, are you?
What's your next move then?

101
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,580
The elders from both families are so invested.
That's why I'm feeling confused.

102
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,820
I'll just stall for now.
No other choice but to stall.

103
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,640
But how long can you keep stalling?

104
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,680
Until he can't keep up the act anymore.

105
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,660
Enough with the sighing. Jia Yu will be home soon.

106
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,220
Go touch up your makeup.
Your eye makeup is all smudged.

107
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,820
- I'll clean up here.
- Okay, I will.

108
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,220
 The surveillance footage
wasn't deleted by him, was it? 

109
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,180
Jia Yu.

110
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,180
Jia Yu.

111
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,240
Mom, Godmother.

112
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Did you have fun?

113
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,560
Lots of fun.

114
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,360
Thank you.

115
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,320
- Here's his backpack.
- Got it.

116
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,120
We'll head out now.

117
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,220
If anything comes up again, call me anytime.

118
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,760
I'll treat you to dinner soon.

119
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Drive safely.

120
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,380
- Bye, Godmother.
- Bye, Jia Yu.

121
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,100
- Bye, Jia Yu.
- Bye, Kai, Jin Yu.

122
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,900
I'll take my leave now.
Don't ignore her. Take the initiative.

123
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,740
Is it on your way? Give me a ride.

124
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:44,820
Ye Meng. How are you today?

125
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,840
I'm fine.

126
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,220
Next time this happens, you should call me.

127
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,100
It's really nothing. I just feel bad for Ya En.

128
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:05,320
When she got married, I thought
she finally found happiness and a reliable one.

129
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,480
I never imagined it'd turn out like this.

130
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,780
Are you still mad at me?

131
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,520
Do you have something to tell me?

132
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:47,700
People are complicated. What they think
is hidden behind flesh and pretense.

133
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,060
The lucky ones might just
live their whole lives in the dark.

134
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,100
The unlucky ones

135
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,300
suddenly realize
they don't know their partners at all.

136
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
I'll head back. Good night.

137
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
 Mr. Li. 

138
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,100
 Hanhai Group's too shady.
We need to get information from within. 

139
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
 

140
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,060
- Take a look at this.
- Ju Hua, look.

141
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,640
See how pretty this chain is? Petite and delicate.

142
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,880
Perfect for Meng's style. This is the one.

143
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,000
This is too thin and light. It looks really cheap.

144
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It doesn't showcase your wealth.
You don't understand.

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,340
What do you know?

146
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,580
Wearing thick chains
makes you look like nouveau riches.

147
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,840
And another thing.

148
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,320
Today's youth prefer entry luxury.

149
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,080
How much is that crap worth?

150
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,060
With gold, the heavier, the better, right?

151
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,360
Besides, if they divorce one day,

152
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,060
I can bring this over
and it'll turn into cash, right?

153
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,240
Use your head.

154
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,220
Ugh! They're doing great now.
Are you trying to jinx their marriage?

155
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,000
This dragon-phoenix design has great symbolism.

156
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
It's called marital harmony. Yes, give me.

157
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,720
Oh, shut it already! It's long outdated.

158
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,100
Modern kids like sparkly things. What do you know?

159
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,060
- 'Sparkly things'?
- Yes!

160
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,420
Thinking you're still a girl? Look at your age.

161
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,640
'Sparkly things'... Enough already!

162
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,300
Questioning my taste now? What's wrong with me?

163
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,760
- So petty.
- What's wrong with me?

164
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,180
Who says people
at my age can't wear flashy accessories?

165
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,640
I have to wear it. I'll annoy you to death.

166
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,840
Ladies, we have a lot more styles.

167
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,220
Feel free to browse more.

168
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,360
By the way, gold and diamond combo pieces
are really popular now.

169
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,220
See? They're both timeless and trendy.

170
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,800
What do you know?

171
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,580
If you want to be tacky, go ahead alone.

172
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,100
Don't drag my granddaughter into your gaudy style.

173
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,240
Why am I suddenly called tacky and tasteless?

174
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,620
You're the petty one. Such narrow-mindedness.

175
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,420
Ladies.

176
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,100
What now?

177
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,980
Look, you two are buying this
for your grandkids, right?

178
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,980
Shouldn't we ask their preferences?

179
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,120
What if you two love it, but your granddaughter
or granddaughter-in-law doesn't?

180
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,500
What then?

181
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,760
Hello?

182
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,000
Grandma?

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,580
- Ba Dou.
- Meng.

184
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm at a jewelry store,
choosing accessories for you.

185
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,220
I don't know which one you prefer.
Come choose yourself.

186
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,920
I'll pay for whatever you like. That's settled.

187
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,340
Morning.

188
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,600
Morning.

189
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,400
I brought breakfast for you.

190
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,900
Not hungry. Let's go.

191
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,240
Check this out. Listen. It's weighty, right?

192
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,840
It exudes elegance.

193
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,380
- Grandma.
- Grandma.

194
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,300
- Coming.
- Come see quickly.

195
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,980
Meng, hurry.

196
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,000
Sit here.

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,700
I picked these for you. The thin ones
your grandma picked just don't suit your style.

198
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,000
Got it.

199
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,600
Meng, look. The earrings I chose for you.
This is the bracelet.

200
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,480
I picked this. And this ring.

201
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,420
- What do you think?
- Choose.

202
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,580
Look, Meng.

203
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,540
Stop hesitating, Meng. Pick something.

204
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,700
Grandma, gold prices are super high right now.
It's a bit of a loss to buy at this moment.

205
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,760
Let's wait a bit longer, okay?

206
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,220
No loss when buying for you. The wedding jewelry
is just the basic requirement, right?

207
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,760
Ba Dou can afford it. Pick whatever.

208
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,360
We've been too busy lately. Get this done today.

209
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,740
Final decision.

210
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,460
Right. I'll buy you whatever you like, Meng.
Price doesn't matter.

211
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,880
Go on, choose. Grandmas are excited.

212
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,420
Grandma, I didn't want to say it earlier,
but these styles are pretty outdated.

213
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,360
Nowadays online,
customized services are offered for clients.

214
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,420
You want our wedding to be one-of-a-kind, right?

215
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,520
Of course.

216
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,440
Let's put these away. We'll look elsewhere.

217
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,980
Unbelievable.

218
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,380
Let's postpone our wedding for a while.

219
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,520
What do you mean?

220
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,220
My mother's case isn't resolved yet.
I'm not in the right headspace now.

221
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,460
When we registered our marriage,
it didn't really feel real.

222
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,660
But now, the grandmas are planning the wedding.

223
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm actually starting to feel
the weight of marriage more deeply.

224
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:06,040
But these feelings aren't entirely positive.
I'm a little scared and anxious.

225
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,080
Ye Meng, are you having regrets?

226
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,780
I'm leaving.

227
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,940
Ya En, what are you doing?

228
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,740
Come look at this.

229
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,620
What is all this?

230
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,080
Again.

231
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,900
Who did this?

232
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
Chen Jian, obviously.

233
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,560
Why would he do this?

234
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,720
He probably wants to frame me to get more money.

235
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,220
How shameless. This place is trashed.

236
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,220
If Jia Yu sees this, what do we do?

237
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,240
I'll help clean up.

238
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
Don't panic. We'll clean it up quickly.

239
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,860
Oh, my god.

240
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,940
Unbelievable. I'm livid.

241
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,220
He'll stoop to anything. What a piece of work.

242
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,480
Fang Ya En,

243
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,340
when did you become a Ningsui celebrity?

244
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,320
You're in the gossip news.

245
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,280
 
Look, 'Exposed'.

246
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,560
I just run a clothing store.
What could he expose about me?

247
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,720
I have to ask, what were you two doing?

248
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,040
It shows Kai taking measurements in my shop.
That's normal tailoring work.

249
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,760
He secretly took this photo
to frame me. Unbelievable.

250
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,560
This is laughably absurd.

251
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,080
Tell me the truth. Did you two have something?

252
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,880
Stop making this worse.

253
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,180
Well? Should we teach him a lesson?

254
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,020
How?

255
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Let's do it.

256
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
What's wrong?

257
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,140
In that room.

258
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,140
I just realized, at our age,

259
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,700
doing something illegal
would really be embarrassing.

260
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,680
But he's gone this far. How can you tolerate it?

261
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,480
I'll take responsibility. Let's go.

262
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,500
Okay. Give me that.

263
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,620
Let me take out my phone. Where's the phone?

264
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,320
It's inside.

265
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,420
Is it?

266
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
Here, here.

267
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,220
Got it.

268
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,880
You take this.

269
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Let's move.

270
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,740
- Go.
- Go.

271
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,320
Why aren't you moving?

272
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,380
Let me just mentally prepare myself.
I need to check. Okay. Go.

273
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,180
Go.

274
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,040
Step aside.

275
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,840
Screw you!

276
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,240
Are you crazy? You psycho!

277
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,560
Didn't you want to escalate this? I'll play along!

278
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,080
Everyone, look here. This man is Chen Jian.

279
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
He abused me during our marriage.
He never paid child support.

280
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,240
He keeps dragging out our divorce.
He threatened me with our son.

281
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,220
When that didn't work, he put up posters
slandering me downstairs from my place.

282
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,380
Didn't you claim Cheng Kai Ran was my lover?

283
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,660
Then you must know what he does for a living.

284
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,560
You won't divorce me?
Fine. We'll keep living like this.

285
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,280
Let's see if you can still stay in Ningsui!

286
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,380
Adulterers. I'll call the police
and have you arrested first.

287
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,660
Go ahead! Call them!

288
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,620
Scum like you should've been executed!

289
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,240
You should've died long ago!

290
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,224
We'll discuss cooperation later. I'm leaving.

291
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:31,000
Wait, Zhao.

292
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,140
She's insane. Don't mind her.

293
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,280
Zhao, don't listen to her nonsense.

294
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,660
She's mentally ill.
I didn't know she'd come today.

295
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,700
- Did you get it recorded?
- Everything's recorded here.

296
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,800
- Good.
- How do you feel?

297
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,380
My head's spinning. Amazing. Did you see his face?

298
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,180
Awesome.

299
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,520
We're really sorry.
We were a little impulsive today.

300
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Don't bring your problems into my shop.

301
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,800
Look what you've done to this room.
I need to keep running my business.

302
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,280
- We sincerely apologize for the trouble.
- Right.

303
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,980
- Please scan.
- We'll reflect on this.

304
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,720
Let me give you advice. If you couple have
something to discuss, do it at home.

305
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,560
We're not a couple! Payment's done.

306
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,000
Stop meddling! Ugh.

307
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,460
Your aim was terrible.
Look where you splattered it.

308
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,140
He was such a chicken. Unbelievable.

309
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,620
Why did you fall for such a cowardly man?

310
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,000
I'll never want to see him.

311
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,240
Just looking at him makes me sick.

312
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,760
Without a man, we'll live happier.

313
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,560
Exactly.

314
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:09,940
Remember how carefree we were as kids?
Just laughing all day.

315
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,760
Now, we're adults. It feels like we have more.

316
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,040
But we're less happy, right?

317
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:29,040
It's not that we've changed.
We just care about more things.

318
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,560
Basically, we're becoming more cautious.

319
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't be sad. Cheers.
I wish both of us better and better futures.

320
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,700
Better and better. I'm finishing mine.

321
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,500
Cheers.

322
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,660
Now, tell me. What brings you
and the drinks here today?

323
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,040
Something's off. Did Li Jin Yu upset you again?

324
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:21,560
Sometimes, I think
he's even more terrifying than Chen Jian.

325
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,480
How's that possible? Who could be more terrifying
than an abuser or a con artist?

326
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,280
Tell me properly. I'm listening. Go on.

327
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,120
He deceived me.

328
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,260
He deceived you?

329
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,740
But I don't know why. I still want to trust him.

330
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,040
Do I have a savior complex?

331
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,460
No, sweetheart.
You didn't treat others like this before.

332
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,860
I can't figure it out. My mind's all tangled.

333
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,460
Enough now. Let's drop this topic.

334
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,760
I'll tell you when I sort it out.

335
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,800
Okay. Tell me whenever you want.

336
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,780
Remember this, Ye Meng. Follow your heart.

337
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,760
No matter what happens, whatever you decide,

338
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,660
I always support you.

339
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,440
Okay.

340
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,240
Okay, okay.

341
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,660
Come on, drink up.

342
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,460
I don't care. If you drink
too much, I'll carry you home.

343
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,980
You promised.

344
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,940
Hurry up.

345
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
You...

346
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,140
Drink. Just kidding.

347
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:36,620
Who taught you that?
Is this how people from big cities treat me?

348
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:06,000
Even without women,
we men should maintain our lives.

349
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Come on, cheers.

350
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,560
These women are ruthless.

351
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,720
Fang Ya En or Ye Meng?

352
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,700
Both terrify me.

353
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,320
I'll never understand what's wrong with this world

354
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,940
or what women want.

355
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,180
Ya En and I will talk sense into her.
Don't be so worried.

356
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,740
No words can fix this complicated mess.

357
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,880
It's way deeper. I just want to protect Ye Meng.

358
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,940
Fine. I don't know what happened to you two.

359
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,560
But seeing you this tense, it must be serious.

360
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:15,020
Need our help? Just name it. Be direct.

361
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,880
I need some days off.

362
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,320
Ye Meng. Ye Meng.

363
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Why are you so wasted?

364
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,780
You're going the wrong way.
Your home is over there.

365
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,180
Do you need anything?

366
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,940
About what you said today, what do you mean?

367
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Exactly what it means.

368
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:36,500
The day we chased Wang Xing Sheng, you went too
and deleted the surveillance footage, right?

369
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:56,080
I've been waiting for you to come clean.
But now, I'm exhausted.

370
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:03,800
If our relationship
is just built on secrets and lies,

371
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,900
it shouldn't exist anymore.

372
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,800
Ye Meng.

373
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,520
 Aren't you afraid that I have leverage over you 

374
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,340
 and hold evidence of your wrongdoings? 

375
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,280
 Actually, we didn't need to reach this point. 

376
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,040
 You know me best. 

377
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,700
 Give me what I want, and I'll stop bothering you. 

378
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:59,420
 Li Jin Yu, you're so sick.
You can't manage the stock ownership currently. 

379
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,780
 
 Transfer it to me. I'll safeguard it for you. 

380
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:18,320
 Li Jin Yu, what exactly are you trying to do? 

381
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:27,560
 To get what's mine. The stock transfer agreement
you made me sign has expired. 

382
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,920
 I want to reclaim my 15% company shares. 

383
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,520
Hello?

384
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,560
 Hello? Ye Meng, I've been looking for
Wang Xing Sheng these days but failed. 

385
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,980
But yesterday, I discovered
a witness related to your mom's case.

386
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,940
Did you know this case has an actual eyewitness?

387
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,280
Eyewitness?

388
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,620
The day your mom died by suicide,
someone saw her in Jiumenling,

389
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,760
saying she was sitting in a car with a man.

390
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,080
That man was likely Wang Xing Sheng.

391
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,280
Why didn't anyone tell me?

392
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,420
Because he later retracted his statement,

393
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,700
claiming he misremembered the license plate.

394
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,080
Can you contact him? I'll go find him.

395
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,380
No need. I know him.
Isn't the world ironically small?

396
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,900
That person happens to be Li Jin Yu,
the naive guy I told you about.

397
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,560
Who?

398
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,120
 Li Jin Yu. I mentioned him to you
just the other day. Did you forget again? 

399
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,380
 Irrelevant. What matters is that I know him. 

400
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,360
 Want me to help ask what really happened? 

401
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,860
 Hello? Ye Meng? What's wrong on your end? 

402
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,060
 I'm asking if you need me to ask him. 

403
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,400
No need. Don't tell him yet.

404
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:36,480
 

405
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,300
Hanhai.

406
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Ye Meng, why didn't you tell me
you'd come back to Jiangbei?

407
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,680
You've been following me?

408
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Tai Ming Xiao told me
about the deleted surveillance footage.

409
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,480
And?

410
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm sorry. I was too impulsive
when I canceled the meeting with Wang Xing Sheng.

411
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,680
Now he's missing, I bear major responsibility.

412
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,900
But if you still want to find him, I can help.

413
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,420
You'll help me? How?

414
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,600
Do you know the Ningsui Hailan Bay project?

415
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,420
I've put in tremendous effort
to get this project from Li Ling Bai.

416
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,620
If you want to approach Li Ling Bai,
this is an excellent opportunity.

417
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,660
As long as you return to the company,
you'll lead this project.

418
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,120
Why should I trust you?

419
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:32,780
You have no other choice.
Otherwise, you'd not be here. Am I wrong?

420
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,680
Fine. I'll join.

421
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,680
Hello, do you have an appointment?

422
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,260
We're from Geometry Field
with prior arrangements made with Ms. Li.

423
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,300
Understood. Please register here,
and I'll get your cards ready.

424
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,100
Mr. Gou, please proceed ahead.
I'll handle the registration.

425
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,000
 Did you see my message? The naive guy is back. 

426
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,200
 Can you believe it, Gou? Li Jin Yu has returned. 

427
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,060
Mr. Gou, this way, please.

428
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,180
Ms. Li, Mr. Gou and his team are arriving.

429
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Ms. Li.

430
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,960
Gou Kai, you came.

431
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,000
When did Jin Yu return?

432
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,100
Just recently. I'm showing him
the company's business.

433
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,260
What brings you here today?

434
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,080
To finalize the Hailan Bay
framework agreement with Ms. Li.

435
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,680
By the way, let me introduce you.

436
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,980
This is Ye Meng, my most trusted partner

437
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,660
and future leader of this project.

438
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,540
Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Li.

439
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,500
Hello. Impressive credentials
for someone so young.

440
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,780
Thank you.

441
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,620
This is the junior Mr. Li
from Hanhai Group, Li Jin Yu.

442
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,140
What junior Mr. Li?
They've known each other since childhood.

443
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,940
A pleasure, Mr. Li.

444
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,740
Likewise.

445
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,200
We won't keep you then.
We'll prepare in the conference room.

446
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,580
- Good. Take them there.
- Yes.

447
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,740
- See you shortly.
- See you.

448
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,540
This way, Mr. Gou.

449
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,000
Rest assured, Ms. Li. We won't let you down.

450
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,840
I'll be watching closely.

451
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:31,260
Gou Kai, you're really being so thorough now,
and your company's growing so fast.

452
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,120
Jin Yu, learn from him.

453
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,200
Understood, Ms. Li.

454
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,000
It's your trust in our company
and willingness to give opportunities.

455
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,780
Jin Yu's just returned.
Ye Meng and I need to learn from him.

456
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,180
Capable yet humble.
Giving you this project really makes me relieved.

457
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,960
There's a celebratory dinner tonight.
Everyone should attend.

458
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,760
Okay.

459
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,220
Come to my office later.

460
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,380
You returned to Gou Kai's company?

461
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,300
Didn't you swear to me you'd never go back?

462
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Is there an issue?

463
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,820
Aren't you back to take over the family business?
And you pretend we're strangers.

464
00:43:53,856 --> 00:43:56,128
 ♫ You ♫ 

465
00:43:56,128 --> 00:43:58,304
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

466
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,519
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

467
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:08,320
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

468
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,240
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

469
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,400
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

470
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,864
 ♫ Go ♫ 

471
00:44:20,864 --> 00:44:22,880
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

472
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,008
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

473
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:32,992
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

474
00:44:32,992 --> 00:44:36,960
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

475
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,976
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

476
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:47,296
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

477
00:44:47,296 --> 00:44:50,880
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

478
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,960
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

479
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,721
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

480
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:06,968
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

481
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,805
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

482
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:14,761
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

483
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:16,928
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

484
00:45:16,928 --> 00:45:21,728
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

485
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:23,872
 ♫ But why ♫ 

486
00:45:23,872 --> 00:45:27,392
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

487
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:32,445
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
