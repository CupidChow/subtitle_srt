1
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:11,845
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,459
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,244
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:20,773
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:25,925
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:31,173
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:34,661
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:38,125
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:42,757
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:49,029
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:53,765
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,845
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,845 --> 00:01:01,029
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:03,045
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:06,013
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,909
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,237
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,292
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,269
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:20,284
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,743
 

22
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:38,701
I just feel a little dizzy
because of a blood pressure spike.

23
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,861
No need to worry about me.

24
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:43,901
We're worried because you're so important to us.

25
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,821
When Ba Dou comes back,
I'll tell him I want to be discharged.

26
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:47,821
Fine.

27
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:52,921
When my leg was broken, I rested in bed
for two months. I've had enough of that.

28
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,221
Nobody makes you stay in bed.

29
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,712
You can get up and walk around.

30
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:06,481
Don't think I won't. I'm leaving here.
I'll see who dares stop me.

31
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:09,461
Grandma, stop it.

32
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:12,401
It's the middle of the night. Aren't you tired?

33
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:17,101
- Grandma.
- Grandma.

34
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,101
- I feel dizzy.
- Sit down.

35
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,221
I feel dizzy.

36
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,481
Slow down.

37
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,181
What did the doctor say?

38
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:40,401
I don't have many days left, right?

39
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,121
What nonsense!

40
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:57,901
Stop acting. You're my grandson.

41
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:02,841
Looking at your eyes,
I can tell you're happy or not.

42
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:06,381
I know my own body best.

43
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:12,581
I originally thought

44
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,401
to keep it hidden a bit longer.

45
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,021
You knew all along?

46
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:21,621
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

47
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,901
Come on. Don't give me that look now.

48
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:44,781
Do it when I'm really dead.
I won't be around to see it, anyway.

49
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,841
Both of you leave. I'm sleeping.

50
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,701
Why did you come out?

51
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,576
It's cold outside.

52
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:28,641
Why are you sitting out here alone?

53
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:30,521
Can you keep me company?

54
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,416
Sure.

55
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,504
Li Jin Yu.

56
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,861
You can discuss anything with me.

57
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:48,981
No need to pretend to be strong.

58
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,704
I'm fine.

59
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:00,001
What are you thinking now?

60
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:03,136
I don't know.

61
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,781
Actually,

62
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:13,861
when I was young, I didn't remember much
about my grandma, and we were not close.

63
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,861
I just knew

64
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:18,701
she was hot-tempered.

65
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,801
Later,

66
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,881
my dad died in a car accident.

67
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:34,761
 If I hadn't driven up the mountain back then, 

68
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:39,161
 we wouldn't have hit the car coming
in the other direction. 

69
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,061
 Leave! 

70
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,736
 Dad! 

71
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,761
 I've never been able to forgive myself. 

72
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:03,841
 She appeared in my life 

73
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:07,021
 like a heroine. 

74
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:10,176
 She traveled for over ten hours 

75
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:12,501
by train,

76
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,401
traveling from Ningsui to Jiangbei

77
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:19,741
just to rescue me from Li Ling Bai.

78
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:23,621
Without her,

79
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:26,441
I would've died in Jiangbei long ago.

80
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:34,281
But I was immature back then.

81
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:36,421
I didn't trust anyone.

82
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:41,161
Our interaction pattern was

83
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:43,201
that I stayed silent,

84
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:47,081
while she kept nagging.

85
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,401
So, I became even quieter.

86
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,141
Can you imagine that scene?

87
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,721
I can imagine it.

88
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:58,401
Grandma thought she brought a lively boy.

89
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:01,001
However, you were so quiet.

90
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:05,521
At that time,

91
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,941
you were not used to this place.

92
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:12,821
It's not just that.

93
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:16,928
I also hated this place.

94
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,121
The neighbors were overly friendly.

95
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:25,201
Grandma has a hot temper.

96
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,501
Back then, I kept thinking

97
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,321
that before long,

98
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:33,281
she would drive me away.

99
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,821
 Until one day, I discovered 

100
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,421
 she was actually packing my things. 

101
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:43,421
 So the next day, I left. 

102
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:48,001
 I didn't want to be abandoned again. 

103
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,561
 Why are you following me? 

104
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:10,201
 Nobody wants me, and I can't afford to keep you. 

105
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,336
 Ba Dou. 

106
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:30,001
 That was the second time I had seen someone 

107
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:33,761
 who was so anxious about me. 

108
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,941
 My dad was the first one
to give me that anxious look. 

109
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:39,121
 Where have you been? 

110
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,472
 Let's go home. 

111
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,792
 Come on. 

112
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:55,501
 That night, she gave me a beating. 

113
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,901
 She dragged me home by the collar. 

114
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,621
 And a dog came back with us. 

115
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,301
Later, I found out

116
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:10,721
that she packed my things
because she'd asked the village

117
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:13,621
to build me a separate house in the courtyard.

118
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,741
She wanted me to have my own home,

119
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:21,561
so I'd never again be left with nowhere to go.

120
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:28,321
Was that dog Ping An?

121
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:34,621
Grandma wants you safe and sound.

122
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,480
She loves you.

123
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:42,321
She was pretty energetic

124
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:46,941
and could chase me upstairs
with a duster in her hand.

125
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:50,521
But now, she has to stay in the hospital.

126
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,472
Ye Meng.

127
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,821
I don't think I can accept this.

128
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:00,241
If she really leaves me,

129
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:03,601
I'll truly have no family left.

130
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,041
Jin Yu.

131
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,901
You have me.

132
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:15,301
I'll always stay with you.

133
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:57,021
Ba Dou, I want chicken wings and milk tea.

134
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:59,584
Mom.

135
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:06,912
Why are you here?

136
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:10,021
I heard you were sick, so I came to check on you.

137
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:14,021
You came to see if I've
kicked the bucket? Just wait.

138
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:20,741
Mom, I didn't mean that.

139
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:22,401
I just heard about your illness,

140
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:25,921
so I got you the best medical team in Jiangbei.

141
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:30,761
If you want, I'll take you there this afternoon.

142
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:33,101
Don't worry about the money.

143
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:36,221
No need. I have health insurance.

144
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:38,901
My grandson already has everything you can offer.

145
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:41,621
I just don't understand why you came here.

146
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:43,601
Get out.

147
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:48,521
He's not your grandson. He's an outsider.

148
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,741
Outsider?

149
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,801
That's my good grandson.

150
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,261
You're the outsider.

151
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:59,081
Your real grandson is Zhuo Feng, not Li Jin Yu.

152
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,621
Zhuo Feng has been ill for so long.

153
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:13,661
As his grandma, did you ever care?

154
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:23,261
Don't forget how your son died

155
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:25,901
and how my husband died.

156
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,641
My son's death has nothing to do with Ba Dou!

157
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:31,081
- Who says it doesn't?
- You just blame him!

158
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:48,021
Leave now.

159
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:49,824
Get out.

160
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:59,801
I'm warning you. Do not hurt him again.

161
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:02,481
Otherwise, I'll haunt you even after death.

162
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:12,481
When your real grandson Zhuo Feng gets better,

163
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,021
I'll bring him to visit you.

164
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,776
Close the door.

165
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:37,101
Ms. Li, that old woman is so ungrateful.
When have you ever endured this?

166
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:39,081
I think you shouldn't have...

167
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:44,601
My family matters are none of your business!

168
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,928
She's my mother-in-law.

169
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,901
My husband's mom.

170
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,961
Zhuo Feng's grandma.

171
00:13:57,141 --> 00:14:03,401
If you have free time,
prepare for Hailan Bay's opening.

172
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:06,181
Understood, Ms. Li. I'll handle it immediately.

173
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,221
Hello?

174
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:24,221
 Ba Dou, where are you?
Cousin and aunt came to visit Grandma. 

175
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:26,441
Okay, got it.

176
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:47,801
Enough! It's just a surgery. What's there to fear?

177
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:50,341
Don't give me conservative treatment.

178
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:51,801
That's unacceptable.

179
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,621
Haven't you considered how old you are now?

180
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:56,021
When have I ever backed down?

181
00:14:56,021 --> 00:15:01,141
I won't wait passively to die. I'll risk it.
Even if I lose the bet, it's worth trying.

182
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:04,521
I'll inform Ba Dou of my decision later.

183
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,561
Ba Dou understands me best.

184
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,761
Listen,

185
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:10,401
at your age, why take that surgical risk?

186
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:14,421
- What if...?
- Okay, Grandma will have the surgery.

187
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:19,861
I told you. My grandson understands me best.

188
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:22,761
Jin Yu, are you serious?

189
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,501
What if the surgery fails?

190
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:27,321
Exactly! You're insane!

191
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,861
Let's go.

192
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:31,921
Think twice about it.

193
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,341
Go.

194
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:35,561
Jin Yu, talk sense into her.

195
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,361
Wait for me.

196
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:43,321
Alright, lie down and rest.

197
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:53,921
I've decided.

198
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:58,441
Before the surgery,
both of you will go somewhere with me.

199
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:03,641
Even if I don't survive the operation,

200
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,221
I'll have no regrets.

201
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:08,841
Come on, Grandma! You'll be perfectly fine.

202
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,576
Hurry.

203
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,621
- We're home.
- Slow down.

204
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:28,901
Slow down, Grandma.

205
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,720
Alright.

206
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,901
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

207
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,741
- This door is so heavy.
- Hurry!

208
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:38,021
Coming.

209
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:39,501
Grandma, slow down.

210
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:41,441
Grandma.

211
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:49,401
I am back!

212
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,201
Grandma is full of energy.

213
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:59,561
- Go open the door.
- Okay.

214
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,621
Put the stuff away quickly.

215
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,281
I'll take you two up the mountain

216
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:05,661
- to pick tea leaves.
- Mrs. Tou is back!

217
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:15,801
Grandma.

218
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,101
Hurry up!

219
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:19,921
- Your stamina is impressive.
- Come on.

220
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:22,801
You're as vigorous as ever.
You're amazing, Grandma.

221
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:25,721
Very impressive.

222
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:30,041
You two walk so slowly, even with long legs.

223
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,861
You lack exercise. Come on.

224
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:37,920
- The tea garden is so far.
- Come on.

225
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,921
- Careful.
- Okay.

226
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:43,181
Alright.

227
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:49,421
Okay, got it.

228
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:55,621
Grandma.

229
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,440
What are you writing?

230
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:00,281
No peeking!

231
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:03,901
Li Jin Yu, don't try to
figure out women's secrets.

232
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:05,921
Okay.

233
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:11,441
Sure. Guess what? Women have secrets.

234
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:14,141
- Okay.
- Oh no. Grandma has a secret.

235
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,341
Ba Dou.

236
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:27,101
Be gentle with that.

237
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:29,281
Listen carefully, child.

238
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:34,341
The tea leaves are alive with vitality.

239
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:38,641
Those tiny buds seem fragile in winter,

240
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:43,341
but when spring comes, they'll sprout right open!

241
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:47,401
Come on. Look at me.

242
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:51,201
Grandma, we must come back together

243
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:53,001
to see new buds growing.

244
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,581
Grandma.

245
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:55,840
- Keep your word.
- Sure.

246
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,781
- Good.
- Pinky swear.

247
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:59,061
Li Ba Dou.

248
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:00,541
Count me in!

249
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,201
Deal. Do your work now.

250
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,761
Come on.

251
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:13,201
- Help me pick up fresh leaves.
- Got it.

252
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:17,161
Hurry up! No dilly-dallying.

253
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:18,241
Okay.

254
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,501
Is this enough?

255
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,581
I think so.

256
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:23,101
Grandma, it's enough for a pot of tea.

257
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:26,401
I'll make tea for you.
I've known how since childhood.

258
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:30,861
Alright. I'll show you how I make tea tonight.

259
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:33,581
I will also cook dishes I loved when I was young.

260
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:35,781
Let's go back right now.

261
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:37,941
Keep picking up tea leaves.

262
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:41,901
You fail to escape it, huh?

263
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:44,821
Grandma, I'm tired.

264
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,656
Do your work.

265
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:49,696
I'm tired.

266
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,521
Do it a little longer.

267
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:55,901
Fine. I'll get serious now.

268
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,901
Okay.

269
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,961
Show us.

270
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,621
- I'll have a break.
- You keep working.

271
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,104
Show us now.

272
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:14,861
Like this, see?

273
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,664
Well, let me see.

274
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:19,681
I know lots of impressive skills.

275
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:21,201
Then you teach me how to make tea.

276
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:23,001
Just make it with hot water.

277
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,901
- Like making instant coffee?
- You're talking nonsense.

278
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,581
Stop talking. If Grandma
hears this, we're done for.

279
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:30,400
Fine.

280
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:34,641
If we keep sunbathing like this,
we'll turn into black potatoes.

281
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:36,621
No. You're still fair.

282
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:39,441
- You're fair.
- You're lying.

283
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:42,721
We're still fair-skinned.

284
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,640
Hurry!

285
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:57,441
Be careful!

286
00:20:57,441 --> 00:21:00,301
Grandma, you should rest. Let Li Jin Yu do it.

287
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,341
Him? He probably learned how to cook online.

288
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,341
Can you cook what I loved as a child?

289
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:08,901
I told you I would cook for you two tonight.

290
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:09,961
Okay.

291
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,541
- Ba Dou, lift that lid.
- Be careful.

292
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,181
- Meng, pour in the oil.
- Got it.

293
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:22,901
- Ba Dou.
- Be careful.

294
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,141
Come slice this.

295
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:26,161
You cut.

296
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,161
- Make them thin.
- Okay.

297
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,984
Done.

298
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:38,041
Be careful!

299
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,821
Meng. Taste it quickly.

300
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:55,201
Grandma, you try first
and see if it's the taste of your favorite food.

301
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:58,240
- I'll try it first then.
- Go ahead.

302
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,128
Well?

303
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,541
It's the taste.

304
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,381
- Try it.
- Okay.

305
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:07,901
Let me get you some.

306
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:09,728
This is big.

307
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,952
How is it?

308
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,721
Just so-so.

309
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:20,441
Seems like the taste you loved isn't that special.

310
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:22,001
The cooking timing isn't right either.

311
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:25,201
How about I make you what I liked
when I was little?

312
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:28,301
Li Jin Yu, you shut up. You don't need to do that.

313
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:30,481
I think Grandma's favorite food is the best.

314
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,821
These dishes are delicious!

315
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:33,701
You think so?

316
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:37,821
Just wait. We'll deal with you after the dinner.

317
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:41,161
We'll give him a beating
and see how he handles this.

318
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:42,781
Sure.

319
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:44,861
Are you trying to kill your husband?

320
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:46,464
Grandma.

321
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,681
- You hit me?
- No.

322
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:49,961
- Apologize!
- I'm sorry.

323
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,241
Good. Feed her properly.

324
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:56,901
You like it? Here.

325
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:58,821
Feed me.

326
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:00,800
Here you go.

327
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:06,341
- Delicious.
- Ba Dou, eat more.

328
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,801
Meng, you eat too.

329
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,664
Grandma.

330
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,736
Eat more.

331
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,901
Why aren't you eating? Here. Open your mouth.

332
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,161
I'm eating.

333
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:19,961
Didn't you say it's delicious? You like it.

334
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:22,944
- Give it to me.
- Okay. Here.

335
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:30,400
This darn phone.

336
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,256
I'm hungry.

337
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:47,901
What is this darn place? Why is there no signal?

338
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,901
So hungry.

339
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:23,341
What are you doing here? You scared me!

340
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:27,641
You really frightened me.
Aren't you sleeping at this hour?

341
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:32,241
I can't sleep, so I'm walking around.

342
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:34,001
Walking around?

343
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:36,141
What are you doing?

344
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,901
Nothing.

345
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:40,141
- What exactly are you hiding?
- No, I'm not.

346
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:41,401
Ordering take-out?

347
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:42,481
You're hungry.

348
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,681
You're hungry.

349
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:48,096
I realized that the food I love

350
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:50,721
- couldn't fill me up.
- I know.

351
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:55,001
The moment I lie down, I feel starved.

352
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,401
Have you ordered food yet?

353
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:58,721
- I can't get cell reception.
- Me neither.

354
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:01,401
- Stand here.
- Will this work?

355
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:02,781
Let me check.

356
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,141
It fails.

357
00:25:04,141 --> 00:25:06,401
Move around.

358
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:08,681
Got signal! I'll order for you.

359
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,381
- Fried chicken steak.
- Got it.

360
00:25:10,381 --> 00:25:12,781
- Five portions.
- Too many. That's indigestible.

361
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:13,888
- Not too many.
- No way.

362
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,201
- No fried chicken.
- Milk tea.

363
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:17,061
How about barbecue?

364
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:18,781
- Order some skewers too.
- Okay.

365
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:20,480
- No fried chicken available. Barbecue is okay.
- Okay.

366
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,001
- I'll get you chicken wings.
- Don't.

367
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,832
What are you two doing here?

368
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:36,921
Don't tell me you're still reminiscing
about childhood flavors?

369
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:39,401
Yes.

370
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:41,821
Meng said she's hungry.

371
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:45,201
Grandma, how could you sell me out?

372
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:48,201
Didn't you say you're hungry?

373
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:50,641
Look, I just came out for a walk.

374
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:53,001
She wants to order food. She is hungry.

375
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,821
Right, I'm the hungry one. I'm hungry.

376
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,901
- You admit it.
- Yes.

377
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:00,141
Listen, I'm literally starving.

378
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,341
Can you get me some food?

379
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:04,681
Grandma, you are taking a walk, right?

380
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:06,681
- You're not hungry, right?
- Yeah.

381
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:09,061
I'm hungry. Please get me some food.

382
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:10,141
What do you want?

383
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:12,241
Grilled fish, roasted sweet potato, and milk tea.

384
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:14,481
Wait, you're not hungry, right?
You won't eat anything.

385
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:16,201
I don't like that food. I want something else.

386
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:20,576
I'm afraid you two can't finish it all.
I'll just eat a bit.

387
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:22,141
- Fine.
- Come on, Grandma.

388
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:24,201
Alright. You two wait for a while.

389
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:26,641
Ba Dou. Thank you.

390
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:30,441
That's not cool. You just sold me out like that?

391
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:32,901
Look how good Ba Dou is.

392
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,121
Go wait by the door.

393
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:37,501
I can't believe you.

394
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:46,341
Why haven't you two started eating?

395
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:48,128
- We are waiting for you.
- No need.

396
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:50,201
Here, try the milk tea I made.

397
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:51,721
Thank you, honey.

398
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:54,481
You finally know I'm your honey.

399
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,821
- Join us.
- Join us.

400
00:26:56,821 --> 00:27:00,441
I really can't eat anything. I overate at dinner.

401
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:04,541
It's getting cold. Let me get you another quilt.

402
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,821
There's more if needed.

403
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:08,481
- Thanks, honey.
- Thanks.

404
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:18,848
Delicious.

405
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:36,541
 I went to Jiangbei and brought that child back. 

406
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:40,961
 He has suffered a lot. 

407
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:47,341
 Had I been any later, he would've been ruined. 

408
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,201
 Fortunately... 

409
00:27:56,721 --> 00:28:02,001
 Today, he scared me to death! 

410
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:09,061
 He thought I abandoned him.
He actually ran away alone. 

411
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:13,621
 His dad said he was pretty clever. 

412
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:16,001
 But I think he's quite foolish. 

413
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:20,721
 He's my grandson. 

414
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:23,621
 This is his home. 

415
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:31,281
 He likes that dog so much. I'll name it Ping An. 

416
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:35,801
 I wish him peace and good luck. 

417
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:47,781
 My grandma raised me too. 

418
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:53,001
 We depended on the tea garden. 

419
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:55,301
 When I was very little, 

420
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:59,341
 I started to pick tea leaves
with my grandma on the mountain. 

421
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,621
 She told me 

422
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:08,001
 that the tea leaves looked different
in different seasons. 

423
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,401
 Just like people. 

424
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:16,241
 But after saying that, my grandma passed away. 

425
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:20,401
 I was only about ten years old back then. 

426
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:26,421
 I never imagined that Grandma would leave me. 

427
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:29,701
 How time flies! 

428
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:34,701
 I'll leave Ba Dou soon. 

429
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:43,001
 Thankfully, I have time to prepare for goodbyes. 

430
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:47,584
 It's funny. 

431
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:50,621
 Though I act tough, 

432
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:55,541
 I'm actually terrified. 

433
00:29:55,541 --> 00:30:00,041
 Thinking about this, I can't sleep at night. 

434
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:05,001
 I've cried secretly. 

435
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:10,421
 But I can't let Ba Dou see my fear. 

436
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:15,721
 He has already suffered enough. 

437
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:20,001
 I can't burden him further. 

438
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:25,421
 They say bad people live longest. 

439
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:31,481
 Should I start doing bad things now?
Is it too late? 

440
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:40,928
 I hope to live long enough
to see Ba Dou marry Meng. 

441
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:46,701
 Last night, I dreamed they got married. 

442
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:50,741
 I felt so happy. 

443
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:07,201
 If Ba Dou finds happiness, I can rest easy. 

444
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:58,101
Grandma, are you asleep?

445
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:01,141
Meng.

446
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:02,641
You're still awake.

447
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:04,512
Come in.

448
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:11,061
Grandma.

449
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:13,401
I want to sleep with you tonight.

450
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,328
Okay.

451
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:21,301
I never told you before

452
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:24,201
that I really admire you.

453
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:29,401
You went to Jiangbei
to take Li Jin Yu away from his mom.

454
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:32,901
You have the courage to face life and death
with laughter and grace.

455
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:35,661
I think you're remarkable.

456
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:44,921
It takes courage to live, not to die.

457
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:49,141
At my age, I've been through a lot.

458
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:56,001
But I can't stop worrying about Ba Dou.

459
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:59,552
Please.

460
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:03,341
Take care of Ba Dou.

461
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:08,401
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked about this.

462
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:09,621
It's okay.

463
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,301
Let's sleep now.

464
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:13,441
Don't worry.

465
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,721
Let's sleep now.

466
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:27,001
I'll put this sweater on you.
It even has little flowers.

467
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:31,621
Alright. Cover up and sleep.

468
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:36,721
- Lights out?
- Okay.

469
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:48,101
- Your hands are so cold.
- I'm not cold.

470
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,681
It's okay.

471
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,761
Grandma.

472
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:03,861
- Everything will work out smoothly.
- Sure.

473
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:11,781
- One, two, three.
- Did you take the flowers?

474
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:14,621
Sure. Don't prick your hands.

475
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:16,621
- Let me take a close-up.
- Again.

476
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,141
Get closer. Closer shot.

477
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,301
Okay. One, two, three!

478
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:23,061
- Take the flowers.
- One, two, three!

479
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,441
The flower!

480
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:26,481
Look at this!

481
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,781
- Edit this properly for me.
- Deal.

482
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:30,861
Make my face look smaller.

483
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,341
You're already thin enough.
You want to be thinner?

484
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:34,401
- Make it look good.
- Got it.

485
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:36,061
Keep all the photos.

486
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:37,301
Make my skin whiter too.

487
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:39,341
Fine.

488
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:44,721
Who're you messaging secretly?

489
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:45,861
I'll tell Meng.

490
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:48,621
No! Listen to me.

491
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:51,481
Go ahead.

492
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:53,861
Come on.

493
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:59,441
I plan to hold a wedding for Ye Meng.

494
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:07,201
Why that face? Isn't this your biggest wish?

495
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,801
You read my diary!

496
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:21,241
You peek at my phone,
but I can't glance at your diary?

497
00:35:21,241 --> 00:35:25,101
- Stop arguing. I'm telling Meng.
- Stop it.

498
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:28,781
I stumbled upon it accidentally. I didn't mean to.

499
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:35,141
Besides, your diary is scrawled,
full of wrong characters. I don't like reading it.

500
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:39,821
What do we do then?

501
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:42,521
I'll return to Ningsui first to prepare the venue.

502
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:46,721
You keep her occupied. Don't let her find out.

503
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:51,001
What are you two doing there?

504
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,441
Come on. Are you done editing?

505
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:55,221
Done.

506
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,261
Save them all.

507
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:58,861
I was telling Grandma
that something urgent came up at the company.

508
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:01,121
We might need to return early.

509
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:03,861
Meng and I aren't going back with you, right?

510
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,701
Sure. I'll stay here with Grandma.

511
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:08,441
- You may go.
- Alright.

512
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:09,441
You're leaving alone.

513
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:11,821
- Let's shoot over there.
- Got it.

514
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:14,081
- Take good care of Grandma.
- Don't worry.

515
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:17,101
- Hurry up.
- Coming!

516
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:19,776
Here.

517
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,701
Sweetheart, don't worry.

518
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:26,521
Your wedding with Meng has already been prepared.

519
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,601
- Come on.
- Calm down.

520
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:31,201
I've recently started selling a new wine.

521
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:33,701
Did you order it yet? No?

522
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:35,521
- Alright?
- Fine.

523
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:37,001
Let me tell you.

524
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:39,744
Getting married? It is way too sudden!

525
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:43,441
I'm now redecorating.
But I'll send workers to help you.

526
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:45,921
You can trust me. Leave it to me.

527
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:49,661
Ya En is the bridesmaid, right?

528
00:36:49,661 --> 00:36:52,121
Stop nagging. Everything's ready for you.

529
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,821
I'll have Jia Yu be a flower boy.

530
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:57,721
No worries. I'll find a wedding host.
It's a piece of cake.

531
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,661
Work faster.

532
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:12,441
Grandma, we've been doing this for a long time.

533
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:15,701
Let Li Ba Dou do it. I'll call him.

534
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:18,601
Why should he get to slack off?

535
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:22,701
Come on. Stop it.

536
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:27,661
Listen, let me tell you a story
about my childhood.

537
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:33,481
When I was barely five, I dashed straight here.

538
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:36,081
I knew this path pretty well.

539
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:40,341
I kept picking tea leaves until noon.

540
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:44,441
Listen, I never wanted to bring Ba Dou here.

541
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:49,561
But my legs are sore. My feet hurt, Grandma.

542
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:54,601
You have beautiful, long legs. Keep going.

543
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:55,904
Your legs are better now.

544
00:37:55,904 --> 00:37:57,441
When they weren't,

545
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,584
I covered for you every day.

546
00:37:59,584 --> 00:38:01,301
Now, you've forgotten my kindness.

547
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:03,401
What are you talking about?

548
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:06,521
Since I don't have much time to live,
it's normal to forget something.

549
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:09,021
Don't say something like that.

550
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,121
Speaking.

551
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:17,001
 All set. Just waiting for you two to return. 

552
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:19,661
Stop rushing me. Hang up!

553
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:27,441
My back aches.

554
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:28,481
Sore back?

555
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:30,541
No more work. Let's go.

556
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,441
- Careful!
- Go.

557
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:35,361
What? Don't hurt your back.

558
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,801
You're so mischievous. Slow down!

559
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:52,281
Quick! Grab the luggage.

560
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:56,041
Come on.

561
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:57,821
You're acting strange.

562
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,261
Didn't you have fun at the tea garden?
Why the rush to come back?

563
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:02,701
We've visited my hometown, anyway.
I got bored after two days there.

564
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:04,701
Coming home. I will make your favorite dishes.

565
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:08,381
Alright, thank you, sir.

566
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:13,661
Put them there.
Just leave them arranged like that.

567
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:15,821
Since when did our home have so many flowers?

568
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:19,661
- It's a big day!
- Grandma.

569
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:26,761
Happy wedding!

570
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,081
Well, do you like it?

571
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:55,840
Isn't this like the courtyard you imagined?

572
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:05,141
Before, you always came to me first.

573
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:10,501
Now, let me take the final step.

574
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:18,081
Save whatever you want to say for later.

575
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:21,001
Our bride needs to get ready now.
We shouldn't miss the auspicious hour.

576
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,441
What does that mean?

577
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:24,041
Come on.

578
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,961
- Ju Hua, come here.
- Go get changed.

579
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:27,221
- What's happening?
- Come on.

580
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:32,301
You play a role in today's occasion.
I'll help you with your makeup.

581
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,381
- No need.
- Why not?

582
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:37,081
It's your grandson's big day!

583
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:39,701
- Come on.
- Okay.

584
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:46,261
Meng, put lipstick on.

585
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:48,221
What's this called? Lip gloss.

586
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:50,048
Again.

587
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:55,101
Don't laugh. You'll smudge the makeup.

588
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:00,601
- Done.
- Really?

589
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,528
Sure. Look in a mirror.

590
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:07,821
Absolutely stunning! Is that really me?

591
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:12,601
Of course, it's you!
Are you shocked by your own beauty?

592
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:18,221
Sure, I am. I barely wore makeup in my whole life.

593
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:24,921
Let me tell you,
though I always teased you before,

594
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:29,821
honestly, you're the most energetic
elderly lady I've ever met.

595
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,776
I know.

596
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:34,861
You're beautiful without makeup.

597
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:39,241
Look how stunning you are with makeup.

598
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:43,821
Mei Lan, you're acting weird.

599
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:46,701
This is the first time
you've complimented me like this.

600
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:49,001
Our families had conflicts.

601
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:52,001
- I occupied a little bit of your place.
- Don't mention it again.

602
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:56,701
- Let the past just be the past.
- Okay.

603
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,521
You know what? I have an idea.

604
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:00,601
Now that our families are related by marriage,

605
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:05,521
why don't we knock down that wall,
connecting our homes?

606
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:06,861
Good idea.

607
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:07,901
Deal!

608
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,601
Deal!

609
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,921
Don't mention the past again.

610
00:42:11,921 --> 00:42:13,301
Never again.

611
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:17,541
Oh, by the way, I brought something for you.

612
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,521
What?

613
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:22,400
Look.

614
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,041
Meng's parents.

615
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,821
Look who this is.

616
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:31,921
Meng?

617
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:35,001
This is a photo of Meng
at the age of three months.

618
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:38,481
Look at Meng. She's been a beauty since childhood.

619
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:41,741
Look again. This was when she graduated
from elementary school.

620
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:45,121
What a pity. Ba Dou has never
liked taking photos since childhood.

621
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:49,261
I have no photos to help me reminisce.
It's really regrettable.

622
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:52,121
Don't worry. Leave this task to me.

623
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:55,221
From now on, I'll often take pictures of them

624
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:57,341
and then give you all the photos.

625
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,661
- Get each of us a big album.
- Sure.

626
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,561
Ba Dou will pay for the albums.

627
00:43:01,561 --> 00:43:03,001
You old miser.

628
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:05,081
- Look at this hat. Doesn't it look like mine?
- Sure.

629
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:08,001
- Same style.
- It's funny.

630
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:11,221
Do you know what this hat
is called? This is a beret.

631
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,621
- Look.
- Look at her.

632
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:18,701
Doesn't she look like me?
Doesn't she look like Grandma?

633
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:46,824
 ♫ You ♫ 

634
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,000
