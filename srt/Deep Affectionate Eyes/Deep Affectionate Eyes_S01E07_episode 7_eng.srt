 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:11,716
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

3
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:15,330
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,615
 ♫ With a sense of excitement You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:25,796
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:31,144
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:34,632
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:38,196
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:42,828
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:48,800
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,936
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,936 --> 00:01:01,116
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

13
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:05,916
 ♫ All I possess is drowned The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

14
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:11,280
 ♫ Has never changed If miracles could exist ♫ 

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,263
 ♫ Promises would be kept Please remember ♫ 

16
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:20,355
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

17
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:27,016
Deep Affectionate Eyes

18
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:29,900
 

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:38,670



20
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,544
Hello? Is anyone there?

21
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:43,244
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

22
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:45,464
- Are you Jiang?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:47,924
I'm Ye Meng, a friend of Cheng Kai Ran.

24
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:51,020
I see. Then we're family here. Sit.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,144
I'd like to ask about an antique.
Have you seen this thumb ring?

26
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:10,444
This wasn't sold here, but it looks familiar.

27
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:17,928
I remember now. A few years ago,

28
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:22,164
a middle-aged man came to me
to appraise this thumb ring.

29
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:26,064
It was top-quality. So I made several offers.

30
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:29,204
But he wouldn't sell it.

31
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:33,964
Do you know his name
or have his contact information?

32
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:39,624
Sorry, I only knew that he wasn't local
and was on a business trip from Jiangbei.

33
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,124
It's okay. Could you add me on WeChat?

34
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,570
- Alright.
- Text me if you recall anything.

35
00:02:50,284 --> 00:02:53,544
- Okay. Don't mention it.
- Thank you. Sorry for the trouble. See you.

36
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:55,264
- Alright. 
- Okay. Thanks.

37
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:57,644
- Bye. 
- Bye.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,604
Could that seller be the man
who visited my mom years ago?

39
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:14,564
There is a chance. Here's what we'll do.

40
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll ask my friends in Jiangbei to ask around.

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,724
I'll also contact my friend there.

42
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:25,024
Your "friend" in Jiangbei? Your ex-boss?

43
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:28,864
No. Tai Ming Xiao, my former colleague.

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,900
You sound strange. Are you jealous?

45
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,404
Why would I be jealous?

46
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:37,964
Good that you're not.

47
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:43,164
After all, he's been
my handsome and kind partner for years.

48
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:46,084
There's nothing I can do even if you're jealous.

49
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:47,544
What kind of partner is he?

50
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:51,004
Tai Ming Xiao? My late-night snack buddy.

51
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,600
Sounds like you had a lot of fun in Jiangbei.
You even had a "partner".

52
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:01,284
Just admit you're jealous.
Longing for a relationship isn't shameful.

53
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,744
I said I'm not jealous.

54
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,644
Really?

55
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:10,684
After the Spring Festival comes spring.

56
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:14,444
Even Ping An is going out,
looking for girlfriends every day.

57
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,444
Do you really want to stay single forever?

58
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:20,904
Maybe Ping An is going out to find me a job.

59
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:27,004
I don't believe it. Let's bet.
He's definitely looking for a girlfriend.

60
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:29,664
Ping An can't talk. How do we bet?

61
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:31,264
I have an idea.

62
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
Done.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,400
You really stoop to anything to win.

64
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,484
You even installed a dashcam on Ping An.

65
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:50,484
Never underestimate a woman's competitiveness
and her desire to conquer.

66
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,064
What's the wager?

67
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:59,884
If you lose, admit you were jealous earlier

68
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,844
and that you want a relationship.

69
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,934
Deal.

70
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:08,504
Poor Ping An,

71
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:10,484
getting monitored while dating.

72
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:13,304
Remember to blur his girlfriend's face.

73
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:15,404
You're already giving up, young man?

74
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:18,724
What if Ping An really is job-hunting?

75
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,044
Do you have a problem with me today?

76
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:28,164
No, it just amuses me to tease you.

77
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:35,784
Your ears look so red.

78
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:38,324
It's from the cold.

79
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:40,784
Cold? I'm wearing shorts and I'm fine.

80
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,464
So much vanity.

81
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:45,524
- How does this thing work? 
 - I don't know.

82
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:49,264
Wait, are you trying to weasel out?

83
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:51,260
...

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,344
You're too kind, Mr. Wang.
We'll need your support next year, too.

85
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,664
Happy New Year.

86
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:59,284
I wasn't being kind.

87
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,824
Shut up.

88
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:04,884
Happy New Year, Mr. Li.
Have you received the health supplements?

89
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:06,104
Remember to take them.

90
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,064
No, I haven't. Where did you send them?

91
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:10,944
Work more and talk less. I could've made
twice the dumplings you made.

92
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:14,104
Finish wrapping what's in your hands first.

93
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:16,864
Meng, what filling do you want?

94
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:19,204
Peanut filling.

95
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:21,424
I'm video-calling my dad.

96
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:25,324
Really? Let me see.

97
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:27,604
- Brother.
- Brother.

98
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,404
Dad, did you have dumplings?

99
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:32,124
I'll cook them now. They gave us some at work.

100
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:38,324
Are you the only worker at the bank?
Why are you staying over every Spring Festival?

101
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:40,924
Mom, I won't procrastinate this time.

102
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:44,864
I'll handle the handover after the festival
and we'll meet soon.

103
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:48,384
Really? It's settled then. We'll be waiting.

104
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:51,324
Alright. Meng.

105
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:54,604
I have some things to do.
Take care of your grandma and aunts.

106
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:56,704
- Okay. 
 - Take care of yourself.

107
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:59,464
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

108
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:02,424
- Bye.
- Bye.

109
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:05,284
He's funny. Who's taking care of whom?

110
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:10,084
They're finally showing some humanity
and letting your dad return to his family.

111
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,404
And you should move back, too.

112
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:15,564
We have so many spare rooms at home.

113
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:19,084
The old house is decaying without tenants.

114
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:23,524
Grandma always said that houses need residents.

115
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,244
Did I say that?

116
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:30,484
Grandma, what are you making?
I asked for peanut filling.

117
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:34,444
Right, make her some peanut filling.

118
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,164
We're out of peanut butter.

119
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,364
- Well... 
 - I'll go buy some.

120
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:42,504
You're going? Don't take too long.

121
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,824
Mom, look at her slacking off, doing nothing.

122
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:46,164
Me? Slacking off?

123
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,024
- Hurry up.
- Have you no conscience?

124
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:52,504
You two miss each other when apart,
but fight when you meet.

125
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,644
- How much per jin?
- Ten yuan.

126
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,284
- I'll take two jin then.
- Okay.

127
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:01,284
Give me some extra.

128
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:10,664
What are you doing?

129
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:15,364
I know where you hide your keys now.
I'll sneak in tonight.

130
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:19,044
Why are you here?

131
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:24,944
Putting up couplets. Your house looks bare
without any holiday spirit.

132
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:27,384
- That's unnecessary. 
 - Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:31,604
Come on, tall guy.
Put up the horizontal scroll.

134
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:37,524
Check if these are aligned.

135
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:40,464
- A bit lower. 
 - Lower?

136
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:43,064
- You sure? 
 - Yeah.

137
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:47,884
 

138
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:49,804
What about this one?

139
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:51,944
- A bit to the right.
- Okay.

140
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:54,064
A bit to the left.

141
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:56,364
I've already pasted it.

142
00:08:56,924 --> 00:08:59,264
Fine.

143
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,564
Hello? I just left. Be there in 15 minutes.

144
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:05,864
Keep the good tiles.

145
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:10,284
Don't come over. We're having fun playing mahjong.

146
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,624
- One Bamboo.
- Didn't you ask for dumplings?

147
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:17,544
I had some at the hospital.
We ordered takeout for the celebration.

148
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:22,724
Since you're bored at home,
I arranged something for you.

149
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,964
What did you arrange?

150
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:30,124
Go to Ye Meng's home for the Spring Festival.

151
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:31,844
Here we go. Five Dots.

152
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:35,164
That's it. We're playing mahjong. I'm winning.

153
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:36,964
No need, I...

154
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,484
I took Granny's red envelope.
I'm taking you home by force if needed.

155
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:47,844
Let's get some groceries then.

156
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:49,784
That's what I'm up to.

157
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,964
Self-drawn win.

158
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:56,704
So lucky.

159
00:09:56,704 --> 00:09:59,044
Bed No. 3. Stop playing.

160
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:02,064
I'm back. Are the dumplings ready?

161
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:06,004
Meng, I didn't know we're taking orders.
Where's the peanut butter?

162
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,684
What took you so long?

163
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:13,064
Okay, let's meet after the festival.

164
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:16,504
Goodbye, Mr. Li. We have a guest.

165
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:19,724
Who's this?

166
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:21,664
This is...?

167
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,624
Granny, Auntie, Second Aunt,
Third Aunt, nice to meet you.

168
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,904
Hello.

169
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:30,524
He's my friend. His family's away,
so I brought him here.

170
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:32,524
Welcome.

171
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:37,064
Friend? What kind of friend?

172
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:38,604
Boyfriend?

173
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,664
What do you do?

174
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:43,564
No, just regular friends for now.

175
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:46,844
Be nice, okay? Don't scare him away.

176
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:52,144
Let's welcome Meng's friend. Come with Granny.

177
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:56,964
Come in. What a tall young man.

178
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:58,384
Who is he?

179
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,124
Sister.

180
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:03,100
What do you want?

181
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,384
- Get some water. 
 - Why does he look familiar?

182
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:09,864
- That makes sense. 
 - What do you mean? Where did you meet?

183
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:13,364
- What's your surname? 
 - My surname is Li. Just call me Li.

184
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:14,804
- Li. 
 - Good surname.

185
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:18,244
Many of my wealthy clients have that surname.

186
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,784
- How old are you? 
 - Twenty-seven.

187
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:23,324
Twenty-seven? Two years younger than Meng.

188
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:26,244
That's fine. I like younger men.

189
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:28,124
Boy-crazy.

190
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:30,044
What do you do?

191
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:32,804
I have no stable job. I do a bit of everything.

192
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:37,084
So you're versatile. Good, as long as
you can take care of Meng.

193
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:42,084
Honestly, money isn't important.
As long as you two are happy.

194
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:46,424
Why do you look so familiar?
I think I've seen you somewhere.

195
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:51,464
- Right, Mom? That was what I thought. 
 - You've met before. At the old house.

196
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:55,684
The repairman.

197
00:11:55,684 --> 00:12:00,364
Grandma, I was joking back then.
He's Mrs. Tou's grandson.

198
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:04,024
Remember when our roof was leaking?
He came to help fix it.

199
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,324
You're Tou Ju Hua's grandson?

200
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:08,404
Yes.

201
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:11,624
No wonder you're not coming home.
So you're dating someone.

202
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,524
- Not yet.
- Li.

203
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,724
- What do your parents--
- Do for work?

204
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:23,284
My dad passed away. I live with my grandma now.

205
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,424
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:26,124
It's okay.

207
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:29,984
I'm starving. Are the dumplings ready?

208
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,204
I forgot it...

209
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:34,384
- Weren't you making calls?
- Let me prepare your red envelope.

210
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:36,484
- No need, Granny.
- Let's eat. The New Year is coming.

211
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,284
What's wrong?

212
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:45,844
Well, go ahead and talk. Have some melon seeds.

213
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,924
- Have some peanuts.
- I hope they didn't scare you.

214
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:50,524
Not at all.

215
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:54,324
- Thank you. 
 - Let me peel an orange for you.

216
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:56,124
No need.

217
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:00,636
It's Chinese New Year's Eve.

218
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:03,444
May our new year

219
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:08,724
be filled with togetherness,
smooth sailing, and happiness.

220
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,624
You've worked hard.

221
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,844
Nice dumplings. Try some.

222
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:17,564
It's nice. Have more.

223
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,264
Alright then. Try it.

224
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,624
- I toast you. 
 - I'll drink with you.

225
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:24,424
- Toast to you.
- Mom, I toast to you.

226
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:27,004
That's enough. My plate's already full.

227
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:30,844
- Dig in.
- I've got more here.

228
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,804
Now, I'll be handing out red envelopes.

229
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:35,664
I've been waiting for it.

230
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,844
- Meng.
- What's that got to do with you?

231
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:39,384
Me first.

232
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:42,584
- Everyone gets one. 
 - Starting with the youngest.

233
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:44,804
Let me see.

234
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:31,244
All my family loves good-looking people.
They're just excited to see you.

235
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:35,484
It means that they approve of you, right?

236
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:42,764
Actually, I find your family quite lovely,
completely different from what I imagined.

237
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:48,464
Though I suppose only a family like that
can raise a girl like you.

238
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:51,484
So you've been imagining things.

239
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:55,604
It's cold. Go upstairs.
I'm going to visit my grandma.

240
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,684
Would you like to
set off fireworks with me afterward?

241
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:03,904
I prepared so many fireworks for your birthday.
They're still in the warehouse.

242
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:10,160
We'll see. I'll contact you later.

243
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,904
I'm off.

244
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:19,524
Li Jin Yu.

245
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,324
Happy New Year.

246
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,604
What did you say?

248
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:49,390
I said, Happy New Year. Go up now.

249
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,664
Bye.

250
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:55,624
Bye.

251
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,604
 ♫ You ♫ 

252
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:43,080

 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

260
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:12,564
 He's quite handsome.
But he doesn't have a proper job. 

261
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,244
 Financial stability matters most. I must warn you. 

262
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,244
 Dr. Gao is better than him. Right, sis? 

263
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,944
 Yeah, I find him too withdrawn 

264
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,620
 and complicated. 

265
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,324
 Look how innocent Meng is. 

266
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:27,144
 She will be exhausted. 

267
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:31,872
 I'm right here. I'll get mad
if you keep badmouthing Li Jin Yu.

278
00:18:56,724 --> 00:19:00,664
Come here, son. Happy New Year. Wait.

279
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:05,444
Mom wishes you health, safety, and growing tall.

280
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,964
- Thanks, Mom. I wish you'd make more money.
- Alright.

281
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,244
- And nag me less. 
 - Can't do that.

282
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:13,504
You'd be unrestrained.

283
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:15,804
Have some meat.

284
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:18,304
Put your red envelope away.

285
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:22,324
Who is it on Chinese New Year's Eve? Let me see.

286
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:24,160
Coming.

287
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,940
Who is it?

288
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:31,444
Kai.

289
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:33,484
Happy New Year, Ya En.

290
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:37,784
Happy New Year.
Why aren't you having dinner at home?

291
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:41,224
I was delivering New Year goods to clients
and brought you a share.

292
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:43,404
- Thank you so much. 
 - My pleasure.

293
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:46,164
Here's a red envelope for Jia Yu.

294
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:49,664
- I can't accept this. 
 - Take it for the kid. Come on.

295
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:51,724
Then I'll thank you on Jia Yu's behalf.

296
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,584
Just a small gesture.

297
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:57,084
I didn't know what Jia Yu likes, so I picked this.

298
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,404
You're too kind, Kai.

299
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:02,824
- It's the New Year. 
 - Give it to him yourself.

300
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,124
- Alright. 
 - Let's go.

301
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:10,884
Jia Yu. Look who's here.

302
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:14,284
No need to change shoes. Come on in.

303
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:21,844
Happy New Year, kiddo.

304
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:25,844
Mom, do you owe him money?
Is this uncle here to collect debts?

305
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:31,524
Mind your words. Greet him.
He prepared a red envelope for you.

306
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:33,904
Happy New Year, Uncle.

307
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:36,244
Happy New Year to you, too.

308
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:42,984
This... This is a gift I picked for you.
See if you like it.

309
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:53,736
Thank you, Uncle. This really matches your style.

310
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,964
I like it very much.

311
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,684
Glad you like it.
Tell me if you want any other toys.

312
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:03,144
I'll get you toys until you're 18.

313
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:07,244
No need. Money's hard to earn.
Don't waste your money on me.

314
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:08,804
Mom, I'll put this away.

315
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:10,644
Go ahead.

316
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,744
So clueless.

317
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:16,984
High EQ, huh? He takes after me.

318
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,724
Come on, eat something.

319
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:20,404
I should head back now.

320
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,764
Come on. Have a drink for the New Year.

321
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:26,464
Also, try my cooking.

322
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:29,564
It's a clean glass. Want some beer?

323
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:36,544
You've changed a lot over the years.

324
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:39,444
You've changed way more.

325
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:41,904
My son thought you were a debt collector.

326
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:45,944
Do you know what kids think of you?

327
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:50,484
I'm removing this scar after the festival.

328
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:52,524
You're acting weird.

329
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:58,464
You came to fix your suit. Now, scar removal?

330
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:00,684
You're into someone, huh?

331
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:04,064
No.

332
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:05,844
Really?

333
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:07,244
Really.

334
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,804
You can tell me. I can give you advice.

335
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:11,724
It's a small town. Who would I like?

336
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:13,554
There are so many pretty girls here.

337
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:15,444
I bet someone meets your standards.

338
00:22:15,444 --> 00:22:18,984
I'm not into anyone. I-I should go now.

339
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:21,264
My dad's waiting to cook dumplings.

340
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:24,944
Right, bring Ye Meng
to my shop after the Spring Festival.

341
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:29,264
Eat something first. You haven't had dinner.

342
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,544
This book is for you.

343
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:34,590
 

344
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:39,724
Reciprocity. Knowledge strengthens the mind.

345
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,564
Isn't it strange?

346
00:22:42,564 --> 00:22:47,244
With my low education level, I have such a studious son.

347
00:22:47,244 --> 00:22:50,924
Mom, you married Dad because you lacked education.

348
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:54,664
So I learned from your mistake.

349
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,084
True. Can't argue with that.

350
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:01,964
Kids speak frankly.
I'll read the book and learn from it.

351
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,944
I'm off. Call me if needed.

352
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:06,404
Let me walk you out. Be right back.

353
00:23:06,404 --> 00:23:09,344
- Bye, Uncle. 
 - Goodbye.

354
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,844
- I really like him. 
 - He likes you, too.

355
00:23:11,844 --> 00:23:14,024
- Really?
- Yeah.

356
00:23:14,024 --> 00:23:16,424
I'm off then. Go inside. It's cold.

357
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:18,404
Okay. Take care.

358
00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:20,984
What are you doing here on New Year's Eve?

359
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,744
I should ask you. Why are you here?

360
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:26,204
To see my son.

361
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:29,824
We're still married. Do you have to be so mean?

362
00:23:31,504 --> 00:23:34,004
My regards to your parents.

363
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:35,624
Fine. I'm leaving.

364
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:38,420
- Okay. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

365
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:43,324
A family is supposed to have dinner on New Year's Eve.

366
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:46,524
- What are we having?
- Food is ready.

367
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:49,984
Have you cooked dumplings?

368
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:26,444
 I find him too withdrawn and complicated. 

369
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:29,084
 Look how innocent Meng is. 

370
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,300
 

371
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:51,064
- Hello? 
 -  Hello? 

372
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:52,984
Home yet?

373
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:56,344
Just arrived.

374
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,064
Feeding the fish?

375
00:25:04,824 --> 00:25:10,404
Remember the black goldfish you said resembled me?

376
00:25:10,404 --> 00:25:13,644
Of course. Why?

377
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:18,804
You'll find a partner just like your goldfish did?

378
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:25,604
That fish wasn't black in the first place.
It wasn't cool at all.

379
00:25:29,844 --> 00:25:34,544
It was red, just like the normal goldfish.

380
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:39,544
It turned black because it
developed black spot disease.

381
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:42,604
Black spot disease?

382
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,740
It's a contagious disease.

383
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:55,420
One of the goldfish has been infected.

384
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:01,244
What are you trying to say?

385
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,304
Ye Meng.

386
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:14,044
If you encounter a sick goldfish,

387
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:20,524
the best thing to do is to stay away from it.

388
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:23,144
Don't try to get closer.

389
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:29,984
Because it'll only drag you into the darkness.

390
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:42,604
Your partner shouldn't be someone like me,

391
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:46,420
who can't watch fireworks with you

392
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,960
or celebrate New Year's Eve with your family.

393
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:57,992
 ♫ Oh you, whispering softly ♫

Ye Meng.

410
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:38,780
Li Jin Yu,

411
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,380
I really don't understand.
Why can't you be brave for once?

412
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:47,724
I've taken 99 steps toward you.
I just need you to take one step.

413
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:51,144
I'm going to ditch you. Do you believe me?

 ♫ My love is too obsessive ♫

 ♫ Remember I blazed for you ♫ 

426
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:15,004
The Spring Festival is finally over.
I'm so exhausted.

427
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:18,864
Chen Jian keeps coming over
every other day. So annoying.

428
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:21,904
- What does he want now? 
 - Who knows?

429
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:27,084
He's probably changed his mind because my shop's doing well lately.

430
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,044
Unbelievable.

431
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:34,964
You came here right after the Spring Festival
instead of visiting your neighbor boy?

432
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:37,004
I won't see him again.

433
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:40,644
What happened?

434
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:44,164
I'm tired of pursuing him.

435
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:48,124
But you said things were going well just days ago.

436
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:52,284
He rejected me.

437
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:19,224
Li Jin Yu.

438
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:48,324
You brat. Where is that camera?

439
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:56,690
He rejected you?

440
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,380
A gorgeous, wealthy woman is pursuing him.

441
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:05,244
He should be grateful,
yet he rejected you? This is ridiculous.

442
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:11,764
He said he was afraid of dragging me down
as I try to save him.

443
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,564
He told me to find a better man.

444
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,614
He's even more demanding than a goldfish.

445
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:19,084
You can't be too cold or too warm towards him.

446
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,004
Care for him, and he calls you a do-gooder.

447
00:32:21,004 --> 00:32:24,364
Ignore him, and he'll just wither away quietly.

448
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:26,264
So exhausting.

449
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,804
So what's your plan? Are you giving up?

450
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:34,864
What else can I do? He made himself clear.

451
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:41,424
I totally support you.
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

452
00:32:47,284 --> 00:32:49,484
Speaking of the devil.

453
00:32:55,884 --> 00:33:00,204
He's not here for me. Has he been coming often?

454
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:04,104
I suspect he knows you fell out with Li Jin Yu

455
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:07,988
and wanted to approach you through me.

456
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,684
Maybe he wants to pursue you.

457
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:13,584
- You're crazy. 
 - I'm serious.

458
00:33:18,484 --> 00:33:22,664
Kai, come in.

459
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:25,084
What a small world. Just a second.

460
00:33:25,084 --> 00:33:27,964
- That's it. Talk later. 
 - So awkward.

461
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:31,244
What a coincidence.

462
00:33:31,984 --> 00:33:36,444
I happen to have
an unsweetened hot bubble tea in the car.

463
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:38,144
Thanks.

464
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
- Here's another cup. 
 - Thank you.

465
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,724
What a small world. Why are you both here?

466
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:53,624
Got something to say or not?

467
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:57,104
I guess it's obvious.

468
00:33:58,424 --> 00:34:02,824
By the way, I reinstated Li Jin Yu at work.

469
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:05,484
Why are you telling me this?

470
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:09,484
Didn't you tell me to be magnanimous?

471
00:34:09,484 --> 00:34:11,964
Things have changed.

472
00:34:11,964 --> 00:34:13,504
Did I say that?

473
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:17,760
Besides, I don't have anything
against Li Jin Yu.

474
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,640
We're buddies.

475
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:23,204
Why are you telling me?
What does it have to do with me?

476
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:24,624
It has nothing to do with you.

477
00:34:24,624 --> 00:34:26,184
So why were you looking at me?

478
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:28,424
Can't I glance around? Can't I look at you?

479
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:34,124
Kai, I'm doing my nails today.
Nobody's watching the shop.

480
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:35,824
Ya En.

481
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:41,824
I don't have time to pick up Jia Yu's, either.

482
00:34:44,704 --> 00:34:49,944
You're the best, Kai.
Ye Meng, let's get our nails done.

483
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:51,964
Thank you for the bubble tea.

484
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,304
You're both leaving?

485
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:56,584
Tell you what, he's here for you.

486
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:58,964
Don't try to freak me out in broad daylight.

487
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,664
Seriously.

488
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:14,184
Have this.

489
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:26,844
Let's try that new open-air restaurant
at the night market? Okay.

490
00:35:26,844 --> 00:35:30,324
Dr. Gao, looking sharp. Got a date?

491
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:34,104
Yeah, with the family member
of your former roommate.

492
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:38,604
- Ye Meng? 
 - Yeah. That beautiful lady.

493
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,204
No, it's not a date.

494
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:43,724
I'm asking her for a favor.

495
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,524
Mrs. Tou, let me check your leg.

496
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:49,444
- Does it hurt? 
 - No.

497
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:54,884
Mrs. Tou, your leg has healed.
You can basically go home now.

498
00:35:54,884 --> 00:35:57,284
But make sure to avoid strenuous activities.

499
00:35:57,284 --> 00:36:00,084
Okay, thank you.

500
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:02,224
I'll make my rounds.

501
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:04,264
Go ahead.

502
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:16,004
What's going on with you and Ye Meng?
Why didn't you seize the opportunity?

503
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:20,084
Forget it. The Ye family's different.
Have some fruit.

504
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:23,264
What do you mean?

505
00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:29,124
That fussy old lady looked down on you, huh?

506
00:36:29,124 --> 00:36:32,184
I don't care about that.

507
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:35,364
Look at my precious grandson, so fair and sweet.

508
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:38,144
So young and handsome.

509
00:36:38,144 --> 00:36:39,324
Come on, enough.

510
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:44,364
Just the sight of you makes me happy. So handsome.

511
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:48,260
Now that your leg's healed,
you're getting sentimental, acting like a psychologist.

512
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,872
I'm off.

513
00:36:56,364 --> 00:36:59,724
Alright, let's meet at the restaurant at 7 PM.

514
00:37:00,444 --> 00:37:02,444
- Who is it? 
 - Dr. Gao.

515
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:04,684
Are you dating him?

516
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:08,004
Come on, we're just regular friends.

517
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:12,624
His nephew wants an internship
in Jiangbei. I'm helping out.

518
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:18,224
Aren't romantic relationships
built on mutual help?

519
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:22,244
Since you find Li Jin Yu hard to please,
find someone else.

520
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:24,724
Dr. Gao seems decent.

521
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:26,924
I have no feelings for him.

522
00:37:28,064 --> 00:37:32,804
You just can't let go of Li Jin Yu.
Stop pretending you've moved on.

523
00:37:32,804 --> 00:37:35,934
Here's my advice. If you don't want to give up on him,

524
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:38,724
ask him out for a proper talk.

525
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:41,264
Otherwise, the misunderstandings will remain.

526
00:37:41,264 --> 00:37:43,044
You'll regret it later.

527
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:47,144
Enough about me. Think about yourself.

528
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:50,664
What's there to think about? I've decided.

529
00:37:50,664 --> 00:37:52,884
Men are way more pragmatic than women.

530
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:58,604
I have only one motto now.
Stay away from men, or you'll end up miserable.

531
00:38:07,164 --> 00:38:10,664
- Why did I get it wrong again? 
 - What's wrong, Jia Yu?

532
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:14,764
When will my mom and godmother be back?
I need help with a problem.

533
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:18,204
Why would you wait for them? I can help.

534
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,684
This one.

535
00:38:28,204 --> 00:38:30,864
 
Is this really a 2nd-grade problem?

536
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:36,004
This is for the Olympiad competition.
Don't push yourself if you can't solve it.

537
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:38,164
Come on, I've been good at Olympiad math.

538
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:41,780
There's no problem I can't solve.

539
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:47,064
Well... Let me think...

540
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,824
Got the answer yet?

541
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:53,844
In two minutes.
It requires an unconventional approach.

542
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,934
It's okay if you really can't solve it, Uncle.

543
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:04,544
Nothing's impossible if you're willing to give up.

544
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:08,364
"Nothing's impossible if you try."

545
00:39:08,364 --> 00:39:11,484
- W-Where are you going? 
 - To the bathroom.

546
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:15,464
Fine. I'll tell you the answer once you're back.

547
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:24,664
 

548
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:28,064
What a lame question. I swear I'll...

549
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:41,464
He brought you flowers to ask you for a favor?

550
00:39:42,324 --> 00:39:44,204
Let's go.

551
00:39:44,204 --> 00:39:46,004
Dr. Gao.

552
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:50,904
Ms. Fang, your leg is recovering well.

553
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:55,864
All thanks to you
and the professional medical team.

554
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:57,624
Pretend I'm not here today, Dr. Gao.

555
00:39:57,624 --> 00:40:01,624
I'm just here for free food. Feel free to talk.

556
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:08,124
I didn't know what flowers you'd like
and picked these.

557
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:11,984
That's so nice of you.
I'll do my best to help your niece.

558
00:40:11,984 --> 00:40:13,804
Thank you.

559
00:40:13,804 --> 00:40:15,484
What would you like to order?

560
00:40:15,484 --> 00:40:18,044
Is there anything you'd like?

561
00:40:18,044 --> 00:40:20,484
Some recommendations could help.
We've never been here.

562
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,204
- I'll order for us then. 
 - Okay.

563
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:26,764
- This one.
- Okay.

564
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:28,464
- And the shrimps.
- Alright.

565
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:33,827
 

566
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:38,204
Why are you standing back there?

567
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:51,224
That's why you agreed to meet me.
Ye Meng dumped you?

568
00:40:51,224 --> 00:40:53,764
Didn't you ask to meet me?

569
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:57,784
Oh, come on. Fang Ya En's here, too.

570
00:40:57,784 --> 00:41:01,144
She's here as a friend to vet this guy.

571
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:06,004
That means their relationship's getting serious.

572
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,724
You're in trouble, buddy.

573
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:10,804
Ye Meng's always
favored handsome guys since childhood

574
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,644
and loses interest fast.

575
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:16,884
All her exes played hard-to-get at first.

576
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:20,724
But they'd beg her to stay when she left.

577
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:26,464
You're still too naive.

578
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:31,924
I'm still better than someone
who can't figure out who they like.

579
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:36,824
I... Do you think I like her? Well... You...

580
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:49,144
Let's go.

581
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:55,864
Why is Li Jin Yu here?

582
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:03,204
Excuse me, sir.

583
00:42:04,584 --> 00:42:08,080
Why are you here? What a coincidence.

584
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,104
Long time no see. Please enjoy.

585
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:17,384
What would you like to order?

586
00:42:17,384 --> 00:42:20,824
What a coincidence to run into acquaintances.

587
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:26,204
We just know each other. We're not acquainted.

588
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:31,564
By the way, send your niece's files to my email.

589
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:32,804
I'll ask someone for help.

590
00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:35,744
- Thanks for caring so much.
- You're welcome.

591
00:42:35,744 --> 00:42:42,084
I hope what I said at the wedding
didn't put any pressure on you.

592
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:43,740
It's fine.

593
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:46,764
Ye Meng was just praising you, Dr. Gao.

594
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,344
Really? What did she say?

595
00:42:49,344 --> 00:42:52,904
She said you have a gentle personality
and a great appearance.

596
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:58,404
Plus you have a stable income.
You're a top choice for many girls.

597
00:42:58,404 --> 00:43:02,444
But I suppose "many girls" doesn't include you?

598
00:43:02,444 --> 00:43:06,824
Ms. Fang told me you preferred younger men.

599
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:12,500
I did,

600
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,360
but I've come back to reality
after the Spring Festival.

601
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:33,980



602
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,256
 'You' - Xia Heng
