ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>DEEP AFFECTION EYES</i>
BY ER DONG TU ZI ON JJWXC.NET

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
INPATIENT

3
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,240
Where's Meng?

4
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,160
She hasn't shown up.

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,720
NEW MESSAGE

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,720
FROM LI LINGBAI

7
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Ye Meng's been kidnapped.

8
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
Call the police now.

9
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,240
Where is she?

10
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,320
Pretty quick of you to show up.

11
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Do you even know what you're doing?

12
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,960
So, you really do care about her.

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,200
Not that it matters to me.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
Worst case…

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,080
we all die together.

16
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,200
You've lost your mind.

17
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,680
That's right, I have.

18
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
And it's you people who drove me mad.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,320
Li Jinyu, you've got guts,

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,240
teaming up with your grandfather
to take me down.

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,880
You have no idea what Hanhai means to me.

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,440
I bled for it,
sacrificed my happiness for it.

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,480
You'll never take it away.

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,600
Isn't it my shares you're after?

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,040
Fine. They're yours.

26
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,800
But you've already hurt Ye Meng's mother.

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,600
Don't hurt Ye Meng too.

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,080
That woman destroyed my life.

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,520
Who are you to judge me?

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,760
Calm down.

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
I'll sign them over right now.

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,080
Stay out of my way.

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,000
Ye Meng! Ye Meng!

34
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,960
<i>She's the only child we have.</i>

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,760
We just wanted her to have everything.

36
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,280
So, after she was born,

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,880
all my love and focus went to her.

38
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,800
The show's just starting.

39
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,360
Why rush off already?

40
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
Ye Meng!

41
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
Wake up!

42
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,680
Please, wake up!

43
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,440
Ye Meng!

44
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,720
This is what you get
for giving yourself to Li Lingbai

45
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,920
so completely.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,360
<i>Don't you want a way out for yourself?</i>

47
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,400
<i>I've got money stashed.</i>

48
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,920
Set me free,

49
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,840
and it's all yours.

50
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
Don't forget

51
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,720
what you promised me.

52
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,280
Ye Meng!

53
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
Wake up!

54
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,200
Ye Meng!

55
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,040
Wake up!

56
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,960
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,960
But if you need someone

58
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,640
to blame, blame
that useless mother of yours.

59
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,320
Ye Meng.

60
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,080
Please, Ye Meng, wake up.

61
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,600
Ye Meng!

62
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,760
Don't scare me like this.

63
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
Ye Meng.

64
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,040
Don't do this to me.

65
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,960
RONGHAI MUNICIPAL PUBLIC SECURITY BUREAU
NINGSUI PRECINCT

66
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,320
What, here to see me fall?

67
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,240
I came to tell you

68
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
you don't need to worry about Li Zhuofeng.

69
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Once he's recovered,

70
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,040
I'll bring him back to Ningsui
and hand him over to Grandma.

71
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,240
I haven't lived your pain,

72
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,080
so it's not my place
to tell you to let go of your hate.

73
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
But someone once told me

74
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,440
the world doesn't mean me harm.

75
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,080
And it's the same

76
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,480
for everyone.

77
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,480
When you're drowning in pain,

78
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
all you see in this world is darkness.

79
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,920
Do you want

80
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,240
to hear my story?

81
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,120
<i>My adoptive father took me abroad.</i>

82
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,240
<i>But his business partner,</i>
<i>Chen Guosheng, drugged me.</i>

83
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,680
<i>I was just a kid.</i>

84
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
<i>Too scared to tell anyone.</i>

85
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,840
<i>A month later, I realized I was pregnant.</i>

86
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,560
<i>I finally got the courage</i>
<i>to tell my adoptive father.</i>

87
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,360
<i>For the sake of profit,</i>
<i>he forced me to marry Chen Guosheng.</i>

88
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
So…

89
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,880
that's the root of your hatred for me.

90
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,640
But Ye Meng's mother…

91
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,160
What did she ever do to you?

92
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,040
She?

93
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,360
<i>Her mistake was being too happy.</i>

94
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,240
Bai?

95
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
<i>Years later, by chance,</i>

96
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,400
<i>we ran into each other again.</i>

97
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,720
<i>Back at the welfare center,</i>
<i>we were best friends.</i>

98
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,200
<i>But life sent us</i>

99
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,200
<i>down completely different paths.</i>

100
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,400
Bai, come have some fruit.

101
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,120
One look at this place

102
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,600
and I can tell you've had it pretty good.

103
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,400
Not really.

104
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,080
I just got lucky, that's all.

105
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,240
Truth is,

106
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,440
you've always been so likable.

107
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,200
I remember when my dad

108
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,320
first came to the welfare center,

109
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,360
- <i>the one he noticed first was you.</i>
- Do you like it?

110
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,760
I do.

111
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,800
Good.

112
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,280
Wait here for me.

113
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,840
Shu Yi.

114
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
You're leaving, aren't you?

115
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,000
That means I'll be the only one left here.

116
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,520
Honestly,

117
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,440
I don't even want to go to Jiangbei.

118
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,600
But I know you want to get out of here.

119
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,360
Here, take this.

120
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,560
<i>If you hadn't turned him down,</i>

121
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,320
<i>he never would've adopted me.</i>

122
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,840
My life

123
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,560
might have turned out
completely different.

124
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,440
The truth is,

125
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,200
I really wanted to say yes back then.

126
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,440
Then why didn't you?

127
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,520
Because I saw how much
you loved that teddy bear.

128
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,760
And I promised you

129
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,760
I wouldn't leave you
all alone in the welfare center.

130
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
<i>I hated her for giving me the life I had.</i>

131
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,720
<i>That's when I started my revenge.</i>

132
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,240
Wang Xingsheng, you're a liar.

133
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
A con man.

134
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,480
I'm going to the police.

135
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,400
Go ahead.

136
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,760
I'll just tell them

137
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,160
you were in on it with me.

138
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Don't forget,

139
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,240
you sent me to the welfare center.

140
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,040
The investors in your town
only trusted me because of you.

141
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,040
You're my accomplice.

142
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,520
That's not true! You tricked me.

143
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,760
I never tricked them.

144
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,520
Do you think they'll believe you?

145
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,080
You care most about the Ye family

146
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,120
and your daughter.

147
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
If this ever comes out,

148
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,240
the family's finished,
and even your daughter

149
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
in high school will suffer.

150
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,720
So, keep your mouth shut.

151
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,960
Because if I go down,

152
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
I'll drag you into prison with me.

153
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,240
<i>At first, I only wanted her</i>
<i>to feel the same pain I lived through.</i>

154
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,960
I never thought…

155
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,960
she'd take her own life.

156
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,920
<i>Give that money back.</i>

157
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,720
That money

158
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,880
is the life savings
of everyone at the welfare center.

159
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,120
You don't understand

160
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,200
how important it is to my family.

161
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,840
<i>Did you ever stop to think</i>
<i>how I survived all these years?</i>

162
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,280
You decided for me,

163
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,120
trading away our futures.

164
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,920
You threw me into hell.

165
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
<i>I thought what I did back then</i>

166
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,280
<i>was for your own good.</i>

167
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,080
Lovely.

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,280
For my own good.

169
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,120
For my own good.

170
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,240
It's for me.

171
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,480
Do I look like I've had a good life?

172
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,280
Don't do this, Bai.

173
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,680
Shu Yi, listen to me.

174
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,960
Your happiness today

175
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,480
was built on my misery.

176
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,840
I'll make sure the world knows

177
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,960
you're nothing but a fraud.

178
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,120
- I'll make sure your family
- No…

179
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,360
and your child
live under that shame forever.

180
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,200
Please don't do this, Bai.

181
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,240
I'll make you feel every ounce of pain

182
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,520
that I've felt.

183
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,920
I'll make sure…

184
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,960
This is your debt to me.

185
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,320
Bai.

186
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,240
Bai.

187
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,760
Bai!

188
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
<i>I know…</i>

189
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,400
you hate me.

190
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
<i>I hate you too.</i>

191
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,320
But when you were at your worst,

192
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,920
Ye Meng was there

193
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,760
to hold onto you.

194
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,200
I once had moments

195
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,600
when I felt lucky too.

196
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
The baby's kicking. Feel it.

197
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,320
Really?

198
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,600
It is!

199
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,360
Let me listen.

200
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,400
Who's out there?

201
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,120
- You don't even know me?
- Are you that annoying dad?

202
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,080
<i>If it hadn't been</i>
<i>for that car accident back then,</i>

203
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,040
<i>I wouldn't be this person today.</i>

204
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,120
<i>But it's too late for what-ifs.</i>

205
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,840
Go.

206
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,720
Pretend you never had a mother like me.

207
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,880
Don't ever come back.

208
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,720
VISITATION ROOM

209
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,960
Take care of yourself.

210
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,520
Meng.

211
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,440
Meng.

212
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,800
Ye Meng.

213
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,600
Meng.

214
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
Ye Meng.

215
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,240
Meng.

216
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,040
Meng.

217
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,240
Ye Meng.

218
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,120
We've been worried sick
these last two days.

219
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,480
How do you feel?

220
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,840
I hope you didn't tell the grandmas.

221
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
None of them know.

222
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,600
Don't get up.

223
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,240
- Stay still.
- Raise the bed, slowly.

224
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,640
Easy. Don't strain yourself.

225
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,880
Ask her if anything hurts.

226
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
Meng,

227
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,000
- are you in pain?
- Where's Li Jinyu?

228
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,480
After he left the hospital,
we couldn't reach him.

229
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,960
Couldn't reach him…

230
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,120
Give me my phone.

231
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,600
Here.

232
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,560
Here.

233
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,960
Don't worry about it.

234
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,080
Just rest.

235
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,200
Rest a little longer. Stop worrying.

236
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,200
Kai, go get the doctor.

237
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,760
Let's go pick up Jiayu.

238
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,200
I'll go myself.

239
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,440
I just came to talk to you.

240
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,280
Okay.

241
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,000
That day…

242
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,520
I went too far with my words.

243
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,240
I was upset.

244
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,240
Don't take it to heart.

245
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,040
I'd already let it go.

246
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,280
After all, he's your son.

247
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,680
I understand.

248
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,880
Kai, I'll admit it.

249
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,720
I really do have feelings for you.

250
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,680
But

251
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,240
I just walked out of a broken marriage.

252
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,840
When it comes to love…

253
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,800
I've lost my confidence.

254
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,480
At the start,
I only saw you as a younger brother.

255
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,800
But you…

256
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,720
You've been so good to me…

257
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,040
and to Jiayu.

258
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,640
I'm truly grateful.

259
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
Still…

260
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm confused.

261
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,680
I don't have an answer.

262
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,480
On top of that,

263
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,400
the three of us…

264
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,520
Our situation is complicated.

265
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,160
What's between us

266
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,200
has nothing to do with Ye Meng.

267
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,560
I know.

268
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,080
But I can't help overthinking.

269
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,720
Could you…

270
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,240
give me some time?

271
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
I need to sort myself out first.

272
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Li Jinyu!

273
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,720
Li Jinyu!

274
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,400
Li Jinyu!

275
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,320
<i>Ye Meng,</i>

276
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,000
<i>whatever my history with Li Lingbai,</i>

277
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,160
<i>she's still my mother.</i>

278
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,280
<i>That will never change.</i>

279
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,240
<i>What she did to your mother</i>

280
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,560
<i>is something I can never make right.</i>

281
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,640
<i>When I think about it,</i>

282
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,280
<i>every tragedy seems</i>

283
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,000
<i>to trace back to me.</i>

284
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,440
<i>Too many people were hurt</i>
<i>by what happened back then.</i>

285
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,760
<i>I can't pretend none of it ever happened.</i>

286
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,640
<i>Meeting you</i>

287
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,880
<i>was the luckiest moment of my life.</i>

288
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,560
<i>I want you to stay free and happy,</i>

289
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,000
<i>not weighed down by my burdens.</i>

290
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,920
<i>Please give me time.</i>

291
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
<i>I'll put an end to this myself.</i>

292
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,560
Dad…

293
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,400
IN MEMORY OF BELOVED HUSBAND LI MU

294
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
You were the one

295
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,640
I trusted most in this world.

296
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,600
I never thought

297
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,440
I'd be the one to cause your death.

298
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,040
All these years,
I've lived with the weight of it.

299
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,240
Until I met Ye Meng…

300
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,520
She gave me hope to live again.

301
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,640
<i>But now,</i>

302
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,560
<i>I feel I owe her more and more.</i>

303
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,760
<i>So much, I can't even count.</i>

304
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,920
<i>Recently,</i>

305
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,160
<i>Li, Chairman of the Hanhai Group,</i>

306
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,240
<i>was arrested on multiple charges,</i>
<i>including illegal detention,</i>

307
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,480
<i>kidnapping, and arson.</i>

308
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,760
- <i>The case also involves…</i>
- Excuse me.

309
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,200
- Hello.
- Did a tall, thin man

310
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,880
around 27 or 28 come through here?

311
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,920
- He went up the back mountain.
- <i>Those involved…</i>

312
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,920
- I couldn't stop him.
- <i>…Wang, Xu, and others</i>

313
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,120
<i>have been taken into custody.</i>

314
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,920
Li Jinyu!

315
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,480
Li Jinyu!

316
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,080
Li Jinyu!

317
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Li Jinyu!

318
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,240
What's wrong with you?

319
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,680
You ignore my calls and messages,

320
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,840
then write about
putting an end to everything.

321
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,120
What are you trying to do?
What am I supposed to do?

322
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,000
I was under investigation.
I didn't have my phone.

323
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,000
And I couldn't

324
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,880
say those words to your face…

325
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,600
so I wrote a letter.

326
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,400
Was it you who turned in the flash drive?

327
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,160
I couldn't let your mother be branded
with a crime she didn't commit.

328
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,240
Ye Meng.

329
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,120
This time, I'm not running away.

330
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,640
Do you have any idea

331
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,560
what I thought had happened?

332
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,080
Grandma was right.

333
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,440
People are like tea.

334
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,880
When spring comes,

335
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,480
new leaves always grow.

336
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,600
It's the same for us.

337
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,920
As long as we're alive,

338
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,960
there's always hope.

339
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm sorry

340
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,960
for making you worry.

341
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,640
Ye Meng,

342
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,040
thank you.

343
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,800
Is that all?

344
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,040
I love you.

345
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,920
I love you too.

346
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,000
Let's go home.

347
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm still mad at you.

348
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,480
Wait for me.

349
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,560
We'll walk together.

350
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,560
Do you realize how long and rough

351
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,560
this road is?

352
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,040
I've been looking for you.

353
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

354
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,120
How will you make it up to me?

355
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,440
How about I carry you down the hill?

356
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,280
No way. What if you drop me?

357
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,760
If someone's going down,

358
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,440
- you'd let me fall first.
- Impossible.

359
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,720
Don't lie.
You'd toss me aside in a second.

360
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,680
Please, everyone, sit.

361
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,280
I want to apologize.

362
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,680
Because of my family,

363
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
Hanhai has been dragged down.

364
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,080
I owe you all a sincere apology.

365
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,200
Everyone here

366
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,000
is a cornerstone of this company.

367
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
The success

368
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,560
Hanhai has today

369
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,800
was built on your hard work.

370
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,720
I'm sure you've all heard
the reports about Hailan Port,

371
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,280
which began as the Tianhui City project.

372
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,640
As Hanhai's largest shareholder,

373
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,840
I will take the responsibility

374
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,520
for the negative influence.

375
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,240
That's why

376
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,360
I will donate the net profits
from my shares

377
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
to compensate

378
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,240
every victim and their families

379
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,480
from that financial fraud case.

380
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,800
From here on, the company will be managed

381
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,040
by more capable hands.

382
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
I only have one request.

383
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,000
Phase Three of Hailan Port

384
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,800
must preserve the original look
of the fishing village.

385
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,720
Li Jinyu's a good man.

386
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
I always knew he was.

387
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,960
So did I.

388
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,920
Not playing the big boss anymore?

389
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I was never cut out for it.

390
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,320
Better off studying for my CPA license.

391
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,080
Small-town kids like us
don't need to stir things up here.

392
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,040
So, are we staying one more night
or heading back?

393
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,600
Let's just go home.

394
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,080
We'll make it in time
for Kai's restaurant opening.

395
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,560
- Come on.
- Let's go.

396
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,159
GEM RESTAURANT GRAND OPENING

397
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,159
Thanks.

398
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,159
Mr. Cheng,

399
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,199
it's the lucky hour.

400
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,719
- Time to cut the ribbon.
- Alright!

401
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,880
- Let's do this.
- Everyone,

402
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,679
three, two, one!

403
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,679
- We're open!
- Let's go.

404
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,760
Thank you to everyone,
old friends and new,

405
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,199
for supporting Gem.

406
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,199
Today marks the first day
of Gem Restaurant.

407
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,719
To celebrate, everything's 20% off.

408
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,120
And all our members

409
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,360
can join a free prize draw.

410
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,480
- I checked the prizes myself.
- Bravo!

411
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,360
Mr. Cheng really pulled out all the stops.

412
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,320
Hurry up, everyone.

413
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,720
First come, first served!

414
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,080
Come on in. Come on in.

415
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,680
- Head inside, everyone!
- Come!

416
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,920
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

417
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,880
Welcome, welcome.

418
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,080
Look at this crowd.

419
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,240
Business is booming.

420
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,520
Come again next time.

421
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,080
Stop waiting around.

422
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Ya'en took Jiayu into the city
for an event.

423
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,160
But she did send flowers.

424
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,800
PROSPERITY AND SUCCESS, GRAND OPENING

425
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,400
It's fine. No big deal.

426
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,560
It's fine. Maybe she'll show up later.

427
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,960
Come on, everyone, inside.

428
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,800
GEM RESTAURANT GRAND OPENING
FORTUNE OVERFLOWING

429
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,440
How was the food?
Anything we should improve?

430
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,320
- No, it was great.
- That's good to hear.

431
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,240
- We liked it.
- Good.

432
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,760
Post it on Moments and share it.

433
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,880
Bring friends next time.

434
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,080
- Will do.
- Great.

435
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,000
- Bye!
- Bye!

436
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,920
Bye!

437
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,040
Kai, come check this out.

438
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,800
Where is he?

439
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,560
- I'm getting nervous.
- No clue.

440
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,560
Let's hit the mall.

441
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,200
Sure, I need new clothes.

442
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,680
GRAND OPENING

443
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,080
Turning a bar into a restaurant?

444
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
What a waste.

445
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,400
Tai Mingxiao.

446
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,680
Welcome!

447
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,600
Tai Ming…

448
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,280
What's this?

449
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,360
The new Three Musketeers?

450
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,600
We asked you here

451
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,440
because there's something we need to say.

452
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,520
We're sorry.

453
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,600
What's going on?

454
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,960
Mr. Gou,

455
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,280
you knew today was my opening?

456
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,040
What…

457
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,600
Of course. You'd do anything for money.

458
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,240
Tell me.

459
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,960
How much is he paying you? I'll double it.

460
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,160
Wait.

461
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,840
He doesn't even know.

462
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,040
If you've got money to burn,

463
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,880
give it to me. I'll even cut you in.

464
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,720
Enough about money.

465
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,560
That's not what this is about.

466
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,840
The truth is…

467
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,600
I've been Ye Meng's husband all along.

468
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,280
You think I'll believe that?

469
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,400
At least let go.

470
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,320
Let go.

471
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,440
- Stop it.
- Calm down.

472
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,320
Look.

473
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,320
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

474
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,800
Believe it now? Huh?

475
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,440
I just got back from abroad.

476
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,760
You've really let me down.

477
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,480
I'll talk to him.

478
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
Go.

479
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,600
I think he's crying.

480
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,840
Seriously.

481
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,080
He's heartbroken.

482
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,280
What can we do?

483
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,920
I feel bad for him.

484
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,040
Come on. That's enough.

485
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,040
Stop brooding by the sea.

486
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,960
I never meant to hide things from you.

487
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,680
Back then, the situation was complicated.

488
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,480
I feared for Ye Meng's safety.

489
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,120
You always think you know best.

490
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,080
And you keep me in the dark.

491
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,120
You hid your marriage.

492
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,800
You hid quitting the competition.

493
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,400
Do you realize that match
wasn't just about you?

494
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,920
I gave it everything I had too.

495
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,320
I know.

496
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,120
Losing that match back then was on me.

497
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,080
I owe you an apology.

498
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,920
I'm not mad we lost.

499
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,480
I'm mad you vanished without a word.

500
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,320
I saw you as a friend.

501
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
What did you see me as?

502
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,280
Around that time,

503
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,680
my father passed away.

504
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,800
I wanted to tell you guys,

505
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,560
but I didn't know how.

506
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
You know what I'm like.

507
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,640
I shut myself off

508
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,720
and kept everyone at arm's length.

509
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,200
The only person I ever
opened up to was my dad.

510
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,920
And because of me,

511
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,600
he died in that car crash.

512
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,200
I wasn't in any state to compete.

513
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,640
I fell apart.

514
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,120
So, I cut ties with everyone

515
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,040
and hid myself away.

516
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,840
Back then, I thought

517
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,720
maybe this was all my life would be.

518
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,520
Until Ye Meng came along.

519
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,360
She gave me

520
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,240
a reason to live again.

521
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,240
That's why

522
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,640
I can stand here now,

523
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,400
finally saying this to you.

524
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,160
I'm sorry

525
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,440
for keeping the truth from you.

526
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,760
But in my heart,

527
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,800
I've always treasured

528
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,760
the time we shared.

529
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,840
To me, you'll always be my closest friend.

530
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,520
I'm sorry.

531
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,920
For what happened with Ye Meng

532
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,600
and for everything in the past.

533
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,200
