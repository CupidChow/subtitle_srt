 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,727
♫  I still remember it clearly  ♫

3
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:15,341
♫  Your eyes sparkled back then  ♫

4
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:20,626
 ♫ With a sense of excitement You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:25,807
♫  But over time, you've forgotten  ♫

6
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:31,155
♫  Promises left behind at every twist in life  ♫

7
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,643
♫  Only memories remain like scattered fireworks  ♫

8
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:38,107
♫  When I turned to walk away  ♫

9
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:42,739
♫  If I could go back to the day we said goodbye  ♫

10
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:48,811
♫  I'd never let go of your hand  ♫

11
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:53,847
♫  I can't hide the flutters in my heart  ♫

12
00:00:53,847 --> 00:01:01,127
♫  I'm about to be out of control as breathing turns weightless  ♫

13
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:05,927
♫  All I possess is drowned by the me who still loves you deeply  ♫

14
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:11,191
♫  I'll never changed even if miracles exist  ♫

15
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:15,374
♫  Don't forget, our promises will be kept  ♫

16
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:20,466
♫  And the dream where I'm with you  ♫

17
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:26,960
   

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,990
   

19
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:39,960



20
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,956
Thanks for today.

21
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:54,476
Are you okay?

22
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:57,076
- This guy is harassing women! 
 - Let go of me!

23
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,616
Thanks.

24
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,536
Don't mention it.

25
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:03,356
If this happens again, don't hesitate to come to me.

26
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:07,936
He told me you were loaded and would repay us.

27
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:09,816
How can you tell I'm rich?

28
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:13,456
- We have a good eye. 
 - You can leave.

29
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:15,576
Wasn't it you who said...

30
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:19,216
Fine. Call me if you need anything.

31
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:22,056
- Thanks. Bye. 
 - Bye.

32
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:25,356
So handsome. He's the man who was in the toilet just now, right?

33
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:27,256
That's him.

34
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:34,596
You sent Mai Mai to distract Cheng Kai Ran. How were you so sure it’d work?

35
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:37,796
I just know Mr. Cheng.

36
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:43,076
You're not just a good actor. You also know people and are smart.

37
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:44,976
What did you want to see me about?

38
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:49,056
I came to apologize. About Jiang Lu Zhi, I...

39
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:51,776
Okay. Anything else?

40
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:55,776
Add me on WeChat.

41
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,956
You ruined your reputation for me today. I'll make it up to you.

42
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:00,976
I'll transfer the money later. Scan me.

43
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:04,516
My cousin was talking nonsense. No need.

44
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:12,076
 Meng. I made an appointment with Dr. Gao again. Don't stand him up again. 

45
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:16,856
Then, let's try a different way to compensate.

46
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:24,276
Date me. I'm more reliable than Jiang Lu Zhi.

47
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,976
Are you women so eager to get married?

48
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:34,776
You're really younger than me?

49
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,828
Two years younger.

50
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,368
How did you know?

51
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,844
When paying at the hospital today, I accidentally saw your ID card.

52
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:44,580
   

53
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,348
You followed me?

54
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:54,228
You're overthinking it. I'm not that bored.

55
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:57,588
Fine. Do you accept an age gap?

56
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,480
I only like younger girls,

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,900
especially the sweet and naive ones. Understand?

58
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:10,548
So, you really do like to act like a hero.

59
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:13,908
You sacrificed your reputation for me today

60
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:17,108
just to make Jiang Lu Zhi jealous, but was it worth it?

61
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,080
None of your business!

62
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:22,108
Go, quickly!

63
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,428
Can I get your WeChat?

64
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,688
You should learn to protect yourself and your reputation.

65
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:51,948
One more skewer of this.

66
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:54,148
- This one, right? 
 - Yes.

67
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,728
- What else? 
 - I also want this tofu skewer.

68
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:59,528
- Meatballs. 
 - This one? Okay.

69
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:01,768
- How much in total? 
 - 20.

70
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,808
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

71
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:06,528
I didn't eat enough this afternoon.

72
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:08,908
Come on, eat up!

73
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:16,448
 - Sister Mei, how much in total? 
 - 10. 

74
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,870
 - Thanks, Sister Mei. 
 - Okay. 

75
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,728
 Thank you for studying with me. 

76
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:24,528
 So, you bought me some food as compensation. 

77
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:28,108
 - Don't run! 
 - Stop chasing me! 

78
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,148
 Is that Kai Kai? 

79
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:31,988
 What trouble did he stir up now? 

80
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:34,288
 - Do you think he can win? 
 - Don't run! 

81
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:36,808
 - Don't run! 
 - No chance he'll win. 

82
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:39,428
 Help, Sister Ya En, Sister Ye Meng! 

83
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:41,288
 - Stop! 
 - Help me! 

84
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,128
 Don't run! 

85
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:46,848
 Let's go! 

86
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,328
 - Don't you run! 
 - Don't run! 

87
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:57,160
   

88
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:08,668
Meng, who would've thought after all these years in Jiangbei,

89
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:13,528
you've kept this habit?

90
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:18,168
From now on, every morning, come to the morning market with me.

91
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:22,168
Grandma, I like running, so I go for a morning run every day.

92
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:25,148
- You shop alone. 
 - Morning runs are healthy.

93
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:28,328
This is about when Dr. Gao usually starts his early shift too.

94
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:30,688
You two could squeeze in a date.

95
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:34,108
Do you know how many girls are eager to date him?

96
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:37,408
Listen, even if your leg is broken tomorrow,

97
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,988
you'll crawl there, understood?

98
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:43,868
- Every time I mention this, you play deaf. 
 - Fine. I get it.

99
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:46,108
- Go. The family's waiting. 
 - Are you going or not?

100
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:48,448
Yeah, I'll go tomorrow.

101
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,108
Hello?

102
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:11,788
 - What's Cheng Kai Ran been up to lately?  
 - Cheng Kai Ran?

103
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,308
He's made something of himself now.

104
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,488
But I can't explain it all on the phone.

105
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:20,068
 After I got married, Chen Jian didn't let me contact him, 

106
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:23,288
 so we haven't seen each other for years. 

107
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,300
The scar on his face was from back then.

108
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,188
 Yeah. He was such a handsome kid before, but now he has a scar on his face. 

109
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:33,108
So, he's been looking for you all along.

110
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:37,268
 A few years back, he kept watching your old house at Nantang'an every day. 

111
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:41,848
After your grandma moved to live with your aunt, he finally stopped.

112
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:47,848
But he made threats, saying he'd make you pay.

113
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:52,728
 - Let me go talk to him.  
 - Don't, don't! Wait for me.

114
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:55,648
Wait until I'm discharged from the hospital. I'll go talk to him for you.

115
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,968
Maintain your perfect wife and mother image. Why are you getting involved in this?

116
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,788
Don't worry. I'll handle it myself.

117
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,140
   

118
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,328
What a coincidence.

119
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:48,177
You come to my bar, saying it's a coincidence?

120
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,868
Not running away anymore?

121
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:55,988
Got time? Let's talk about the past.

122
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,460
Okay.

123
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:01,088
I know you've been holding onto those past events.

124
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:04,968
 I came today to tell you I called the police back then. 

125
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,748
 But the police couldn't find you. 

126
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:09,528
 Because every one of you didn't want to end up at the police station. 

127
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,588
 Those guys ran away. And you ran off with them. 

128
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:15,988
 Hello? Police, I need to report a case. 

129
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,188
Is this really police business? We were so close back then.

130
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:22,088
You watched them drag me away and did nothing to save me.

131
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:25,488
I didn't realize how serious it was. You used to pick fights,

132
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:29,288
- so I didn't know— 
 - Stop acting right now. What's the point of saying all this now?

133
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:36,288
Okay. So, you're pinning all of this on me?

134
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:37,788
Yes.

135
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,868
Then, just stab me. That should satisfy you.

136
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:43,088
You think I won't?

137
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:54,948
Brother Kai. No matter what happens,

138
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:59,208
it's not appropriate for a man to fight a girl.

139
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,108
Let go.

140
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,988
Brother Kai, Brother Jin Yu, what are you doing?

141
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:20,628
- What are you doing here? 
 - Brother Jin Yu, how did you hurt your hand?

142
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,708
Why did you come?

143
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:28,808
Brother Jin Yu has a performance tonight. I finally got time off and came to watch it.

144
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:32,128
I was hoping Brother Jin Yu could continue tutoring me.

145
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:39,248
Kai Kai, I really hope you can live well.

146
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:45,028
If this scar really bothers you, I know a doctor who can remove it.

147
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,528
Brother Jin Yu, are you okay?

148
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,688
Jing Jing, let's go.

149
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:54,388
Coming.

150
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,648
- Let me see your hand. 
 - It's nothing.

151
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,568
Are you going to keep following me?

152
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:01,548
I'm not following you. My home is this way, too.

153
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:03,688
Thanks for today.

154
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:08,828
But that girl looks simple and kind. She must be your type.

155
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,828
I don't want to offend Cheng Kai Ran, and no interest in your love game.

156
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:21,288
What about Jiang Lu Zhi? Why do you date her?

157
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:23,408
Because she's prettier than you.

158
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,508
You're truly the most tasteless man I've ever met.

159
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:31,528
But you're the most tasteful woman I know.

160
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm home.

161
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,320
- We probably don't share the same route now. 
 - Actually, we do.

162
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,300
I forgot my key today. Mind if I borrow your place to get back to mine?

163
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:45,728
Thanks.

164
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Want to come up to my place?

165
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:07,888
No need.

166
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,700
Then I'll leave.

167
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:18,428
Still alive?

168
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,410
Yes.

169
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,068
For your injury compensation, I'll give it to you together.

170
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:28,548
Are you made of money? Throwing cash at people every time?

171
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,108
Bye.

172
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,730
Bye.

173
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:38,828
Don't forget to treat that wound.

174
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:03,668
After all these years, only you're still here.

175
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,988
Why are you coming up?

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,500
   

177
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:03,328
 Sweetheart. Are your eyes tired? 

178
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,468
 Mom, I'm so tired. 

179
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:10,988
 Here, have some milk and go to bed after finishing this paper. 

180
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:14,588
 - Mom, I don't want to do this anymore. 
 - Why?  

181
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:18,120
 If you don't, you'll have to retake the exams again. 

182
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:23,028
 Listen. Drink the milk, and you'll feel energized. 

183
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:25,488
 Hurry up and drink it.  

184
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:30,568
 Our baby is so good. Good job! 

185
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,188
 Are you asleep? Looks like things are going well lately. 

186
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:53,668
 It's nothing serious. Just asking how you are. 

187
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:57,548
 In a little while, I'll be on a business trip and I'll make time to visit you. 

188
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:38,948
Dr. Gao, the first batch of goods has been sent.

189
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:41,208
This is their new product. Come take a look.

190
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,668
The effect.

191
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:46,288
If he gets the surgery today, he'll be up on his feet tomorrow!

192
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:50,488
- You're a doctor. You know how it works. 
 - You're back.

193
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:53,428
Why did it take you so long to come back? Dr. Gao has been waiting for you for ages.

194
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:56,828
Did you go to the hospital again to look after your friend?

195
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:58,928
Meng Meng has a kind heart.

196
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,568
No, I went to the club last night,

197
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:04,428
partied all night, and was too tired to come back.

198
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:06,828
That's so you. Cool.

199
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:08,660
Miss Ye.

200
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,088
We meet again.

201
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:15,588
You two know each other? Come on, Meng, sit over here.

202
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:19,308
Move aside. Come.

203
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:21,088
You didn't sell it, did you?

204
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,088
Sit here.

205
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:47,868
Dr. Gao, last time you didn't see Meng Meng because she was too busy.

206
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:52,708
This time, Meng Meng is available. Have a good chat.

207
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,628
Grandma, where are you going? Let's talk together.

208
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:59,708
Come on. Sit.

209
00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:09,288
Dr. Gao. Since we've already met and you already know my basic conditions,

210
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:11,948
I'll mention a few small requirements.

211
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,500
Okay.

212
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:18,068
After marriage, you'll move in with us.

213
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:20,968
On workdays, you'll get up before 6:30 every morning.

214
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,928
I value family-oriented people.

215
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:28,488
So cancel all those work-related dinners or parties, okay?

216
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay.

217
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,008
There are many in my family. So breakfast needs separate preparations.

218
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,388
My grandma has weak teeth, so cook her porridge soft and mushy.

219
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,168
My elder aunt likes sweet fried pancakes from South Street. They're greasy.

220
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,548
So, use oil-absorbing paper to soak up all the oil.

221
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:47,008
My second aunt loves West Street's soup dumplings. Right?

222
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:50,088
That shop's popular. Queue up half an hour in advance, or you'll miss out.

223
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,548
Not for me. I'm dieting.

224
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:53,008
Isn't that your favorite shop?

225
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:56,988
And my youngest aunt just returned from abroad, so she likes foreign cuisine.

226
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:01,088
Prepare bagels or toast for her.

227
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:04,408
And most importantly, coffee, right? It has to be freshly ground.

228
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:07,828
How did I do? Does anyone have anything to add?

229
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:12,028
Why did you hit me?

230
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,588
Grandma has weak teeth.

231
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:20,648
The eldest aunt likes low-oil sweet fried pancakes.

232
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:24,468
The second aunt likes soup dumplings from West Street. I'll need to queue for those.

233
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:29,168
- The youngest aunt likes bagels. 
 - And freshly ground coffee.

234
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:32,368
Got it. No problem, I've memorized everything.

235
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:36,608
As it happens, I'm someone who enjoys waking up early.

236
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:47,368
Any children we have will take my surname. All surnamed Ye, okay?

237
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:49,088
I'm the only child in this family.

238
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:52,368
So, I've decided to follow the national policy and have two children.

239
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,320
Both will carry the Ye name. You raise them.

240
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,900
No problem, right?

241
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:07,888
Childbearing isn't easy for women. I completely understand your request.

242
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:11,688
I don't care what my kids' surname is. We'll all be family anyway.

243
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,788
Dr. Gao, why don't you just be honest with me?

244
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:18,288
How much did Grandma pay you? How could you agree to marry me otherwise?

245
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:23,688
Grandma said after marriage, I wouldn't need to buy a house or a car.

246
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:26,820
The ancestral house in Nantang'an will be mine.

247
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,688
But only after I turn fifty.

248
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:33,928
By then, that house will be a ruin.

249
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:38,008
Fine, let's just call this off if you don't agree.

250
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,448
I was joking about the house.

251
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,360
I have my house and car.

252
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,400
I mean... I agree.

253
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,148
- Glad you do. Let's talk. 
 - Sit down.

254
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:03,528
- What are you doing? 
 - Dr. Gao. Let's exchange contact info.

255
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:05,148
- Sure. 
 - All right, all right.

256
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:07,728
- Why are you sharing contacts? 
 - You youngsters chat.

257
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,328
So, only you can have it? Here, scan my code.

258
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:13,288
- Take it back with you. Try it yourself first. 
 - Okay.

259
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:15,728
- Dr. Gao. 
 - Good for kidneys.

260
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:18,468
- You like coffee too? 
 - Why are you so nosy?

261
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:20,108
I've been to this place too.

262
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:22,928
What's with the coffee? A Chinese person drinking coffee daily...

263
00:22:22,928 --> 00:22:26,908
- What's wrong? 
 - Drink this tonic.

264
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,880
 Li Jin Yu. Li Jin Yu, are you home? 

265
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,320
 Li Jin Yu! 

266
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,240
Morning.

267
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:53,730
Morning. Did you sleep well?

268
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:58,368
- Are you borrowing my place to climb the wall again? 
 - No need.

269
00:22:58,368 --> 00:23:01,648
- I have a key today. 
 - What do you need then?

270
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:05,728
Our house lost power. I need to borrow a toolbox.

271
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:16,588
Is that your puppy? So cute! What's its name?

272
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:17,968
Ping An.

273
00:23:17,968 --> 00:23:23,940
Ping An, I've moved next door, and I'm your neighbor from now on.

274
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,028
What's it doing? Why won't it come down?

275
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:30,408
It always wants to go to the rooftop. It fails, but it just won't budge. Stubborn thing.

276
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,828
Just like you. Go for it.

277
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,368
- How's your hand? 
 - It's nothing serious.

278
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:37,748
Good that you're okay.

279
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:42,148
If your hands are damaged, I couldn't possibly pay for it.

280
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:48,688
Thank you.

281
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,288
Goodbye.

282
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:05,808
 Li Jin Yu. 

283
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:08,128
- Hi. 
 - Anything else?

284
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:11,128
I just remembered, I'm not great with toolboxes, so I need to hire an electrician

285
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:13,108
paid by the hour.

286
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,628
Thank you.

287
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:22,288
Meng Meng.

288
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:35,728
I've moved to Fang Ya En's place.

289
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:43,168
This kid...

290
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:53,668
I found the circuit diagram. Take a look.

291
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,028
You memorized it already?

292
00:24:58,028 --> 00:25:02,028
When I was at the hospital, I found you had a very good memory.

293
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:03,928
I didn't memorize it.

294
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,600
Then, how did you fix it?

295
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,588
Because I already knew how.

296
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:12,068
You're full of surprises.

297
00:25:12,068 --> 00:25:13,268
Fixed.

298
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:16,368
That fast? Thanks.

299
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:22,548
But the lights still aren't on. Are you sure it's fixed?

300
00:25:22,548 --> 00:25:26,348
There was nothing to fix. You forgot to pay the electric bill.

301
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:31,548
Don't forget to pay my hourly rate.

302
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,488
What's wrong?

303
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:03,728
Give me your contact info. I'll transfer the money.

304
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:12,028
Payment QR code.

305
00:26:17,588 --> 00:26:21,648
Paid by the hour. I'll send you payment for one hour.

306
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:23,800
Is 50 yuan enough?

307
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:26,408
What are you drinking?

308
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:30,368
My water dispenser is still not okay. I'm pretty thirsty.

309
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:34,388
There's water in the fridge. Help yourself.

310
00:26:59,147 --> 00:27:01,900
   

311
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:13,248
The Memory Palace. I've seen this book before.

312
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:16,808
I heard it teaches people

313
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:20,148
to use familiar patterns to memorize unfamiliar and new information.

314
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:22,748
It's like having a room in your brain

315
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:26,728
where each room can store much information, right?

316
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,908
Pretty much, but it doesn't have to be rooms.

317
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:34,648
Simplify it. It can be a person

318
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:36,608
- or even a phrase. 
  - You bastard! 

319
00:27:36,608 --> 00:27:38,088
 - Mom. 
 - Get out! 

320
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:42,708
 The familiar objects you recall whenever you close your eyes. 

321
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,908
 When you need to remember, 

322
00:27:45,908 --> 00:27:50,648
 just use your associative abilities to connect them. 

323
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:55,968
This way, memorization becomes easier.

324
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:59,828
That's impressive. Which university did you graduate from?

325
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:02,788
I never graduated. High school diploma.

326
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:04,908
High school diploma.

327
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:11,448
What? You elite university graduate look down on high school diplomas?

328
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:15,728
How could that be? I didn't graduate from any elite school.

329
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:18,448
Jiang Lu Zhi graduated from an elite university.

330
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,708
Besides, she doesn't look down on you. Why would I look down on you?

331
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,228
We've already broken up.

332
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:25,688
Right, right, ex-girlfriend.

333
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,208
But this book, Memory Palace, seems genuinely useful.

334
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:34,408
An amazing memory is not all good things.

335
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,210
Not a good thing?

336
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,508
If I had learned it earlier, I might have surpassed Jiang Lu Zhi in exams.

337
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:47,948
You don't know how hard I studied back then but still couldn't memorize it.

338
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:50,408
Why do you always compare yourself to Jiang Lu Zhi?

339
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:54,788
It's not that I want to compete, but didn't you say she was prettier than me?

340
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:57,708
There are plenty prettier than you. Should you compare with every single one?

341
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:00,448
Like who? Tell me.

342
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:03,968
Do you have other business?

343
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,208
No, I came mainly to ask you

344
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,548
if you're free tomorrow. I want to treat you to dinner.

345
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,390
   

346
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:26,148
Hey, what do you want?

347
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:29,348
 My high school classmate getting married next week asked me to be a bridesmaid. 

348
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:31,244
 I'll be in Ningsui for a couple of days.  
  

349
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:35,428
 Let's meet then, okay? We'll talk face-to-face.  
    

350
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:40,868
Tomorrow's no good.

351
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,788
You mean dinner tomorrow?

352
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:46,408
I'm busy tomorrow.

353
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:50,728
Okay. Another time, then. I'm leaving.

354
00:29:52,028 --> 00:29:54,768
- Thanks for the water. 
 - Close the door on your way out.

355
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:56,508
No problem.

356
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,770
   

357
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:28,900
   

358
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:57,148
 Jin Yu. Jin Yu, what happened? 

359
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,828
 Dad, Mom doesn't want me anymore. 

360
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:04,068
 How could that be? She's just angry for now. That won't happen. 

361
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:07,968
 Take me abroad, okay? Don't abandon me. 

362
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:12,148
 All right. I'll talk to Mom after we go back. Go. 

363
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:42,168
Li Jin Yu!

364
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:31,900
   

365
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:58,148
 Why? Why is it not you who died? 

366
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:21,310
 Li Jin Yu. 

367
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,380
 Li Jin Yu. 

368
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:30,608
He's inside, isn't he? Li Jin Yu.

369
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:37,068
Want to try my heart-shaped double skin milk for you?

370
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:38,868
I made it myself.

371
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:44,348
You made it yourself? It's from Zhou's.

372
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:48,808
I bought it in person. Specially for you.

373
00:34:52,468 --> 00:34:55,508
What's wrong? You look like a stray dog!

374
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:58,868
If I manage to cheer you up, will I earn some points?

375
00:35:02,288 --> 00:35:04,868
Did something happen?

376
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:09,368
Aren't you being a bit too concerned as a neighbor?

377
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:14,628
Has anyone said you're difficult to deal with? Don't eat the double skin milk.

378
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:25,648
What? You ask Li Jin Yu if he wants to date you? 
    

379
00:35:26,468 --> 00:35:29,548
Any louder and I'll go deaf.

380
00:35:29,548 --> 00:35:33,988
I haven't even blamed you for telling me the big news while I'm eating.

381
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:37,328
I just wondered why you sent me double skin milk kindly today.

382
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:40,468
- Am I the type to abandon friends for romance? 
 - Aren't you?

383
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:42,828
- Then, don't eat it. 
 - Give it back.

384
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:44,448
I told you you'd embarrass yourself.

385
00:35:44,448 --> 00:35:46,028
Just days ago, you said,

386
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:49,028
"He was Jiang Lu Zhi's ex-boyfriend and I could never be with him."

387
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:51,228
Look how quickly you've turned into a simp!

388
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:55,188
Is that what you call simping? I'm just interested because he has the face I like.

389
00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:58,308
My family keeps pressuring me to get married. Don't I just need a boyfriend to keep them quiet?

390
00:35:58,308 --> 00:36:01,228
Oh, please. You've been under Jiang Lu Zhi's thumb for years.

391
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:05,008
You want to get back at her by dating her ex-boyfriend.

392
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:08,768
Now I failed. The man is hard to deal with.

393
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,828
Speak of the devil.

394
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,328
Why is he here?

395
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:20,188
I've got new arrivals recently. I need manual labor.

396
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:24,728
Mrs. Tou said he's free for a part-time job. Let's keep the money among our own.

397
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:27,108
Sister Ya En.

398
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:39,488
Ye Meng bought this double skin milk for me. Try it. It's really sweet.

399
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,928
No, thanks.

400
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:46,728
So, you'll hang up these new arrivals

401
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:48,908
and need to pack some items for warehouse storage.

402
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:51,828
Others need sorting for today's shipments.

403
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:55,828
- No problem. 
 - Okay. For more details, ask Ye Meng.

404
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:58,928
- I'll handle the shipping orders. 
 - Let me help you.

405
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:01,368
Don't. Just focus on your work.

406
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:17,008
Aren't you capable of polite conversation?

407
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:19,208
You call her Ya En sweetly with such respect.

408
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,828
But give me nothing but cold shoulders.

409
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:24,008
Want friendly service? Pay extra.

410
00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:38,288
What are you doing here?

411
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:41,748
Boss, hope you don't mind me taking a part-time gig.

412
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:42,868
Go ahead.

413
00:37:42,868 --> 00:37:46,388
- Looking for Ya En? I'll get her. 
 - No.

414
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:50,828
I'm here for you. Let's talk outside.

415
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,800
What's up?

416
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,020
I...

417
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:08,148
I'm here to apologize. I know you deliberately provoked me that day.

418
00:38:08,148 --> 00:38:12,108
You know I could never actually lay hands on you.

419
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:17,008
And I can't keep a distance from you.

420
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,540
All right, got it. Anything else?

421
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:23,828
What's your relationship with that brat?

422
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:27,908
You're younger than him. Don't say 'brat.'

423
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:30,308
Anyway, listen. Stay away from him.

424
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,508
Don't be fooled. He treats the old lady well now, but his filial act is fake.

425
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:37,568
When he first came, he got into fights and beat someone into the ICU.

426
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,708
If the old lady hadn't spent her life savings to pay it off, he'd have been done for.

427
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:46,528
Cheng Kai Ran, you never got into fights when you were a kid?

428
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:51,588
Anyway, his scandals are too many to count. He's pure scum.

429
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:54,128
At my bar, he's always surrounded by women.

430
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:57,568
He's got every lady in town wrapped around his finger.

431
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,868
Remember Granny Zhang at the town entrance? Her hair's completely white.

432
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:04,008
The other day, at my bar, he and a woman... I can't...

433
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,908
- I just can't put it into words. 
 - I know, I know.

434
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:12,488
You know?

435
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,888
So, that was you in the restroom that day. Huh?

436
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,508
You two. When did you meet?

437
00:39:28,508 --> 00:39:30,588
- Not long ago. 
 - Not long ago?

438
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:33,228
You just met and he's already helping you deceive me?

439
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:38,128
That little brat. Seems he forgot who puts food on his table.

440
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:44,148
He isn't interested in you, right?

441
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:48,528
Cheng Kai Ran, I'm warning you not to be reckless.

442
00:39:48,528 --> 00:39:51,128
If I really lose it, I can be pretty unpredictable.

443
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:56,648
If I find someone giving him trouble, you'll be held responsible.

444
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:05,968
Why are you still here?

445
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:07,988
Wait, Ye Meng, I'm...

446
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:11,948
Brother Kai, your presence is a great honor. What's with the aggressive attitude?

447
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:13,950
Looking for a fight?

448
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:16,928
You... You're disabled, Sister Ya En?

449
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:19,988
Stay out of it. I've been cursed.

450
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:25,908
If you ever need help with anything,

451
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:29,428
just tell me directly. I'll send someone else from my bar.

452
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:32,708
Your people look intimidating. With them here, who'd enter?

453
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:37,170
My place would shut down in days. I'm fine.

454
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,028
Busy?

455
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,228
Why are you here?

456
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:44,028
I heard you injured your leg and came to check on you.

457
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:47,668
Stop pretending, will you? Didn't I tell you?

458
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:50,088
After our cooling-off period ends, meet me at the civil affairs bureau.

459
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:53,308
I want to take my son back to stay for a few days. His grandma misses him.

460
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:55,608
Now you want to be a good dad?

461
00:40:56,468 --> 00:41:01,488
Ye Meng, I hear you're barely hanging on in Jiangbei.

462
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:02,868
You're quite funny.

463
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:06,748
After repeating school for years to get into a crummy university, you still achieved nothing.

464
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:09,268
Just go back to your hometown, find a stable job,

465
00:41:09,268 --> 00:41:12,848
and maybe even land a decent person to be your husband.

466
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:17,028
Who are you? Want a beating?

467
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:20,408
- Who are you? 
 - Let me formally introduce you.

468
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:23,628
Chen Jian, Ya En's ex-husband.

469
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:26,048
He's an extremely "decent person."

470
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,948
Watch your tone. And what's this "ex-husband" nonsense?

471
00:41:28,948 --> 00:41:31,108
- We're not even fully divorced yet. 
 - Almost there, almost.

472
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:34,588
If you want to shorten the divorce cooling-off period, it's okay.

473
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:36,348
Ya En can sue you immediately.

474
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:40,248
The only reason she's sparing your dignity is you're her son's father.

475
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:44,928
Just get out already. I already know your demand.

476
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:48,668
When Jia Yu comes back, I'll consider his opinion.

477
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:53,728
Fine. Be careful who you hang out with. Don't lead our kid astray.

478
00:41:55,408 --> 00:41:58,948
Ye Meng. So, this is the person you're rooting for?

479
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:02,468
Watching you get humiliated, he won't even stand up for you.

480
00:42:04,408 --> 00:42:06,568
You need me to step in?

481
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:08,268
Do I need it?

482
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:15,370
All right, fine.

483
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,648
Since you've found a part-time job, no need to come to my bar.

484
00:42:20,648 --> 00:42:23,908
If you ever need anything in the future, just go to Sister Ye.

485
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,828
Kai Kai, take some fruits with you.

486
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:28,788
Keep them for yourselves, you two.

487
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:53,920



488
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:09,188
 'You' - Xia Heng 

489
00:43:09,188 --> 00:43:11,360
♫  You  ♫

490
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,500
♫  The moment I see you  ♫

491
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,000
♫  The moment I think of you  ♫

492
00:43:17,568 --> 00:43:23,652
♫  The moment I hear any news of you  ♫

493
00:43:23,652 --> 00:43:29,572
♫  My heart is touched  ♫

494
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:33,632
♫  My mind is occupied  ♫

495
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:36,096
♫  Go  ♫

496
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:38,212
♫  Where to go?  ♫

497
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:42,240
♫  How to escape?  ♫

498
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,324
♫  Those memories of you  ♫

499
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:52,292
♫  They have drowned me  ♫

500
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:58,208
♫  I can't let go  ♫

501
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,628
♫  I remain silent  ♫

502
00:44:02,628 --> 00:44:06,112
♫  My words stuck in my throat  ♫

503
00:44:06,112 --> 00:44:12,192
♫  Maybe this will end the sorrow  ♫

504
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:16,353
♫  Pretending to be determined  ♫

505
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:22,000
♫  I'm still trapped at the starting point  ♫

506
00:44:24,102 --> 00:44:27,237
♫  The most perfect lie  ♫

507
00:44:27,237 --> 00:44:30,293
♫  I even deceived myself  ♫

508
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:36,860
♫  If love means letting go, let's sever all connections  ♫

509
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,504
♫  But why...  ♫

510
00:44:39,504 --> 00:44:42,624
♫  The moment tears fall  ♫

511
00:44:42,624 --> 00:44:47,377
♫  I don't want you to leave  ♫
