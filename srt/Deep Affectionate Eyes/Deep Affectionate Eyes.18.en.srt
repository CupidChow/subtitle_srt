ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>DEEP AFFECTION EYES</i>
BY ER DONG TU ZI ON JJWXC.NET

2
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,960
I thought you said you couldn't drive.
Still lying to me?

3
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,440
That surveillance footage
is in my possession.

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,280
I'll get it to you.

5
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,200
The club video

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,000
involves both Wang Xingsheng
and Li Lingbai.

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,240
And with Wang Xingsheng missing,

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
I didn't want you to keep investigating

9
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,880
because I feared
Li Lingbai would target you.

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,760
About my mother's death…

11
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,000
You were the witness, weren't you?

12
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,120
Back then, I only saw the license plate
number of Wang Xingsheng's car.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
Why did you retract your testimony?

14
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,280
At that time, Li Lingbai
provided him with an alibi.

15
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,000
It was pouring rain,
so I started doubting my own eyes.

16
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
I really don't know
if I should believe this.

17
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Ye Meng.

18
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,600
I've already lost my dad.

19
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,240
I can't bear to lose you too.

20
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,160
Jinyu, stop the car now.

21
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,760
- Dad.
- Hm.

22
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,160
I need to ask you something.

23
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,360
Go ahead and ask.

24
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,240
Am I not…

25
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,960
your biological son?

26
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,320
So you knew all along I wasn't your son,

27
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,560
and kept it hidden from me all this time.

28
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,200
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

29
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,240
I've always treated you as my own child.

30
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,760
But I'm not!

31
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
And my biological father,
who is he really?

32
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,160
Why has he never appeared all these years?

33
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,240
What about Mom?

34
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,840
Has she always hated me
because of him too?

35
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,720
Jinyu, stop asking these questions.

36
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
Just know that I am your father!

37
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,360
I just want to know the truth!

38
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,800
Jinyu, look out!

39
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,880
I've always wondered.

40
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,040
If I'd been capable
of protecting him back then…

41
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
would things have turned out differently?

42
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,360
Yu.

43
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,320
Yu, wake up.

44
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,200
Yu.

45
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,560
Yu, wake up. Yu!

46
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,680
Yu, wake up.

47
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,120
Yu!

48
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Hey!

49
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
Yu!

50
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,120
Jinyu!

51
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,800
Yu!

52
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,680
Yu, wake up! Wake up!

53
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,640
Jinyu!

54
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,920
Jinyu!

55
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,160
Get out, now!

56
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,520
Dad!

57
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,320
Get moving now!

58
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,520
Come with me, quick!

59
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,320
Go!

60
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,680
Get out now, Dad!

61
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,880
Jinyu, leave me!

62
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,919
Leave me!

63
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
Dad!

64
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,240
I know…

65
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,400
I've hidden so much from you…

66
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,240
and my ways
of protecting you were extreme.

67
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,600
But…

68
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,640
I've never liked anyone before.

69
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,680
It's the first time.

70
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,880
That's why I'm truly scared now.

71
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,520
I can't bear to lose someone I love again.

72
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Stop driving.

73
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,400
Your skills are worse than mine.

74
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,960
Get out of the car.

75
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,560
Seated properly?

76
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
Still replacing the project lead?

77
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,800
No more changes.

78
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm such a genius!

79
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,640
This pink flower needs to be more visible.

80
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,480
- Okay.
- Move that one forward a bit.

81
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,560
The "E" in "LOVE" has to pop.

82
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,880
Make it pop.

83
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,000
Charge for Love.

84
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,480
Gou.

85
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,240
How does it look?

86
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,280
Change of plans.

87
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,480
- Let's pull back for now.
- What do you mean? What's going on?

88
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,720
Li Jinyu showed up out of nowhere.

89
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,320
I invited him for the team building.

90
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,960
Are you out of your mind?

91
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,800
Find another room and set up
the confession scene. Understood?

92
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,320
I told you it was irresponsible
to confess here!

93
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,440
- Too prone to mishaps.
- Understood?

94
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,600
I… I get it.

95
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,360
Pulling back now. Pulling back!

96
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,640
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Hurry up!

97
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,760
Okay.

98
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,960
I'm heading out first.

99
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,120
Where are the balloons?

100
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,920
Wait. It is a match between us.
Why are you driving?

101
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,080
Watching you race
got me itching to drive too.

102
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,760
Congratulations, Mr. Gou, on the win.

103
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
Let's go. Everyone's already
gathered for the team building.

104
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Why are you tagging along?
This is an internal event.

105
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,120
What? The client's not welcome?

106
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,000
Everyone's here already.

107
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,120
- Mr. Gou.
- Mr. Gou.

108
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,280
- This armor is incredibly accurate.
- En did great today.

109
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,320
Learn well from your boss,
but skip the temper part,

110
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,200
- okay?
- Okay.

111
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,000
Mr. Gou still has jokes.
That was a pointed remark.

112
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,920
Drink more today. Cheer up.

113
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,960
Mr. Gou and I have something to discuss.
You all keep chatting.

114
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,120
- Okay.
- Fine. Talk later.

115
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,360
- Waiting for you, Mr. Gou. Hurry up.
- Hm.

116
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm all set.

117
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,200
Where though?

118
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,960
Take me upstairs.

119
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,600
Come in.

120
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,240
Hello. We're pretty much done here.

121
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,560
- Thank you. You may go now.
- Okay.

122
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,560
- Appreciate the hard work.
- Thanks.

123
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,200
- You're welcome.
- Come here.

124
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,120
So? How is it?

125
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,440
Romantic or not?

126
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,040
Look at this.

127
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,520
Charge for Love, little warrior.

128
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,280
- Be your own sun.
- You made it?

129
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
You put real heart into this.

130
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,240
Told you, bro.

131
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
Only I can pull this off.

132
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,520
No one else could've nailed

133
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,600
every detail like this.

134
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,720
What is this thing? So ugly.

135
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,040
Who brought it?

136
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,280
A camera? That's just creepy.

137
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,240
I brought it.

138
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,040
If you don't know
how to talk properly, then shut up.

139
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560
It really doesn't fit well here, though.

140
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,360
That narcissistic?

141
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,800
You need to record a confession?

142
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
What do you know?

143
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,640
When Ye Meng and I are together,
all this will be our precious memories.

144
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,800
Is this even appropriate?

145
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,480
Ye Meng isn't divorced yet.

146
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
Aren't you afraid of karma for doing this?

147
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,960
Let me put it this way.

148
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,640
That Cheng Kairan is just
a money-grubbing loafer.

149
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,280
I told him to divorce Ye Meng, and he had
the nerve to demand five million from me.

150
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,520
Five million! Is he insane?

151
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,960
That's certainly not a small amount.

152
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,000
Right? So, it's normal
for me to bargain with him, isn't it?

153
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,360
And he called me an idiot! Is he crazy?

154
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,000
That's too much.

155
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,680
Ye Meng is kept in the dark
and can't see his true colors.

156
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,520
So, I'm recording this video
to send to her husband.

157
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,480
Make him face reality and give up sooner.

158
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,680
Sound right?

159
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,560
You're actually sending it to her husband?

160
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,760
That's downright unethical!

161
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,080
Unethical?

162
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,040
Still want your bonus or not?

163
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,960
Perfect spot.

164
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,640
Perfect.

165
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,120
I'll help you figure out
how to connect it right now.

166
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,040
And…

167
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,520
During dinner, remember to…

168
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,840
Set the mood.

169
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,120
Feel the vibe, got it?

170
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,120
- Get it done.
- Of course.

171
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,360
Ye Meng.

172
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,320
Look, the ocean is so clear,

173
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,280
just like my love for you,

174
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,320
pure and flawless, so innocent,

175
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,040
without a single blemish.

176
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I love you.

177
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
I love you.

178
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
CHARGE FOR LOVE

179
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,160
How come you came

180
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,520
- to the team building today?
- After all, our two companies

181
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,040
are collaborating. Just here
to get to know everyone better.

182
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,520
Wonderful. So delighted to have you here.

183
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Bonus.

184
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,080
Everyone's had their fill of fun,

185
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,040
food, and drinks, right?

186
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,200
How about some mini-games?

187
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
Mini-games.

188
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,560
Ye Meng.

189
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,440
Come. Sit!

190
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,600
With such a big group,

191
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,760
let's keep it simple.

192
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
How about some corporate-style

193
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,640
Truth or Dare?

194
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,440
You in?

195
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,480
Is everyone feeling uncomfortable
with me around?

196
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,040
- No, not at all!
- Of course not!

197
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
Good to know.

198
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,680
- So, you're up to it, right?
- Of course.

199
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,440
- Sure.
- Alright.

200
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,320
Take a look.

201
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,880
Then, who wants to go first?

202
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,680
Mr. Gou,

203
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,320
- why don't you draw first?
- Fine.

204
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,680
Let me demonstrate.

205
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,200
Okay,

206
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,920
just randomly pick one.

207
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Any card.

208
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,160
Let me see. Quite a lot of text here.

209
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,920
So, it says, "Tai Mingxiao

210
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,840
is Gou Kai's right-hand man,

211
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,080
highly favored.

212
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,320
But since Ye Meng arrived,

213
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,760
you've suddenly fallen out of grace.

214
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,240
Mr. Gou, are you into Ye Meng?"

215
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,000
What kind of question is this?
Does this even exist?

216
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,960
Stop making things up.

217
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,080
How could there be?

218
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,640
If there is, just say it outright. Right?

219
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,280
There is.

220
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,200
- There is.
- There is.

221
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,400
Well, Mingxiao doesn't usually lie.

222
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,240
Fine, I'll answer it.

223
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,800
Yes, I like her.

224
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,840
Don't you all like her too?

225
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,840
Yes. Who wouldn't like Ms. Ye?

226
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,720
- We definitely like her.
- Of course, we like her.

227
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
As a boss,

228
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,160
it's only natural to favor
those with stronger skills.

229
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
Next.

230
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,600
Let's keep going in order.

231
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,600
I'll wait a bit.

232
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
- I'll go first then.
- Alright.

233
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,640
- Jinyu goes first.
- First card.

234
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,960
First card.

235
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,960
"Do you support office romance?"

236
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,280
Absolutely not! Our company
is too traditional for that.

237
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,200
I support it,

238
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,640
as long as it doesn't interfere with work.

239
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,440
How can you still support this?

240
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,840
Do you have a crush on someone? Who is it?

241
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,880
Mr. Li, who do you have a crush on?

242
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,640
- Who?
- Who?

243
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,160
Ms. Ye.

244
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,320
- He likes Ye Meng.
- Ye Meng.

245
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,800
I've answered. Your turn now.

246
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,800
Why are you talking
in such gasping phrases? You scared me.

247
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,760
Ye Meng, you're up.

248
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
This one.

249
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,880
Open questions?

250
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,520
Then let me ask one. I'm asking one.

251
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,920
Ye Meng, you're Mr. Gou's subordinate

252
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
and also Li Jinyu's Party B.

253
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
If a collaboration forced you

254
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,960
to choose between them,

255
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,760
who would you pick?

256
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,960
I choose Mr. Gou.

257
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
I'm actually a bit upset now.
That was poorly said.

258
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,880
Mr. Li, you're excellent,

259
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,840
but it would be better if you were
more tolerant toward subordinates.

260
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm stepping out for a bit.

261
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,600
Just stretching my legs.

262
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,400
Where are you off to?

263
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,240
Heading to the restroom.
Is that alright, Mr. Gou?

264
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,240
Approved.

265
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,960
Go to the room downstairs.
The restroom there is empty.

266
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,880
It's so stuffy in here. Aren't you hot
wearing that leather jacket?

267
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
Take it off and just relax.

268
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,680
Jia, take over hosting for a bit.

269
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,400
- Got it.
- Well…

270
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,200
- Shall we keep playing, Mr. Li?
- Mr. Li, are you still…

271
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,960
He's gone.

272
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,280
The boss isn't just playing games.
He's playing with our heartbeats.

273
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,160
Choosing the boss over your own husband?

274
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,360
How extra of him.

275
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,280
Jealous?

276
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,240
He's really pulling out all the stops.

277
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
Flowers, balloons, the works.

278
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,840
Seems determined to confess to you.

279
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,120
I swear to you. I had no idea beforehand.

280
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,080
And…

281
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
I haven't fully forgiven you yet.

282
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
Can you forgive me now?

283
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,120
Not afraid of being seen?

284
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
Don't you think
this makes it more thrilling?

285
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,840
Gou Kai.

286
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,560
You're digging your own grave.

287
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
<i>What's wrong?</i>

288
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,880
Just thinking about
how Gou Kai looked at you,

289
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,160
I want to gouge his eyes out.

290
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,600
Quite the possessive streak.

291
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,560
Why compare yourself to him?

292
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,880
I'd go with you anytime.

293
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,840
<i>Bro, I'm going in.</i>

294
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,160
Damn!

295
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,240
Wait!

296
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
Gou, don't!

297
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Are you insane?

298
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,200
You can't go in!
It's not ready inside yet!

299
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,400
I saw Ye Meng go in. Move!

300
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,880
Get up!

301
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,400
I have something very,
very important to say.

302
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,960
It determines whether we can still

303
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,720
be brothers going forward.

304
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,560
I just want to advise you.
Maybe call off today's confession.

305
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,280
She's married.
What's good about that? Right?

306
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,640
Don't tell me
you have a thing for Ye Meng too?

307
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,280
- Why would I compete with you for a woman?
- "You guys"?

308
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,080
No.

309
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,920
I'm doing this for your own good.

310
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,160
If it's for my good, move aside.

311
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,920
Stop with this nonsense.

312
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,560
Gou!

313
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Listen to me. Don't go!

314
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,840
Don't!

315
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
Let's go home.

316
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,480
Don't go!

317
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,200
- Don't!
- Let go of me.

318
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,560
Don't go!

319
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,560
Don't!

320
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,080
Don't go!

321
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,640
Don't!

322
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,000
Where is she?

323
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,080
She's gone. Told you it wasn't ready.

324
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,840
Can't be.

325
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,720
She just entered the room.

326
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,720
She said she had an emergency and left.

327
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,160
She absolutely
did not leave with Li Jinyu.

328
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,720
Really, I swear.

329
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,400
- Where are you going?
- To check the surveillance footage.

330
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,240
Gou!

331
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,320
Gou!

332
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,520
Th-This… The surveillance system

333
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,080
broke down. Nothing was recorded.

334
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,680
Are you hiding something from me?

335
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,280
- No.
- Are you sure?

336
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,720
No. Really, no.

337
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,120
Let me see that.

338
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,800
- The computer's broken.
- What's wrong with it?

339
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,320
It looks perfectly fine though.

340
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,920
What do you mean?

341
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,760
It's broken.

342
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Broken?

343
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,360
Little thing, come here.

344
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,920
- Come on.
- Don't come any closer.

345
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,040
Listen to me! Listen!

346
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,520
Don't be angry!

347
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,920
Listen!

348
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,480
I just thought it through carefully.

349
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,840
Today's not the right day
for a confession.

350
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,080
I had everything ready,
and you're telling me now?

351
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,160
I'm on your side, really!

352
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,640
But think about it.

353
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
Even if Ye Meng's husband is the worst,

354
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,760
they're still married.

355
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,880
You have no idea how they interact

356
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,440
or what their relationship is like.

357
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,920
Aren't you just breaking up a family?

358
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,040
Finished talking?

359
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,600
Let me see if I can fix it.

360
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,600
I told you it's broken.

361
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,280
Wouldn't believe me, would you?

362
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,480
You only get one shot at a confession.

363
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,440
It has to hit perfectly.

364
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,040
Now the enemy's hidden,
while we're exposed.

365
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
You need to infiltrate their camp
and dismantle it from within.

366
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,320
Don't let Ye Meng think

367
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,760
we have questionable character.

368
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
Or everything will fall apart.

369
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,560
Understand?

370
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,280
I've got your back!

371
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,680
I'm going to find out

372
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,760
what's really up with her husband.

373
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,840
Wait for me to come back.

374
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,240
Move aside.

375
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,320
Send me her husband's information.

376
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,920
GEM MUSIC BAR

377
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
WELCOME

378
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,240
Where's your boss?

379
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,720
The one on the sofa, in the white pants.

380
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,320
Right. We need to find a good designer.

381
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,720
So, you're Ye Meng's husband?

382
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,000
Why this endless nonsense again?

383
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,920
Hello. I'm Tai Mingxiao,
a friend of Ye Meng's.

384
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,360
She got married without a word to anyone.
I just wanted to say hello to you.

385
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,560
Come, sit down. Let's talk over drinks.

386
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,840
Your bar is quite spacious.

387
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,880
Business must be good.
You're usually busy, right?

388
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
I'll be blunt.

389
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,520
As I said last time,
the minimum is 2.5 million.

390
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,240
Not a cent less. I have principles.

391
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,280
What 2.5 million?

392
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,840
I wasn't discussing money with you.

393
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,920
I just genuinely wanted to talk about
Ye Meng's relationship issues.

394
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,760
Now you're not even
offering money? Just talking?

395
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,160
No way.

396
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,520
I'll never leave Ye Meng.
Don't even think about it.

397
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,440
That's more like it, buddy!

398
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,080
But you can't just talk the talk.
You need to make time for her.

399
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,760
She doesn't need my company anyway.

400
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,840
Buddy,

401
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,320
just because she says she doesn't
need you around doesn't mean you bail.

402
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,520
Listen, women are no different from men.

403
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
You have to keep an eye on her.
Can't give too much freedom.

404
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,400
Especially someone like Ye Meng,
so good-looking.

405
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,080
She's got plenty of guys orbiting her.

406
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,880
If you're not watching,

407
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,600
are you really at ease?

408
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,440
Yes.

409
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,280
I know her better than anyone.

410
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,520
"Know her better than anyone"?

411
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,080
Buddy, you're sporting
a pasture so green on your head,

412
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,320
and you still think you know her?

413
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,080
What did you just say?

414
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,320
I'm saying you know her,
but you don't know the people around her.

415
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,160
What if she runs

416
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,120
into those pushy types

417
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,040
who just want to latch on?

418
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,920
The kind who'd steal your partner?
Shouldn't you be cautious?

419
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,240
What's Gou Kai up to again?

420
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,400
Gou Kai?

421
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,800
Didn't you just say…

422
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,480
someone's latching onto her
and trying to steal her?

423
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,800
That's literally Gou Kai.

424
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,520
And honestly,

425
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,000
Ye Meng would never be into him.

426
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,720
If he actually manages to steal her,

427
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,160
I, Cheng Kairan,
will spell my name backwards.

428
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,640
Now, let's drink to that.

429
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,880
Not Gou Kai. I never mentioned him.

430
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,640
So, there's some new character now?

431
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,720
I…

432
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,320
Buddy.

433
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,960
This time, it's someone
even more troublesome than Gou Kai.

434
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,440
Any woman would fall for him.

435
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,720
One of the Four Heavenly Kings?

436
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,720
Ever heard of Hailan Port?

437
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,960
They have a new person in charge,

438
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,760
the eldest son of Hanhai Group,
Li Jinyu. Do you know him?

439
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,360
- Li Jinyu.
- That's the one.

440
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,200
I thought you were talking
about someone else.

441
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,360
We're bros.

442
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,480
Buddy, beware of fires,
thieves, and your bros.

443
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,560
The closer the bro,
the more you need to watch out.

444
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,320
Buddy, I know you mean well,

445
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,840
but Li Jinyu's fine.

446
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,160
We don't distinguish
between yours and mine.

447
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,360
Buddy, you…

448
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,800
Your game is so wild now?

449
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,480
What does this have to do with games?

450
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,400
You need to broaden your perspective.

451
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,680
Widen it.

452
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,920
If you're really that free,

453
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,920
go worry about your so-called…

454
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,920
Boss Gou.

455
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,440
Go bother with his issues.

456
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,680
The perspective is broad.

457
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,320
Broad to the point of madness!
This world's gone insane.

458
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,800
How did Ye Meng fall so low
to end up with someone like you?

459
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,440
What are you saying to me?

460
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,120
If you've got nothing better to do,
I'll attend to other business.

461
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,320
Well…

462
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,679
- Opening a bottle for you.
- Thanks.

463
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Drink here.

464
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,080
- Have him settle the bill later.
- Got it.

465
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,080
Really, buddy?

466
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,400
- Not opened yet.
- Scan to pay here later.

467
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,040
What?

468
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,239
I need to wash my hands too.

469
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,600
Fine.

470
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,680
Should be just us now, right?

471
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,000
Li Jinyu!

472
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,320
Li Jinyu!

473
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,880
Hurry! Go!

474
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,880
Faster, Li Jinyu, faster!

475
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,160
The dog is biting me!

476
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
The dog is biting me.

477
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,440
What are you doing here?

478
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,840
Airhead!

479
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,480
What's going on with you and Ye Meng?

480
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,520
Pretending.

481
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Pretending?

482
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,720
In that room, you two…

483
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,360
I saw everything.

484
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,040
- You saw?
- Saw everything.

485
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,240
- I'm too embarrassed to even say it.
- Just as well.

486
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,080
What's "just as well" about it?

487
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,200
I wish I'd gone blind,
seen nothing at all!

488
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,160
How could you fall this low, airhead?

489
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,680
Yes, you're a man, I get it.

490
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,080
Ye Meng's gorgeous with a killer body.

491
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
Facing such a beauty,
you can lose control.

492
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
But she's married.

493
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,840
And her husband…

494
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,800
Her husband doesn't care.

495
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,400
Even if her husband doesn't care,
the three of you can't just live together!

496
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,720
That's chaos!

497
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,200
And Ye Meng too, how did she fall so far?

498
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,280
Who are you calling "fallen"?

499
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,400
You….

500
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,400
Are you living together?

501
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,280
You three are playing way too dirty!

502
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,240
You're the dirty one!

503
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,480
What Ye Meng and I have is reasonable,
legitimate, and legal. Get it?

504
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,480
"Reasonable and legal"?

505
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,400
Li Jinyu, is that human language? You…

506
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,080
You're eagerly breaking up a family,

507
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,800
and she's having an affair.

508
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,160
Have you ever considered the poor husband

509
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,040
on that marriage certificate?

510
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,960
Husband,

511
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,800
do you feel pitiful?

512
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,680
A little.

513
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,120
After all, I have such a beautiful wife
but can't proclaim it to the world.

514
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,640
Morality decays and virtue collapses!

515
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,560
Li Jinyu, you…

516
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,480
You little homewrecker! Have you no shame?

517
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,320
I'll get it. Wait here.

518
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,720
Where are you going?

519
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,120
I'm still right here!
Could you show some respect?

520
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,560
At least for the sake of our friendship.

521
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,000
- What is it?
- Open it and see.

522
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,800
Marriage certificate.

523
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,680
Look closely.

524
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,200
Married couple.

525
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,640
Li Jin…

526
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,360
Yu!

527
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,600
Exactly.

528
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,800
I am that very "pitiful husband
of Ye Meng" you've been talking about.

529
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,080
How did this happen?

530
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

531
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,520
So, you're

532
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,280
secretly married?

533
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,560
Why keep it hidden?

534
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,000
Is it related to Wang Xingsheng?

535
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,640
And…

536
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,320
what's that buddy
Cheng Kairan's role in all this?

537
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,480
It was all to investigate Wang Xingsheng.
Kai was just a decoy.

538
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,440
Understood.

539
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,240
Hailan Port is about to open.
Li Lingbai will soon arrive in Ningsui.

540
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,080
So, my relationship with Ye Meng
must remain confidential.

541
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,280
Alright.

542
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,400
Fine.

543
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,040
If you needed to keep it secret,
why tell me?

544
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,360
Now I know too much.

545
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,240
What if your mom comes after me?
I'd be in real danger.

546
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,160
Exactly. So, you have a choice.

547
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,640
Help us keep the secret

548
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,640
or--

549
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,000
Stop acting
like you're so democratic, okay?

550
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,360
What choice do I actually have?

551
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,560
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Not hard work.

552
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,560
Just a hard life.

553
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,440
Stay safe.

554
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,840
