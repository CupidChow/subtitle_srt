 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,804
♫  I still remember it clearly  ♫

3
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:15,418
♫  Your eyes sparkled back then  ♫

4
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:20,703
♫  The way you lit up when telling me you loved me  ♫

5
00:00:20,703 --> 00:00:25,784
♫  But over time, you've forgotten  ♫

6
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:31,132
♫  Promises left behind at every twist in life  ♫

7
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:34,620
♫  Only memories remain like scattered fireworks  ♫

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,184
♫  When I turned to walk away  ♫

9
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:42,816
♫  If I could go back to the day we said goodbye  ♫

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:48,788
♫  I'd never let go of your hand  ♫

11
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:53,924
♫  I can't hide the flutters in my heart  ♫

12
00:00:53,924 --> 00:01:01,104
♫  I'm about to be out of control as breathing turns weightless  ♫

13
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:05,904
♫  All I possess is drowned by the me who still loves you deeply  ♫

14
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:11,268
♫  I'll never changed even if miracles exist  ♫

15
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:15,351
♫  Don't forget, our promises will be kept  ♫

16
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:20,510
♫  And the dream where I'm with you  ♫

17
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,953
   

18
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,900
   

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:39,210



20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,000
Ye Meng, you don't need to resign.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,100
After all, this isn't your first loss to me.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,000
Wait, you're better than me at flirting with men.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,632
However, Gou Kai doesn't fall for it.

24
00:01:56,632 --> 00:02:00,512
Jiang Lu Zhi, I know you love scum.

25
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:04,352
But don't use scum to disgust me, all right?

26
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:08,752
You're pretending not to care when rejected. It's so typical of you.

27
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,872
It's good for you to return home.

28
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:12,752
Since Gou Kai and I are together now,

29
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:16,900
it’s not suitable for you to stay.

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,300
How petty. Men are all you care about.

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,200
What's that supposed to mean?

32
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,592
Seems you're still clueless.

33
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:33,772
I've introduced the clients you stole from me to competitors.

34
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:38,600
Next time you scheme, you'd better know who you're dealing with.

35
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,900
 Jia Yu, help me with something. 

36
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,672
Leave the big box. It's fine.

37
00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:05,372
- Take this upstairs. 
 - Okay.

38
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,200
Thanks.

39
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:13,512
- Hello? 
 -  Ya En, it's me. 

40
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:17,512
Cheng Kai Ran, what's up?

41
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:19,932
 I hear Ye Meng is returning to Ningsui. 

42
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:22,652
You haven't let it go after all these years?

43
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:26,492
She's not coming back. She called me days ago. She said she bought a house in Jiangbei.

44
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:28,650
I don't think she...

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,700
- be back. 
  - What did you say? 

46
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:34,972
 Ya En. 

47
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:37,872
- I'm busy now. Talk later. 
 -  Hello? 

48
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,900
Ye Meng!

49
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,432
Fang Ya En!

50
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,732
Why are you back?

51
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:48,192
Just now, Cheng Kai Ran called me,

52
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:50,612
saying you're coming back. I couldn't believe it at first.

53
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:52,652
After all these years, he still won't let go.

54
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:54,252
How long are you staying this time?

55
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:57,292
I'll stay for a while. I resigned.

56
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:59,600
Lend me your concealer.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,200
Why did you quit suddenly?

58
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,272
You got beaten up? By whom?

59
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:10,352
Man or woman? Did you fight back? Did you call the police?

60
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:13,000
With your personality, you won't take it lying down.

61
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:19,632
You didn't become a mistress, did you?

62
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:22,592
You suddenly quit and got beaten.

63
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:27,292
Listen, as your best friend, I can accept you dating 13 guys.

64
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,512
But I can't watch you become a homewrecker.

65
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:32,692
Fang Ya En, have some faith in me!

66
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:36,992
Do you think my morals are that low? Why not say men are lining up to have me?

67
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:41,092
Here you are. Now, tell me who it was.

68
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,130
You want to know?

69
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,270
- I'm not telling you. 
 - You won't tell me?

70
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,812
- You don't love me anymore! 
 - Don't hit me.

71
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:51,812
- Here. 
 - Almost done.

72
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:57,870
   

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,100
Coming!

74
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,800
Gorgeous! Come in quickly.

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,372
Careful, it's heavy.

76
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:13,172
- You're back. 
 - You've lost weight.

77
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:16,192
We ordered your favorite dish, Nantang Crab.

78
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,312
Mom.

79
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:20,072
Meng, did you buy the limited-edition item I wanted?

80
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:22,172
Sure. It's in my suitcase. I'll give it to you later.

81
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,572
- Perfect! Thanks. 
 - It was hard to buy.

82
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:28,512
Sister, add another dish. Dr. Gao will be here soon.

83
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:30,612
Which Dr. Gao?

84
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:33,412
No one special. Just a client of mine.

85
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,992
- Auntie, what's this about? 
 - Nothing much.

86
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:39,112
Just a nice young man.

87
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:44,152
He is a doctor, a kind-hearted man. He just brought me a big deal last week.

88
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:48,052
Now that you're back, it's a good opportunity for you to make new friends.

89
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:51,312
Come on. I just got back, and you're already setting me up?

90
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:56,572
Second Sister, I'm surprised you never miss a chance to promote your business, do you?

91
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:59,172
You think I'm that petty?

92
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,712
Listen, I'm not in the mood for this.

93
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:04,352
If you push me, I'll leave right now.

94
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:07,772
- No one's forcing you! 
 - Enough. Be quiet!

95
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,632
Listen to me.

96
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:12,852
Meng, our guest, will be here soon.

97
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:18,292
We can't be rude. Meeting him once won't hurt.

98
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:21,872
Unfortunately, our family doesn't have many children.

99
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:26,092
Your aunts have no children. And your dad only had you.

100
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:32,192
We've been expecting you to return and have a baby.

101
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,272
- Enough. Go with your aunt. 
 - Come on.

102
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,632
Go inside.

103
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,552
You should remove your makeup.

104
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:50,532
Meng, how's this room? Your eldest aunt bought it for you.

105
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,052
Meng, wash your face and take off your makeup, okay?

106
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:55,992
- All right, I get it. 
 - Let me help you.

107
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:59,872
Understood. I'll wait outside.

108
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,872
Hurry up!

109
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,600
Coming!

110
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:19,312
- Dr. Gao, welcome. Come on in! 
 - Hello.

111
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:22,792
 Meng, come quick! Dr. Gao's here. Come out! 

112
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,812
 Welcome! Please sit. 

113
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,032
 Dr. Gao, please, have a seat. 

114
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:34,492
Look how thoughtful Dr. Gao is. He brought so many gifts.

115
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:37,892
- Sit down. 
 - Madam, please.

116
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:47,452
 - Meng.  
 - Okay, coming.

117
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,472
She just came back. She's dressing up.

118
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:53,752
Dr. Gao, which department are you in?

119
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:55,952
Orthopedics.

120
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:58,032
It must be an exhausting job.

121
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:00,732
It's fine. I was in cardiac surgery before.

122
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,772
Would you like a banana? Here, have one.

123
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:04,352
- I want one too. 
 - No, thanks.

124
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:07,312
Give it to me. I'll eat it.

125
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,932
What?

126
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:11,732
Coming.

127
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:16,152
- Your delivery. 
 - Okay. Thanks.

128
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:19,312
Meng Meng, your food is here.

129
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:21,392
Coming!

130
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:23,492
Almost ready!

131
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,392
Hey, can you help me?

132
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:45,092
- Let me pour for you. 
 - No problem.

133
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:07,500
Thanks. I made my clothes dirty.

134
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,410
You look skinny, but you're strong.

135
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:27,812
Meng, come on.

136
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,860
   

137
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:33,832
   

138
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:37,112
Why's this a barbecue stall now? Wasn't this Nantang Crab before?

139
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:41,072
Nantang Crab moved long ago. Several shops have come and gone here.

140
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:44,472
- Do you know where it moved to? 
 - How would I know?

141
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,050
All right. Thanks.

142
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:55,652
 Where did you go? Dr. Gao is waiting for you. Come back now. 

143
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:58,352
I'm taking Ya En to the hospital. We'll be there soon.

144
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:01,812
Take good care of Dr. Gao. I'll treat him to dinner next time.

145
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:24,128
   

146
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:33,400
What are you staring at?

147
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,330
Don't look, or I'll charge you.

148
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,872
Your QR code doesn't even work. How could you charge me?

149
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:43,332
You can't afford to date without money.

150
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:47,990
Gotta go. I'm busy. Bye.

151
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:54,740
We meet again.

152
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,672
Want to friend me on WeChat?

153
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:07,232
No. I'm looking for Nantang Crab, but the QR code doesn't work.

154
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:08,930
That shop moved.

155
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:12,012
- Far away? 
 - Pretty far.

156
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,920
Are you heading back? Give me a ride.

157
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:20,220
Is my home not on your way?

158
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:56,692
   

159
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,892
Here you go.

160
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:03,040
Enjoy your meal. Let me clear the table for you. All right.

161
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,432
Thanks.

162
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:15,050
No problem.

163
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,852
Excuse me, one crab rice.

164
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:20,890
Coming right up.

165
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:23,812
Here you go.

166
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:26,212
- Thanks. 
 - Be careful. It's hot. No problem.

167
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:29,332
Jin Yu, you're back. Thankfully, you returned today.

168
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:32,132
Otherwise, with your cousin away, no one could help me with deliveries.

169
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,770
The food's inside. Come get it.

170
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:41,932
- Hello? 
  - I just saw your message. 

171
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:46,072
That crab restaurant we used to go to moved due to poor business.

172
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:48,332
I'll ask around tomorrow about the exact new location.

173
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:50,112
No need. I found it.

174
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,180
 How did you find it? 

175
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:55,660
I asked a "little brother."

176
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,630
"A little brother"?

177
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,730
Romantic encounter?

178
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:05,380
Why are you so confident about local boys?

179
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:11,212
 By the way, if my grandma calls you, tell her you broke a bone. 

180
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:13,570
Again?

181
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,330
How many times have you made the same excuses?

182
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,472
 Does your grandma think I'm surviving on sheer willpower? 

183
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:21,832
Thanks in advance.

184
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:23,520
Bye.

185
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:28,780
Mom.

186
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:34,540
Don't touch me.

187
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:43,690
Hi, can I friend you on WeChat?

188
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:50,480
Done. Thanks.

189
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:53,780
I did it.

190
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,660
   

191
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,540
   

192
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:53,260
Stop.

193
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,850
Come here!

194
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,590
What's wrong?

195
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:03,932
You are still up?

196
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:07,212
Careful with dark circles. Otherwise, I'll have to buy eye cream for you.

197
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:08,912
What's wrong with you?

198
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:12,832
Yes, I took the chance to discuss business with him today

199
00:16:12,832 --> 00:16:15,192
and asked him to promote health products for me.

200
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,952
You can't see my good intentions, can you?

201
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:20,592
I just wanted to introduce you to a good man.

202
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,080
Mom.

203
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:30,572
Our family never breaks promises.

204
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:35,092
How dare you jump out the window when we have a guest!

205
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:37,252
You've embarrassed me.

206
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:39,092
Can we make this quick?

207
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:42,432
I'm exhausted from the flight. I want to sleep in the old house, okay?

208
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:45,372
Meng Meng, your grandma moved in with us.

209
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,792
Why go back to the old house? That old house is falling apart.

210
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,832
Are you avoiding Dr. Gao's visit?

211
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:53,932
No, I just don't think he is right for me.

212
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:58,392
Didn't I tell you? I prefer younger men.

213
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,092
Younger men? Why?

214
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:04,132
So, you can make trouble together after marriage?

215
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:07,492
- Mom, I can't agree with you. 
 - Shut up, you moron.

216
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:09,252
Just go to sleep.

217
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:12,730
You speak.

218
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:16,352
How much younger exactly?

219
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:19,092
There's no fixed rule. One year younger is fine.

220
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:21,670
Even seven or eight years younger works.

221
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:24,992
You...

222
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:27,692
Oh, right, Ya En is still hospitalized.

223
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:31,692
- Her leg's broken. I should bring her something. 
 - Get back.

224
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:36,692
I called her. She's perfectly fine.

225
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,772
I'm furious.

226
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:42,790
Don't be mad, Mom.

227
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,832
What's this? Who is it?

228
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:57,580
Fang Ya En actually broke her leg.

229
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:08,790
What happened to you?

230
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:12,892
Ye Meng, you jinxed me! Look at my foot!

231
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,652
- What did the doctor say? 
 - It will take a while to recover.

232
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:18,570
Ye Meng?

233
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,830
You're Mrs. Ye's granddaughter, right?

234
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:26,132
- Yes. 
 - Ye Meng.

235
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:31,052
It's been six years since you moved from the old house.

236
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:33,852
- Mrs. Tou? 
 - Sure.

237
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:35,672
Yes, we haven't met in years.

238
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:38,292
- You're so pretty. Let me introduce him to you. 
 - Thank you.

239
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:41,732
This is my grandson, Li Ba Dou.

240
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:45,952
Say hello to her. She's our former neighbor.

241
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:49,252
He came to Ningsui after you left for Jiangbei for school.

242
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:52,392
You've never met him. Ba Dou, say hi to her.

243
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:54,070
Hello.

244
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,532
Don't mind him. He's a quiet boy.

245
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:02,720
He's terrible at talking and tight-lipped.

246
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:08,052
It's okay. Mrs. Tou, how did you hurt your leg?

247
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:12,372
I slipped while tidying up the greenhouse two days ago.

248
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:13,872
Be more careful.

249
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:16,790
I-I'm going to talk with my friend.

250
00:19:19,412 --> 00:19:21,912
- Come here. 
 - What?

251
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:25,850
You never noticed such a handsome boy before?

252
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:30,860
He's average-looking.

253
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:36,392
Average-looking? Your standards are too high.

254
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,370
I prefer the obedient type.

255
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,152
Ba Dou, I want to buy this wine.

256
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:45,332
We can't afford it.

257
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:48,432
You ask Jiang to buy it. She can afford it.

258
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:53,132
- Why should she buy it? 
 - Aren't you two dating?

259
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:57,892
Your birthday's coming up. Have her buy it as your gift.

260
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:01,672
We just started dating. Should I really ask for gifts?

261
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:05,872
- Do you think that's appropriate? 
 - If you don't like her, tell me.

262
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,632
I'll introduce you to someone else.

263
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:12,732
Mr. Liu's granddaughter is good.

264
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:16,872
She has a house, a car, and doesn't want a bride price.

265
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:19,872
She can even give you 300,000 as dowry.

266
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:22,352
Why don't you just sell me off then?

267
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:26,252
Whatever price you set, the money is yours.

268
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:30,052
You can eat, drink, and travel the world with that money.

269
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:34,592
I'll be some family's live-in son-in-law, taking care of their elders.

270
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:36,652
Would that satisfy you?

271
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,012
Get lost.

272
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:41,132
Mai Mai, watch Grandma. I'll go pay the bills.

273
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:45,212
Put your headphones on. We're in a hospital.

274
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:51,930
Plug them in. You know how?

275
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:55,532
He's truly handsome and tall.

276
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:59,612
- If you think he's good-looking, keep watching him. 
 - I was watching him for you.

277
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:02,612
I'm not feeling well. Stop provoking me.

278
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:07,352
Hey, is your brother really named Li Ba Dou?

279
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:10,632
That's his childhood name. He wasn't pale when he was a kid.

280
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:14,492
My grandma said he was dark and skinny.

281
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:17,352
So, we've kept calling him Ba Dou.

282
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,532
His real name is Li Jin Yu.

283
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:24,212
"Jin" in unit of weight and "Yu" as in small island.

284
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:26,130
I'm his cousin.

285
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:32,392
Your grandma mentioned his girlfriend, Sister.

286
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:36,712
- Why didn't she come? 
 - She works in Jiangbei and doesn't have time.

287
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:41,372
I actually really like her. She's beautiful and makes a seven-figure income annually.

288
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,992
Her surname is Jiang? Is she from our local area?

289
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:47,420
Yes, she's also from Ningsui.

290
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:50,152
Is her name Jiang Lu Zhi?

291
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:53,892
Yes, you know her? She's quite impressive, isn't she?

292
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:56,252
I heard her salary doubled again.

293
00:21:56,252 --> 00:22:01,652
She even switched jobs and became a manager at a service consulting company.

294
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,852
- Jihe Company? 
 - Yes, that's the name.

295
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:06,412
Wait, wasn't that your company?

296
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:10,360
Thanks, Sister. I'll leave you alone.

297
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:18,392
Did you quit because of Jiang Lu Zhi?

298
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:23,132
Exactly. She joined my company and took over my project.

299
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:28,412
Gou Kai gave her the client my team worked hard for six months to secure.

300
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:31,570
Jiang Lu Zhi hit you?

301
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,790
Don't let me see that woman.

302
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:39,540
Don't worry. She's worse than me.

303
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,632
 Let me go! 

304
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:45,672
 Jiang Lu Zhi, have you lost your mind? How dare you hit me! 

305
00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:55,372
 What are you staring at? Stop looking, or I'll gouge your eyes out! 

306
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,270
 Get out of here. 

307
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,292
Enough. Keep it down. You're disturbing others.

308
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,932
Good for you. I knew you wouldn't take bullying lying down.

309
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,092
Thank you so much.

310
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:30,492
 Wen Wen, don't panic about the contract yet. I'll ask Mr. Gou about it.  

311
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,230
 - Is he in? 
 - Yeah. 

312
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:39,792
 Are you ticklish, Mr. Gou? You're not ticklish? 

313
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:46,892
 Apologies for interrupting. Is this a good time? 

314
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,312
 Perfect timing. Let me introduce you. 

315
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:54,412
 Ye Meng, Jiang Lu Zhi, you two know each other, right? 

316
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:57,992
 Sure. Long time no see. 

317
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:02,252
 Lu Zhi officially joined our company today. 

318
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:05,170
 The project you've been following will be hers. 

319
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:07,452
 What do you mean by this? 

320
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:10,832
 My team worked on that project for half a year, and you just handed it to her? 

321
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:13,972
 Lu Zhi might communicate with the client more effectively. 

322
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:16,132
 Oh, this is how she communicates? 

323
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:20,072
 Fine. Carry on. I'm going. 

324
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,460
Kid...

325
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:40,330
Your girlfriend is Jiang Lu Zhi?

326
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:42,710
What about it?

327
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:48,472
She has another boyfriend in Jiangbei.

328
00:24:48,472 --> 00:24:50,280
So?

329
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:55,500
So, she's cheating.

330
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:04,870
Are you telling me this to help me, or do you have a grudge against her?

331
00:25:06,412 --> 00:25:08,250
Let me guess.

332
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,670
She stole your man?

333
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:21,672
You might not know this since we just met, but I'm actually scum.

334
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:26,912
If you want to watch the drama, say it outright. No need to pretend to help me.

335
00:25:26,912 --> 00:25:30,312
You're paranoid and blind.

336
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:33,212
The men she fancies aren't my type.

337
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,630
   

338
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,480
Everything's settled for you.

339
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,012
Where did you go?

340
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,950
I just paid bills.

341
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:03,972
That younger guy looked really upset when he came back earlier.

342
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:06,640
Did you do something to him?

343
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:11,992
I didn't do anything. What makes you think so?

344
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:14,312
I know you well.

345
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:16,550
What exactly do you know about me?

346
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,410
Fang Ya En.

347
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:25,372
All right, what about Jia Yu? Howa bout I take him to school tomorrow?

348
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:28,672
Don't worry about it. He's with my mom. You should head home.

349
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,540
All right, I'm leaving.

350
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,330
Get some rest early.

351
00:26:54,692 --> 00:26:58,210
Brother, do you have candy?

352
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:08,132
Candy? Your teeth are about to fall out. Aren't you scared your mom will scold you?

353
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:11,852
I didn't expect you to be so sarcastic.

354
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,272
Then, take a guess.

355
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:19,652
Which of my four pockets has candy? Guess right and it's yours.

356
00:27:19,652 --> 00:27:22,172
Liar! I bet none of them do.

357
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:25,512
I clearly saw you take it from your coat pocket.

358
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:28,952
I'm not lying. All four pockets have candy. Go on, guess.

359
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:33,560
Then... I'll pick this side.

360
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:40,350
There is!

361
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:46,270
You're the richest guy I've ever met, with candies in four pockets!

362
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,612
I don't even have pockets.

363
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:52,592
Just kidding. This is the last one. Brush your teeth after eating it.

364
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:54,972
Otherwise, all your teeth will get pulled out tomorrow.

365
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:59,172
Brother, which room are you in? Can I play with you again?

366
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:04,712
I think you're cool, dressed in black,

367
00:28:05,552 --> 00:28:10,940
like the awesome Grim Reaper from movies.

368
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:14,860
Are you trying to trick me for candies?

369
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,510
I might not come every day. It depends on my mood.

370
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,332
All right, I'm going then. Otherwise, my mom will scold me again.

371
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:25,892
Bye, Grim Reaper!

372
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:45,390
I hear you have a boyfriend in Jiangbei. Don't you give me an explanation?

373
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:23,240
I'll buy you some fruit.

374
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,680
Sure. Milk? Got it.

375
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,470
Bye.

376
00:30:02,672 --> 00:30:04,470
So heavy.

377
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:08,112
Sorry, our machine broke today. Hold on, let me calculate the price.

378
00:30:08,112 --> 00:30:09,950
All right.

379
00:30:12,632 --> 00:30:19,132
19, 40, 58,

380
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:24,412
and 55...

381
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:31,370
178.8 yuan in total.

382
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:38,560
Yes! Exactly. You got math skills.

383
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:44,672
- Thanks. 
 - Take care.

384
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,612
68 yuan in total.

385
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,380
One moment.

386
00:30:56,672 --> 00:31:01,832
After years of being a worker, I'm now serving you.

387
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:05,252
Since you jinxed me, isn't it your job to take care of me?

388
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:08,470
Sorry. What do you want to eat?

389
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:11,510
Not yet. Let me ask you a question.

390
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,890
Has Cheng Kai Ran contacted you recently?

391
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:15,592
No.

392
00:31:15,592 --> 00:31:20,470
Good. You stay home until I'm discharged.

393
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:23,900
Mrs. Tou.

394
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:39,090
Go on.

395
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,690
You know that doctor?

396
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:52,160
He keeps looking at you. You only know Li Ba Dou, right?

397
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:55,752
He's Jiang Lu Zhi's boyfriend.

398
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:58,692
Everyone around him gets crossed off my list.

399
00:31:58,692 --> 00:32:02,120
Correction, ex-boyfriend.

400
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:05,390
They broke up? Who initiated it?

401
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:10,652
Drop the act, Ye Meng.

402
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:13,032
Don't you know exactly what you did?

403
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,960
What did I do?

404
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:18,692
You're not a nosy person.

405
00:32:18,692 --> 00:32:24,892
You take it out on Li Jin Yu just because he's Jiang Lu Zhi's boyfriend, right?

406
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:27,650
How do you know they broke up?

407
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:32,608
Last night...

408
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,072
Mrs. Tou lectured Li Jin Yu all evening about their breakup.

409
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:46,212
I think Li Jin Yu is innocent.

410
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:50,952
You shouldn't have done that.

411
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:55,472
What? I helped him. He should be thankful to me.

412
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:04,472
Fine. I'll apologize to him, all right?

413
00:33:04,472 --> 00:33:08,692
Sure. I pity that poor guy.

414
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:12,352
Excuse me.

415
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:15,090
Stop hurrying me! I'm coming.

416
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,700
Got it.

417
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:19,072
I'll go out for a bit.

418
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,310
Sister.

419
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:25,592
Hey, where does Li Jin Yu work?

420
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:03,560
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers. Thanks for coming, guys.

421
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,412
What song are you singing tonight?

422
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,252
Haven't decided yet.

423
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:13,170
Kid, come out. We need to talk.

424
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:17,560
Excuse me for a moment.

425
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:34,130
What do you want?

426
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:41,850
I actually... You take the call first.

427
00:34:45,564 --> 00:34:47,090
   

428
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:49,612
Hello?

429
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:52,232
 I just saw your message. 

430
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:55,732
 - Sorry, Jin Yu. I'm currently...  
 - Congratulations.

431
00:34:55,732 --> 00:34:59,932
 I'll explain when I get back. I'm sorry. 

432
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,292
Got it. Anything else?

433
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:05,972
 Sorry, I didn't tell you sooner. I've been busy. 

434
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:09,020
 But keep this from my family for now... 

435
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:12,152
Satisfied? Now leave me alone.

436
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:16,232
Don't be like this. I know heartbreak sucks.

437
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,792
Why's there no signal?

438
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:05,472
Hey. Did a woman just leave here?

439
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:07,470
 We didn't see her. 

440
00:36:08,472 --> 00:36:10,532
Did a woman just go in here?

441
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:13,372
This is the women's restroom. What do you think?

442
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,832
Sir, the men's room is over there. Go that way.

443
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:17,732
I don't need you to tell me. Just do your job.

444
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:20,832
- Stop it, Bro. 
 - Ye Meng! Come out!

445
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:24,252
 - Let go of me! 
 - Bro. This is the women's restroom! 

446
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:28,572
Ye Meng, I know you're in there. Get out now!

447
00:36:28,572 --> 00:36:30,872
Get out of my way!

448
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:33,672
- Sir. Please don't do this. 
  - Ye Meng! 

449
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:36,532
- Is there a woman inside? Answer me! 
 - Calm down!

450
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:38,872
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't make this hard for me.

451
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:42,232
- I can't explain this to my boss. 
 - I'm the boss here.

452
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:45,472
- Let me go in! 
 - What kind of boss are you?

453
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:47,212
Let me tell you something.

454
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:50,432
10 customers a day claim to be the boss here.

455
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:53,032
- Go throw up somewhere if you're drunk. 
 - Stop it!

456
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:56,012
Move! Ye Meng, I know you're in there.

457
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:58,352
Come out immediately!

458
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:00,352
- Need help? 
 - Isn't it obvious?

459
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:03,872
- I'd appreciate it. 
 - Call me "brother."

460
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,172
I hate being called "kid."

461
00:37:07,172 --> 00:37:12,472
Wait, do you think I can't handle this without a brother's help?

462
00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:14,380
Get your hands off.

463
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:21,892
Ye Meng!

464
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:24,772
Stop staring! Hurry up!

465
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:26,772
Come on.

466
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:35,672
Push me harder. A little higher.

467
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,672
- Check the window area. 
 - Put me down!

468
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:44,692
- His men are outside. 
  - Ye Meng! 

469
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,312
Old Zhang, who hired this guy?

470
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:50,392
- Security! Get security! 
 - Where's Mr. Wang?

471
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:52,752
- This guy is harassing women! 
 - Let go of me!

472
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:56,372
- Stop it! 
 - Get off my leg! Now!

473
00:37:59,132 --> 00:38:01,060
- Come here. 
 - Ye Meng!

474
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:06,172
Ye Meng! Get out here!

475
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,452
- Ex-boyfriend? 
 - No! Think of something.

476
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,192
Take off your clothes.

477
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:21,232
What do you want?

478
00:38:23,272 --> 00:38:27,252
Take off your jacket and shoes. Wear mine.

479
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:56,552
Sit down.

480
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:06,192
Follow my lead later.

481
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:11,052
Where's Old Zhang?

482
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:13,752
- You can't barge into the women's restroom to find someone. 
 - I know.

483
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,832
Let go of me.

484
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:17,872
Who hired this stupid guy?

485
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:20,872
I'm telling you, I'm the actual owner here.

486
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:25,552
I'm going in to check if my friend is there. I'm not invading the women's restroom.

487
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:29,232
Mind your own business! Go back to your drinks.

488
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:32,452
He really is my boss. Get out of here.

489
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:37,272
And you! After getting paid tomorrow, stay out of my sight. Get lost!

490
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:39,150
Ye Meng!

491
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:44,632
- Ye Meng! 
 - What's up, Brother Kai?

492
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,452
What're you doing here?

493
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:48,552
What do you think?

494
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,032
Stop doing this in my place, okay?

495
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:55,192
- Did you see the girl who came in earlier? 
 - I didn't notice.

496
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,832
My attention was all inside. Who knew what happened outside?

497
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:00,952
- I was shouting so loud. You didn't hear anything? 
 - No.

498
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:05,152
What's your girl's name?

499
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,172
- I don't know. Never asked. 
 - You don't know?

500
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,632
- Are you kidding me? Let me see. 
 - She's getting dressed.

501
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:15,412
Just let me check if she's the girl I know. Okay?

502
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:18,312
Let me take one look.

503
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:20,292
You're actually undressed?

504
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:26,292
So sorry, Miss! You're really bold, aren't you?

505
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:29,312
All right, Brother Kai. Save me some dignity.

506
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:33,252
Look, I'm okay with getting photographed. I have a thick skin, but she doesn't.

507
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:35,932
She needs to live in this town after this, right?

508
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:38,052
Where could she even hide?

509
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:39,952
 What're you doing? 

510
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:46,192
Make way!

511
00:40:47,552 --> 00:40:49,852
Stop taking pictures!

512
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,912
He's already left.

513
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:06,912
Thanks.

514
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:12,272
