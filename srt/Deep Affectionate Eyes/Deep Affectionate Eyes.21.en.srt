2
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,880
<i>I only blacked out for a second.</i>

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,360
My blood pressure probably spiked.

4
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,200
I didn't pay much attention.

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,760
Don't act like it's such a big deal.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,600
How can we not worry?
You mean the world to us.

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,959
When Badou gets here,

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
I'll tell him I'm checking out.

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,720
Okay.

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,160
I've been stuck here for two months
with this broken leg.

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
I've had enough

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,280
of lying in bed.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,120
Nobody's making you stay here.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,080
If you want, get up and dance.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Don't think I won't.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I'll walk out this minute.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,400
See who dares stop me.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,360
Grandma,

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,560
don't start.

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,560
It's the middle of the night.
Aren't you tired yet?

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,320
- Grandma.
- Granny.

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,760
- Grandma.
- I'm dizzy.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,120
- Sit down.
- Dizzy.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,760
- Slowly.
- Careful.

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,440
The doctor told you, didn't he?

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,880
This old body

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,360
doesn't have much time left.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,240
Don't say that.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
Don't try to fool me.

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,160
You're my grandson. One twitch of your eye

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,640
and I can tell if you're happy or hurting.

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,480
I know my own body.

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,880
I just thought

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,760
I could hide it a little longer.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,960
You knew from the start?

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,200
Why didn't you tell us?

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,920
Hey,

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,880
don't look at me like that.

39
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,680
Save it for when I'm gone.

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,120
I won't be around to see it anyway.

41
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,600
Now go, both of you.

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm going to sleep.

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,600
What are you doing out here?

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,760
It's freezing.

45
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,880
Why sit alone in the cold?

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,320
Stay with me a while.

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,640
Of course.

48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,720
Li Jinyu.

49
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,800
Whatever it is, you can talk to me.

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,480
You don't have to hold it in.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,800
I'm fine.

52
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,360
Then tell me what's on your mind.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,200
I don't know.

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,120
Back when…

55
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,040
I was little,

56
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,840
I barely remembered Grandma.

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
I didn't know her at all.

58
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,920
I just thought of her

59
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,040
as some short-tempered old lady.

60
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,240
Then after my dad died in that car crash…

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,000
<i>If I hadn't driven up</i>
<i>the mountain that day,</i>

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,280
<i>I wouldn't have run into that car</i>

63
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
<i>coming from the wrong direction.</i>

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,120
<i>Leave me!</i>

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Dad!

66
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,200
<i>I've never been able to forgive myself.</i>

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
<i>Then she showed up out of nowhere,</i>

68
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,720
<i>like a heroine.</i>

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,640
<i>She took a ten-hour train,</i>

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
went through all the hardship,

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,600
rushed from Ningsui to Jiangbei,

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,920
just to pull me out

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,840
from Li Lingbai's control.

74
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
If it hadn't been for her,

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,400
I'd have died in Jiangbei long ago.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
But back then, I was angry at the world.

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,880
I didn't trust anyone.

78
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,040
Our whole relationship

79
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
was just me staying silent,

80
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,080
while she barked at me like a firecracker.

81
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,000
The more she pushed, the quieter I got.

82
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,400
Can you picture that?

83
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
I can.

84
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
She thought

85
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,880
she was bringing home a firecracker.

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
Turns out she got a dud.

87
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
Back then,

88
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,480
you probably
just weren't used to this place.

89
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,160
It wasn't just not being used to it.

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
I hated it.

91
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,480
The neighbors
were too warm-hearted, too friendly.

92
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,120
Grandma's temper was unbearable.

93
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
I kept thinking

94
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,760
it was only a matter of time

95
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
before she threw me out.

96
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,920
<i>And then one day,</i>

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,760
<i>I actually saw her packing my things.</i>

98
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
<i>So, the next morning,</i>

99
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,760
<i>I left on my own.</i>

100
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,360
<i>I didn't want to be abandoned again.</i>

101
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,000
TRANQUIL HARMONY

102
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,920
Why are you following me?

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,440
Nobody wants me.

104
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
I can't take you in.

105
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,640
Badou!

106
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,360
<i>That was the second time in my life</i>

107
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,120
<i>I saw someone look that panicked over me.</i>

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,560
<i>The first was on my dad's face.</i>

109
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,480
Where did you run off to?

110
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,520
Come home.

111
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,760
Come on.

112
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,480
<i>That night, she dragged me back,</i>

113
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,160
<i>smacked me around,</i>

114
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,960
<i>and even brought the dog home with us.</i>

115
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,640
Later, I found out

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
she wasn't packing to kick me out.

117
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,960
She'd gone to the village,

118
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
arranged for me to have
a little house in the yard.

119
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,080
She wanted me to have a place of my own,

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,919
so I'd never feel like
I didn't belong anywhere.

121
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
That dog was Ping'an, wasn't it?

122
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
She just wanted you safe and sound.

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,560
She loves you.

124
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,080
That fiery old lady

125
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
used to chase me from room to room

126
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,280
with nothing but a feather duster.

127
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,880
Now she's lying in a hospital bed.

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,680
Meng…

129
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,160
I can't accept it.

130
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,600
When she's gone,

131
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,960
then I won't have any family left.

132
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,000
Jinyu.

133
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,240
You still have me.

134
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,520
I'll always be here with you.

135
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,400
THREE STEPS TO GET OUT OF BED SAFELY

136
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,080
Badou, I want chicken wings and milk tea.

137
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,040
Mom.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What are you doing here?

139
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I heard you were unwell,
so I came to see you.

140
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,400
Came to check if I'm dead, didn't you?

141
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
Keep waiting!

142
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,640
Mom, that's not what I meant.

143
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
I heard you were sick,

144
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,560
so I hired the best
medical team in Jiangbei.

145
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,160
If you'll let me,

146
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
I'll take you there this afternoon.

147
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,680
You don't need to worry about money.

148
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,040
I don't need it.

149
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,120
I have health insurance.

150
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
And whatever you have,
my grandson has too!

151
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,200
Did you come all the way to Ningsui

152
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
just to stir up trouble?

153
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,960
Now leave!

154
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,920
He's not your grandson.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,920
He's just an outsider.

156
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Outsider?

157
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,440
That boy is my dearest grandson.

158
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
You're the outsider here.

159
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,920
Your real grandson is Zhuofeng,

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,440
not Li Jinyu.

161
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,080
Zhuofeng's been sick for ages.

162
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,080
You're his grandma.

163
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,320
Did you ever visit him?

164
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,160
Did you ever worry about him?

165
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,200
And don't forget

166
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,160
how your son died.

167
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,440
Or how my husband died.

168
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,560
My son's death had nothing
to do with Badou.

169
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,440
- It was you who said…
- Don't fool yourself!

170
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,680
Enough. Get out.

171
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,040
Out.

172
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,720
Listen to me.

173
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,720
If you dare hurt him again,

174
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,840
I'll come after you, even from the grave.

175
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,280
Once your real grandson,

176
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,040
Zhuofeng, is better,

177
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
I'll bring him to see you.

178
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,840
Shut the door!

179
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,280
Mrs. Li, this old woman has no sense.

180
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,000
How can she talk to you like that?

181
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,480
You never should have--

182
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,200
Since when do you get
to weigh in on my family?

183
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,240
She's my mother-in-law.

184
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,080
My husband's mother.

185
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,560
Zhuofeng's grandmother.

186
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,600
If you have time to complain,

187
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,720
apply it to real work.

188
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,200
Get Hailan Port's launch ready.

189
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,640
Yes, Mrs. Li.

190
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,880
I'll handle it right away.

191
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,760
DEPARTMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY

192
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,680
Hello?

193
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,680
<i>Jinyu, where are you?</i>

194
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,560
<i>Uncle and Aunt are here visiting Grandma.</i>

195
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,800
Okay, I'm on my way.

196
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,000
INPATIENT

197
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,520
<i>Enough of the fuss. It's just surgery.</i>

198
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,920
<i>What's there to be afraid of?</i>

199
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,760
Conservative treatment?
No, I won't go with that.

200
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,720
That's not safe.

201
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,520
At your age, you have to think carefully.

202
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,920
Since when have I ever backed down?

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,160
Sitting here, waiting for death,

204
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,360
is worse than taking a gamble.

205
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,720
If I lose, at least I fought.

206
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,280
Once Badou gets here,
I'll tell him myself.

207
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,480
He's the one who understands me.

208
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,680
But at your age,

209
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,040
going through surgery

210
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,000
is too risky. What if…

211
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,280
Fine.

212
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,280
We'll do the surgery.

213
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,760
See? I told you.

214
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,840
My grandson is the one who understands me.

215
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Jinyu, your grandma's being reckless,

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,480
and you're just encouraging her. What if

217
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,720
- the surgery fails?
- Exactly.

218
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
This is madness.

219
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,960
Let's go.

220
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Think it over again, please.

221
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,240
Go, go, go.

222
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,160
Jinyu, talk to her.

223
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,720
Hey, wait!

224
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,440
Enough.

225
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,880
Lie down and rest for a while.

226
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,000
I've made up my mind.

227
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,400
Before the surgery,

228
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,800
the two of you have to take me somewhere.

229
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
If I don't make it
off that operating table,

230
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,400
at least I won't leave with regrets.

231
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,280
Don't talk like that, Grandma.
You're going to be fine.

232
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,160
Hurry up.

233
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,520
- We're home.
- Careful, careful.

234
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,680
Easy there, Grandma.

235
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,760
Whoa, all right.

236
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,680
- Be careful.
- I got this.

237
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,960
That door is heavy.

238
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,960
- Quit dawdling.
- Coming!

239
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,400
Slow down, Grandma.

240
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
Granny!

241
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,120
It's me, Tou Juhua.

242
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm back!

243
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,040
She's still got lungs of steel.

244
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,480
- Unlock the door.
- On it.

245
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,520
Put your things down.

246
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,480
I'm taking you both up the mountain.

247
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,320
- We're picking tea leaves.
- Juhua, you're back!

248
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,800
Granny…

249
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,000
Move faster.

250
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,840
- You've still got energy to spare.
- Stop dragging your feet.

251
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,160
Still as graceful as ever.

252
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,720
You're amazing.

253
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,080
A real master.

254
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,880
You two have long legs

255
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,280
but no strength.

256
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,400
- You need to exercise.
- I am exhausted.

257
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,400
Keep moving.

258
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,760
This area.

259
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,120
- More tea leaves?
- Who knew the tea fields were this far?

260
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,840
Quit whining.

261
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,720
- Slow down, slow down.
- I'm fine.

262
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,520
Alright, here goes.

263
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,760
Okay, I got it.

264
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,520
Grandma,

265
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,560
what are you writing?

266
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,200
Not for you to see.

267
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Li Jinyu,

268
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,440
women have secrets.

269
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,599
Stay out of it.

270
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,880
Fine.

271
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,760
That's right.

272
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,800
A girl's got to have her secrets.

273
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,000
Want to guess mine?

274
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,400
- Sure.
- She's keeping secrets. We're in trouble.

275
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,840
Badou.

276
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Be gentle.

277
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,000
You can't just…

278
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,480
Let me tell you something.

279
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,920
Look,

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,440
tea has its own seasons.

281
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,240
It has its own life force.

282
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,960
Don't underestimate these tiny buds.

283
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,720
They look like
they won't survive the winter,

284
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,880
but once spring comes,

285
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,240
they burst right open,

286
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,680
screaming, "Jinyu, Jinyu,

287
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,440
come pick me."

288
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,360
Granny,

289
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,720
next spring,

290
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,120
we have to come back together.

291
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,920
See if the new shoots have grown.

292
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,160
- Come on, Granny.
- Promise?

293
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,160
- Promise.
- Alright.

294
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,680
- Pinky swear.
- Yes.

295
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,960
Li Badou.

296
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,440
Count me in.

297
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,680
Good.

298
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,600
Now back to work.

299
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,120
Here we go.

300
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Here,

301
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,040
pick a fresh one for me.

302
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,160
Sure.

303
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,400
Faster.

304
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
Stop flirting.

305
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Okay.

306
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,400
Think this is enough?

307
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Should be.

308
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,640
Granny,

309
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
this'll make a pot for us.

310
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,040
I'll show you my tea skills when we
get back. Been brewing since I was a kid.

311
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,480
Good.

312
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,520
Then tonight,

313
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,760
I'll show you my cooking.

314
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,720
I'll make you what I used to eat
as a child.

315
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,400
Let's head back now

316
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
and get ready.

317
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,280
Not yet. Keep picking.

318
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,800
No escaping now.

319
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Granny, I'm tired.

320
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Keep going.

321
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,720
Tired?

322
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,920
Just a bit more.

323
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,800
Fine. Now I'll get serious.

324
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,760
Okay.

325
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Go ahead.

326
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,880
I'll take a short break.

327
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,000
No breaks.

328
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,080
Show me.

329
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
This is how it's done.

330
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,840
Here. See?

331
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,560
Where? Let me see.

332
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,600
I know plenty of ways to do it.

333
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,120
Then tell me how you brew it.

334
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
Just pour hot water over it.

335
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
Like instant coffee?

336
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,280
Shut up.

337
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,040
If Granny hears you, we're dead.

338
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,640
Alright.

339
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,600
Any longer in the sun,

340
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,560
we'll turn into baked potatoes.

341
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,520
Not you. You'll stay fair.

342
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,880
- My fair lady.
- Liar.

343
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,640
You'll stay fair.

344
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,920
We'll both stay fair.

345
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
Hurry it up.

346
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,640
Careful.

347
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,760
Granny, you rest. Let Li Jinyu do it.

348
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,240
What would he know?

349
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,200
Probably just looked it up online.

350
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,000
Think you can cook the food I grew up on?

351
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,840
Didn't I just tell you two?

352
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,880
- Tonight, I'm showing off.
- Alright.

353
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,040
Badou, get that lid.

354
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,480
- Watch your fingers.
- Meng, pour the oil.

355
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,520
Got it.

356
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,640
Whoa.

357
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,280
Badou.

358
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,040
- Careful.
- Come cut this.

359
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,160
Here, slice this.

360
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,880
- Make it thin.
- Alright.

361
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,240
Sorted.

362
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,120
Careful, it's hot.

363
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,720
Meng, try it.

364
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
No, Granny, you first.

365
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,200
See if it tastes the same.

366
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,800
- Fine, I'll be the judge.
- Go ahead.

367
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,240
Well?

368
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,800
That's it! That's the taste.

369
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
- Let me try.
- Alright.

370
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,080
Here, try this one.

371
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,000
Take a big bite.

372
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,960
What do you think?

373
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,040
Not that great.

374
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,880
So, your childhood flavor wasn't all that.

375
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,640
And the heat's off.

376
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,640
How about I whip up a few dishes

377
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,120
from my childhood instead?

378
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,840
Li Jinyu, what are you even saying?

379
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,200
Who cares about your childhood?

380
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,360
Granny's childhood flavor is unbeatable.

381
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,600
This is delicious.

382
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,520
You really think so?

383
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,480
Just wait.

384
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,720
When I'm done eating,

385
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,960
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

386
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,000
That's right.
We'll gang up on him together.

387
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,160
Let's see how he handles that.

388
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,200
Exactly.

389
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,240
You're plotting to murder your husband?

390
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,000
Granny!

391
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,360
- You dare touch her?
- No, no, I'm sorry.

392
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,520
Say it properly.

393
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,640
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- Good.

394
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,960
Now feed her properly.

395
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,640
Here, you like it, right?

396
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,760
Feed me too.

397
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,640
Here you go.

398
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,520
- Mmm, tastes wonderful.
- Eat more, Badou.

399
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,440
Badou.

400
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
Meng, you too.

401
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,640
Okay, Granny.

402
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,720
Have some more.

403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,800
Why aren't you eating? Open up.

404
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,080
Fine, I'll eat.

405
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,960
Isn't it good? You love it.

406
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,240
Give me another.

407
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,240
Okay, here.

408
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,640
Stupid phone.

409
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I'm starving.

410
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,360
What even is this place?

411
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,080
No signal at all.

412
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,120
I'm so hungry.

413
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,280
What are you

414
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,920
sneaking around for?

415
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,240
Nearly scared me to death.

416
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,560
You scared me!

417
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,840
Why are you up wandering
in the middle of the night?

418
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,800
Couldn't sleep.

419
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,320
Came out for a little walk.

420
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,320
Just needed a stroll.

421
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
What about you?

422
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,280
Nothing.

423
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,160
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

424
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
You're ordering takeout.

425
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,280
You're starving.

426
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,480
You're starving.

427
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,720
See?

428
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Nostalgic flavors don't mean much

429
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,320
if they don't fill you.

430
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,640
Tasty, but not filling.

431
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,800
Exactly. I lie down,

432
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,320
and my stomach growls like thunder.

433
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,920
- Wait…
- I'm about to faint.

434
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,280
How's the takeout order going?

435
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,800
This useless phone has no signal.

436
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,440
- Mine either.
- Stand over there. Try it.

437
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,840
You think that'll help?

438
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,480
Just try.

439
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,040
Still nothing.

440
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,280
Still searching for signal.

441
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,560
Wait, got it!

442
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Quick, what do you want?

443
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,120
- Fried chicken cutlets.
- Okay.

444
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,920
- Five pieces.
- Five? That's way too many.

445
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,120
- You won't digest them.
- Not too many at all.

446
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
- No, no, no. Not available.
- Milk tea.

447
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,360
They only have barbecue.

448
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,680
- Then skewers.
- Let me see…

449
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,880
No cutlets, just skewers.

450
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,080
- Skewers will do.
- Fine, I'll get you chicken wings.

451
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,040
- Don't.
- What are you two up to?

452
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,960
Still stuck

453
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,400
on childhood cravings?

454
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,840
No…

455
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,200
Meng said she's hungry.

456
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,720
Granny, come on.

457
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,560
Don't throw me under the bus.

458
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,920
What? Didn't you just say
you were starving?

459
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,560
I was just out for a walk.

460
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,720
She's starving,

461
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,920
trying to order food.

462
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,520
Yes, yes. It's me.

463
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,720
I'm starving.

464
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,520
- See? She admits it.
- Yes, Granny, I admit it.

465
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm hungry.

466
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,040
Really, I'm starving.

467
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,240
Please make me something.

468
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,280
She's not hungry.
What did you say you were doing?

469
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,120
You just came out to stroll?

470
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,680
- Not hungry at all, right?
- Right.

471
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,200
I'm the one who's starving.

472
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,760
- Make me something.
- What do you want?

473
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,160
Grilled fish, sweet potatoes,
and milk tea.

474
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,440
You just said you weren't hungry.

475
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,480
Why order so much?

476
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,600
I don't even like those.

477
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,480
- Give me something else.
- I just don't want you two

478
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,080
to waste food. I'll help finish it.

479
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,040
Granny.

480
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,160
Fine. Wait here. I'll cook.

481
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,080
Thank you, Badou.

482
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,360
Really, Granny?

483
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,840
How could you sell me out like that?

484
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,040
Look how handsome he is.

485
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,200
Now go wait by the door.

486
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,000
Granny, honestly…

487
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,640
Why haven't you started eating?

488
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
We were waiting for you.

489
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,840
Waiting for me? Come on.

490
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
Try my milk tea.

491
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,520
Thank you, baby.

492
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,080
Now you remember to call me that.

493
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,720
- Eat with us.
- Yes, eat with us.

494
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,760
I'm really too full.

495
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,400
I ate too much at dinner.

496
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,480
It's cold.

497
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,120
I brought extra blankets.

498
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,240
I'll set them up.

499
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,720
There's more food if you need.

500
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,720
Thanks, baby.

501
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,840
Thanks, baby.

502
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,280
Granny, quick.

503
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,200
Quick, quick.

504
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Come on, come on.

505
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,840
So good.

506
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,800
<i>I went to Jiangbei</i>

507
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,760
<i>and brought that boy back.</i>

508
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,160
<i>He was beaten down so badly,</i>

509
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
<i>he wasn't even himself anymore.</i>

510
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,320
<i>If I'd shown up any later,</i>

511
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,240
<i>he might've been lost forever.</i>

512
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,560
<i>Thank heavens I made it in time.</i>

513
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,560
<i>Today,</i>

514
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,320
<i>he nearly scared me to death.</i>

515
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,960
<i>He thought I didn't want him anymore,</i>

516
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,280
<i>so he ran off on his own.</i>

517
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,080
<i>His father used to brag about</i>

518
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,000
<i>how clever he was.</i>

519
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
<i>But to me, he just seemed</i>
<i>like a silly kid.</i>

520
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,000
<i>Still, he's my grandson,</i>

521
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
<i>and this is his home.</i>

522
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,480
<i>He seemed fond of that stray dog,</i>

523
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,920
<i>so I named it Ping'an.</i>

524
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,520
<i>All I wanted was for him</i>

525
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,280
<i>to live safe and sound.</i>

526
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920
<i>When I was little,</i>

527
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,920
<i>I was raised by my own grandmother too.</i>

528
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,720
<i>We made our living</i>

529
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,160
<i>off that tea mountain.</i>

530
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,200
<i>I was just a little kid,</i>

531
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,680
<i>but every day, I followed her</i>

532
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,600
<i>up the slopes to pick tea leaves.</i>

533
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,920
<i>She once told me,</i>

534
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,600
<i>"Tea has its own spirit in every season.</i>
<i>Each one is different.</i>

535
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,920
<i>Each one worth cherishing.</i>

536
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,160
<i>Just like people."</i>

537
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
<i>But the next day, after those words,</i>

538
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,600
<i>Grandma passed away.</i>

539
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,600
<i>I was only about ten.</i>

540
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,280
<i>I never imagined</i>

541
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,120
<i>my grandmother would leave me</i>

542
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,760
<i>so soon.</i>

543
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,040
<i>And now the years have flown by.</i>

544
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,560
<i>It's my turn</i>

545
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,160
<i>with Badou.</i>

546
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,720
<i>At least,</i>

547
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,560
<i>I still have time</i>

548
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,440
<i>to say goodbye properly.</i>

549
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,560
<i>It's almost funny.</i>

550
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,440
<i>I always act tough,</i>

551
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,760
<i>but inside, I'm terrified.</i>

552
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120
<i>The thought of it</i>

553
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
<i>keeps me up at night.</i>

554
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,360
<i>I've even cried quietly to myself.</i>

555
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,760
<i>But I can't let Badou see me afraid.</i>

556
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,560
<i>That child's had enough pain.</i>

557
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,760
<i>There's no reason</i>

558
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,360
<i>I should make him worry even more.</i>

559
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,600
<i>They say only the wicked live long.</i>

560
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,360
<i>Maybe it's not too late</i>

561
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,840
<i>for me to be a little selfish.</i>

562
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,960
<i>What I really hope is to live long enough</i>

563
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,040
<i>to see Badou and Meng's wedding.</i>

564
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,640
<i>Last night, I dreamed they already did.</i>

565
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,080
<i>I was so happy, I could've flown.</i>

566
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,800
<i>As long as Badou finds happiness,</i>

567
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
<i>I can leave this world in peace.</i>

568
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,440
Granny, are you asleep?

569
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,040
Meng.

570
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,560
You're still awake, right?

571
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Come in.

572
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,200
Granny.

573
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,080
I want to sleep with you tonight.

574
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,400
Of course.

575
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,360
I never told you this before,

576
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,560
but I've always really admired you.

577
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,400
When you stormed into Jiangbei

578
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,320
to take Li Jinyu back from his mother…

579
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,800
And now, the way you face
life and death with such courage…

580
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,160
I think you're amazing.

581
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,240
Dying isn't bravery.

582
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,120
Living every day, that takes courage.

583
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,840
Right?

584
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
At my age,

585
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,480
I've made my peace.

586
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,360
The only thing I can't let go of is Badou.

587
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm asking you…

588
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,840
Please, look after him.

589
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,160
I shouldn't have brought this up.

590
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm sorry.

591
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,520
It's alright.

592
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,560
Go to sleep.

593
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,240
Really, it's fine.

594
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,080
Let's go to bed.

595
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,720
Let me cover you

596
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,840
with this sweater.

597
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,360
- I'm good, Granny.
- It has little flowers.

598
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,600
Alright.

599
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,640
Blanket up.

600
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,960
Alright, lights out.

601
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,080
Okay. Lights out.

602
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,400
Why are your hands so cold?

603
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,440
I'm not cold.

604
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
Don't cry.

605
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,120
I'm fine, Granny.

606
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,680
- Everything will turn out okay.
- That's right.

607
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
One, two, three!

608
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,520
- Can you see the flowers?
- Yes, yes!

609
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,520
Careful not to prick your hand.

610
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,520
- Here, let me get a close one.
- Another one!

611
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,040
Okay, close-up.

612
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,160
Ready? One, two, three!

613
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,480
Show the flowers.

614
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,320
- One, two, three.
- These flowers, right here!

615
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,400
Here, take a look.

616
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,760
- Fix these up.
- Isn't it lovely?

617
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,680
Alright.

618
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,280
- Slim my face a little.
- How much slimmer do you want?

619
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,240
You're already so thin.

620
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,240
- Just make me look good.
- I know.

621
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,960
Keep all the pictures.

622
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,440
And lighten up my face too.

623
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,680
Okay.

624
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,160
Who are you texting
so sneakily this early?

625
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
I'll tell Meng.

626
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,760
No, wait, let me explain.

627
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,080
Well?

628
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,120
Out with it.

629
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,840
I'm planning

630
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,480
to throw Meng a wedding.

631
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,239
What's with that look?

632
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,120
Isn't that your biggest wish?

633
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,760
You read my diary, didn't you?

634
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,320
And you can peek at my phone,

635
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,280
but I can't peek at your diary?

636
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,440
Don't twist things. I'm telling Meng.

637
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,440
Fine, fine.

638
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,080
I didn't mean to. It was an accident.

639
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
And anyway,

640
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,600
your diary's full

641
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,920
of typos and scribbles.

642
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,679
Not exactly worth reading.

643
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
What do you plan to do?

644
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,120
I'll head back to Ningsui

645
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,440
to set things up.

646
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,440
You keep her here one more day.

647
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,080
Distract her, so she doesn't catch on.

648
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,080
What are you two whispering about?

649
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,120
Always dragging your feet.

650
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,360
Did you finish fixing my photo?

651
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,120
All done.

652
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,480
- Save it.
- I was telling Grandma something came up

653
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,680
at the company.

654
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,240
We might have to head back early.

655
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,000
Meng and I won't go with you. Right, Meng?

656
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,600
Right. I'll stay here with Granny.

657
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,080
Go on, then. You can leave.

658
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,000
Fine.

659
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,360
Off you go, all alone.

660
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,120
Let's get some more shots over there.

661
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,040
- Okay.
- Take care of Grandma.

662
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,000
I will. Don't worry.

663
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,960
Hurry up.

664
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,480
Coming, coming!

665
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,800
Heyo!

666
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,040
There we go.

667
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,240
- This is nice.
- Don't worry, baby.

668
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,800
- The family's already prepared
- What?

669
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,440
- your wedding.
- I thought this was for me.

670
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
- Let me talk.
- Look at her, getting worked up.

671
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,120
It's Middle Aunt.
I've taken on a new wine brand.

672
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,560
- Have you ordered?
- Mom, can I have this?

673
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,600
No? I knew it.

674
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,440
- Think it'll work?
- Of course, of course.

675
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,920
Let me tell you…

676
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,840
A wedding?

677
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,600
That's so sudden.

678
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,840
I'm renovating,

679
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,840
but I'll send

680
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,160
my workers over tonight.

681
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,520
You can count on me.

682
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,680
Totally reliable.

683
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,800
And… Ya'en's the bridesmaid, right?

684
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,720
Why are you being so fussy?

685
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,040
Everything's taken care of.

686
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,200
Jiayu will be your flower boy.

687
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,720
Don't worry, Jinyu.

688
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Leave the wedding host to me.

689
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
You're in safe hands.

690
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,000
Hurry it up.

691
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,880
Granny,

692
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
how much longer
do we have to keep picking?

693
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,640
We've been at this forever.

694
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,760
We should've made Badou do it.

695
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,600
That's right. I'm calling him.

696
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,240
Why does he get to slack off,

697
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,160
while we're stuck here?

698
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,440
Don't you dare call him.

699
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,840
Forget it.

700
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,520
Let me tell you

701
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,840
about my childhood.

702
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,920
When I wasn't even five,

703
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,480
I'd run here as soon as the sun came up.

704
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,920
I knew every step of this path

705
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
like the back of my hand.

706
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,360
Pick and pick and pick,

707
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,160
until it was almost noon,
then I'd head home.

708
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,440
Honestly, I wouldn't even
bother bringing Badou.

709
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,760
But my legs are sore, Granny.

710
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,200
My feet hurt too.

711
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,000
You've got those long legs.

712
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,920
Put them to good use. You can do it!

713
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,640
Says the one with fine legs.

714
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,360
Back when you were in the hospital,

715
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
I was the one covering for you every day.

716
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,040
And this is how you repay me?

717
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,320
Repay you? Please.

718
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,440
I'm with one foot

719
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,440
in the coffin already.

720
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,720
What do I have to hold back for?

721
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,360
Pfft, don't say that!

722
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,040
Yes?

723
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,000
<i>Everything's ready.</i>

724
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,920
<i>Just waiting for you.</i>

725
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,280
Stop rushing us.

726
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,200
Alright.

727
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,560
I'm tired too.
My back aches, my legs hurt.

728
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,560
Your back aches?

729
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,400
Enough. Let's go.

730
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,440
Careful, careful!

731
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,360
Let's go.

732
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,720
What's wrong? Tweaked your back?

733
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,640
Granny, you're too playful.

734
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,840
Slow down!

735
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,640
Grab the bags, quick.

736
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,480
Hurry up.

737
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,720
Granny, you're unbelievable.

738
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,960
Had fun at the tea fields,

739
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,160
now rushing home again?

740
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,400
I've seen enough of the field.

741
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,280
Two days was plenty. I was bored.

742
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,600
I'll cook something nice for you.

743
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,840
That's it. Thanks, sir.

744
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,040
There you go.

745
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,280
- Bye.
- Here.

746
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,320
Put those right there.

747
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,000
Put those flowers over there.

748
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Yes, right there.

749
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,720
Since when do we have this many flowers?

750
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,000
The big day's coming.

751
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,000
Granny…

752
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,440
Congratulations, newlyweds!

753
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,160
Do you like it?

754
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,800
Isn't this courtyard almost exactly

755
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,280
like the one you always pictured?

756
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,240
All this time,

757
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,120
it's been you taking steps toward me.

758
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,880
This last one…

759
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,040
Let me take it for us.

760
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,080
Save the speeches for later.

761
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,720
Our bride still needs hair and makeup.

762
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,880
Can't miss the lucky hour.

763
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,360
Hair and makeup for what?

764
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,960
- You'll see soon enough.
- Off you go then.

765
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,200
- Off you go.
- Juhua, come here.

766
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,600
- Time to suit up.
- What's going on?

767
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,520
- Come on.
- Listen,

768
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,920
today you're the star's grandmother.

769
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,200
You need a little makeup too.

770
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,160
Oh, no need for me.

771
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,280
- I don't want makeup.
- No excuses.

772
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,040
It's your eldest grandson's

773
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,000
wedding day.

774
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,520
- Let's get you ready.
- Alright, alright.

775
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,760
Meng said

776
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,440
after lipstick, you need this.

777
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,960
It is called…

778
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,680
lip gloss. Then…

779
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,520
Hey, don't laugh.

780
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,840
If you laugh, I can't do it.

781
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,120
Hold still or it'll smear.

782
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,520
- There.
- Done?

783
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,680
Done. Take a look.

784
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,240
My goodness. Gorgeous.

785
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,720
Is this really me?

786
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,360
Of course it's you.

787
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,320
Knocked yourself out with beauty, huh?

788
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,440
I really might faint.

789
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,720
I've never worn makeup in my life.

790
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,920
Ever.

791
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,400
Let me tell you the truth.

792
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,600
I might always bicker with you,

793
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,760
but honestly,

794
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,920
in my heart,

795
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,680
you are

796
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,840
- the most striking old lady I've ever met.
- Naturally.

797
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,600
You're beautiful even barefaced.

798
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,120
With makeup, you absolutely glow.

799
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,000
A true beauty.

800
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,240
Meilan,

801
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,720
the sun must've risen in the west today.

802
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,600
This is the first time you've praised me.

803
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,760
Sure, our families had some grudges.

804
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,760
All because I took
that little strip of land.

805
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,920
Still not over it?

806
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,240
Alright, enough.

807
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,600
That's all in the past.

808
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,760
All in the past.

809
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,480
You know what I was thinking?

810
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,520
Now that we're in-laws,

811
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,480
why not remove that wall? Boom.

812
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,440
Make it a connected space.

813
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,760
I like that idea.

814
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,760
- Deal.
- Deal.

815
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
And no more bringing up the past.

816
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,160
Not a word from me.

817
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,120
Oh,

818
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,880
and I brought you something.

819
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,480
What is it?

820
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,560
Look.

821
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,440
Meng's parents.

822
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,720
And here, recognize her?

823
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,720
It's Meng.

824
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,800
Three months old.

825
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,960
Look at her.

826
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,400
- See?
- A beauty from the start.

827
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,640
And here,

828
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,040
elementary school graduation.

829
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,960
Too bad our Badou

830
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
never liked taking photos.

831
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,600
Now when I think back,

832
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,920
there's nothing to look at.

833
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,120
Such a shame.

834
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,080
Don't worry.

835
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,040
Leave it to me.

836
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
From now on,

837
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,280
I'll trail after them,

838
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,640
snapping photos every day.
I'll give them all to you.

839
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,160
Then make us each a big album.

840
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,000
- Sure.
- On Badou and Meng's dime, of course.

841
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,920
- Alright?
- You old miser.

842
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,280
- Look at that hat on Meng.
- Right.

843
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,920
Doesn't it look just like mine?
Same style. Must be fate.

844
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,160
Do you know what it's called?

845
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,120
A beret.

846
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,120
- You see?
- Look at that little face.

847
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,760
Doesn't she look like me?

848
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,160
Just like her grandma.

849
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,720
