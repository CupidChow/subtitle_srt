 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:11,816
♫  I still remember it clearly  ♫

3
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:15,330
♫  Your eyes sparkled back then  ♫

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,615
♫  The way you lit up when telling me you loved me  ♫

5
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:25,796
♫  But over time, you've forgotten  ♫

6
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:31,144
♫  Promises left behind at every twist in life  ♫

7
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:34,632
♫  Only memories remain like scattered fireworks  ♫

8
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:38,096
♫  When I turned to walk away  ♫

9
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:42,828
♫  If I could go back to the day we said goodbye  ♫

10
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:48,800
♫  I'd never let go of your hand  ♫

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,836
♫  I can't hide the flutters in my heart  ♫

12
00:00:53,836 --> 00:01:01,016
♫  I'm about to be out of control as breathing turns weightless  ♫

13
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:05,916
♫  All I possess is drowned by the me who still loves you deeply  ♫

14
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:11,280
♫  I'll never changed even if miracles exist  ♫

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,363
♫  Don't forget, our promises will be kept  ♫

16
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:20,280
♫  And the dream where I'm with you  ♫

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,910
   

18
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,980
   

19
00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:34,470
You really rejected him?

20
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:42,228
Please. If you like each other, just be together already. Stop this back-and-forth.

21
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:47,670
I do want to be with him, but not if it's just out of gratitude.

22
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:52,908
I don't know why I'm being so fussy. I pursued him before.

23
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:56,548
Now, he's taking initiative, but I'm nitpicking everything.

24
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:01,548
Love's about mutual submission.

25
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:05,748
This is the first time I've seen you so unconfident in love.

26
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:11,128
I just want to hear his answer directly.

27
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:13,320
You're being too dramatic.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:22,500



29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,808
Hurry up, Xiao Wang. Help me with the discount. Quick, I've sent it to you.

30
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:29,628
I can't reach it. Send more.

31
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:32,948
I'll go easy on you during poker next time. Come on.

32
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:34,848
I can't reach.

33
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:41,708
Chen Xiang is back.

34
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:47,008
What Chen Xiang?

35
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:53,888
The legend of Splitting Mountains to Save His Mother, he’d do anything for his mother.

36
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,188
Are you him?

37
00:02:55,188 --> 00:03:01,088
The sick one isn't her, but your biological grandson Li Zhuo Feng.

38
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:06,308
But he's fine now. The bone marrow transplant succeeded. Don't worry.

39
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:10,268
I'm not worried about him, but you.

40
00:03:11,328 --> 00:03:14,888
Nonsense. You're not my real grandson?

41
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:23,208
Wait, are you trying to abandon your responsibility as my grandson?

42
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:26,308
That came out wrong.

43
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:31,828
Listen, you must take care of me. No retirement support, no future for you.

44
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:36,308
Don't worry. I'll definitely support you.

45
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:44,028
You've got white hair now. Come, sit.

46
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:49,788
Look how pale your face is. Like paper.

47
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:53,628
You suffered alone in Jiangbei with no one to protect you.

48
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:59,688
You've had a bad time.

49
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:01,908
Ye Meng came to see me.

50
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:09,128
Ye Meng's wonderful. Treasure such a good girl.

51
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:18,248
I... I want to try. Do you think I can?

52
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,528
Absolutely. Go try right now.

53
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:30,688
With your premature grays and fading looks, you'll be unwanted soon.

54
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:37,148
Hurry.

55
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:45,408
Discount cut.

56
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,148
Coming!

57
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,440
Hi.

58
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:16,728
Your pipes were aging. Last time I couldn't fix them, so...

59
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:21,348
I had them repaired while you were in Jiangbei.

60
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh. Okay.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,740
Well...

62
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:33,768
I'm planning to fix the yard. Interested, Gardener Li?

63
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:37,588
Gladly.

64
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,108
It's hard work. I'll help.

65
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,508
Li Jin Yu.

66
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:09,448
Didn't you notice the dog poop there?

67
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:13,448
Seriously? Why didn't you warn me? Look!

68
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,248
You didn't see it yourself?

69
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:18,268
Now your nose is covered in dog poop. What now?

70
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:20,268
I can wipe it myself.

71
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:25,408
Don't be ungentlemanly. What about my hand?

72
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:30,728
Your hand? Let me wipe it for you.

73
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:35,808
Just kidding. There was no dog poop.

74
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:38,368
You're so childish.

75
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,650
What's wrong?

76
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,996
It's just a bee. Don't worry. It flew away.

77
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,488
It really scared me.

78
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:52,468
I never thought our tough girl fear bees.

79
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:56,528
All girls fear bugs. Typical guy response.

80
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,568
It's coming again.

81
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,588
What now?

82
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,588
I'll stop teasing you. Just kidding.

83
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,068
So immature.

84
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:08,368
Li Jin Yu, you've been awful since the dog poop joke!

85
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:11,608
I said stop messing around. Are you done?

86
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:15,508
I'll stop. You stop! What's wrong with you?

87
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:18,948
Ms. Ye, sign for the large parcels.

88
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:21,488
Coming! These are from Jiangbei?

89
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:23,528
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

90
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,568
- Help me carry them. 
 - Beg me.

91
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:31,708
Li Jin Yu, didn't get enough beating last time. Such a loser.

92
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:35,508
Sir, could you help carry? We'll do it together.

93
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:37,728
Delivery only. No carrying service.

94
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:39,928
- Fine. Fine. 
 - Which ones are ours?

95
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:42,208
All of these.

96
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,908
- Can you manage? 
 - Yes.

97
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:47,508
Could you move aside, please?

98
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:51,868
- Hurry up. I have more deliveries. 
 - Okay.

99
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:04,588
- Give it to me. 
 - Thanks.

100
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:07,348
Can you unpack this while I wash my hands?

101
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:23,950
   

102
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:29,568
One of these is a gift, I think.

103
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:32,088
For Ye Meng only.

104
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:42,788
A camera? But this doesn't look new at all.

105
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:50,608
Probably something my ex-boss had my friend ship when packing my stuff.

106
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:55,908
Why would your ex-boss send you a camera?

107
00:08:55,908 --> 00:09:00,388
It's nothing. These are just team-building photos.

108
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:08,808
Team-building with just the two of you?

109
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:14,328
Look closer. There are others...

110
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:19,668
- Way too cozy for colleagues. 
 - Wait.

111
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:22,048
See? There are others in these shots.

112
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:24,968
How could it be just us two for the team-building event?

113
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,808
Seems like your ex-boss wants to rekindle something.

114
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:32,048
Let him keep dreaming.

115
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,900
Li Jin Yu...

116
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:40,120
save your jealousy until you become my boyfriend.

117
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:48,128
Weeding's done. Let's buy some plants now.

118
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:50,588
Buy flowers instead of plain plants.

119
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,428
Mr. Jealousy, enough.

120
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,668
I want some sunflowers.

121
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:07,488
Your house, your rules.

122
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:11,308
It's our shared project. Show some effort.

123
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:15,408
I'm not your boyfriend. What "our"?

124
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:20,788
You mind it? You know exactly why you're not my boyfriend.

125
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:27,808
These sunflowers are nice.

126
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:34,568
Ma'am, sunflower seeds and this one, please.

127
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,688
The total's 30. Scan me.

128
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:38,188
Thank you.

129
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,288
- Here. 
 - One moment.

130
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:43,208
Done paying.

131
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,908
Which pot?

132
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,908
This one.

133
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:50,908
My fate clashes with plants. They might die in weeks.

134
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:53,808
Garden Li, you'll need to nurture them.

135
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:56,148
Will my wage get a raise?

136
00:10:56,148 --> 00:11:00,588
Sure. If that's the relationship you want.

137
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:05,528
Let me say it again. I'll handle all gardening tasks.

138
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:09,248
Will my good performance earn me the privilege of joining you at the dinner table?

139
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:10,388
Here you go.

140
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:14,428
No. Street food, maybe.

141
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:20,288
What's this? Looks cute.

142
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,880
- Rice cake, please. 
 - Okay.

143
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:25,240
10 yuan.

144
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,460
Thank you.

145
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,688
Li Jin Yu, take this home. I've got to do something.

146
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,248
- What's wrong? 
 - I saw someone I know.

147
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:34,148
Sorry about earlier. It was urgent.

148
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,108
Tired? Let's finish planting tomorrow.

149
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:42,908
Seeds wait, but saplings need planting today.

150
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,908
What happened earlier?

151
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:50,240
Nothing.

152
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,000
Just tired. Tomorrow?

153
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,570
Fine.

154
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,540
I'm heading back then.

155
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:28,420
   

156
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:34,148
 First round only. Save nerves for finals. 

157
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:38,268
 Confident about making it to the finals? 

158
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:39,920
 Fairly. 

159
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,880
 Like you said, it's just a game. Chill. 

160
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:51,108
 The cake's sweet, and the birthday girl's pretty, 

161
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:53,728
 though wishes could be grander. 

162
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,228
Well?

163
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:59,548
My friend saw that car in X Space.

164
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:33,808
 I saw someone I know. 

165
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:35,328
Make the replica convincing,

166
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:40,008
and no one will distinguish the Ming dynasty, the Republic Era or modern. Right?

167
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:43,428
Enough. I'm busy.

168
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:13,928
Hey, I stared forever outside and almost didn't recognize you.

169
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:16,128
Y-You arranged this?

170
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:20,468
Come on. I referred clients before. You forgot me?

171
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:25,608
Seems familiar.

172
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,928
Meng Meng! Meng Meng!

173
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:35,768
This room's sweltering.

174
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:40,088
Definitely familiar. Very.

175
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:43,848
A toast to your prosperous business.

176
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:47,508
- Thanks. 
 - When did you return? How's business in Jiangbei?

177
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,528
- Not bad. 
 - Cheers.

178
00:18:57,008 --> 00:19:00,908
Brother, this ring's impressive.

179
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:04,228
Making money without me?

180
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:08,988
So, Meng Meng, good eye.

181
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:14,528
This Ningsui piece came from this place.

182
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,148
 That car's using a fake plate. Checked with the traffic police. 

183
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,848
Got it.

184
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:39,848
Bottoms up. Take me along next deal.

185
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:41,328
- Sure. 
 - More drinks.

186
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:44,740
Drink up. Finish it.

187
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,568
Finish it, finish it all. No leftovers. That's right.

188
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:56,288
That's the spirit.

189
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:58,060
What's this?

190
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:02,148
You said you were working. Working? This is your "work"?

191
00:20:02,148 --> 00:20:03,848
Go home. Now.

192
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,628
Just go.

193
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:10,288
Wait. You go home. I'll explain later.

194
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:11,988
What vows did you make at our wedding?

195
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:15,408
"Steady life" meant this scam?

196
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,508
Honey, we're innocent, really.

197
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:24,328
You go home. We'll talk—

198
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:26,148
Innocent? Go!

199
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:28,128
Stop!

200
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:40,748
I thought it was a honey trap at first.

201
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:45,388
Now playing tragic lovers? Good act.

202
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:47,188
You're misunderstanding. He misunderstood, too.

203
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:50,268
- Let me clarify with him. Back soon. 
 - Don't.

204
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:55,568
My first time here, and you're acting familiar. You can't just leave without explaining.

205
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:00,368
Hold them!

206
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,868
What are you waiting for? After them!

207
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:20,188
This way.

208
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:22,088
It's them two!

209
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:31,068
Stop! Don't run!

210
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:43,648
There! Hurry!

211
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,848
Stop right there!

212
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,200
Are they gone?

213
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,660
Why are you here?

214
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:16,288
You're dressed like this late at night. Who knows who you're meeting?

215
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:23,028
Seems like it bothers you.

216
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:30,768
That car's plate is fake. I had the traffic police check it.

217
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:33,468
Either smuggled or stolen.

218
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,568
You noticed this afternoon.

219
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:41,368
Why do you want to find him?

220
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:47,410
The ring he's wearing belonged to my mom.

221
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:50,328
Let's go back first.

222
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,988
- Stop! 
 - Stop! It's him!

223
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:00,388
Stop!

224
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:14,428
Good runner, huh? Run! Keep running!

225
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:16,568
You've got the wrong idea. Let me explain.

226
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:18,680
Enough.

227
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,220
Take them back.

228
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:54,848
Stay back.

229
00:23:59,948 --> 00:24:01,848
Beat him! Beat him hard!

230
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:03,648
 Go! 

231
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:08,148
Let's see who makes a move.

232
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:09,548
Why's he here?

233
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,188
- I called him. 
 - Don't you know whose turf this is?

234
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:13,568
You're hurt.

235
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,268
It's nothing.

236
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:18,048
Who are you?

237
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:23,428
Never mind that. No lawbreaking in Ningsui.

238
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:26,368
Move aside. Move.

239
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,468
These are the ones, police.

240
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:33,908
You're all coming with me.

241
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:37,888
Go, go, go.

242
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:45,468
Why do you cause trouble every time you come back?

243
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,768
Maybe you should just stay here.

244
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:53,188
I'll keep your cell ready for your later visits.

245
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:58,788
Officer Chen, you're still full of energy.

246
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:03,228
The pot calling the kettle black. You two are the same.

247
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:08,228
Ye Meng, you're making our jobs harder already?

248
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:10,068
Sorry.

249
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:13,568
Enough. Just joking. You've grown up now.

250
00:25:13,568 --> 00:25:16,088
At least, you know to call us when there's trouble.

251
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:19,328
Actually, we should thank you for tonight.

252
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:22,808
That Fat Buddha is definitely shady.

253
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:26,768
About your mother's ring,

254
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:29,808
it was purchased through legitimate channels.

255
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,148
He doesn't know much about the seller.

256
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:35,588
He just remembers the seller's last name is Wang.

257
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:38,088
I don't know what you're investigating,

258
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:40,248
but remember to ask us police for help.

259
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:43,468
This is civilized society. Obey the law. Understand?

260
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:45,088
Understood. Thank you, Officer Chen.

261
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:46,708
All right, go home.

262
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,428
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you, Officer Chen.

263
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:54,148
Let me look. You should go to the hospital for that.

264
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:56,268
No need. Just a scratch.

265
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:59,368
As the police said, the ring was legally obtained.

266
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:02,508
Finding the person is going to be tough.

267
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:07,708
Let me handle it. I know lots of people here.

268
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:11,528
No need. I'll handle it myself. Thanks for today.

269
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,328
N-Natural thing to do.

270
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:17,508
Well, since it's this late, let's get something to eat.

271
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:20,968
Night snacks. Let's go.

272
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:24,768
You really should treat that wound.

273
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:26,468
Really, it's fine.

274
00:26:40,268 --> 00:26:41,988
Here, I got Band-Aids.

275
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:43,368
I'm fine. Don't need it.

276
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,648
No, you need one.

277
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:57,788
Hold still.

278
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:05,828
- Does it hurt? 
 - No.

279
00:27:05,828 --> 00:27:07,508
Here, Brother Kai.

280
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,768
Put everything in front of Ye Meng.

281
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:12,368
Got it.

282
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:18,908
Try this tofu before it gets cold.

283
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:22,128
Try it. The hotplate tofu you loved as a kid.

284
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:25,568
- Its taste hasn't changed at all. 
 - Smells great.

285
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,988
Touched by me sharing my childhood memories?

286
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:36,468
Touched? If I hadn't come, Fat Buddha would've been harassing you.

287
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:41,088
If I hadn't shown up, you two wouldn't even have tofu to eat.

288
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:44,048
If you don't like tofu,

289
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:46,536
try this sweet fermented rice. Delicious.

290
00:27:46,536 --> 00:27:48,568
If you don't like sweets, give it to Kai Kai.

291
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:50,848
Kai Kai likes sweets.

292
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:54,048
Why give me what he doesn't want? I'm not a trash can.

293
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,808
Fine. I'll eat it all.

294
00:27:57,808 --> 00:28:02,268
I ordered all your favorites when you were in school.

295
00:28:04,088 --> 00:28:07,628
Kai Kai, thanks for today.

296
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:11,848
But I don't want you involved anymore.

297
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:15,468
I don't get involved, but he can?

298
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:17,768
You're different.

299
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:20,768
H-How are we different?

300
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:26,468
We've known each other for 10 years. How long have you two?

301
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:29,288
T-This... These are all our memories.

302
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:33,768
See. No one can bully Kai Kai from now on.

303
00:28:33,768 --> 00:28:36,988
This is not important. Ye Meng wrote this herself.

304
00:28:36,988 --> 00:28:39,228
Cheng Kai Ran, lower your voice. Stop shouting.

305
00:28:39,228 --> 00:28:40,568
Can't you calm down?

306
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:43,228
How am I supposed to calm down? You just put a band-aid on him.

307
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:46,428
You're so close to him. Even the chopsticks I gave you were given to him.

308
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:49,428
Do you know what we've been through together?

309
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,048
When I was beaten hard,

310
00:28:51,048 --> 00:28:54,988
she was the one who rushed over and protected me at all costs, know that?

311
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:59,028
When was that? I don't remember.

312
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:06,752
   

313
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,668
   

314
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:11,468
Why do you have my school badge?

315
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:16,192
The first day after National Day during your senior year,

316
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:21,768
when I was cornered in the alley behind the school, you rushed over to protect me.

317
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:25,528
 If you hadn't saved me that day, I would've been crippled. 

318
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:32,808
I understand why you started resenting and avoiding me later.

319
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:35,290
I went to you every day...

320
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,180
just to see you more.

321
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:42,748
Why don't I remember any of this?

322
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:51,148
October 8 of your senior year, I'll remember it forever.

323
00:29:51,148 --> 00:29:56,528
October 8? That wasn't me. It was Fang Ya En.

324
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:03,350
Ye Meng.

325
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:10,468
Even if you want to cut ties with me, don't joke about this.

326
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:13,948
It really wasn't me. I remember that day clearly.

327
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:19,768
 Hello, Director. 

328
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,768
 Director. 

329
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:23,668
 Where's your school badge? 

330
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:30,228
 Oh, no, I forgot my badge. If he catches me, I'll get lectured for hours. 

331
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,888
 I'll go in first. 

332
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:35,588
 Wait for me by the back wall. I'll give you my badge. 

333
00:30:35,588 --> 00:30:37,528
 - Which class are you from? 
 - All right, go. 

334
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:39,548
 What's your name? 

335
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:42,148
 Hurry up! The bell's about to ring. 

336
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:50,868
 Run. Keep running. Still want to run now? 

337
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:52,528
 - I won't run! 
 - Try running again! 

338
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:54,328
 I'm not running anymore. 

339
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:57,148
 Aren't you good at running? 

340
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,708
 No more running. No more. 

341
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,228
 - Still hiding? 
 - I won't run! 

342
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:01,388
 Try hiding again. 

343
00:31:01,388 --> 00:31:03,188
 Go away. 

344
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:13,088
 Run! 

345
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,128
 - Beat her up! 
 - Stop! 

346
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:19,468
 Stay there! Don't run! 

347
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,924
   

348
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,228
   

349
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,028
 Ye Meng. 

350
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,168
 - School officials, right? 
 - Yes, yes. 

351
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:42,448
 This is my son's injury report. 

352
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:44,088
 Our school will strengthen— 

353
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:46,228
 You need to give me an explanation. Who allowed this? 

354
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:47,388
 Don't worry. Don't worry. 

355
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:49,948
 Was it you? Did you do this? 

356
00:31:49,948 --> 00:31:52,388
 No hitting! No violence at school! 

357
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,568
 - My son's in the hospital! 
 - Don't worry. 

358
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:55,808
 It was my son who got beaten. 

359
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:57,528
 Our school will hold a meeting to address your son's case. 

360
00:31:57,528 --> 00:32:00,148
 Listen, you must give me an explanation today. 

361
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:02,328
 - Okay, okay. 
 - Or I won't let this go. Let me tell you... 

362
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:04,528
 That punk got injured and was hospitalized. 

363
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:06,848
 His mother came to school and made a huge scene. 

364
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:10,228
The situation escalated so much that Ya En had to drop out of school.

365
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:14,708
That's when Ya En left Ningsui to work in another city.

366
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:22,188
You've been following me all these years, thinking I was your savior, right?

367
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:36,568
Take this.

368
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:41,700
   

369
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:46,468
Ya En?

370
00:32:52,628 --> 00:33:02,368
 No one can bully Kai Kai. 

371
00:33:04,128 --> 00:33:09,568
 Fang Ya En. 

372
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,670
   

373
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:32,468
 Back off! Don't move! 

374
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,848
 That punk got injured and was hospitalized. 

375
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:40,228
 His mother came to school and made a huge scene. 

376
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:43,888
 The situation escalated so much that Ya En had to drop out of school. 

377
00:34:53,948 --> 00:34:56,628
Mom, we're out of tissues.

378
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,508
Coming.

379
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:18,568
My face is fine. You should head back.

380
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:21,368
No, wait. Let me check. This needs disinfection.

381
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:23,748
Otherwise, if it scars, your face will be ruined.

382
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:27,148
- It's not that bad. 
 - Please.

383
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:29,048
Wait a moment.

384
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:32,948
Take any seat.

385
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:38,328
Quite thorough. There's even a first aid kit.

386
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:54,388
Are you still thinking about Fang Ya En and Cheng Kai Ran?

387
00:35:55,788 --> 00:36:01,928
Yes. I wish we could go back in time.

388
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:07,748
There wouldn't be that misunderstanding. Ya En and Kai's lives would be different.

389
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,168
What's wrong?

390
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:17,228
Missing my mom.

391
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:30,268
Give me your hand.

392
00:36:54,368 --> 00:37:01,568
You know what? I have a savings passbook from my mom.

393
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,700
Deposit only.

394
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,920
Each entry has a different amount.

395
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:13,748
But every deposit has her personal notes.

396
00:37:16,688 --> 00:37:21,388
Buy Meng Meng a cake when she's sad.

397
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:33,228
Get Meng Meng heels for college dates.

398
00:37:36,028 --> 00:37:37,880
When she starts working,

399
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,380
buy her a decent bag.

400
00:37:51,308 --> 00:37:53,690
If your mom loved you so much,

401
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,168
why...

402
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:01,668
Exactly. That's what confuses me too.

403
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,908
A while ago...

404
00:38:06,908 --> 00:38:10,028
Remember when I wanted to buy a house in Jiangbei?

405
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:16,168
My grandma only told me the ring was missing when they tried to help with the down payment.

406
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:22,308
But my mom treasured that thumb ring. She'd never lose it.

407
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,380
The same one Fat Buddha wore today.

408
00:38:26,968 --> 00:38:30,848
Two days before my mom's suicide, I saw a man visit her.

409
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:36,268
 I thought it was the man in the car today, but he wasn't. 

410
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:46,468
But at least, we've got a new clue today.

411
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:53,548
We'll follow this ring clue and dig deeper. We're bound to find something.

412
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:58,548
Next time something like this happens, remember to call me.

413
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:04,848
You look down on me. If you hadn't come today, I could have handled it myself.

414
00:39:05,748 --> 00:39:08,708
Seems like I'm dispensable.

415
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:16,228
Just kidding. I was actually terrified.

416
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:36,300
Li Jin Yu...

417
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,600
you're not dispensable.

418
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,640
It's great having you around.

419
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:55,008
I'm taking this off for you.

420
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,850
Does it hurt?

421
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:20,928
No.

422
00:40:25,368 --> 00:40:27,320
Li Jin Yu...

423
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,160
were you jealous today?

424
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,110
No.

425
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:37,588
No? Really?

426
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:44,588
I thought you were meeting your ex-boss.

427
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:04,008
Don't underestimate yourself, and don't underestimate me either.

428
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:15,508
Didn't you tell me before? I'm the woman with the best taste you've ever met.

429
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:22,988
Okay, got it.

430
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:25,520
Got what?

431
00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:28,008
Not telling you.

432
00:41:28,668 --> 00:41:32,148
Playing hard to get?

433
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:36,668
You're quite good at this. All this time I've been so serious.

434
00:41:37,488 --> 00:41:41,728
All right, I need to rest. You should get some sleep, too.

435
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:43,508
Go home.

436
00:41:43,508 --> 00:41:46,168
Resting this early? That's nonsense.

437
00:41:46,168 --> 00:41:47,668
Go.

438
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:51,128
Making it sound like I'm clinging to you. Fine, I'll leave.

439
00:41:58,288 --> 00:42:00,168
Goodnight.

440
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:01,968
Goodnight.

441
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:30,030



442
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,960
 'You' - Xia Heng 

443
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,140
♫  You  ♫
