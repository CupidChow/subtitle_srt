ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>DEEP AFFECTION EYES</i>
BY ER DONG TU ZI ON JJWXC.NET

2
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,280
You actually rejected him?

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
I'm begging you both.

4
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,480
If you like each other,
just be together, okay?

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,160
Stop this endless back-and-forth!

6
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,640
I do want to be with him,

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,480
but not if it's just out of pity.

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
Ugh, why am I like this?

9
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,080
I chased him before.

10
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,720
Now that he's finally interested,
I'm over here nitpicking.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,840
God, I'm insufferable.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,200
Love's all about
"one thing conquering another".

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
This is the first time I've seen you

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,840
so insecure in romance.

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,040
I just need to hear
his answer from his own lips.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,320
You're being so extra right now.

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
Hurry up, Wang.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Help me slash and get the discount.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
I've already sent you the link.

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,800
Come on. I can't reach
the discount myself. Send more invites!

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,600
I'll go easy on you in cards next time.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,160
Ugh, I'm still not there!

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,280
Chenxiang is back.

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
What "Chenxiang"?

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
Chenxiang Rescues His Mother!

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,080
Even if it means splitting your bones

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,120
to save your mother.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It is Chenxiang.

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,880
It wasn't her who was sick.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,880
It was Li Zhuofeng,

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,080
your own grandson.

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,000
But he's fine now.

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,640
The transplant went perfectly.
Please don't worry.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,680
I'm not concerned about him.

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,520
It's you I'm worried about.

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,640
What nonsense are you spewing?

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
You're not my own grandson?

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,200
What are you implying?
Trying to dodge your responsibilities

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,800
and bail on being my grandson?

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,120
Why does that sound so harsh?

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Listen up. You're obligated
to support me in my old age.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,600
No way you're getting out of this!

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Don't worry.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,880
I'll definitely take care of you
in your old age.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
You've got gray hair.

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,520
Come. Sit down!

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,240
Look at your face.

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
It's ghostly pale,

49
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,880
like it's made of paper.

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,600
You went to Jiangbei alone,
with no one to look after you,

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
and ended up getting hurt.

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Getting hurt.

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,320
Ye Meng came to see me.

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,480
Ye Meng is such a good girl,
really special.

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,440
You'd better cherish her properly!

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
I…

57
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,680
I'd like to give it a try.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,400
Do you think that'd be okay?

59
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
Okay.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,960
Go try it right now. Don't wait.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Unless you want those gray hairs

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,520
to wreck your looks

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,880
and leave you single forever.

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,360
Hurry up.

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,120
Slash it for the discount.

66
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,519
Coming!

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,840
Hi.

68
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
Your home's pipes are aging.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,520
We didn't get to fix them last time. So…

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,280
By the time you went to Jiangbei,
I had already had it repaired.

71
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Alright then.

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,360
Well…

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,760
I was just thinking
about sprucing up the yard.

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,640
Want to take on the job, Gardener Li?

75
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,000
Fine.

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,400
Gardener Li, you've worked hard.

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
Let me help.

78
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,840
Li Jinyu.

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,080
Do you know there was
a pile of dog poop just now?

80
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Really?

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,320
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,240
Didn't you see it yourself?

83
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,240
So, what are you going to do now
with dog shit all over your nose?

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,160
I can wipe it myself.

85
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,480
What about my hand then?

86
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,800
Your hand…

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
I'll wipe it. I'll do it too.

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,760
Got you!
There's no dog poop on that at all.

89
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,960
You're so boring.

90
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
What's wrong?

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
It's just a bee. Don't be afraid.

92
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,920
It's already flown away.

93
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
It scared me.

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,840
Never thought someone as tough
as you would be scared of bees.

95
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,840
All girls are scared of bugs.

96
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,960
How can you be this clueless?

97
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,000
It's coming again.

98
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
What's going on?

99
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
Just kidding. No, really.
I was messing with you.

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,000
Ugh, you're impossible.

101
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,600
Li Jinyu, what's going on with you?

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,440
You've been a little shit
since the dog poop joke.

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,720
I said, stop messing around.

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,560
- Still want to keep it up?
- No.

105
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,520
Stop messing around.

106
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,520
What's the matter with you?

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,840
Ms. Ye.

108
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,600
- Please sign for the oversized luggage.
- Someone's here.

109
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,040
Coming.

110
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,480
From Jiangbei?

111
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,680
- Yes.
- Okay.

112
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,360
PACKAGES TO SEND? WE DELIVER THE SOLUTION!

113
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,240
- Give me a hand.
- Beg me.

114
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,720
Li Jinyu, still asking for more?

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,200
You're no match for me.

116
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,840
Sir,

117
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,680
could you give me a hand?
Let's move them together.

118
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,200
Delivery only. Can't help with moving.

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,640
- Fine.
- Which one is ours?

120
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,120
All of them.

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
- Can you move it?
- Yes.

122
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,280
Could you please move aside?

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,160
Hurry up. I have more orders to deliver.

124
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,400
Fine!

125
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,480
- Give it to me.
- Thanks.

126
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,320
Help me unpack them.
I'm going to wash my hands.

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,880
TO YE MENG

128
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,040
One of them is a gift, I think.

129
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
"To Ye Meng".

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
A camera.

131
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,040
But this doesn't seem new at all.

132
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
It was probably sent to me
by my former boss

133
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,560
through my friend
when they were packing things up.

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,040
Your ex-boss sent you a camera?
What's that supposed to mean?

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
What could it possibly mean?

136
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,400
It's just full
of our team-building photos.

137
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,120
"Team-building" with just the two of you?

138
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
You're so observant.

139
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,720
Look, there's still a lot …

140
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,840
here.

141
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,120
You two are awfully close.

142
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
Wait!

143
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,520
Look.

144
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
There are plenty of other people here!

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,960
How could this team-building
just be the two of us?

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Seems your ex-boss
is trying to rekindle something here.

147
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,080
Then let him keep dreaming!

148
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,280
Li Jinyu,

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,800
if you're jealous,

150
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,040
maybe wait until
you're actually my boyfriend.

151
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,200
Now that the weeds are cleared,

152
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,320
let's go buy some greenery.

153
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
Buy flowers instead. Skip the greenery.

154
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
You jealous little bun. Alright.

155
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,640
I'd like to buy some sunflowers.

156
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,880
It's your place.

157
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,480
Do whatever you want.

158
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,320
We're supposed
to build this place together.

159
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,960
Could you at least pretend to care?

160
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,040
I'm not your boyfriend.

161
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,600
What's there to build together?

162
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,160
Still hung up on that?

163
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,960
If you can't figure out
why you're not my boyfriend by now…

164
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,040
These sunflowers are nice.

165
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,760
Hey, boss.

166
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Give me a pack of sunflower seeds,

167
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,520
and this one too.

168
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,560
- That'll be 30. You can scan me first.
- Sure.

169
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Thank you.

170
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
Just a moment, please.

171
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,520
Paid.

172
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Which pot?

173
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,000
This.

174
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,880
Just FYI, my <i>Wuxing</i> murders plants.

175
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,400
How long these survive? No guarantees.

176
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,480
So, dear Gardener Li,
prepare for heavy rescue duty.

177
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,840
Will I get a raise?

178
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,240
Sure,

179
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,640
if you want to keep this transactional.

180
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,200
Let me rephrase.

181
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Sowing, watering, fertilizing,
and pruning. I'll handle everything.

182
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,920
If I perform well,

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
may I have a seat at the dining table?

184
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,560
Here you go.

185
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,280
Table seating? Not a chance.

186
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,880
But the sidewalk stall? Definitely.

187
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,400
What's this? It's actually kind of cute.

188
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,000
- One order of sticky rice cake, please.
- Alright.

189
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,760
Ten yuan.

190
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
Thank you.

191
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,360
Li Jinyu, take this home for me.
I've got something to attend to.

192
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,280
What happened?

193
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,520
Ran into an acquaintance.

194
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,920
Sorry about earlier.

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,480
Something urgent came up.

196
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,680
You must be tired.

197
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,080
Shall we plant the rest tomorrow?

198
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,680
Seeds can wait till tomorrow,

199
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,480
but these seedlings must be planted today.

200
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,280
What happened earlier?

201
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,960
Nothing. Just…

202
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,480
I'm actually tired too.

203
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,400
Can we do it tomorrow?

204
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,120
Okay.

205
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,600
I'll be going now.

206
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,440
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

207
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,480
‪GOU KAI: THE CAKE IS SWEET,
‪THE BIRTHDAY GIRL IS BEAUTIFUL,

208
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,440
‪THOUGH YOUR WISH COULD STAND
‪TO BE A BIT MORE AMBITIOUS.

209
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,160
<i>This is just the first round.</i>

210
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,760
<i>Save your nerves for the finals.</i>

211
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,280
The finals?

212
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,320
You're that confident?

213
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,240
Not really.

214
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,160
Like you said, it's just a game.

215
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,080
Relax.

216
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,160
<i>The cake is sweet,</i>
<i>the birthday girl radiant,</i>

217
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,640
<i>though your wish could be bolder.</i>

218
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
How's that?

219
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,640
My friend told me

220
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,600
they spotted that car in X Space.

221
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,360
<i>Ran into an acquaintance.</i>

222
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,120
JIANG A 95566

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,800
JIANG A 95566

224
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,080
‪Both of you, this way.

225
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,400
If the fake is convincing enough,

226
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
who cares if it is from

227
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
the Ming Dynasty, the Republic era,
or modern time?

228
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,200
Right?

229
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,920
Anyway, gotta go. I'm busy.

230
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's sing…

231
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,520
Join us.

232
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,160
Join us.

233
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,280
Sure.

234
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,040
Bro!

235
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,920
I was staring outside for ages.
Thought I was seeing things.

236
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,080
This… This was your doing?

237
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,320
What are you talking about?

238
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,320
I referred clients to you before.
Have you forgotten?

239
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,160
You look somewhat familiar.

240
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,440
Meng.

241
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,160
Meng.

242
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,600
But damn, it's boiling in here!

243
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,480
You do look familiar.

244
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
- Really familiar.
- Let me propose a toast.

245
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,080
It's been too long.

246
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,920
To your flourishing business.

247
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
- Thanks.
- So, when did you return?

248
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Everything good
with your Jiangbei ventures?

249
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,880
- Not bad.
- Bottoms up.

250
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,520
Bro, this ring looks amazing!

251
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,640
How come you never think of me
when you strike it rich?

252
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,640
So, Meng, right?

253
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,680
Great taste!

254
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,040
This is from Ningsui.

255
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,640
It's from…

256
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,000
It's from here.

257
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
<i>That car has fake plates.</i>

258
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,240
<i>I checked with traffic police.</i>

259
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,240
Got it.

260
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,720
Cheers. Bottoms up.

261
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,040
- Bottoms up?
- Don't forget about me when you get rich.

262
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,400
- No problem.
- Come on.

263
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,760
Drink!

264
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,040
Empty that glass.

265
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,160
Not a single drop left!

266
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,320
That's it!

267
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
That's right.

268
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,440
What the hell are you doing?

269
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,800
You said you were at work!

270
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,040
Is this what you call "working"?

271
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,880
Get home.

272
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,240
- Now!
- Not now.

273
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,800
Go home first. I'll explain later.

274
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,920
What happened
to all your promises at our wedding?

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,200
To live an honest life every day.

276
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,400
Is this how you keep your vows?

277
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,000
Honey, what were you even thinking?

278
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,400
That's my brother.

279
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,000
Go home first. I'll explain…

280
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,160
Who cares whose brother? Just go.

281
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,120
Stop!

282
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,520
At first,

283
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,360
I thought it was a honey trap.

284
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
Now you're pulling
this "star-crossed lovers" act.

285
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,080
Nice performance.

286
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,240
It's all misunderstandings.
He's confused too.

287
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,360
Let me go explain outside.

288
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,560
- I'll be right back.
- Hold on!

289
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,600
This is my first time in Ningsui,
and you're acting like we're old friends.

290
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,560
You think you can
just walk away without explaining?

291
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,720
Block them!

292
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,680
Why are you just standing there?
Go after them!

293
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,000
This way.

294
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,520
It's them two!

295
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,080
- Don't run!
- Stop!

296
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,400
Don't run!

297
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,040
There!

298
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,200
Hurry up!

299
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,480
Stop!

300
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,160
Don't run!

301
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,760
They left?

302
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,000
But why are you here?

303
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,000
Out at this hour with this dress.

304
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,560
Do enlighten me who deserves the honor.

305
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,480
Does it bother you?

306
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,440
That car's plates are fake.

307
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,760
Traffic police confirmed it.

308
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,960
Either smuggled or stolen.

309
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,920
You've been bothered since this afternoon.

310
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,800
What business could you
possibly have with him?

311
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,640
That ring on his hand…

312
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,760
It's my mother's.

313
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
Let's discuss this at home.

314
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,280
Stop!

315
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,400
- Stop!
- It's him!

316
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,040
Stop!

317
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,160
Think you're quick?

318
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,360
Run! Keep running!

319
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,800
Bro, no! Serious misunderstanding!

320
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,000
- Let me explain.
- Enough!

321
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,720
Take them back first.

322
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,360
- Stay back!
- Chase me!

323
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,520
Fuck him up! No mercy!

324
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Move!

325
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,280
Let me see who dares throw the punch.

326
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,600
Why is he here?

327
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,560
- I told him.
- Messing around in my territory?

328
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,640
You're injured.

329
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,600
I'm okay.

330
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Which syndicate do you claim?

331
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,840
Where I'm from doesn't matter.

332
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,600
In Ningsui, crime doesn't fly.

333
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,440
- Clear the lane!
- Clear the lane!

334
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,360
That's them, Officer.

335
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,040
Come with me to the station.

336
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,880
Go!

337
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,960
Back in Ningsui for five minutes
and already making trouble?

338
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,840
Tell you what.

339
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,840
Stay forever.

340
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,080
That room? I'll keep it ready.

341
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,080
Save us these frequent reunions.

342
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,560
Officer Chen,

343
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,960
long time no see.

344
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,360
You're as energetic as ever.

345
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,480
Pot calling the kettle black.

346
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,800
You two are cut from the same cloth.

347
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Ye Meng,

348
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,360
back for five minutes

349
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
and already turning up the heat?

350
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,560
I'm sorry.

351
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,640
Alright, just joking with you all.

352
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
You've grown wiser,

353
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,560
knowing to call the police
when in trouble.

354
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,560
Actually, we should thank you tonight.

355
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,680
That "Fat Buddha" guy
was indeed suspicious.

356
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,160
As for your mother's ring

357
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,440
you asked about,

358
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,000
it was purchased
through legitimate channels.

359
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,000
As for the seller,

360
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,240
he wasn't entirely certain either.

361
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,000
Only recalling that
the person's last name was Wang.

362
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,880
I'm not sure
what exactly you're looking into,

363
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,240
but if anything comes up,
seek help from the police.

364
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,880
In a civilized society,
obey the law. Understood?

365
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,920
Understood. Thank you, Officer Chen.

366
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,800
Alright, you're free to go.

367
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,920
- We really appreciate it.
- Thank you, Officer Chen.

368
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,040
Let me see. You should go to the hospital.

369
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,320
That needs proper treatment.

370
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,960
Nah. Just a scratch.

371
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
As the police confirmed,

372
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,320
the ring was legally purchased.

373
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Tracking people down just got complicated.

374
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
Leave the hunt to me.

375
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,960
My little black book runs deep.

376
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
No need.

377
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,880
I'll handle it myself.

378
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,600
Thanks for today though.

379
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,920
No need for thanks.

380
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,440
Anyway,

381
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,080
l look how late it is.

382
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,000
Midnight snack?

383
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,720
My treat!

384
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,680
Go.

385
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,160
You'll need medical attention.

386
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,800
I am fine.

387
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,080
Come on. I bought Band-Aids.

388
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm fine. No, thanks.

389
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,840
No, put one on.

390
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,120
Hold still.

391
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
- Does it hurt?
- Coming.

392
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,880
- No.
- Here, Kai.

393
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,520
DONGTING RESTAURANT

394
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,720
Place them all before Ye Meng.

395
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,640
Okay.

396
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,640
Try this tofu.

397
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
It's about to heal by now.

398
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Try this.

399
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,000
This is the sizzling iron-plate tofu
you adored as a little one.

400
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,320
Not a single flavor changed.

401
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,680
Smells decent.

402
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,840
Reliving my childhood for you…

403
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,120
Aren't you touched?

404
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,320
Touched.

405
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,880
If I hadn't shown up,

406
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,320
you would be Fat Buddha's tofu.

407
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,120
Had I been late,

408
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
you would have no chance
to eat tofu anymore.

409
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,080
If tofu's not your thing,

410
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,360
try this fermented rice wine.

411
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,280
Cloyingly sweet!

412
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,640
But if sweetness offends,
Kai'll devour it.

413
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,160
Kai has a sweet tooth.

414
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
Why should I have to eat his leftovers?

415
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,200
I'm not a garbage disposal.

416
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,120
Fine, I'll eat it all!

417
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
Happy now?

418
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,360
I've ordered all the dishes

419
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,600
you loved back in our school days.

420
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Kai,

421
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,720
your help today is appreciated.

422
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,000
But this is where your involvement ends.

423
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,160
My involvement ends, and his doesn't.

424
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,600
You're different.

425
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,840
I…

426
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,960
What makes me different?

427
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,880
We've been friends for nearly a decade.

428
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,080
How long have you two
even known each other?

429
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,760
This, all of this,

430
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,400
is our shared memories.

431
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,720
Look at this.

432
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
"No one's allowed to bully Kai!"

433
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,720
Ignore this.

434
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,600
Ye Meng. She wrote it.

435
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,560
Cheng Kairan, lower your voice.

436
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,240
Stop yelling. Can't you just stay calm?

437
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,040
How do you expect me to stay calm?

438
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,000
You're the one sticking
Band-Aids on him, sitting so close.

439
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,480
Even the chopsticks I got for you,
you handed to him.

440
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,480
Do you have any clue
what we've endured together?

441
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,800
When I was getting beaten
like a stray dog,

442
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,920
she was the one who charged in,

443
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,200
the one who shielded me
with no regard for her own life.

444
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,320
When did that happen? I don't recall.

447
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,480
How did my school ID end up in your hands?

448
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,560
On the first day

449
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,800
after National Day in your senior year,

450
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,160
I was cornered in the school's back alley,

451
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,600
and you charged in to shield me.

452
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,520
<i>Had you not saved me that day,</i>

453
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
<i>I'd have surely been badly injured.</i>

454
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,280
<i>Afterward,</i>

455
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,040
<i>you began to resent me, pushing me away.</i>

456
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,680
I get it.

457
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,560
I kept seeking you out daily,

458
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,920
just to catch more glimpses of you.

459
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
How come I don't remember this?

460
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,960
At your senior year.

461
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,920
October eighth.

462
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,840
Etched in my bones.

463
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
October 8th?

464
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,880
That wasn't me. It was Fang Ya'en.

465
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,720
Ye Meng.

466
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,080
If cutting ties is your goal,

467
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,120
don't weaponize that memory.

468
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,400
That wasn't me.
I have a crystal clear recall of that day.

469
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,920
- Good day, Dean.
- Forgot your ID?

470
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,080
Dean.

471
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,120
Where's your school ID?

472
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,760
Oh no, I forgot my school ID.

473
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,120
If he catches me,
it's another eternity of lecturing.

474
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,960
I'll go in first,

475
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,880
then you wait for me
behind the school building,

476
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,800
and I'll hand you my school ID.

477
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,880
- Which class?
- Fine, go.

478
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,840
What's your name?

479
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,440
Hurry up. The bell's about to ring.

480
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,560
Run! Run again?

481
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,920
Run away again?

482
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,520
- No!
- I dare you.

483
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,640
I'm not running anymore.

484
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,840
So good at running, huh?

485
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,800
I'm not running!

486
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,040
- Still hiding.
- I'm not running!

487
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,240
- Try hiding again.
- Go away!

488
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,120
Run!

489
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,400
- Hit her!
- Stop!

490
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,520
- Stop right there!
- Don't you dare run!

491
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,640
Stay there!

No violence in school.

00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,440
- My son is in the hospital.
- Rest assured.

505
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,600
It was my son who got beaten up.

We'll give your boy the justice.

- Fine.

So, that's when Ya'en

515
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,040
fled Ningsui,
drifting through menial jobs.

516
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,720
While you orbited me,

517
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,720

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,560

Don't worry about my face.

00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,639
You should head back now.

534
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,360
No, that won't do. Let me check.

535
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
We must disinfect this properly,

536
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,679

could really disfigure your face.

537
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,239
- You're exaggerating.
- I beg you.

538
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,159
Wait a moment.

539
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,360
Take a seat for now.

540
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,440
Quite meticulous.
There's also a first-aid kit.

541

543
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,640
Yes.

544
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,840
I wish I could go back in time.

Ya'en and Kai's lives

547
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,000
would be so different now.

548
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,680
What's wrong?

549
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,560
I missed my mom.

550
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,920
Here.

551
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,600
Give me your hand.

552
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,720
You know,

553
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,480
I have a savings passbook

554
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,000
from my mom.

555
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,960
Deposit only, no withdrawals.

556
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Every amount

557
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,120
is different,

558
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,320
but each entry

559
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,200
has her little notes beside it.

560
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,920
"Buy Meng a cake

561
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,720
when she's sad."

562
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,640
"Buy Meng a pair of high heels

563
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,560
when she's on a date with her boyfriend

564
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,440
during college."

565
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,240
"Get her a decent bag…

566
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,440
when she starts her career."

567
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,040
Then how could your mom,

568
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,920
who loves you so much…

569
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,240
Yeah,

570
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,920
that's exactly why I find it so strange.

571
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,320
A while back, just recently,

572
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,040
when I was planning
to buy a house in Jiangbei,

573
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,360
my grandma and the others

574
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,240
wanted to help me with the down payment,

575
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,960
and that's when they told me
the thumb ring was missing.

576
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,640
But my mom treasured that ring deeply

577
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,520
when she was alive.

578
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,560
No way she would've ever lost it.

579
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
The one Fat Buddha was wearing today.

580
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,440
Two days before my mom killed herself,

581
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,440
I saw a man went to see her.

582
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,640
<i>Today I thought it was the man in the car.</i>

583
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,600
<i>But it was not.</i>

584
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,640
Anyway,

585
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,560
at least we've got a new lead today.

586
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
We can follow this ring

587
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,800
and dig deeper.

588
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,800
We're bound to find something.

589
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,120
Next time this comes up,

590
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,680
remember to bring me along.

591
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,560
You look down on me a bit, don't you?

592
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,200
If you hadn't come today,
I could have handled it myself.

593
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,960
Looks like I'm dispensable now.

594
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,280
Just kidding.

595
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm actually terrified.

596
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,600
Li Jinyu.

597
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,040
You're not dispensable.

598
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,040
Having you is truly wonderful.

599
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,960
I'll take this down for you.

600
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,440
Does it hurt?

601
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,400
No.

602
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Li Jinyu.

603
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,720
Did you feel jealous today?

604
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,440
No.

605
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,000
No? Really?

606
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
I thought

607
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,960
you were going to meet your former boss.

608
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,720
Don't underestimate yourself,

609
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,360
and don't underestimate me.

610
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,440
Didn't you tell me once

611
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,480
that I'm the lady who has the best taste?

612
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,320
Okay, I know.

613
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,760
What do you know?

614
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,760
I won't tell you.

615
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,960
Playing hard to get, huh?

616
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,040
You're quite the expert, kid.

617
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,600
And here I was taking it so seriously.

618
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,600
Alright.

619
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,320
I need to rest.

620
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,160
You should too. Go.

621
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,160
Rest this early? You're totally lying.

622
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,160
Quickly!

623
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,400
As if I'm some burden to you.

624
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,520
Fine. I'm leaving then.

625
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,600
Good night.

626
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Good night.

627
