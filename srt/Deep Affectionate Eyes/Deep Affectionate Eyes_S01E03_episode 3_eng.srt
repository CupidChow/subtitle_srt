 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:11,779
♫  I still remember it clearly  ♫

3
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:15,393
♫  Your eyes sparkled back then  ♫

4
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:20,578
♫  The way you lit up when telling me you loved me  ♫

5
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:25,759
♫  But over time, you've forgotten  ♫

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:31,107
♫  Promises left behind at every twist in life  ♫

7
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:34,695
♫  Only memories remain like scattered fireworks  ♫

8
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:38,159
♫  When I turned to walk away  ♫

9
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,791
♫  If I could go back to the day we said goodbye  ♫

10
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:48,763
♫  I'd never let go of your hand  ♫

11
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:53,799
♫  I can't hide the flutters in my heart  ♫

12
00:00:53,799 --> 00:01:01,079
♫  I'm about to be out of control as breathing turns weightless  ♫

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,879
♫  All I possess is drowned by the me who still loves you deeply  ♫

14
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,243
♫  I'll never change even if miracles exist  ♫

15
00:01:11,243 --> 00:01:15,426
♫  Don't forget, our promises will be kept  ♫

16
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:20,530
♫  And the dream where I'm with you  ♫

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:26,904
   

18
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:30,300
   

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,820
- See you later, Ya En. 
 - You've worked hard today.

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,600
Li Jin Yu.

21
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,040
Sorry, you lost your job because of me today.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,900
I'll talk to Kai Kai. It will be fine.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,480
I want a peaceful life without complications.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,240
What do you mean?

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,520
I just want to take care of my grandma. That's it.

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,380
So, stop messing with me. I know you're just fooling around.

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,050
I'm off.

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:08,800

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,220
What's wrong with Chen Jian? I thought he wanted a divorce.

30
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,280
He didn't cherish our relationship, but now he refuses to let go.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,360
Forget about that loser.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,000
- Let me help you. 
 - No need.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,480
- Be careful. 
 - You may break my arm. Don't.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,040
Sorry.

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,260
My arm...

36
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,780
What would you like to eat, Jia Yu? Let me show off my cooking skills.

37
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,340
Please don't. I will never forget the dishes you made.

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,800
Let's just order takeout.

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,440
You've traumatized my son with your cooking.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,880
Fine, it's my treat. Order it on my phone.

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,780
Thanks, Godmother.

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,340
What about the child if you get divorced?

43
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,320
I don't care about anything else. Jia Yu is my whole world.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,060
Chen Jian can't take him away.

45
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,980
Let's get crab roe noodles again, okay?

46
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,780
Okay.

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,960
No scallion for Godmother. Double scallion for Mom, right?

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
That's right.

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,120
 Here is Li Jin Yu's phone number. 

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,500
 Sister, this is all I can do for you. 

51
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:47,030
   

52
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,120
   

53
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,120
- I can walk pretty well. 
 - I can even run now.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,240
All right.

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,920
Go to the city for your errands after dropping me off at home.

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,220
- Will you be fine? 
 - Yeah, I'll be fine.

57
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,180
Why is he here again?

58
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,300
- I wasn't here. Bye. 
 - All right, hurry up.

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,600
- Kai Kai. 
 - Sister Ya En.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,500
- Why are you alone? 
 - It's just me here.

61
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,840
Where's Ye Meng?

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,190
She has work and didn't come.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,300
- See you. 
 - Wait,

64
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,000
Let us give you a ride. Where are you going?

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,400
- No need. My leg is fine. 
 - Don't be shy.

66
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,500
- Come on. Let me give you a ride. 
 - I'm not being shy. Wait, I...

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Keep that foot elevated.

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,760
Granny, why did you come out?

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm tired of lying in bed. My entire body aches.

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,240
So, I came out to get some sun and fresh air.

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,900
Yeah, it's a nice day for a walk.

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,660
Go over there and hang out with them.

73
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,320
- Tell me if you need anything. 
 - Go ahead.

74
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,460
- Come on, let's sit somewhere. 
 - All right.

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,500
Where's Li Jin Yu? Why isn't he here?

76
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,370
Sit.

77
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,440
Are you close with Ba Dou?

78
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,160
Not particularly.

79
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,960
Why not try getting to know him?

80
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,400
My grandson might lack elsewhere, but he's very handsome.

81
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Number One.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,040
- Don't your parents want a live-in son-in-law? 
 - Yeah.

83
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,840
Ba Dou is your best choice. He meets all your requirements.

84
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,100
Granny, the whole town knows whenever our family does anything.

85
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,080
What if people gossip about Li Ba Dou?

86
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,980
So what? Li Ba Dou took his mother's surname.

87
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:26,040
Don't judge him by his laid-back attitude. He's actually quite capable.

88
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,820
Right, I bet you like those foreign movies...

89
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,280
- What's it called? Something "tic." 
 - Romantic.

90
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,300
Ba Dou can be your personal translator.

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,660
- I didn't know that Li Ba Dou grew up overseas. 
 - Granny.

92
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,100
All right, got it.

93
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,560
It's about time. Let's head back.

94
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,140
- Give us a second. 
 - I'll keep her company.

95
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,980
Don't worry.

96
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,400
Take me on an adventurous escape.
I'll treat you to coffee.

97
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,940
I guess that could work.

98
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,820
My treat. Pinky promise.

99
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,320
Pinky promise.

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,340
Let's go. Come on.

101
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,740
- What can I get for you? 
 - Two hot oat milk lattes.

102
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,960
That'll be 50 yuan. Scan here.

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,160
- Let me get this. 
 - No need. I was joking with you.

104
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,580
I'll transfer you the money,

105
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,780
or you'll find me stingy and ignore Ba Dou.

106
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,100
No way.

107
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Thank you.

108
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,280
Granny, you're just like my own grandmother.

109
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,880
Our coffees are ready. Let me get them.

110
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,140
Thank you.

111
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,280
Ms. Li, can we negotiate a higher rate?

112
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
Two thousand per session.

113
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,440
That's the maximum rate here.
Feel free to ask around.

114
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,740
Excuse me, I need to take this.

115
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,620
Hello? Who's this?

116
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,560
Li Jin Yu, how dare you do this
behind your grandma's back?

117
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,940
What nonsense.

118
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,660
Nonsense? I saw you with my own eyes.

119
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,380
How dare you do this...

120
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,240
Two thousand per session is acceptable.
But I want long-term cooperation.

121
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,060
Young man, your qualifications are exceptional.

122
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,060
I'll definitely keep working
with you if you do well.

123
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,940
I truly believe you're cut out for this industry.

124
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,640
Two thousand is a lot.
The market isn't so great in our town.

125
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,200
Stop hesitating. Capitalize on your youth.

126
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,740
This lady may not fancy you once you're older.

127
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,340
Well said, girl. Do you know each other?

128
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,040
We're friends.

129
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,740
You're right. We shouldn't charge per session
for long-term partnerships.

130
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,820
Regular clients deserve special treatment, right?

131
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,660
Seize this opportunity, young man.
You're really insightful, young lady.

132
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,420
I'm telling your grandma.

133
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,340
- What are you thinking? 
 - This is how youngsters go astray.

134
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,780
First holding hands, then what? You're still young. Do the right thing.

135
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,560
Not every penny is worth earning.

136
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,960
If you want to badmouth me, please do it behind my back, okay?

137
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,940
What do you think I want from him?

138
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,992
I'm a legitimate businesswoman. Do you think I want him as a boyfriend?

139
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:18,980
I've got plenty of boyfriends, okay?

140
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,760
Look. The modeling agency contract.

141
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,780
Sign it if everything looks good. 
    

142
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,300
I've got a spa appointment waiting.

143
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,180
Sister Li, can I take this contract home?

144
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,940
I'll review it and get back to you.

145
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,980
No problem. Looking forward to working with you.

146
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,420
How come there's a scar here? I didn't notice it earlier.

147
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,784
Sorry, but the primary requirement

148
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:59,540
for hand models is to have perfect skin without any scars.

149
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,060
Why don't you take care of it first?

150
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,560
Get back to me if you're still interested, okay?

151
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,010
Sorry for the trouble.

152
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,400
I have to go. Bye.

153
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,960
What are you doing here?

154
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,160
Why did you kidnap my grandma?

155
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,300
Don't talk nonsense.

156
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,540
I ran into Granny at the hospital. She asked me to take her out.

157
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
- Looks nice. 
 - You like?

158
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,780
Too bitter and overpriced.

159
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,160
Ba Dou, w-w-why are you here?

160
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,880
You're getting bolder, sneaking out on your own.

161
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,120
Come here.

162
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,920
What's wrong?

163
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,200
This girl's prettier and sweeter than Xiao Jiang.

164
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,060
Enough. I'll take you back.

165
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,440
I tried hard to come out. Let me take some photos for social media.

166
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,760
Fine, stay if you want. I'm leaving.

167
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,580
Silly girl, what are you waiting for?

168
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,540
Go after him. The caregiver will come and get me.

169
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,300
All right, Granny, see you around.

170
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,480
Okay. Don't worry.

171
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,440
Li Jin Yu.

172
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,680
If you want this modeling job, I can help you.

173
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,420
That's "nice" of you.

174
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,780
You lost your bar job because of me. I owe you.

175
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,060
- Let's go. 
 - Where are we going?

176
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,300
You'll find out.

177
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,560
 Actually, he had a tough childhood. 

178
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,880
 His mom drove him overseas when he was little. 

179
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,260
 You think she did it for him? She just didn't want him. 

180
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,940
 It was like exile. He became a left-behind child, you know? 

181
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,660
 Only his dad cared for him. 

182
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:04,080
 So, when his dad died, he almost gave up living. 

183
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,780
 His mom wished him dead. 

184
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,560
 If I hadn't rushed to Jiangbei, Ba Dou wouldn't be alive. 

185
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,120
 What a poor kid. 

186
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,120
Why did you bring me here?

187
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,620
You'll find out. Come on.

188
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,880
Lioness.

189
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,640
Come on up.

190
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,300
Which floor?

191
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,200
Second floor.

192
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,060
You've been back for so long and finally remembered me?

193
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,420
I thought I misheard when I got your call.

194
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,100
- I came right after arriving. 
 - The equipment's ready.

195
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,020
I'm going out for a job. Make yourself at home.

196
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,820
Let's go.

197
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,240
Take a seat.

198
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,660
Take off your watch.

199
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,900
Why are you staring at me? Let me see.

200
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,800
Your heartbeat's slower than average.

201
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,800
Dr. Ye, are you done checking my pulse?

202
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm a bit nervous. Tell me the truth. Do you actually know how to do it?

203
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,200
Of course, I do. I used to work here.

204
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,500
If I hadn't gone to Jiangbei for college,

205
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,880
I would have opened a studio back in town.

206
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,300
You were quite idle.

207
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,420
No, I failed the college entrance exam and had to retake it.

208
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,200
So, I worked here in the summer. Keep this on for a bit.

209
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,860
Are you nervous?

210
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,460
No.

211
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,240
Let me remove it.

212
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,440
Should we begin?

213
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
It might hurt a bit.

214
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,460
Does it hurt?

215
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
Go on.

216
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,780
How did you get this scar?

217
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,760
Because of my mom.

218
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,000
Should we continue?

219
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,380
You loved her deeply?

220
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
But she hated me.

221
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,580
My mom loved me very much.

222
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,380
 Madam, I really don't know what to do about your daughter. 

223
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,900
 She's the only one who couldn't solve the problem we just covered. 

224
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,620
 She's taking the college entrance exam for the second time. 

225
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,880
 She won't even get into vocational college like this. 

226
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,940
 What's wrong? Can't handle a little criticism? That's all you can take? 

227
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,600
 Mom, my grades— 

228
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,352
 Enough. Stop pulling a long face. 

229
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:37,760
 Have a candy to cheer up. 

230
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,200
Is this really the time to show off?

231
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,580
But she committed suicide.

232
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,160
Wyatt?

233
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,680
That's the English name I gave my mom.

234
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,180
Have you seen that movie called “Proof of Life”?

235
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,780
There's a character named Wyatt, who was mysterious and powerful.

236
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,060
 I insisted my mom use that English name. 

237
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,960
 And I asked Lioness to make me a necklace. My mom wore it all the time. 

238
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,800
 I wish I could live with as much vitality as she did. 

239
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Done.

240
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:00,260
See? It might hurt, but scars can be removed.

241
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
It's up to you.

242
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,580
Should we settle the payment?

243
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,820
Let me add you on WeChat to pay you.

244
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,920
Forget it.

245
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,200
- Sorry. 
 - Are you trying to ruin my wrist?

246
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,600
You asked for my contact, didn't you?

247
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,580
Fine. Here.

248
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,460
Too bad. You already said no.

249
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,740
Li Jin Yu, are you messing with me?

250
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,360
I sat there the whole afternoon. My shoulders are killing me.

251
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,580
- Let me treat you to a massage. 
 - Hurry up.

252
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,420
Hurry up.

253
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,220
Beg me.

254
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,660
You want me to act like those girls? Okay.

255
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,020
Brother Jin Yu, you're so handsome. Let me add you on WeChat.

256
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,620
Sure. I'll scan your QR code.

257
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,940
You're so lame.

258
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,860
Done.

259
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,540
- What are you doing? 
 - You've added so many girls on WeChat.

260
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,440
I deserve a top spot. Be grateful that I didn't delete them.

261
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,220
I didn't expect you—

262
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,020
Come with me.

263
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,720
- Where are we going? 
 - Why the questions?

264
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,760
What's the rush?

265
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,520
- I like walking fast. 
 - Fine. Walk even faster.

266
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,200
- Hurry up. 
 - Li Jin Yu.

267
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,820
Go ahead. I have to go.

268
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,960
Are you busy?

269
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,180
No. Just kidding.

270
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,340
- Watch the steps. 
 - Okay.

271
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
- Come on. 
 - Thanks.

272
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,820
Jia Yu is getting tutored nearby. I'll wait here for him.

273
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,980
You've taken me around all day. Get back to work.

274
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,220
Sister-in-law, what would you like?

275
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,200
Not her. Call her "Madam."

276
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,480
 - Madam.  
 - Deep bow.

277
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,280
 - Madam.  
 - "Madam"? Do I look that old?

278
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,400
Make them leave.

279
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Listen to Sister Ya En. Make me some tea.

280
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,420
It's exactly the same as when we were in school.

281
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,800
It has changed.

282
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,960
Really? I haven't changed at all.

283
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:35,280
We haven't met much these years, but I still see you as my elder sister.

284
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,560
You've built such a huge business.

285
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,340
Why do you still talk like a kid?

286
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:53,100
I still see you as my little brother, too. So does Ye Meng.

287
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,220
So, Kai Kai, stop being so hostile with Ye Meng.

288
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,352
Remember this? "No one will bully Kai Kai..."

289
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:15,268
 "From now on." 

290
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,620
 Fang Ya En. 

291
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,460
 Ye Meng. 

292
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:33,530
   

293
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,880
You're both so heartless.

294
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,900
You left one after another, abandoning me.

295
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,160
Sister Ya En, can I ask you a question?

296
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,560
What is it?

297
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,920
What's going on between Ye Meng and Li Jin Yu?

298
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,100
Here's your key, Miss Ye. Contact me anytime if needed.

299
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,000
What's wrong? Can't you drive?

300
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,180
I can drive. It's just I haven't drove  for a long time.

301
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,580
Let me recall it. What's the first step again?

302
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,960
Fasten the seatbelt.

303
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,200
That I know. I'm talking about the first step to start the engine.

304
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,140
The first step to start the engine? Do you even have a license?

305
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,280
I've been driving for 10 years. I told you I need to get used to it again.

306
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,480
Quit nagging.

307
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,720
Press the clutch.

308
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,120
Which one's the clutch? The middle pedal or...

309
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,780
The left one.

310
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,820
I was testing you. You look so serious.

311
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,620
Ignite the engine.

312
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,240
Keep quiet while I'm driving.

313
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,020
Don't distract me, okay? I need to focus.

314
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,420
Okay.

315
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,600
What's that for?

316
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,400
The windshield needs some cleaning. It's for our safety. Okay?

317
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,970
How can I drive without visibility?

318
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,800
- Just drive— 
 - Stop breathing so loudly.

319
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,940
You're distracting me.

320
00:28:54,844 --> 00:28:56,644
   

321
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,660
Now you're both panting and coughing. Didn't I tell you to be quiet?

322
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,780
Fine.

323
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,340
Let's see how many naps I can take before we get home.

324
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,620
What "naps"? You think you can sleep while I'm driving?

325
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,140
Drive.

326
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,480
Hurry. Remind me how to do this.

327
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,960
You didn't release the handbrake. I thought I was not allowed to talk.

328
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,500
All right, I'm sorry.

329
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,760
Maybe you should drive.

330
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,260
- I can't. 
 - You sound like an expert.

331
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,460
Let's go. Put it in gear.

332
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,800
Okay.

333
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,040
 How do I open the convertible roof? 

334
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,840
No idea.

335
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,140
It looks amazing.

336
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,040
Give me your phone. I'll take a photo for you.

337
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,540
I don't like taking photos.

338
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,760
Why not?

339
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,960
I find it pointless.

340
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,760
Sunsets here are truly stunning, way better than in Jiangbei.

341
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,380
Chen Jian said you couldn't make it in Jiangbei.

342
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,920
Kind of. And why didn't you stay in Jiangbei?

343
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,140
Who told you I came back from Jiangbei?

344
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,640
Your grandma told me.

345
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,000
Nobody appreciates anything I do there.

346
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,900
Even if I did everything perfectly, it still felt meaningless.

347
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,820
It's their problem if they don't appreciate you. Don't be so hard on yourself.

348
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,080
Isn't the sunset beautiful and healing?

349
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,040
Too bad it's so fleeting.

350
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,100
Then, live in the moment. Seeing it is already a gain.

351
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,120
Li Jin Yu, must you always ruin romantic moments?

352
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,680
Your tactic only works on Cheng Kai Ran.

353
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,140
You seem particularly concerned about him.

354
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:44,340
Listen, he only sees me as an older sister. He's not into me.

355
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,140
Rest assured.

356
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,280
I've been into Ye Meng for over a decade. Do you know?

357
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,480
You know how I've lived through these years?

358
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:12,080
- Keep it down. 
 - I almost confessed my feelings to her.

359
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,520
I don't want to be her ordinary friend. Why can't I open this?

360
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,940
Listen.

361
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,140
Cheng Kai Ran, you should drink less.

362
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,660
You've repeated this dozens of times. I'm getting nauseous hearing it.

363
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,920
- I'm not looking for her for revenge. 
 - Revenge?

364
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,140
I just want to see her.

365
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,280
It's been years since we graduated from high school.

366
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,040
You really need to stop this. Wipe your mouth.

367
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,540
All right.

368
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,380
I can't help it. I deserve this.

369
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,640
I owe her in the first place, right?

370
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,420
I wouldn't be here without her.

371
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,020
All I want is to see her.

372
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,700
But... But I don't dare confess.

373
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:15,100
I'm scared she would distance herself.

374
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,180
Cheng Kai Ran, Ye Meng sees you as her younger brother.

375
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:26,080
What about Li Jin Yu? What does she feel about him?

376
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,620
That's all I want to know.

377
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,060
What does that have to do with you?

378
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,520
Come on, just tell me. Does she like him?

379
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,180
Where do I fall short compared to Li Jin Yu except for this scar here?

380
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,280
- How is he better? 
 - Sure, you're handsome.

381
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,240
- I'm handsome. 
 - You're amazing.

382
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,180
Then, why? Why...

383
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,940
Look at you. Who would believe that you're a big shot?

384
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,320
You're just acting like a lovestruck fool.

385
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,660
Why would Ye Meng fall for you?

386
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,480
I can't bear watching you like this all day.

387
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,220
Mom.

388
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,280
Son.

389
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,180
This is my son. This is Uncle Cheng Kai Ran. Say hello.

390
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,940
Hello, Uncle.

391
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,880
- Jia Yu. 
 - That's right. Where are you going?

392
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,480
Jia Yu, send me your school address.

393
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,620
- I'll have someone scout it tomorrow. 
 - What do you want?

394
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,360
If anyone bullies you, I will—

395
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,180
Stop. Isn't the big-brother act quite outdated?

396
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,800
He's got quite a sharp tongue.

397
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,280
- That's my son. 
 - He takes after you.

398
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,500
- Mom, let's go. It's a waste of time to talk to drunkards. 
 - Exactly, let's go.

399
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,700
- You...  
 - See you.

400
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,260
- Sister Ya En? 
 - What?

401
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,620
You're my big sister forever. Get on my back.

402
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,740
- What do you mean? 
 - I will carry you home.

403
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:59,140
Cheng Kai Ran, come on. Get up.

404
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,880
- I'll carry you. 
 - Stand up.

405
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,240
Getting carried away with a few drinks, huh?

406
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,880
Don't make a scene in front of my son.

407
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,060
Jia Yu, say goodbye to Uncle.

408
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,960
Goodbye, Uncle.

409
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,900
Let's go.

410
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,940
Mom, be careful.

411
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,980
Also, don't forget to hire Li Jin Yu back.

412
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,040
Stop being so petty and annoying.

413
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,580
- Let's go. 
 - Well...

414
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,820
Stop talking.

415
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,600
Careful. Hold my hand.

416
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,140
Why are the headlights still on?

417
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,160
You know cars well, though you can't drive.

418
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,380
Let's go.

419
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,100
Brother Kai's here.

420
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,840
Why did you two come back together?

421
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,940
Have fun with your friend. I'm off.

422
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,720
No more nonsense.

423
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,020
Do you want to see him beat me up or see us fight each other?

424
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,020
Well... When did you two hook up?

425
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,840
Back at your bar.

426
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,780
Ye Meng, there are plenty of decent men in our town.

427
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,640
Why choose some penniless, powerless pretty boy?

428
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,400
I can't help it. He appeals to me. I'll choose him over you any day.

429
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,740
I thought you'd keep playing dumb.

430
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,500
But today, right now…

431
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:57,560
you're going to stop pretending because of this guy, huh?

432
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,640
That's right. He keeps pushing me away to avoid offending you.

433
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,660
Anything else? Will you stop bothering me?

434
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,100
All right!

435
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,940
Fantastic.

436
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,860
He's gone. Are you done using me as an excuse?

437
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,160
That's not entirely the case.

438
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,460
If you take a beating for me, I'll fall for you.

439
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:11,160
   

440
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,664
   

441
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:17,552
   

442
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:47,940
   

443
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:06,012
 See? It might hurt, but scars can be removed. 

444
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:09,280
 It's up to you. 

445
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:41,340
♫  Round and round we go  ♫

446
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,652
♫  Wandering and observing  ♫

447
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:49,094
♫  Still waiting where I stand  ♫

448
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:54,392

♫  Used to shining alone  ♫

452
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,100
 Spacing out on the balcony again? We need an all-round technician. 

453
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,160
 Mr. Li, will you come to work tomorrow? 

454
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,716
♫  He quietly listens to her stories  ♫

455
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:23,040
♫  Of joys and sorrows through the years  ♫

456
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
 My hourly rate is steep. 

457
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,480
 Name your price. I'm loaded. 

458
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,620
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

459
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:10,460
Any talents besides singing?

460
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,520
I can play guitar.

461
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,420
What about drums?

462
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,040
No.

463
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,720
So handsome. Is he the resident singer here?

464
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,460
He can totally debut as a celebrity. Handsome, can I get your WeChat?

465
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,000
- No, I'm sorry. 
 - I'll buy you drinks.

466
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,440
- No, thanks. 
 - Fine.

467
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
Ladies, feel free to follow us—

468
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,240
No, thanks.

469
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,600
Smile.

470
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,280
All right.

471
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,400
You can start working tomorrow.

472
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,800
But here's your KPI. Add 10 customers on WeChat every day.

473
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,580
Post the ads on Moments. You have monthly sales targets to hit, okay?

474
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,180
All right.

475
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,340
Well...

476
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,680
He's almost more handsome than me.

477
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:25,030

00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:44,535
♫  The moment I see you  ♫

481
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:47,850
♫  The moment I think of you  ♫

482
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:54,351
♫  The moment I hear any news of you  ♫

483
00:44:54,351 --> 00:45:00,271
♫  My heart is touched  ♫

484
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:04,331
♫  My mind is occupied  ♫

485
00:45:04,331 --> 00:45:06,795
♫  Go  ♫

486
00:45:06,795 --> 00:45:09,011
♫  Where to go?  ♫

487
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:12,939
♫  How to escape?  ♫

488
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:19,023
♫  Those memories of you  ♫

489
00:45:19,023 --> 00:45:22,991
♫  They have drowned me  ♫

490
00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:28,507
♫  I can't let go  ♫

491
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:33,327
♫  I remain silent  ♫

492
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:36,711
♫  My words stuck in my throat  ♫

493
00:45:36,711 --> 00:45:42,891
♫  Maybe this will end the sorrow  ♫

494
00:45:42,891 --> 00:45:47,152
♫  Pretending to be determined  ♫

495
00:45:47,152 --> 00:45:52,960
♫  I'm still trapped at the starting point  ♫

496
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:57,936
♫  The most perfect lie  ♫

497
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:00,992
♫  I even deceived myself  ♫

498
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:07,659
♫  If love means letting go, let's sever all connections  ♫

499
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:10,303
♫  But why...  ♫

500
00:46:10,303 --> 00:46:13,423
♫  The moment tears fall  ♫

501
00:46:13,423 --> 00:46:18,070
♫  I don't want you to leave  ♫
