2
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,400
Please, don't blame him too harshly.

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
Years ago,

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,360
Jinyu was diagnosed with a serious

5
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,680
psychological disorder.

6
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,519
His psychiatrist is here today,

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,880
and a detailed statement

8
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,240
on his condition will be released after.

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,840
‪LI LINGBAI, LIN YANGYANG

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,240
But no matter the reason,

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,360
public or private,

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,560
the fault is mine.

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,720
LIN YANGYANG

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,400
Out of responsibility to everyone,

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
Li Jinyu

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,480
will step down from Hailan Port.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,720
I will take the blame

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,280
for this accident.

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,360
From now on, the Hanhai Group

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,960
will permanently hand over

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,800
the Hailan Port project

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,400
to the Lin Group

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,360
with full control.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm Lin Yangyang,
representing the Lin Group.

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,240
Phase Two

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,240
will be completely demolished and rebuilt

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,200
from the ground up.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
We welcome the villagers
to supervise the process.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,880
Therefore, I officially announce…

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,760
What's going on?

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,680
- What happened?
- What is this?

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Is it a joke?

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,080
- What's going on?
- Look!

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,920
- It's a video!
- Look at the screen!

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Record it.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,280
What are you doing here?

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,479
Shut up.

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Is it ready yet?

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,360
Quiet. It's done.

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,840
Took you long enough.

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
Quit whining.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,120
- Who is that?
- Hello, everyone.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm Ye Meng, PR manager of Hailan Port.

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
As you've just seen,

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
this was the Phase Two site
just a week ago.

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,440
As you can see,

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,240
all the material used on site

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,360
adhered to the code.

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,000
Ms. Lin,

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,360
you can confirm that, can't you?

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
But after the accident,

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,880
suddenly, all the materials

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
failed the inspection.

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,760
And wouldn't you know about it,

55
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,520
but the surveillance footage

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,360
from that incident was swapped.

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,720
Mrs. Li,

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,320
do you really believe that Li Jinyu,

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,040
as project lead,

60
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,280
would sabotage himself?

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,520
Of course, I'd like to believe

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,240
he had nothing to do with this.

63
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,120
But you're just an outside PR hire.

64
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,360
What gives you the right

65
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,880
to speak for him?

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,680
And now you're disrupting order.

67
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,240
Security, escort her out.

68
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,200
What are you trying to do?

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,160
Who says I don't have the right?

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,320
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

71
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,840
I am Li Jinyu's lawful wife.

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Does that give me the right?

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,880
Mrs. Li, if you want him
out of the company so badly,

74
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,720
why not say it to his face?

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,160
Because the person he cares about

76
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,280
most is you, his mother.

77
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,480
He's married?

78
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,600
Why did you hide this from me?

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,720
So what if there's a video?

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Maybe Li Jinyu

81
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,440
staged it himself.

82
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
Li Jinyu is unstable.

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,760
- A man like that is capable of anything.
- That's right.

84
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,760
And besides, did the video actually

85
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,720
record anyone swapping materials?

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,000
- That's right. It didn't.
- They got nothing.

87
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,760
- Did you get anything?
- Right!

88
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,880
- Nothing on tape.
- I caught it.

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
I recorded it.

90
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,200
That day, I stopped by the warehouse

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,320
and saw someone sneaking around.
So, I filmed it.

92
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
Move it forward a bit.

93
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,840
Watch your step.

94
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,320
Push that pile over there.

95
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,800
HARD HAT REQUIRED
SAFETY FIRST, NO SMOKING

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
Two more loads and we're finished.

97
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,680
- I'll get back to work.
- Go on, go.

98
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,560
The one who sabotaged them

99
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
was you!

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,960
No, it wasn't me!

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,000
- He's running. Stop him!
- That's not me in the video!

102
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,120
Don't move.
Where do you think you're going?

103
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
Don't move!

104
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Stay where you are.

105
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
Mrs. Li,

106
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
who's really crying thief to cover theft?

107
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,840
It seems this was indeed a mistake.

108
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,120
I'll hand him over to the police
for investigation.

109
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,640
But considering the risks

110
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,360
and Jinyu's current state,

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,560
he is not suitable to manage Hailan Port

112
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,800
anymore.

113
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
Hello, everyone.

114
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm Dr. Yang Bingzhang,
Li Jinyu's psychiatrist.

115
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,200
As his doctor,

116
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,320
I stand by my reputation and diagnosis

117
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,960
to confirm with certainty

118
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,480
that Mr. Li Jinyu's mental health

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,520
is stable.

120
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
He's capable to do his work.

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,120
Dr. Yang,

122
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,480
- you--
- Mrs. Li,

123
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,480
this is the verified result.

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
If you doubt it,

125
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,960
bring in another specialist
for a second opinion.

126
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,920
You heard him.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,160
Li Jinyu has no mental illness.

128
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
This project was his from the start.

129
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,800
The best solution

130
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,280
is to let him return

131
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,600
and answer the public.

132
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,440
Unless, Mrs. Li,

133
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,440
you'd rather stand here

134
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,560
and insist in front of everyone

135
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,000
that your son is mentally ill.

136
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,000
How could I wish for my son to be sick?

137
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,800
What mother doesn't love her child?

138
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,040
Watch your words.

139
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
Bullshit!

140
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,880
Li Lingbai, shut your mouth!

141
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,040
I came here to call you out!

142
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,000
- Hands off!
- Granny.

143
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,720
- Granny, why are you here?
- Hands off!

144
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,440
You call yourself a mother?

145
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Having you as his mother

146
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
is Li Jinyu's misfortune!

147
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,200
Stop making a scene.

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,120
If you dare lie,

149
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
why shouldn't I speak? Listen to me.

150
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,920
This heartless woman

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,800
abandoned her own son
before he even turned seven.

152
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,320
She threw him out.

153
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,960
It was a stormy night,
pouring rain, thunder crashing.

154
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,000
You wanted him to freeze to death.

155
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,920
Where was your motherly love then?

156
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,600
Answer me!

157
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,520
I'm so pissed off.

158
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,440
The truth is…

159
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,800
Li Jinyu never had any mental issues.

160
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,640
It was this cruel woman

161
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,640
who forced him to see a psychiatrist

162
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,560
again and again.

163
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,280
She locked my sweet grandson

164
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,200
up in dark rooms.

165
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
She brought in people

166
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,440
to brainwash him,

167
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,640
telling everyone he was sick.

168
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,520
You're the one who's sick!

169
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,560
I warned you.

170
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,560
If you hurt my grandson again,

171
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,960
I…

172
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,200
I'll come after you even from the grave.

173
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,480
Remember that.

174
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,400
Don't walk away.

175
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,880
I'm not finished!

176
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,160
Granny.

177
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,280
Calm down. Don't get worked up.

178
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,120
- Shameless woman!
- Careful.

179
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,360
That's enough.

180
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,040
That's her own son.

181
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
Control the narrative about today.

182
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,480
Don't let anything negative spread out.

183
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,679
Yes, Mrs. Li.

184
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,520
Sorry, Mrs. Li.

185
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,960
The Lin Group

186
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,600
won't clean up your mess.

187
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,160
You thought you could use me as a pawn?

188
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,880
You're not even qualified.

189
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,840
Honey.

190
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,800
Baby.

191
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,520
I've been worried sick these past days.

192
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,880
How are you feeling?

193
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
You've lost weight, haven't you?

194
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,760
Do you feel bad at all?

195
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,320
Hey, I'm asking you. Do you feel unwell?

196
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,640
No, I feel fine.

197
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm just thinking

198
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,000
how lucky I am to have married
such an incredible wife.

199
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,640
Hey.

200
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
Look at me. I'm standing here just fine.

201
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,200
No need to worry.

202
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
Let's go home.

203
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,080
Come on.

204
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,120
<i>…all the material used on site</i>

205
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,000
<i>adhered to the code.</i>

206
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,280
<i>Ms. Lin, you can confirm that, can't you?</i>

207
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,640
What are you watching?

208
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,840
Look at these comments.

209
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,240
"Cool lady went head-to-head
with Hanhai Group's CEO."

210
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,560
"Slim, stunning, real-life boss Barbie."

211
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,000
- "She is really…"
- Stop. Don't read that out loud.

212
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,760
Wait, are you blushing?

213
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,920
So what if I am?

214
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,840
Didn't think you knew how.

215
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,560
I might've looked fierce up there,

216
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,480
but I was scared out of my mind.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,400
When the police took you away,
I thought I'd lose you.

218
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
I wasn't scared at all.

219
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,000
Because I knew

220
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,240
my wife is the strongest in the world.

221
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,400
She'd be like a lifesaver,

222
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,880
swooping in on rainbow clouds to save me.

223
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
What is this, a drama now?

224
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,560
Alright, alright.

225
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm sorry

226
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,560
for making you worried.

227
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
Go to sleep.

228
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,280
Li Jinyu.

229
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,480
From now on, I'll protect you.

230
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Okay.

231
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,880
Mom, I'm heading out.

232
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,920
Where to?

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
School performance.

234
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,680
Kai's picking me up.

235
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,880
He's coming?

236
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,840
Call him. Tell him not to.

237
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,800
I'll drive you.

238
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,440
Don't bother him all the time,

239
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,560
okay?

240
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,720
Ya'en.

241
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
I'm here for Jiayu.

242
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
Let's go, Kai.

243
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,080
Kai,

244
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
no need. The shop's quiet today.

245
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,920
I can take him.

246
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,880
I already promised.

247
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,880
Don't overthink it.

248
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,120
I'm not.

249
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
I just happen to be free.

250
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,920
I'll do it.

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
You're busy.

252
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
- Ya'en…
- We already…

253
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,840
I brought my friend to shop here.

254
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,760
Welcome. Come in.

255
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
See? You're tied up.

256
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,920
You can't go anywhere.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
I'll take him. I promised.

258
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,160
Alright, thanks.

259
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,720
- Let's go.
- Jiayu,

260
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,080
want me to call your dad

261
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,520
so he can see you perform?

262
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
Mom, don't worry about it.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
We'll be late. Come on.

264
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,240
- Let's go.
- Bye.

265
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,800
- Goodbye, miss.
- Bye.

266
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,560
Did you hear?

267
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,840
Jiayu's parents are divorced.

268
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,760
Really?

269
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,480
That's so sad.

270
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,240
What's sad about it?

271
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,760
Sure, they're not together anymore.

272
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,440
Buy my mom's still my mom.

273
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,400
Dad's still my dad.

274
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,880
They love me just the same.

275
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,640
Exactly.

276
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,880
So what if they divorced?

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,640
He's got his mom, his dad, and me.

278
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,120
Who are you?

279
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
He's Kai, my bro.

280
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,800
This is Yu, my bro.

281
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,480
Knock it off.

282
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Go away.

283
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,920
So, what play

284
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
are you guys putting on?

285
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,960
<i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>
<i>versus the Big Bad Wolf</i>.

286
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,640
Wait, what?

287
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,920
Since when does Red Riding Hood

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,840
have enough power to fight Big Bad Wolf?

289
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,240
Not just her.

290
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
It's six against one.

291
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,160
Six against one?

292
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,040
Who's the poor kid

293
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
stuck playing Big Bad Wolf?

294
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,240
Jiayu, we're waiting on you.

295
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,680
Go try the Big Bad Wolf costume.

296
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,160
We're starting rehearsal.

297
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,200
You're playing the wolf?

298
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,520
Come on. Places.

299
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,800
Find your spots. Go.

300
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,720
Stand in your spots.

301
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
Jiayu, knock and say your line.

302
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,280
Little Red Riding Hood, are you home?
It's Grandma.

303
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
Louder, Jiayu.

304
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,720
The audience won't hear you.

305
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,960
Little Red Riding Hood, are you home?

306
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,840
- It's Grandma.
- Come on.

307
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,320
Hit him! Get him!

308
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,440
Hit him! Get him!

309
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,880
Stop, stop. That's not right.

310
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,480
- Come here.
- Jiayu, come here.

311
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,640
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

312
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,080
They went for your head.

313
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm fine.

314
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
So, that's why you had me bring you.

315
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,920
You knew you'd be playing Big Bad Wolf.

316
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,600
I didn't want my mom to see me
playing the one who gets beaten up.

317
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,760
But when it's the real show,

318
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,000
she'll find out anyway.

319
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,640
Jiayu, let's try again.

320
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,120
Everyone, back in position.

321
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,720
- Hello. Excuse me.
- Hello.

322
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,400
I have a question.
This play's about teaching kids

323
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,400
how not to fall for scams, right?

324
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,640
That's right.

325
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,320
Then, this Big Bad Wolf role
doesn't suit Jiayu at all.

326
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,720
Honestly, it doesn't suit any of them.

327
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,000
It just makes the kids turn on each other.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,200
What are you suggesting?

329
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,680
I mean…

330
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,320
I've got an idea.

331
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
An idea?

332
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,080
Next, please welcome Grade Two Class Three

333
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,920
with their play,

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,200
<i>Seven Little Red Riding Hoods</i>
<i>versus the Big Bad Wolf</i>.

335
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,560
Once upon a time,

336
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,080
in a little village,

337
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,040
there lived a group
of Little Red Riding Hoods.

338
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,440
They lived in peace and joy,

339
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,560
until one day,

340
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,880
an uninvited guest arrived.

341
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,119
I hear

342
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,480
this family just had

343
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,119
seven Little Red Riding Hoods.

344
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,599
That's enough food for a year.

345
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,960
Little Red Riding Hoods,

346
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,240
are you home?

347
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,360
- It's Grandma. I just called.
- Who are you?

348
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,920
Open the door. Let's see who it really is.

349
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,160
Grandma, why are your ears so big?

350
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,080
Yeah.

351
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,760
And why is your voice so rough and deep?

352
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,720
You're that dumb wolf,

353
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,320
pretending to be Grandma!

354
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,480
No, no, I'm really

355
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,280
your kind, sweet,

356
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,240
beautiful grandma.

357
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,720
Jiayu's mom,

358
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,960
Jiayu's cousin is great.

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,160
He's not his cousin. He's my…

360
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
friend.

361
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,360
I can tell Jiayu's close to him too.

362
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,680
He's really good with him.

363
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,960
Jiayu didn't want to play
the beaten-up wolf,

364
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,440
so he volunteered instead.

365
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Not many families would do that for a kid.

366
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,680
- Kids.
- I'm opening the door. Step back.

367
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,480
Okay.

368
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm coming in!

369
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,160
10TH ANNUAL NINGSUI EXPERIMENTAL
PRIMARY SCHOOL ARTS FESTIVAL

370
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,440
What? Nobody's here?

371
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,800
Get him!

372
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,560
Wait, stop!

373
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,640
Now,

374
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,240
even Little Red Riding Hood
knows how to use anti-fraud apps!

375
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,920
Smarter than monkeys, I swear!

376
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,120
Kids, listen up.

377
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,720
Be like Little Red Riding Hood.

378
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,440
Don't trust strangers.

379
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,720
The internet is full of traps.

380
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,680
Stay alert!

381
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,680
Mom, do you like my Little Red…

382
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,640
- Jiayu.
- Mom!

383
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,640
- You were amazing. This is for you.
- Thanks, Mom.

384
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,920
Come here. Let me hug you.
My son was brilliant up there.

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,200
You know why the Big Bad Wolf gave in?

386
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,120
It was because of you.

387
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,640
You organized everyone

388
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
and led them to victory.

389
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
Please. If it weren't for Kai,

390
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,200
I'd be the one getting hit.

391
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,920
Kai!

392
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,040
You made it.

393
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,440
This was a last-minute change.

394
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,680
Didn't have time to tell you.

395
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,760
You two were so good.

396
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,160
The way you worked together was perfect.

397
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,560
Jiayu, Mom can act too.

398
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,240
Next time there's a play,

399
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,400
save me a role.

400
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,400
Forget it. I'm not playing
the punching bag again.

401
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,760
I want a part like Little Red Riding Hood.

402
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,760
Strong and clever.

403
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,200
- You are strong.
- Kai, teach me how to box.

404
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,880
That way, I can protect my mom.

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Solving things with fists
only works for a moment.

406
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,320
Arming yourself with knowledge
lasts a lifetime.

407
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,440
Kai,

408
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,720
you've changed.

409
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,040
Everything I know, I learned from you.

410
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,960
I didn't mean it like that…

411
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,280
Alright, enough teasing.

412
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,400
I'll start teaching you tomorrow.

413
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
But I'll warn you now,

414
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,360
boxing is tough.

415
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,720
Better be ready.

416
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,480
I won't go easy on you, even if you cry.

417
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,880
Fine, bring it on.

418
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,840
I'm not scared.

419
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,600
One uppercut and you're down.

420
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,520
Kai, drive me home?

421
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,080
I can't. I've got things to do.

422
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,000
See you later.

423
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,200
Oh,

424
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,520
almost forgot to tell you two.

425
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,000
My bar, Gem…

426
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,920
I'm turning it into a restaurant.

427
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,360
Li Jinyu and Ye Meng already know.

428
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,720
We're opening in a few days.
You should come.

429
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,880
Why would you change
a perfectly good bar into a restaurant?

430
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,480
Jiayu's still a kid.

431
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,920
He can't go to bars.

432
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,240
And Yu's my bro.

433
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,520
Of course.
I'll be your number one supporter.

434
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,760
- Good. I'm off.
- Bye.

435
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,440
- Bye.
- Bye, Kai.

436
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,440
Bye.

437
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,080
Don't you think Kai looked a little down?

438
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,840
Jiayu,

439
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,840
do you like Kai?

440
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,200
He really likes me.

441
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,600
So, of course, I should like him back.

442
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,560
You little rascal.

443
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,440
You sure know a lot for your age.

444
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,400
Grown-ups always
make things so complicated.

445
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,040
We kids keep it simple.

446
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,240
Alright, enough of that.

447
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,960
Let's go home. Give it to me.

448
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,880
Okay.

449
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,680
That little scarf is kind of cute, though.

450
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,160
Lunch is ready.

451
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,640
Where are you off to?

452
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,880
Something came up at work.

453
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,080
I've got to go.

454
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,840
Sort out your own lunch.

455
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,800
- I'm heading out.
- Bye.

456
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Bye.

457
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,360
Coming.

458
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,680
Meng.

459
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,240
Yu, come in.

460
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,200
Okay.

461
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Sit down.

462
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Thanks.

463
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,400
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

464
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,800
Ye Meng, I actually came today

465
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,720
to apologize.

466
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm sorry about the attack.

467
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,520
I was blinded by hate.

468
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,960
Didn't even realize I was being used…

469
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,800
Luckily, you weren't hurt.

470
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,880
I'd already forgotten.

471
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,760
I still have that switchblade
you pulled on me.

472
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Just kidding.

473
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,840
But thank you for stepping in

474
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,000
at the press conference.

475
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,080
If anyone should be grateful,

476
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,640
it's us to you.

477
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Not at all.

478
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,200
Don't worry, Ye Meng.

479
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,080
I'll never do something like that again.

480
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm going to work hard,

481
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,320
take care of the kids
at the welfare center,

482
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,480
and be a role model for them.

483
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,400
I believe you. You've got this.

484
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,840
Right, I actually came
to bring you something.

485
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,800
At the welfare center, I found some

486
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,440
old photos of your mom when she was a kid.

487
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,120
I thought you should
have them as a keepsake.

488
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,760
Thank you. Have some tea.

489
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Thanks.

490
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,200
Meng.

491
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,400
Is this your mother?

492
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,440
The one with the short hair.

493
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,040
Why?

494
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,600
Do you know her?

495
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,800
I saw her

496
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,440
many years ago,

497
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,560
at the welfare center.

498
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,640
There was also someone there

499
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
named Li Lingbai.

500
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,840
The two of them

501
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,320
got into a huge fight.

502
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,200
Why would you do this?

503
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,840
What did I ever do to you?

504
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,960
I hate you.

505
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,600
I want you to feel the pain I felt.

506
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,240
But why?

507
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,640
What happened to you? Weren't we friends?

508
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,160
Did they say anything else?

509
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,400
I was too young.

510
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,440
That's all I remember.

511
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,320
Everything else is fuzzy.

512
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,160
Anyway, Meng,

513
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,200
I should get going.

514
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,120
Have more tea.

515
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
Thanks. I just wanted to drop this off.

516
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,920
BAI AND YI

517
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,400
NINGSUI CHILD WELFARE CENTER

518
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,080
Back then, we all called your mom Yi.

519
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
And this one here was Bai.

520
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,400
I think this photo

521
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,880
was taken the day Bai got adopted.

522
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,720
As I remember it,

523
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,960
the two of them really hit it off,

524
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,520
inseparable and always together.

525
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,400
<i>Bai got adopted first.</i>

526
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,280
<i>At the time,</i>

527
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,200
<i>the family was actually</i>
<i>planning to adopt your mom.</i>

528
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,760
But then,

529
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,960
she gave up her chance
and let Bai go instead.

530
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,440
What do you want?

531
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,880
You went through all that trouble,

532
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,760
setting up such a big game,

533
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,240
not just to steal back my shares.

534
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,760
You were also worried

535
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,360
that what you and Wang Xingsheng did
in Tianhui City would come out.

536
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,800
That's why you pushed
for the Lin Group takeover.

537
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,520
What exactly is your connection
to Ye Meng's mother?

538
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,880
Li Jinyu,

539
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,640
your taste is awful.

540
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,040
You actually fell

541
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,360
for the daughter of a fraud.

542
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,000
That woman was fake from the very start.

543
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,320
Always acting sweet,
pretending to be perfect.

544
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,000
Everyone

545
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,640
was fooled by her act.

546
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,240
She was the real fraud.
Through and through.

547
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,760
You're back.

548
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,440
You went out?

549
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,680
Just for a bit.

550
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,080
I'll pour us some water.

551
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
<i>A fraud…</i>

552
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,320
So, is she really the fraud

553
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,720
or the victim in this case?

554
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,880
After what you two pulled
at that press conference,

555
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,120
I'd say I'm the victim.

556
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,000
She knew Wang Xingsheng.

557
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,560
She walked right into his trap.
That's no coincidence.

558
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,600
It has to tie back to you.

559
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,840
Next time

560
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,560
you come see me, bring evidence.

561
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,800
Fine.

562
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,120
Hello?

563
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,280
Ms. Ye,

564
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,240
it's Fat Buddha.

565
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,200
<i>Wang Xingsheng…</i>

566
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,960
<i>Has he gone missing?</i>

567
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,480
How do you know that?

568
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,360
He left me a flash drive.

569
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,760
Told me if he didn't show this month,

570
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,080
I should reach out to you.

571
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,800
<i>I'm guessing</i>

572
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,280
<i>what's on it will interest you.</i>

573
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
<i>And I'll be well compensated.</i>

574
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,760
Where are you? I'll come now.

575
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,080
Tell us where you hid it.

576
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,960
We'd rather not kill you.

577
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,960
If you do kill me,

578
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,480
Li Lingbai

579
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,320
and the rest of you

580
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,800
will die with me.

581
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,680
Are you really asking for it?

582
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,880
Come on.

583
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,600
Come on. Kill me.

584
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,000
Kill me.

585
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,120
Kill me!

586
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,360
Again!

587
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,280
Do it.

588
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,840
Wait, wait.

589
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,880
Hold on.

590
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,400
Hold on, hold on.

591
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,960
Hold on. I…

592
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,640
Send your buddy out.

593
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,520
I… I've got something to tell you.

594
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,520
Li Lingbai…

595
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,720
Trust me.

596
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
There's a car on our tail.

597
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,960
Must be Li Lingbai's people.

598
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,719
She probably knows about the flash drive.

599
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,840
We'll split up ahead.

600
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,360
Keep watch. See where they go.

601
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,360
Got it.

602
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,800
FEI: 16TH FLOOR

603
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,840
Be careful.

604
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,640
FEI: ROOM 1688

605
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,640
ROOM 1688

606
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,920
Wang Xingsheng…

607
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,000
Has he gone missing?

608
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,760
He left me a flash drive.

609
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,480
I'm guessing

610
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,840
what's on it will interest you.

611
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,160
And I'll be well compensated.

612
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,040
Stop!

613
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,520
She went that way.

614
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Thank you.

615
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,240
<i>Locker one is now open.</i>
<i>Remove your item and close the door.</i>

616
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,200
The flash drive's
in a hotel parcel locker.

617
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,040
Once your payment clears,

618
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,000
<i>I'll give you the code.</i>

619
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
<i>Deal?</i>

620
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,040
Are you alright?

621
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,240
- Did you get hurt?
- I'm fine. Where's the drive?

622
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,840
Right here.

623
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,440
It's empty. There's nothing on it.

624
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,560
I'll call him.

625
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,200
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you dialed</i>
<i>is not available.</i>

626
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,400
Looks like we've been played.

627
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,000
Fat Buddha

628
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,520
is always holding something back.

629
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,800
We can't waste time.

630
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,280
Before Li Lingbai finds out
her drive's a fake,

631
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,080
we need to find him.

632
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,960
What's wrong?

633
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,680
Are you upset?

634
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,240
No.

635
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,480
Just tired.

636
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,840
I'm taking a shower.

637
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,480
HAILAN PORT, WHERE THE SEA MEETS HOME

638
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,800
An empty drive

639
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,480
had you running in circles.

640
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,440
You can't even handle
something that simple.

641
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,240
What use are you to me?

642
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,680
Why should I keep you?

643
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,240
A dog would be better.

644
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,320
At least it can guard the house and bite.

645
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,200
HAILAN PORT PHASE III NOW LEASING

646
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,640
