00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,778
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:15,392
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:20,677
 ♫ With a sense of excitement You vowed eternal love ♫ 

4
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:25,858
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

5
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:31,106
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

6
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:34,594
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫

00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:38,158
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

8
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:42,790
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,862
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫

00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:53,898
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

11
00:00:53,898 --> 00:01:01,078
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control As breathing turns weightless ♫

 ♫ All I possess is drowned The me who still loves you deeply ♫

00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:11,242
 ♫ Has never changed If miracles could exist ♫

 ♫ Promises would be kept Please remember ♫ 

15
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:20,350
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

16
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,980

☆ Stars in our eyes ☆ Team @ Viki.com 

18
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:56,111
 One month. I'll give you one month. 

19
00:01:56,111 --> 00:02:00,391
 If you don't return by then, I'll stop waiting. 

20
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,020
 Li Jin Yu, 

21
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,630
 can't you live without me? 

22
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,231
 Not sure. 

23
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,331
 Not sure? Is it a yes or no? 

24
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,491
 Stop it. 

25
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,491
 Wait for me to return. 

26
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,820
 

27
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:22,791
Ye Meng! Ye Meng!

28
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:27,411
You're overdoing it.
Gou Kai asked you to pick me up?

29
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:33,591
He wouldn't do that.
It's my honor to pick up a beauty like you.

30
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,371
You've matured. More confident now.

31
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:42,451
How come the weather there
makes you glow even brighter?

32
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:45,511
You've become so cheesy.

33
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:48,271
Over there.

34
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,871
I've landed. A friend's picking me up.

35
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:55,291
Are you awake? Remember to eat breakfast.

36
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,431
"Are you awake?"

37
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:01,791
- What's wrong? 
 - Reporting to your boyfriend?

38
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,771
If Gou Kai saw your infatuation,
he'd be heartbroken.

39
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:08,831
Let me correct you. It's not just infatuation.

40
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,911
It's a honeymoon. We got married.

41
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:26,091
We've eaten. Everyone enjoyed the meal.

42
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,631
You just announced it days ago.
How should I believe this?

43
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,831
How did you meet him?

44
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,151
Not telling.

45
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:45,631
Come on, introduce us.

46
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,590
 

47
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:13,751
Ping An, what's most important between spouses?

48
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:16,171
You tell me.

49
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:22,811
Right. It's trust.

50
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:43,531
Ye Meng.

51
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:45,831
- You're back. 
 - Ye Meng.

52
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,831
Boss.

53
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:52,511
- How's it going lately? 
 - Same as usual.

54
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,511
Boss, our workload doubled
after you left. We're exhausted.

55
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:01,171
Boss, are you coming back?

56
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:03,391
No, just here for some business.

57
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:06,911
Don't make it sound like Gou Kai
and I mistreat you normally.

58
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:09,471
Coffee. Take these. Meng bought them for you.

59
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:12,031
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks, boss. Love you.

60
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:15,531
Alright, I'll go handle business.
Let's talk later.

61
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,731
- Back to work, everyone. 
 - Our boss got coffee for everyone.

62
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:19,571
Thank you.

63
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,971
Ye Meng, welcome home.

64
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,571
What's wrong with you?

65
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:38,551
Sit.

66
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:41,531
Look how your complexion improved
after returning to Jiangbei.

67
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,971
The weather's nice.

68
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:44,771
Nice weather.

69
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:51,111
It was lively outside earlier. You bought coffee?

70
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,071
Good, good.

71
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:02,451
How long are you staying this time?

72
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,631
Long-term?

73
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:23,771
Here's the document you wanted. Take a look.

74
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,851
Would I lie to you?

75
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:33,315
 

76
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:50,971
When can I meet him?

77
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,671
Don't be so impatient.

78
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:59,811
If you're busy, just give me his contact.
I'll meet him myself.

79
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:03,371
I said don't rush. Have some water.

80
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:14,091
The issue is that you're not our employee.

81
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,431
We can't just hand over client information, right?

82
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,031
Is that so?

83
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:41,651
Actually, I've scheduled
a meeting tomorrow at 2 PM.

84
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:44,451
I'll go with you then, okay?

85
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:46,151
Thank you.

86
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:50,631
We three musketeers are finally reunited.

87
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,990
Come on, smile for a group photo.

88
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:59,851
Ready? Three, two, one, cheese.

89
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,091
I'll post it on social media later.

90
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:05,951
Really not coming back?

91
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,191
Isn't that Ye Meng's ex-boss?

92
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:37,771
How could you let her return
to Jiangbei for coffee meetings?

93
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:42,151
I'm not scaring you, but you've
only been married for a few days.

94
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:46,351
You're letting her return to her ex's territory?
Do you really trust her that much?

95
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,291
Yes.

96
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,411
I'm not trying to drive a wedge between you two.

97
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:57,951
You're better-looking than her ex-boss.

98
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:00,731
But look at his huge office. Clearly, he's loaded.

99
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:05,951
You can't compete financially,
and they share years of camaraderie.

100
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,431
This is dangerous.

101
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:11,731
Are you insane?

102
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,711
Don't brush this off.
I've seen this play out before.

103
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:20,371
Fang Ya En loathes her ex-husband to the core.

104
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:23,051
They agreed to divorce,
but now they're backing out.

105
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:25,371
Wake up and smell the coffee.

106
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:29,431
Our situations are different.
We're legally married.

107
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:33,231
You're legally married. Great.

108
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,671
Then why are you here
with me instead of your wife?

109
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:47,951
Let me give you a surefire way
to win Ye Meng's attention back.

110
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,571
What's it?

111
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:53,071
See those customers? We know them well.

112
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:55,951
I'll let them help you
and take some 'intimate' photos.

113
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:58,951
Use camera angles.
If Ye Meng can post it, so can we.

114
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,911
- Provoke her jealousy.
- How childish.

115
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,571
Come on, try it. It might work.

116
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,951
- No.
- Come on.

117
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,831
What if she divorces you? Try it. Just try.

118
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,951
No need.

119
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,751
Mr. Cheng.

120
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:16,151
Jiang Lu Zhi, what brings you here?

121
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:18,531
I've got a big business opportunity for you.

122
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:23,831
New businesses at Hailan Bay
need a team-building venue. I recommended you.

123
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:27,691
Thanks, Miss Jiang.
I'm always interested in making money.

124
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:31,911
But I recall you don't get along with Ye Meng.

125
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:38,531
Aren't you two romantic rivals?

126
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:42,111
Why would you think of me for this?

127
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:46,571
You claim women are love-obsessed?
Look in the mirror.

128
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:49,191
Can't you think bigger?

129
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,940
I recommended you
because this place is genuinely good.

130
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,291
I want to stay on good terms with both sides.
Why should I make things difficult because of her?

131
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,571
That's so you. Let me mix you a drink.

132
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:01,211
I drove here. No alcohol.

133
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:04,151
I'll make you an alcohol-free one. Have a seat.

134
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:06,711
Keep your eyes on the bigger picture.

135
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,951
How long will you keep pretending we're strangers?

136
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,951
We were never that close.

137
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:22,491
I thought you'd broken up long ago.

138
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:27,151
Surprised to see
her relationship announcement recently.

139
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:30,891
Rare to see her so serious about someone.

140
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:34,771
My sincere wishes for your everlasting love.

141
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:39,591
Hope your charm keeps her in Ningsui forever.

142
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:44,731
So worried she'll return to Jiangbei?

143
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,631
Aren't you?

144
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:58,831
Look at the drink menu.

145
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,891
- I need to take this call. 
 - Go ahead.

146
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:11,331
Mom, working late at the office.

147
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,971
Jiang Lu Zhi's parents are teachers,

148
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:17,271
strict disciplinarians,
just like Ye Meng's family.

149
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:20,871
They prefer local suitors for marriage,

150
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,771
so they have set you up on that blind date.

151
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,571
What did you take?

152
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,590
The photos? Let me check.

153
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:33,731
Imagine the impact
if Jiang Lu Zhi is in this photo.

154
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,911
Look how close you two are here.

155
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:38,680
Impact or disaster? Delete this.

156
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:43,471
Already posted. I told you not to touch me. Look at this mess.

157
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:47,091
This... this huge.

158
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:51,980
Ye Meng will be back soon. Don't mention it.

159
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,830
Nice.

160
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:03,671
Your expressions are hilarious.

161
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:07,671
Check the likes. Everyone wants you back.

162
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:16,531
It's not just me. Tai Ming Xiao
keeps complaining about difficult clients.

163
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:21,391
The PR department's struggling without you,
especially with lots of new projects.

164
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,951
Didn't you want to buy property in Jiangbei?

165
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:29,451
This could be your golden opportunity.
Think about it.

166
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,331
Thrilled about the company's growth.

167
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:36,331
But I'm settled there.
Used to the hometown pace now.

168
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,931
- I'll take my leave then. 
 - Wait.

169
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:42,731
After helping you,
dinner's the least you could offer.

170
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:47,011
Not in the mood. Maybe another time.

171
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,191
Is it Wang Xing Sheng? Or your boyfriend?

172
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:56,211
Just inform him. He can't be that petty.

173
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:59,071
Come on, he's a grown man.

174
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,231
I'm avoiding his jealousy.

175
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:05,451
But he's not my boyfriend. He's my husband.

176
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:09,671
We're legally married. You'll get wedding invites.

177
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:11,260
Leaving now.

178
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:14,351
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

179
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:17,531
What's with the goodbyes? What just happened?

180
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:22,951
It's true. I confirmed it. True love.

181
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:24,951
Confirmed?

182
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:41,211
 Oh no, this is a total death wish. Delete it now. 

183
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:43,311
 Asking for death? 

184
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:47,671
I'm out. Taking this with me.

185
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:56,951
 Alcohol harms health.
Drink moderately. P.S. So hot. 

186
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,791
 Sorry, sorry, I forgot to filter the audience. 

187
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,731
Are you really trying to get yourself killed?

188
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:11,591
How can you say that? It's a love test.

189
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,371
When a woman truly loves you,

190
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:17,791
she gets nervous if any woman
comes within five meters of you.

191
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:23,071
If your ideal type shows up, she'll whip out
an 8x scope and take her out instantly.

192
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:25,371
You know so much.

193
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:27,451
Of course.

194
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:31,711
When jealous, women instantly evolve from
single-cell organisms

195
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:35,231
to 180 IQ geniuses like uncanny Sherlock.

196
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:39,331
If she doesn't mind, either she's lazy

197
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,871
or she doesn't like you at all.

198
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:46,991
Some people here need to self-reflect.

199
00:16:55,231 --> 00:17:01,071
Li, I'm going upstairs. Wait, wait.

200
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:32,191
Grandma? What brings you here?

201
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:38,451
Jin Yu, I heard your grandma was discharged.
I came to check on her.

202
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:40,971
She's inside. Let's go in.

203
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:44,091
- Let me carry that for you. 
 - Alright,

204
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,671
let's go.

205
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,491
Grandma.

206
00:17:55,811 --> 00:18:01,191
This house hasn't changed a bit.

207
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:13,951
Rare visitor. Look who's here.

208
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:20,831
I heard about your leg injury and discharge.
I came to see you.

209
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:28,191
I just got discharged after two months.
Your intel network works fast.

210
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:30,971
Grandma.

211
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:39,951
Ba Dou, you look pathetic propping her up
like you're nursing an empress dowager.

212
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:43,051
Did you break your legs too? You okay?

213
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:45,191
Grandma, please sit. I'll get you tea.

214
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,591
Alright.

215
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:51,791
Would our distinguished in-law drink
commoners' tea?

216
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,611
She was a young miss from better days.

217
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:58,631
What if she gets cerebral palsy from one sip?

218
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:02,731
We can't afford to compensate.
Her life's too precious.

219
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:07,951
Jin Yu, just get me plain water.

220
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:12,271
Ju Hua, your teeth have been yellow
since we were young.

221
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:16,191
Cut back on tea and cigarettes.

222
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:25,371
That lipstick shade clashes with your complexion.

223
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:31,271
It makes you look sallow and haggard. Not good.

224
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:39,831
At our age, we should learn proper self-care.

225
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:42,251
Xu Mei Lan, are you here to pick a fight today?

226
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:44,891
Spit it out. I'm busy.

227
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:48,591
Watch your tone. Do I look unreasonable?

228
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:55,831
Let me tell you, if these kids
hadn't married behind my back,

229
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:58,731
I wouldn't be here.

230
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:04,831
But Jin Yu, I liked him the moment we met.

231
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:08,131
It doesn't seem like your influence at all.

232
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:12,811
Your granddaughter Meng is not spoiled.
Clearly not your doing.

233
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:17,191
Jin Yu, what are your plans?

234
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:18,931
I...

235
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:21,351
She's asking about the wedding. Out with it.

236
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:23,191
Right.

237
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:26,531
Ye Meng's away. I think there's no rush.

238
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:30,491
No rush? You youngsters always procrastinate.

239
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:36,291
Our family is prestigious.
Our wedding preparations are elaborate.

240
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,431
- Xu Mei Lan, what 'prestigious' nonsense? 
 - Let me finish!

241
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:40,751
Am I right?

242
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:42,871
I'm not done! Stop interrupting!

243
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,971
What do you mean by 'not done'?

244
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:48,151
Interrupting? Me? When?

245
00:20:48,151 --> 00:20:50,291
- Aren't you interrupting?
- You came to me!

246
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,051
You scared the kid away with your yelling.

247
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,771
I scared him away? Nonsense!

248
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:55,511
- Where is he now? 
 - Why should I check?

249
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,771
You explain 'prestigious family' first!

250
00:20:57,771 --> 00:21:02,231
You brought it up! You said 'prestigious'!

251
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:05,191
- Define 'prestigious' clearly! 
 - Enough! You're impossible.

252
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:08,771
- You came uninvited. 
 - Fine, fine! I can't win against you.

253
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:12,311
- Shrew. 
 - Exactly. I didn't want this either.

254
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:15,711
Who's a shrew? Take your trash box!

255
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:17,991
Your whole life's a mess. Pathetic.

256
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:20,631
As if I wanted this! You don't deserve it!

257
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:22,471
- You came voluntarily.
- You're the shrew!

258
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:24,611
- You are! 
 - Stop talking. I'm done.

259
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:29,371
Leave! Don't stay here!
Seeing you makes me annoyed.

260
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:34,510
Go away! I'm fuming!

261
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:57,691
What're you doing?

262
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:02,371
 You finally remember me? Just reading. 

263
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:09,451
I didn't want to interrupt your 'business meeting'
with your ex all afternoon.

264
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:15,471
Funny, I was respecting
your 'old comrades reunion' too.

265
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:19,031
 We're just colleagues. Your case is different. 

266
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:23,191
 Jiang Lu Zhi is your ex. You had stories. 

267
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:28,224
Jealous? Cheng Kai Ran's trick worked well.

268
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:34,771
You're intentionally playing
these little games to make me jealous?

269
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,151
Darling.

270
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:57,090
Just one day apart, but I miss you.

271
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,110
Do you miss me?

272
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,570
I have no time for it.

273
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,270
Your grandma visited today.

274
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:09,731
Two grandmas collaborated on wedding plans.

275
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:13,771
Were they rivals when young?

276
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:16,831
 Love rivals? 

277
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:23,571
Doubtful. Their tastes differ too much.

278
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,771
 But we should plan our wedding. 

279
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,591
As a bride-to-be, I need to prepare.

280
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:33,151
When are you coming back to take charge?

281
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:36,871
I want to, but I haven't met Wang Xing Sheng yet.

282
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:42,428
Come back soon,
or Grandma will use all your lipstick.

283
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:45,411
Let her use it if she wants.
I'll never run out anyway.

284
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:50,231
 She applied it on Ping An. 

285
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,271
Okay. Whatever makes her happy.

286
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:02,551
Coming. I'll get the delivery. Keep reading.

287
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:04,151
 Okay. 

288
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:08,171
Coming.

289
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:15,091
The line's been busy. Who were you talking to?

290
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:17,691
 Why are you so nosy? 

291
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,991
 Tai Ming Xiao said you married for true love. 

292
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:26,371
I've known you since graduation.
Nobody understands you better than me.

293
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:29,491
Even if trying to spite me,
you shouldn't joke about marriage.

294
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:31,611
You think I'd believe this nonsense?

295
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:34,091
Gou Kai, have you lost your mind?

296
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:36,511
You think you're the center of the world?

297
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:39,231
 I married someone just to provoke you? 

298
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:42,191
You came this late just for this?

299
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:43,531
Let's talk inside.

300
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:48,611
 Watch it. I'm married now. Keep proper boundaries. 

301
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:51,491
Married, huh? Fine.

302
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,691
How did you meet? What's their family do?

303
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:57,591
- How do they treat you? 
 - None of your business.

304
00:24:57,591 --> 00:25:01,271
You can't make up more lies, can you?

305
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:04,231
Because that person doesn't exist.

306
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:07,131
Thinking announcing on social media
and telling Tai Ming Xiao means anything?

307
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,591
You think this affects me?

308
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:12,060
Congratulations.

309
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,070
It worked.

310
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:20,731
Let me look. Is Jiang Lu Zhi here?

311
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:22,611
Who's this act for?

312
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:26,551
Ye Meng, I've always liked you.

313
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:28,311
You had no clue all these years?

314
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:32,151
 No hint at all. Is this how you love someone? 

315
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:35,991
I didn't tell you earlier
because we're worlds apart.

316
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:39,031
That's why I tried to elevate you.

317
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:40,931
I wanted my parents to accept us.

318
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:43,771
Otherwise, there'd be no future for us.
I didn't want to just be playing you.

319
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:47,931
PUA now? Not falling for it.

320
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:54,531
These are the keys to Jingyuan.

321
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:57,871
 I bought that apartment you wanted. 

322
00:25:57,871 --> 00:26:01,551
Ye Meng, I'll give you everything if you stay.

323
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:14,031
Have you been watching too many CEO soap operas?

324
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,331
Now acting out Cinderella and the prince?

325
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:18,151
Leave if you've got nothing better to say.

326
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:20,911
I need to meet Wang Xing Sheng tomorrow.

327
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:24,891
You think you can meet him without me?

328
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:27,371
Can your 'husband' help with this? No.

329
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:29,991
Gou Kai, I'll find Wang Xing Sheng myself.

330
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:31,791
I'll investigate my mother's case alone.

331
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:35,471
Leave now unless you want
security footage leaked company-wide tomorrow.

332
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,071
Get out!

333
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:38,151
It's fake, right?

334
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:40,151
What fake?

335
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:44,571
Fake.

336
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:49,811
Fake.

337
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:00,931
Cancel tomorrow's meeting with Mr. Wang.

338
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,020
 

339
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:22,871
 These are the keys to Jingyuan. 

340
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:26,351
 I'll give you everything if you stay. 

341
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:30,031
 Ye Meng, I've always liked you. 

342
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,651
 You had no clue all these years? 

343
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:03,348
 

344
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:18,311
 Sweetie, give me your birth details. 

345
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:20,251
 Let your aunt do the compatibility reading. 

346
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:25,111
 We'll pick a wedding date for you. 

347
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:32,451
Looks like their family just calls everyone
by affectionate terms. Nothing special.

348
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:36,911
Eat.

349
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:42,011
Ping An.

350
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:47,111
Finish this pancake.

351
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,911
My last breakfast from now on.

352
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,491
More?

353
00:29:56,891 --> 00:30:00,031
You're surprisingly cheerful.
Still have an appetite?

354
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:03,451
You're truly a dog.

355
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,751
Hello?

356
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:31,171
Well? How did the meeting with Wang Xing Sheng go?

357
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:34,791
I didn't meet him. Gou Kai probably canceled it.

358
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,831
I'll find another way.

359
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:40,391
Gou's insane. Another meltdown?

360
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:44,100
 Relax. I'll handle this. 

361
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:51,071
Hey, Li. I need to ask you about something.

362
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:02,440
 I got Wang Xing Sheng's hotel
from Gou Kai's driver. 

363
00:31:03,391 --> 00:31:05,791
Thanks. Dinner's on me later.

364
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:14,171
Easy. Let me record this.

365
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:20,931
Granny, you're energized
by your future granddaughter-in-law.

366
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:26,171
Joy brings vigor.

367
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:32,951
Jin Yu, you've stared at this page for hours.

368
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:36,971
You know nothing.
This is the memory palace technique.

369
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:41,871
Memory palace? You're just missing Ye Meng.

370
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:49,171
Decided. I'll wear red heels
to your brother's wedding.

371
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:52,571
Rest, Granny. I'll get you water.

372
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:17,291
- Hello.
- Hello.

373
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,591
Can you help me look for
a guest called Wang Xing Sheng?

374
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:21,731
Sorry. We can't disclose guest information.

375
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,951
We had a 2 PM meeting scheduled.

376
00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:25,791
His phone's unreachable.

377
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,891
He has heart issues. I'm worried about him.

378
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:29,831
Do you know his room number?

379
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:32,411
I don't know. Just help me contact him, okay?

380
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:34,891
One moment.

381
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:36,571
Your friend's name again?

382
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:41,011
Wang Xing Sheng. Xing Sheng.

383
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:45,491
Sorry, he checked out this morning.

384
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:47,951
Checked out?

385
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:50,211
Perhaps check elsewhere?

386
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,351
Thank you.

387
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:54,951
You're welcome.

388
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:25,991
 You made Wang Xing Sheng leave, right? 

389
00:33:25,991 --> 00:33:30,611
You don't have to help me,
but sabotage crosses the line.

390
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,711
It was indeed me who canceled the meeting.

391
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,661
 But didn't you say yourself 

392
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:37,251
that you'd find Wang Xing Sheng?

393
00:33:39,071 --> 00:33:42,411
Ye Meng, it's not too late to regret now.

394
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:47,331
I'll help with Wang Xing Sheng's matter.
My terms haven't changed.

395
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,430
 

396
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:13,471
 Hello? 

397
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:19,371
I'm not in a good mood today. Can you comfort me?

398
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:22,191
 I don't feel like comforting you right now. 

399
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,331
What do you mean?

400
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,131
 Nothing special. 

401
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:34,351
Li Jin Yu, are you trying to replace me?
Why won't you comfort me?

402
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,891
Because in a moment, I'll be holding my wife.

403
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,831
So no time to comfort you.

404
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:24,820
What are you doing?

405
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,440
♫ ♫

406
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,640
♫ ♫

407
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,540
♫ ♫

408
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:47,940
♫ ♫

409
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,840
♫ ♫

410
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:59,540
♫ ♫

411
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:06,740
♫ ♫

412
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:12,480
♫ ♫

413
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,671
Why did you come?

414
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:17,971
I've been going crazy missing you.

415
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:24,051
But there's something I need to explain.

416
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:25,751
What is it?

417
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:33,871
Promise you won't get angry
or jealous when I tell you.

418
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:38,631
I won't be angry, but whether
I'll get jealous needs consideration.

419
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:43,760
After we ended the video call yesterday,
Gou Kai came over.

420
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:49,691
I know. The call wasn't hung up.
I heard everything you two said.

421
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:52,151
Then you know I kicked him out, right?

422
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:54,191
Won't you regret it?

423
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:58,011
He's right. I can't give you anything.

424
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:03,131
Others can't provide what you can give.

425
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:05,431
For example?

426
00:38:07,331 --> 00:38:12,611
I miss you so much that I'm going crazy.

427
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:14,631
You're very sexy.

428
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:17,231
How does that compare to piano playing?

429
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:21,011
Playing the piano is first, and this is third.

430
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:23,631
What's second?

431
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:29,791
It was when you called me 'wife'
on our wedding night.

432
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:37,431
Why not combine these two?
Maybe it'll take first place.

433
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:44,211
Darling, I'm going crazy missing you.

434
00:38:57,456 --> 00:39:00,400
 

435
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:06,791
What's up?

436
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,491
 Are you at the hotel?
I need to see you about something later. 

437
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:12,000
No need. I don't want to see you.

438
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:16,691
 No ulterior motives. I just want to apologize. 

439
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:21,011
I had some drinks last night and rambled.
Don't take it seriously.

440
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:23,611
I'll keep helping with Wang Xing Sheng's matter.

441
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:29,031
No need. My husband is here.
He'll help me find him.

442
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:30,831
 Her husband came? 

443
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:40,411
Invite her and her husband to dinner downstairs.
Let's meet at our usual spot.

444
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,291
We're busy. Let's talk later.

445
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:48,331
You three musketeers have a regular spot?

446
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:50,731
Wasn't my attitude proper enough earlier?

447
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:55,431
Zero tolerance for marriage intruders. I swear.

448
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:00,231
Where are you going?

449
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,231
I'm taking a shower.

450
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,191
She hung up.

451
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:16,611
I suggest you accept reality quickly.

452
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:21,231
You didn't believe she was married.
Now, she's brought her husband.

453
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:25,431
She couldn't have hired an actor, could she?

454
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:33,970
It's actually possible.

455
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,031
Neither of us has seen her husband in person.

456
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:39,831
Have you seen him?

457
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:45,631
I haven't seen him either. Very likely.

458
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:51,871
I can't believe you, bro. Seriously?

459
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:53,571
You're something else.

460
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:56,831
I never realized you liked Ye Meng so much.

461
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,811
What made you so obsessed
after her trip to Ningsui?

462
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:04,691
Losing to better men is acceptable.
But what decent man comes from her hometown?

463
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:06,691
I can't accept this.

464
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,251
Acting.

465
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:16,930
 

466
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,131
Hello?

467
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:26,191
 I've found information, Jin Yu. 

468
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:27,751
What's it?

469
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,931
 Fat Buddha returned to Jiangbei. 

470
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:38,751
Are you sure he went back to Jiangbei?

471
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:40,251
 Yes, I heard it from Chen. 

472
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:44,791
 Fat Buddha was just selling counterfeit antiques,
not handling real deals. 

473
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:49,671
 He was recently detained for license plate fraud
and gang fights. He just got out. 

474
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:54,371
 Also, he has a teahouse in Jiangbei, you know?
I've sent you the address. 

475
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:56,271
Thanks. Got it.

476
00:41:58,571 --> 00:42:01,291
Both buddies of yours are mobilized?

477
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,591
I asked him for help.

478
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:07,791
Is Fat Buddha reliable?
We just teamed up to put him away last year.

479
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:11,311
Worth a try anyway.

480
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:24,040

00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:41,596
 ♫ You ♫ 

483
00:42:41,596 --> 00:42:43,972
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

484
00:42:44,668 --> 00:42:47,087
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

485
00:42:47,804 --> 00:42:53,788
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

486
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:59,608
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

487
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:03,768
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

488
00:43:03,768 --> 00:43:06,232
 ♫ Go ♫ 

489
00:43:06,232 --> 00:43:08,348
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

490
00:43:08,348 --> 00:43:12,376
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

491
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:18,460
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

492
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,428
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

493
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:28,544
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

494
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:32,764
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

495
00:43:32,764 --> 00:43:36,248
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

496
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:42,328
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

497
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:46,489
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

498
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:52,536
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

499
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:57,373
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

500
00:43:57,373 --> 00:44:00,429
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

501
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:06,996
 ♫ If love means letting go Let's sever all connections ♫ 

502
00:44:06,996 --> 00:44:09,640
 ♫ But why ♫ 

503
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,760
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

504
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,613
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
