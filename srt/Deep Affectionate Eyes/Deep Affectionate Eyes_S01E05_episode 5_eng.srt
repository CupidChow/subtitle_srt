 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:11,716
♫  I still remember it clearly  ♫

3
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:15,330
♫  Your eyes sparkled back then  ♫

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,615
♫  The way you lit up when telling me you loved me  ♫

5
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:25,696
♫  But over time, you've forgotten  ♫

6
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:31,144
♫  Promises left behind at every twist in life  ♫

7
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:34,632
♫  Only memories remain like scattered fireworks  ♫

8
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:38,196
♫  When I turned to walk away  ♫

9
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:42,828
♫  If I could go back to the day we said goodbye  ♫

10
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:48,800
♫  I'd never let go of your hand  ♫

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,936
♫  I can't hide the flutters in my heart  ♫

12
00:00:53,936 --> 00:01:01,116
♫  I'm about to be out of control as breathing turns weightless  ♫

13
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:05,916
♫  All I possess is drowned by the me who still loves you deeply  ♫

14
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:11,280
♫  I'll never changed even if miracles exist  ♫

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,363
♫  Don't forget, our promises will be kept  ♫

16
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:20,350
♫  And the dream where I'm with you  ♫

17
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:27,000
   

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
   

19
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:37,388
Doesn’t it feel like everything’s spinning? I’m so dizzy.

20
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:41,228
Why does it feel like this place is spinning and tilting?

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,928
Can you slow down?

22
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:49,548
You're quite nimble.

23
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:52,928
Are you drunk? Your face is so red.

24
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,568
You're the drunk one. Look at yourself.

25
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:57,988
What's the room number?

26
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,788
We're here.

27

28
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,320
Li Jin Yu.

29
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,200
You have such deep, affectionate eyes.

30
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:24,348
Let's get inside.

31
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:31,888
Okay, let me find the keycard.

32
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,968
Getting cold feet now?

33
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:44,828
Stop it. You're drunk.

34
00:02:58,028 --> 00:02:59,728
Go in.

35
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:19,988
Stop acting tough. Why drink when you can't handle it?

36
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:24,528
I just need a moment. Don't you dare leave.

37
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:57,508
I'm too tired today. Let's reschedule.

38
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:13,568
Uncle Yang?

39
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,468
Jin Yu?

40
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,148
Uncle Yang, have some water.

41
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,308
What brings you here?

42
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:32,568
Earlier this evening,

43
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:35,368
Ye Meng sent me an urgent message.

44
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:38,868
She asked me to check on a friend.

45
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,908
How did you two meet?

46
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:48,548
It's a long story. Years ago, my counseling center gave lectures in Ningsui.

47
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:52,408
Back then, the townspeople were close-minded. No one attended.

48
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:58,448
Only Ye Meng came every time, asking about depression.

49
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:03,508
Does she know about your past?

50
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:06,388
No. She just likes meddling.

51
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:09,668
Her savior complex is unstoppable.

52
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:15,688
You were popular with girls before Ningsui. But you never dated.

53
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:19,028
That's why I encouraged you to try dating.

54
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:24,768
By the way, your grandmother mentioned a girl from Jiangbei.

55
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:26,928
I never expected it'd be Xiao Meng.

56
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:30,688
No. It's not really dating.

57
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:35,108
Just an arranged meeting to please my grandmother.

58
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,488
But you seem much better now.

59
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:41,128
That incident wasn't your fault. Stop blaming yourself.

60
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:47,228
As long as we don't mention her, things are fine.

61
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,808
Jin Yu, know the white bear effect?

62
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,908
The more you avoid something,

63
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:55,668
the more it consumes your thoughts.

64
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:58,908
I know forgetting the past is hard.

65
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:02,448
But don't rush or force yourself to escape it.

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,600
All right, I'll head back if there's nothing else.

67
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,088
- Let me walk you out, Uncle Yang. 
 - No need.

68
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:14,468
Also, if you want to keep your past a secret, I'll pretend we're strangers.

69
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,708
Take care, Uncle Yang.

70
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,480
 Li Jin Yu? 

71
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,800
Li Jin Yu? Li Jin Yu?

72
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,348
I'm thirsty.

73
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,908
Thanks.

74
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,790
Looking for Uncle Yang?

75
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,920
He left.

76
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,688
How did it go?

77
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,228
He's been my therapist for years.

78
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:50,648
But why were you seeing a psychologist?

79
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,308
My grandmother said my mom had depression.

80
00:08:56,308 --> 00:09:02,588
I wondered why someone so cheerful had depression.

81
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:05,576
So, I attended Uncle Yang's lectures.

82
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,928
Li Jin Yu,

83
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:14,868
I know you think I'm nosy, but I'm scared that you...

84
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:25,688
Forget it. It's just that I want you to open up.

85
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,048
I'm just used to being alone.

86
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:42,268
It seems like I faced the worst moments of my life alone.

87
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,348
But you have me now. Look at me.

88
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:55,668
I'm emotionally stable and financially secure. Not tempted?

89
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,688
What do you like about me?

90
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,460
This face alone is enough.

91
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,440
I had never asked anyone for WeChat before.

92
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:12,788
You said you wanted to ask about the crab restaurant.

93
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:14,888
Don't expose the truth.

94
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:26,048
Don't tease me. When I love someone, it's forever.

95
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:29,768
Funny, me too.

96
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:33,348
You? Let's wait and see.

97
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,248
I shouldn't have invited Uncle Yang.

98
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:39,688
I should've just claimed you. That'd stop you from being cocky.

99
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:43,928
Who's being cocky? Thank me for not taking advantage.

100
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,188
Please. Would you dare?

101
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,370
What's that?

102
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,600
It's still early anyway.

103
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,688
If I want to do something, there's plenty of time.

104
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,568
Do whatever you want. It won't be me who suffers anyway.

105
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,350
   

106
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:24,888
Good night.

107
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:42,628
Quite the gentleman.

108
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,308
I've been looking for you all night. So, here's where you've been.

109
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:10,688
Are you together with Ye Meng?

110
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,048
Is knowing the answer really that important to you?

111
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:22,048
You don’t like me. You only showed interest in provoking Ye Meng, right?

112
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:25,748
- Do you really hate her that much? 
 - I absolutely hate her.

113
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:28,528
Since childhood, teachers and classmates always preferred her.

114
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:30,708
Every boy I liked ended up liking her.

115
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,720
Even my parents constantly say, "Why can't you be more like Ye Meng?

116
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,548
She's pretty and has a great personality."

117
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:42,348
I'm charismatic too. And I'm not bad-looking either.

118
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:44,528
My grades are lightyears ahead of hers.

119
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:47,788
So, why does she get to be the model child?

120
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,088
Maybe in her eyes, you're the model child, too.

121
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,648
Even if that's true, I'll never sit at the same table with her.

122
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,588
We'll probably hate each other forever.

123
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,188
Sorry for using you as a tool again.

124
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,448
We can still be friends, right?

125
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,528
If you really like Ye Meng, let me give you some advice.

126
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:23,928
Keep her in Ningsui. Don't let her return to Jiangbei.

127
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,980
   

128
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:40,728
Jin Yu, you're here.

129
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,380
   

130
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,648
Hand it over.

131
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,528
Help me get this discount.

132
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,708
I need to tell you something. I'm going to Jiangbei.

133
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,080
Jiangbei? What for?

134
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,440
To see Li Ling Bai.

135
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,860
You're going to see that woman? Are you insane?

136
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,860
I've already bought the ticket.

137
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,720
What were you thinking?

138
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,980
She seems to have a terminal illness. Might die soon.

139
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,980
As her son, I should go claim my inheritance.

140
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,260
Then, I'll return to take care of you and let you live a rich life.

141
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,860
Didn't you want to try racing and skydiving like me?

142
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,440
We'll use a world map as a dartboard. Wherever the dart lands, we'll go.

143
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,760
I don't need her money. I have money.

144
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,060
So, stop joking around.

145
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,620
You know exactly what kind of person she is.

146
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,860
Fine. Go if you must.

147
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,260
Text me when you land. I bought you expensive insurance.

148
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,100
If anything happens, I'll claim it and have a happy new year.

149
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,520
Don't even think about it. I'll crawl back before the Spring Festival.

150
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
Eat your food.

151
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,220
   

152
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,340
 First add some oil, then 125 ml of milk. 

153
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
 Mix them thoroughly. 

154
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,500
 Then, add some flour. 

155
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,100
Your leg just healed, and you're already working so hard.

156
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,560
Don't overdo it.

157
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,836
Film this properly. It's Jia Yu's school assignment.

158
00:15:57,836 --> 00:16:01,248
We need to show "The Power of Love" with this vlog. Understand?

159
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:04,228
Fine, I'll use the slimming filter. And a 45-degree angle.

160
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:06,328
Okay, let me see.

161
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:08,848
Here. What do you think?

162
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:11,888
Great. Perfect.

163
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:19,088
You drank together last night and didn't do anything?

164
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:22,288
That's not how city people behave.

165
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,728
I believe in pure love.

166
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,288
You're both so slow. They say it's easy for a woman to chase a man.

167
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,668
You two are moving mountains here.

168
00:16:32,668 --> 00:16:36,948
Are your hints too subtle, or is he uninterested?

169
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:40,128
If that's the case, he's taking advantage of your kindness.

170
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,388
I didn't actually plan to do anything last night.

171
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:48,208
Then, why did you bring him to your room?

172
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:51,128
You wouldn't understand.

173
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:57,388
Are you serious, girl?

174
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:58,688
Stop talking.

175
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:02,548
Oh no, Ye Meng, you've fallen hard.

176
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,108
Totally smitten.

177
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,968
- It's snowing. 
 - Where? Really?

178
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:14,568
It's true. Hurry! Watch your leg.

179
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,988
It's snowing in Ningsui. I need to record this.

180
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:38,348
About being serious, I'm not sure.

181
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:43,488
But my first instinct about the snow isn't to post about it online.

182
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:45,668
Then, what is it?

183
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:49,248
I'm worried if Li Jin Yu brought an umbrella.

184
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:54,108
 Or if he'll slip on the icy ground. 

185
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,448
You're acting like you're in a romance drama.

186
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:20,060
   

187
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:27,108
 But my first instinct about the snow isn't to post about it online. 

188
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,248
 Then, what is it? 

189
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:32,208
 I'm worried if Li Jin Yu brought an umbrella. 

190
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:37,248
 Or if he'll slip on the icy ground. 

191
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,828
   

192
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:45,448
 Where? Hospital or home? 

193
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:50,188
 At home. The snow's beautiful. 

194
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,590
   

195
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:10,748
Aren't you cold? Close the window.

196
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:14,768
You don't get it. It's about a romantic atmosphere.

197
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:16,948
Oh, please.

198
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:22,248
Li Jin Yu's birthday is coming. What should I give him?

199
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,648
Nothing else. Just give him yourself.

200
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:28,248
So cliché. Is that all you think about?

201
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:31,448
Can't I just imagine?

202
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,308
Your "Power of Love is good. Teach me.

203
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,288
Take it. It's right there.

204
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:40,828
I don't want what you made. I want to make it myself.

205
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:44,148
- It's about a sense of ceremony, all right? 
 - Fine, I don't get it.

206
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:48,828
You big-city returnees with your ceremony vibes and atmospheric concepts.

207
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:53,028
- Please, I'm begging you. 
 - I'll teach you. First, close the window.

208
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:55,488
Why are you so obsessed with the window?

209
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,168
- It's cold. 
 - Okay, got it.

210
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:59,488
Pick your favorite color and paint however you want.

211
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:01,908
Paint first. Let me see your skill level.

212
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:05,408
- Just paint like this? 
 - Yes. Squeeze it.

213
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:07,588
It startled me.

214
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:11,388
- Just like this? 
 - Yeah, that's pretty good.

215
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:15,448
- Fang Ya En. 
 - You're really something. You'll eat whatever you make later.

216
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,448
Let me teach you properly.

217
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:37,008
 I booked a ticket for you. 

218
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:41,428
 The flight's tomorrow morning. A driver will pick you up. 

219
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,840
   

220
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:56,348
 I might need to go to Jiangbei tomorrow. 

221
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:17,768
We need to hurry up. If Li Jin Yu finds out, there'll be no surprise left.

222
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:20,848
Are you serious? My leg hasn't fully recovered yet.

223
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:22,728
You're rushing me like this over some guy?

224
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:25,548
Sorry. I forgot about your leg. Come on, give that to me.

225
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:27,728
Look at you with fireworks and cakes and all.

226
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:30,308
Aren't you afraid Li Jin Yu will get spoiled?

227
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,208
He's got a sharp memory and a sharper tongue.

228
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,148
I don't want him bringing this up later.

229
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:36,548
Saying I made such an ugly cake for his first birthday celebration.

230
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:39,528
- All right. No need. 
 - Give it to me. Just give it to me.

231
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:42,568
- It's okay. 
 - Thank you, my bestie.

232
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,568
Be careful.

233
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:31,768
You two may leave.

234
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,568
Yes, Ms. Li.

235
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,688
You've changed quite a bit, becoming more like a real man.

236
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,700
How's your grandma?

237
00:22:58,728 --> 00:23:03,208
She broke her leg recently and is now in rehab.

238
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,848
She's mostly recovered now.

239
00:23:04,848 --> 00:23:08,668
Why didn't you tell me about something so important?

240
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:16,820
I know you still resent me.

241
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,440
Those years...

242
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:28,268
I failed you and your grandma.

243
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:35,448
How did you suddenly get this illness?

244
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:41,630
It's karma.

245
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,820
I've been hospitalized here for over six months.

246
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,208
I have constant nightmares,

247
00:23:54,768 --> 00:24:00,328
dreaming of that stormy night

248
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:05,488
 when you held my hand and cried, 

249
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:10,468
 - "Mom, don't make me leave." 
 - Don't make me leave. 

250
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:26,488
After waking up, I thought I should call you.

251
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:30,828
I researched on my way here.

252
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:36,588
You need physical exams first, then bone marrow test, right?

253
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:40,928
You're willing to donate marrow to me?

254
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,808
Isn't that why you contacted me?

255
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:51,350
 The process is complicated. 

256
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,348
 You'll need to stay here several days. 

257
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:59,528
 I'll have someone handle your admission. 

258
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,952
   

259
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:09,660
   

260
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:33,588
Mai Mai, you're home. Where's your brother?

261
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:36,488
He's out. I'm just feeding his dog.

262
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:39,328
- Where did he go? 
 - He went to Jiangbei.

263
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,848
Jiangbei? So suddenly?

264
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:44,328
He went to be a blood bank.

265
00:25:44,328 --> 00:25:45,828
He's donating blood?

266
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:49,228
No, Grandma said his mom's seriously ill.

267
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,088
We don't know the exact illness.

268
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:55,108
They just said it's life-threatening, demanding a marrow donation from my brother.

269
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:59,008
That woman fears death now, suddenly remembering she has a son.

270
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:00,488
Only an idiot like my brother

271
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:03,728
would rush to Jiangbei immediately upon hearing she's sick.

272
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,868
I think he still harbors hope for that woman.

273
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:10,728
My brother's birthday is coming up.

274
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:15,208
He probably also hopes she'll remember his birthday.

275
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:29,328
 I heard marrow donation's really painful. 

276
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:34,428
 Now he's all alone, with nobody to ask if he's in pain. 

277
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:36,528
 It's too pitiful. 

278
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:49,130
   

279
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:55,028
 Sorry. The subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

280
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:02,108
 Jin Yu, stop the car. 

281
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:05,450
 Dad. 

282
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,248
 I need to ask you something. 

283
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:12,048
 Go ahead. 

284
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:22,488
 Am I not your biological son? 

285
00:29:15,388 --> 00:29:19,948
 A'Feng, you're Mommy's big hero. 

286
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,908
 Superhero. 

287
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:27,448
 I know you can overcome this. 

288
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:32,288
 Mom believes in you. I know you're amazing. 

289
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,108
 Mom will stay with you. Don't be afraid. 

290
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:05,800
   

291
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:15,848
Hi. I'm looking for a patient named Li Jin Yu. Which room is he in?

292
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:18,348
One moment, let me check.

293
00:30:21,108 --> 00:30:22,868
B39, that way.

294
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:24,568
Thanks.

295
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,348
What?

296
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,648
It hurts.

297
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:43,708
Does it hurt badly?

298
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:51,680
♫  Those restless anxieties  ♫

299
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,380
♫  Perhaps you're just like me  ♫

313
00:33:31,248 --> 00:33:33,008
Hello?

314
00:33:33,008 --> 00:33:38,150
Sorry, my phone wasn't with me earlier.

315
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,760
I missed your calls.

316
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:46,248
Mai Mai told me. Are you calling to ask me to pick you up in Jiangbei?

317
00:33:46,248 --> 00:33:49,768
No. It's because I dreamed about you.

318
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:53,248
 I'm calling to ask if you like tofu cheesecake. 

319
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:57,108
When I was in Jiangbei, there was this tofu cheesecake shop.

320
00:33:57,108 --> 00:33:59,392
We went there often, and its cake were delicious.

321
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:02,432
 Do you want me to bring you some? 

322
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:06,048
No, let's go there together.

323
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:07,768
Forget it then.

324
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:11,744
 It's not easy for me to visit Jiangbei. 

325
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:14,448
So many people want to see me.

326
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:18,668
Even if you came, I wouldn't have time to see you.

327
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,588
You really won't see me?

328
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:28,848
No.

329
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:33,088
Okay.

330
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,708
- Yu Zi Yang! 
 - Mom!

331
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:16,408
Zi Yang, I missed you so much.

332
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:21,028
My good boy, let me see. You've lost weight.

333
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:25,488
Leaving so soon?

334
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:31,912
Actually, there was no need for the elaborate charade.

335
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:35,052
I knew Li Zhuo Feng was the sick one.

336
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:40,872
Sharp eyes. I practiced for days in the mirror.

337
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:46,572
I won't let you come for nothing. This is compensation.

338
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:51,372
I owe my father.

339
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:56,812
Use the marrow however you want. I don't care.

340
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:00,852
Fine. Your call.

341
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:38,572
Let's go home. I made you chili chicken and braised pork.

342
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,352
- Are there more? 
 - Sure.

343
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:44,352
All your favorites. Let's go home.

344
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:46,052
Okay.

345
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:18,832
Why are you at the train station?

346
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:24,192
Someone sneaked off to Jiangbei. I couldn't let that slide.

347
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:25,970
My bad.

348
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,030
I'll treat you to tofu cheesecake.

349
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,272
How'd things go in Jiangbei? Smoothly?

350
00:37:37,272 --> 00:37:40,352
All right. All settled.

351
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:47,952
This trip drained you completely.

352
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:51,312
Any more and you'll collapse.

353
00:38:11,512 --> 00:38:16,472
Seatbelt on? Okay. Let's go.

354
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:38,492
Busy later?

355
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:41,412
Not really.

356
00:38:41,412 --> 00:38:43,312
Come to my place.

357
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:57,272
Please, Mr. Li.

358
00:39:05,332 --> 00:39:07,232
Ready?

359
00:39:17,552 --> 00:39:19,772
Happy birthday.

360
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,552
I planned a grand celebration for you.

361
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:28,292
But you sneaked to Jiangbei. So, you're left with just this.

362
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:31,792
But I made this myself. It's my first cake ever.

363
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:37,352
You bought me tofu cheesecake. So, it's a mutual effort.

364
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:39,892
Grand celebration? Mutual effort?

365
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:41,792
That's not how those phrases work.

366
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:45,352
I'll use them how I want. Wait here.

367
00:39:54,172 --> 00:40:00,472
Li Jin Yu, hurry. Here's your gift.

368
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:05,432
Why goldfish?

369
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:10,372
Companion for your black fish. And an example for you too.

370
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:15,432
No more loneliness, but all liveliness.

371
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,520
Next step.

372
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,050
Come on.

373
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:31,592
Here. Make a wish.

374
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:38,932
Li Jin Yu, you didn't make a wish yet.

375
00:41:07,152 --> 00:41:09,552
You need to make a wish.

376
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:41,692
Try this cake. It's my first attempt.

377
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:44,292
But it should taste okay.

378
00:41:49,532 --> 00:41:52,132
- Try it. 
 - You went to Jiangbei for me?

379
00:41:55,852 --> 00:42:01,372
Your cousin feared organ harvesters targeting you. So, I checked on you for her.

380
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:03,692
Why didn't you tell me?

381
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:06,772
I did. I called you.

382
00:42:06,772 --> 00:42:08,812
You said you didn't want to see me.

383
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,992
So, you just came back directly?

384
00:42:15,172 --> 00:42:18,742
I ran off to Jiangbei. But someone avoided me.

385
00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:22,152
My heart was broken. What else could I do?

386
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:31,152
What's wrong?

387
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,972
Do you want to try again with me?

388
00:42:40,072 --> 00:42:41,660
Ye Meng...

389
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,210
do you still want to be with me?

390
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:57,592
Forget it. Pretend I didn't say anything.

391
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:07,392
I... I need to ask.

392
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:10,220
Are you asking this now

393
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:16,252
because you like me or you're moved by me?

394
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:22,252
I want someone who truly likes me.

395
00:43:22,252 --> 00:43:26,272
So no rush. Think carefully.

396
00:43:26,992 --> 00:43:31,250
Eat the cake. Try it.

397
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:34,312
But I can't guarantee it's not poisonous.

398
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:40,272
This smiley face looks like you. Smile more.
