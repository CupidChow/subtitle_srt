00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm heading out, Ya'en.

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,920
Thanks for today.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,920
Li Jinyu.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
YA, MIX & MATCH

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,600
I owe you an apology.

7
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,080
It's my fault you lost your job.

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
I'll smooth things over with Kai.
Don't worry.

YA VINTAGE STYLE, 10% OFF STOREWIDE

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,920
All I want is a quiet life.
I'm not looking for drama.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,400
What do you mean?

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,360
Right now, all I want
is to take care of Grandma.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,920
I don't need more trouble.

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,640
Stop messing with me.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,720
I know. You're only playing around anyway.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm going.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,560
What's the deal with Chen Jian?

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
I thought the divorce happened ages ago.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,160
Him? When we were together,
he never treated me right.

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,720
Now that I want to end it,
he's refusing to let go.

21
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,640
Forget him. He's bad luck.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,720
- Do you need a hand?
- No, no, don't.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,960
- Careful.
- You're gonna break my arm--

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,600
- No, don't.
- Sorry, sorry, my bad.

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,440
- My arm…
- Sorry!

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,040
Jiayu, what do want to eat today?
I will cook for you.

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
Please don't.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,880
Your cooking gave me nightmares.

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,600
Let's just order delivery.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,040
See? One meal from you
scarred my son for life.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,160
Alright, fine.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,840
Then dinner's on me. Pick anything.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,720
Thanks, Godmom.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,680
But the thing between you two…
Will that affect the kid?

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,040
I don't care about the rest.
Jiayu is everything to me.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,480
Chen Jian is not taking him from me.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,760
Then crab roe noodles it is.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Perfect.

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,160
No scallions for Godmom.

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,400
- Extra scallions for Mom, right?
- That's right.

LJY, ADD TO CONTACTS

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,160
- You're walking pretty well now.
- Look, I can even jog.

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,400
Alright, alright.

49
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,560
Once you drop me off at home,

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
go straight to the city
and take care of your business.

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,400
- Are you sure your leg's okay?
- I'll manage.

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
Why's he here again?

53
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
- You didn't see me. I'm out of here.
- Okay, go.

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
Kai.

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,920
Ya'en.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,560
- You're here by yourself?
- Yeah, just me.

57
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,600
Well…

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
Where's Ye Meng?

59
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,120
She's busy today. Didn't come.

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,560
- I'll get going.
- No!

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,120
Well… We'll take you.

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
- Where to? I'll drive you.
- No need. My leg's fine.

63
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,240
- Don't be polite. Come on.
- I'm not being polite.

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
- Let's go.
- No, really, I--

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,200
- Where to? I'll take you.
- I don't…

66
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,160
Don't put weight on it. That's it.

67
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
Granny.

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,320
Why'd you come outside?

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,600
Lying in bed makes my bones ache.

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,960
I feel restless all over.

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,440
So, I thought I'd get some sun
and a bit of fresh air.

72
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,120
Yeah, nice day. A walk will do you good.

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
Go on over there.

74
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,760
Join them for a while.

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,280
- Call me if you need me.
- Go, go.

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,200
- Come on. Let's sit down.
- Alright.

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,440
Where's Li Jinyu?
Why isn't he keeping you company?

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Sit.

79
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,360
So, you know Badou well?

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,840
Not really.

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
Why don't you give him a chance then?

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
My grandson may not be perfect,

83
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,440
but in terms of the basics,
he's got it all.

84
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,720
Hasn't the Ye family been wanting
a live-in son-in-law?

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Right.

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,840
Badou would be perfect.

87
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,200
He meets every one of your family's needs.

88
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,280
Granny…

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,240
You know, in our family,
the minute something happens,

90
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,040
the whole town knows about it.

91
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,640
Aren't you worried
people will gossip about him?

92
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,480
What's there to be afraid of?

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,040
Li Badou took his mother's surname.

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,240
He might seem a little careless now,

95
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,560
but he's got his strengths.

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,560
And don't you love those foreign romances,

97
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,720
the really sappy ones?

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,560
What are they called?
Something with "tic"?

99
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,000
- Some movie.
- Romantic.

100
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,600
When you get together,

101
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,200
Badou can be your personal translator.

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,800
I had no idea Li Badou

103
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
- actually grew up abroad.
- Granny!

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Alright, alright, I heard you.

105
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,760
It's about time we head back.

106
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,160
- We'll chat a little longer.
- I'll keep her company.

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,560
Don't worry.

108
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Come on. Take me with you.

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's break free and run wild.

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,400
I'll buy you coffee.

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
Well, I could go for that.

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
My treat. Pinky promise.

113
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,720
Pinky promise.

114
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,400
Come on.

115
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,840
Hurry.

116
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,240
Hi. What can I get you?

117
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,160
- Two oat lattes, hot.
- That'll be 50. Scan here.

118
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
I've got it.

119
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,640
No need. I was just teasing you.

120
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll transfer it to you later.

121
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
Otherwise, you'll think I'm stingy.

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
Then you'll stop bothering with Badou.

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,640
Not a chance.

124
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,200
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

125
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,600
Granny, you remind me
so much of my grandma.

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,640
Coffee's here. I'll get it.

127
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,440
Thanks.

128
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,240
Ms. Li, can the price go any higher?

129
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
Two thousand a session.

130
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,160
That's the highest rate you'll find.

131
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,920
Ask around if you don't believe me.

132
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
Sorry, let me take this call.

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,720
- Hello? Who's this?
- Li Jinyu.

134
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,600
How dare you do this
behind your grandma's back.

135
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,800
Excuse me?

136
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,280
Don't play dumb.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,800
I saw it. Never thought I'd find you here,
selling yourself as a gigolo.

138
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,360
Two thousand a session works for me,

139
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,080
but I want something long-term.

140
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,240
Kid,

141
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,120
guys like you don't come around often.

142
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,880
If you play your cards right,

143
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,320
I'll definitely keep you on long-term.

144
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,920
Honestly, kid,

145
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,160
you're made for this line of work.

146
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,640
Two thousand isn't exactly small change.

147
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,320
In a town this size, business is limited.

148
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,440
What are you waiting for?

149
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Take the chance while you're young.

150
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Once you're older,
you won't catch her eye.

151
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,159
Couldn't have said it better myself.

152
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,600
You two know each other?

153
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
We're friends.

154
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,880
And you're right.

155
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,480
If we work together long-term,
we won't count by the session.

156
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,840
Regulars are different, right?

157
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,000
They get special treatment, don't they?

158
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,360
Kid, you shouldn't let this slip by.

159
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,400
You're smart, girl.

160
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm telling your grandma right now.

161
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,480
What's in your head?

162
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,320
This is exactly
how young people go astray.

163
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,920
First, it's holding hands, and then?

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,840
You're still young.
Turn back while you can.

165
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
Not every kind of money is worth making.

166
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
If you're going to talk bad about me,

167
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
at least wait until I'm not sitting here.

168
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,520
What do you think I'm hiring him for?

169
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,240
I run a legitimate business.

170
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,280
What? You think
I'll make him my boyfriend?

171
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,320
Please, I've got plenty of boyfriends.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,880
Look.

173
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
A modeling agency contract.

174
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,920
If it all looks good, sign it.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,280
I've got a beauty appointment.

176
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,880
Ms. Li,

177
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,280
if it's alright,
can I take the contract home,

178
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,840
look it over, then get back to you?

179
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,960
No problem.

180
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
Here.

181
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,280
Pleasure doing business.

182
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,280
How come you have a--

183
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,720
How did I not notice this scar earlier?

184
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,320
Sorry.

185
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,360
For a hand model,
your hands need to be spotless.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
No cuts, no scars.

187
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,680
So, here's what I suggest.
Go take care of it first.

188
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,720
If you're still interested after,
come back and see me.

189
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,200
Is that okay? Sorry about today.

190
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,680
I'll head out now. Bye.

191
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,880
Why are you here?

192
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,280
Wait.

193
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,440
Did you kidnap my grandma?

194
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

195
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,160
I ran into her at the hospital.

196
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,800
She asked me to take her for a walk.

197
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
- Looks nice.
- How's the coffee?

198
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,160
Too bitter. And overpriced.

199
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,960
Badou. What are you doing here?

200
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,600
Getting gutsy, aren't you?
Slipping out on your own.

201
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,960
- Come here.
- What is it?

202
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,280
This girl's prettier than Jiang.
And a lot more sensible.

203
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,240
That's enough. I'll take you back.

204
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,440
I barely made it out today.

205
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,840
At least let me post
a few photos on my Moments.

206
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,880
Fine. Stay if you want. I'm leaving.

207
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,720
Silly girl,
why are you still standing here?

208
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,520
Go after him. Hurry.

209
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,240
The nurse will come pick me up later.

210
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,880
Alright, Granny. I'll head out first.

211
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,640
Go on. Don't worry about me.

212
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,240
Li Jinyu.

213
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,880
If you really want
that modeling gig, I can help you.

214
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,200
Aren't you generous?

215
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,240
You lost the job at the bar because of me.

216
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,200
I owe you that much.

217
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,920
Come on.

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Where are we going?

219
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,560
You'll know when we get there.

220
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,040
HOLD HANDRAIL AND STAND STEADY

221
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,400
<i>He had it rough growing up.</i>

222
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,360
<i>When Badou was just a kid,</i>

223
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,680
<i>his mom shipped him overseas.</i>

224
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't think she did it for his sake.

225
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,560
She just didn't want him around.

226
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,640
It was like exile.

227
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,040
He was basically a kid
left behind, you know?

228
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,480
The only one who cared was his dad.

229
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,800
So, when his father passed away,

230
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,920
Badou almost went with him.

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That heartless mother of his
probably wished he had.

232
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
If I hadn't rushed to Jiangbei,

233
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,400
he wouldn't have made it.

234
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,240
Now, do you see
why I say he's been through hell?

235
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,440
XINGFA HAIR SALON, XIUYUAN ORGANIC FOODS

236
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,640
Why'd you bring me here?

237
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,800
You'll know once we go in. Come on.

238
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Shi!

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
Come upstairs!

240
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Which floor?

241
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Second.

242
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,440
You little brat.
You've been back this long

243
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,560
and only now remember me?

244
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,840
When I got your call,

245
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,480
I thought you'd risen from the dead.

246
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,920
I came straight here to find you.

247
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,120
The equipment's set up.

248
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,960
I've got an appointment.
Make yourself at home.

249
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,880
We'll go first.

250
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,720
Sit down.

251
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,920
Take off your watch.

252
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,640
Why are you looking at me like that?

253
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,480
Let me check.

254
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,880
Your heartbeat's slower
than most people's.

255
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
Dr. Ye.

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,160
You done with the pulse check?

257
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,480
You're making me uneasy.

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,880
Be honest.
Do you even know what you're doing?

259
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,600
I do.

260
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,920
I used to work here.

261
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,200
If I hadn't gone to Jiangbei for exams,

262
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,720
I'd have opened my own studio
here in town.

263
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,040
So, you had time to kill back then.

264
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,840
Not exactly.

265
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,360
I failed the college entrance exam.
Had to repeat the year.

266
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,240
Worked here during the break.

267
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,160
Leave that on.

268
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,920
You nervous?

269
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,920
Not really.

270
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,680
Let me wipe it off.

271
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,440
Let's begin.

272
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,839
It'll sting a little.

273
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,720
Does it hurt?

274
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
Keep going.

275
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,080
How'd you get this scar?

276
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Because of my mom.

277
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
Want me to keep going?

278
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
You really love her.

279
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
But she hates me.

280
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,560
My mom loved me.

281
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,640
Ye Meng's mom,

282
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,880
I really can't manage
your daughter anymore.

283
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,840
We just went over that problem last class.

284
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,400
On the test, she was the only one
who couldn't do it.

285
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,040
She's about to take
the college entrance exam.

286
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,720
And she's already repeating a year.

287
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,200
At this rate,

288
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,560
she won't get into junior college.

289
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,840
What's wrong?

290
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,640
Can't take a little criticism?

291
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,160
That's all it takes to upset you?

292
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,320
- Mom, my grades…
- Enough.

293
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,680
Don't give me that long face.

294
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,040
Here, eat something sweet. Cheer up.

295
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,400
Is now really the time
to brag about that to me?

296
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,880
But she still took her own life.

297
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,680
Wyatt?

298
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,040
That's the English name I gave her.

299
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,960
Have you seen the movie <i>Proof of Life</i>?

300
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,000
There's a character called Wyatt.

301
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,160
Mysterious. Strong.

302
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,240
<i>I insisted my mom go by that name.</i>

303
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,600
<i>In full teenage cringe,</i>
<i>I had Shi make me a letter necklace.</i>

304
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,040
<i>She wore it all the time.</i>

305
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
<i>I just wanted to live</i>
<i>with the same strength</i>

306
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,920
<i>she had.</i>

307
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,400
Done.

308
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,880
See?

309
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,000
It stings a little,

310
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,560
but scars can be smoothed out.

311
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,360
If you let them.

312
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,560
LONGXUAN HOME KITCHEN

313
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,640
So, are we going to settle
this money thing or not?

314
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,520
Give me your number. I'll transfer it.

315
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,160
Forget it. No need.

316
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
- Sorry.
- Trying to cripple me, are you?

317
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,640
Didn't you just say you wanted my number?

318
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,280
Fine. If you insist.

319
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,560
Too bad the lady just turned me down.

320
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,800
Come on, Li Jinyu. Stop messing with me.

321
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,240
I worked on you all afternoon.
My shoulders are killing me!

322
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,440
- I'll treat you to a massage then.
- Hurry up.

323
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,760
Hurry up. Hurry up!

324
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,480
Say please.

325
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,800
You really want me to act
like those younger girls, don't you?

326
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,160
Fine.

327
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,000
Jinyu, you're so handsome.

328
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,440
Can I get your number, please?

329
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,480
Sure. Here, let me add you.

330
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,240
You're unbelievable.

331
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Done.

332
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
- What are you doing?
- You've got way too many girls in here.

333
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm pinning myself on top.

334
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
And be glad I don't delete them all.

335
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,560
Didn't expect you to be the--

336
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Come with me. I need a hand.

337
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,120
- With what?
- Why do you ask so many questions?

338
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,880
Why are you walking so fast?

339
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,200
I like walking fast.

340
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,800
Alright. Walk even faster then.

341
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,320
- Go on.
- Li Jinyu!

342
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,880
Fine, you go by yourself. I'm done.

343
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,200
You that busy?

344
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,120
- Are you?
- No. Let's go.

345
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,000
QQ CONVENIENCE STORE

346
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,720
- Watch the step.
- I will.

347
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,200
- Here.
- Thank you.

348
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,360
Jiayu's got tutoring nearby.

349
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,720
I'll just wait for him here.

350
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
You've been tagging along with me all day.

351
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,760
Go on. Get back to work.

352
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,760
Hey, missus.

353
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,480
What are you having?

354
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,240
No, not her. Call her ma'am.

355
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,240
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

356
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,560
- Ninety-degree bow.
- Ma'am.

357
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,960
Who are you calling ma'am?
Do I really look that old?

358
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,760
Come on. Send them off.

359
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,120
Do as Ya'en says. Clear out.

360
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,720
Bring me a pot of tea.

361
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,120
This place hasn't changed a bit
since our school days.

362
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,440
What do you mean it hasn't?

363
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,480
Has it?

364
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,320
I haven't changed at all.

365
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,800
Even after all these years
without seeing each other,

366
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,400
but in my heart,
I've always seen you as my big sister.

367
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,320
Look at you now,

368
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,680
running a big business, calling the shots,

369
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,400
yet you still talk the same, like a child.

370
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,920
I feel the same.
I've always seen you as my little brother.

371
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,240
And Ye Meng too.

372
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,320
So, Kai,

373
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,280
don't stay on such bad terms with her.

374
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,640
Remember these words?

375
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,240
No one's allowed to bully…

376
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,600
<i>Kai.</i>

377
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,760
<i>Fang…</i>

378
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,440
<i>Ya…</i>

379
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,840
<i>…En.</i>

380
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,600
- <i>Ye…</i>
- <i>Meng.</i>

381
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,600
NO ONE'S ALLOWED TO BULLY KAI!
BY FANG YA'EN, YE MENG

382
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,520
NO ONE'S ALLOWED TO BULLY KAI!
BY FANG YA'EN, YE MENG

383
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,440
The two of you…

384
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,560
are really heartless.

385
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,200
Both walking out on me
and just leaving me behind.

386
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,080
Ya'en, my big sister.

387
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
Since I'm calling you sis,
let me ask you something.

388
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,160
What?

389
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,480
Ye Meng…

390
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,280
What's going on between her and Li Jinyu?

391
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,560
Here's your key, Ms. Ye.

392
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,000
Call if you need anything.

393
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,680
Why aren't we moving?
Did you forget how to drive?

394
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,480
I can drive.

395
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,160
I just haven't touched a car in forever.
Feels a little strange.

396
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,080
I'm trying to remember.

397
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,040
What's the first step?

398
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,040
Seatbelt.

399
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Obviously, I know about the seatbelt.

400
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,840
I mean, the first step to start the car.

401
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,480
The first step to start the car?

402
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,920
Do you even have a license?

403
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,920
I've been driving for ten years.

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,440
I told you, I just need
a second to get back into it.

405
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,920
You really love to talk.

406
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,320
Clutch.

407
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,360
Which one's the clutch? The middle or the…

408
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,920
The left.

409
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,800
- I was testing you. Of course, I know.
- Ignition.

410
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
Once I start the car, keep it down.

411
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,320
Don't distract me, okay?

412
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
I need to focus.

413
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,080
Fine.

414
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,000
Why'd you turn on the wipers?

415
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,800
Look at the windshield. It's filthy.

416
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
Ever heard of driving safely?

417
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,160
If I can't see the road,
how will we get home?

418
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,400
- Just go already.
- Stop breathing!

419
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,960
You're breathing so loud,
it's throwing me off.

420
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,040
You did it again! Now you're coughing?

421
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,640
I said no breathing. You cough instead.

422
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,360
Alright.

423
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,360
Let's see how many naps
I can take before I get home.

424
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,400
Nap?

425
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,960
As if you could with me driving.

426
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,000
- Just go.
- Come on.

427
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,680
Remind me again. How do I do this?

428
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,040
You haven't released the handbrake.

429
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,760
You told me not to talk.

430
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,680
Alright, alright. My mistake. Sorry.

431
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,040
Can you take the wheel?

432
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
- I don't know how to.
- Then how come you know it all?

433
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,600
Just go. Put it in gear.

434
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,720
Got it.

435
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,320
XINYI USED CAR

436
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,640
How do I open the convertible top?

437
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,160
No clue.

438
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,400
It's beautiful.

439
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Give me your phone.
I'll take a picture for you.

440
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,320
I don't like pictures.

441
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,840
Why not?

442
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,280
Feels pointless.

443
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,840
The sunset back home is really something.

444
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,960
Way prettier than Jiangbei.

445
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,480
Chen Jian said you left
because you couldn't hack it there.

446
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,000
Something like that.

447
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,960
And you? Why didn't you stay in Jiangbei?

448
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,600
Who told you I came back from there?

449
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,880
Your grandma.

450
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,200
Over there,

451
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,360
no matter what I did,
no one ever gave me credit.

452
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,240
Even if I did everything perfectly,
it still meant nothing. Pointless.

453
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,400
If people don't see your worth,
that's their problem.

454
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,960
Stop turning it on yourself.

455
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,160
Isn't this sunset beautiful?
Isn't it soothing?

456
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,240
Too bad it's over so quickly.

457
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,280
Then, enjoy it while it lasts.

458
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,200
Every moment counts.

459
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,760
Li Jinyu.

460
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,560
Do you have to kill the vibe
every time things get a little romantic?

461
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,640
That routine only works on Cheng Kairan.

462
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,760
He really seems to bother you.

463
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,120
For the record,
he only sees me as his big sister.

464
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,240
There is nothing more to it.

465
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,560
So, stop worrying.

466
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,360
I've liked Ye Meng for over ten years.
Do you even get that?

467
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
More than ten years.

468
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,080
Do you know what those years
have been like for me?

469
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,480
Keep your voice down.

470
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,240
There's only one thin layer between us.
One push and it'd be gone.

471
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,480
Do you get it?

472
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,680
I don't want to be just a little brother.
Why won't this bottle open?

473
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,200
Well…

474
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,240
Come on, Cheng Kairan.
Ease up on the drinks.

475
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,440
You've said the same thing
a dozen times already.

476
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,160
- I'm sick of hearing it.
- I want to see Ye Meng.

477
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,960
Not for revenge.

478
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,040
- Revenge?
- I just want to see her.

479
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,280
I just want to see her.

480
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,360
It's been years
since we graduated from high school.

481
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,920
You should really move on.

482
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,720
- Wipe it off.
- Okay.

483
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I can't.

484
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,360
Guess I deserve it.

485
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,800
I'm the one who owed her
from the start, didn't I?

486
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,240
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't even be the man I am now.

487
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,360
Every day, I imagine
standing in front of her.

488
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,000
But… But I…

489
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,760
But when it comes
to saying how I feel, I freeze.

490
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,720
Because if I say the words,

491
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,520
she might cut me off completely.

492
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,640
Cheng Kairan, to Ye Meng,

493
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,520
- you're only like a little brother.
- Then what about Li Jinyu?

494
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,040
What is Li Jinyu to her?

495
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,680
Tell me the truth.

496
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,200
- What's it got to do with you?
- No, no.

497
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,640
Tell me the truth. Does she like him?

498
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,560
Does she? Tell me.

499
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,800
What does he have that I don't?
What makes me less?

500
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,680
Fine. I've got a scar right here.

501
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,600
But what else?

502
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,600
- Alright, alright. You're handsome.
- Damn right I am.

503
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,560
Yeah, so handsome.

504
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,080
Then why?

505
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,239
Why not me?

506
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,760
Look at yourself right now.

507
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,239
You call yourself a big boss?
No one would believe it.

508
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,480
You're completely love-struck.

509
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,080
How could Ye Meng fall for you like this?

510
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,960
Honestly, just watching you all day
is enough to kill me

511
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,880
- with worry.
- Mom!

512
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,280
- I…
- Hey.

513
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
My son.

514
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,360
This is my son.

515
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,159
This is Uncle Cheng Kairan. Say hello.

516
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,520
- Hello, Uncle.
- Good.

517
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,000
Jiayu.

518
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,280
That's right, Jiayu.

519
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,719
Where do you think you're going?

520
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,760
Jiayu.

521
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,440
Send me your school location.

522
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,320
I'll have someone check it out tomorrow.

523
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
What are you doing?

524
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,639
If anyone dares to bully you, I will…

525
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,360
What century do you think this is?

526
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,000
Still playing gangster? It's ridiculous.

527
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,440
You've got some bite in your words.

528
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,800
Look whose son he is.

529
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,040
- He gets it from you.
- Mom.

530
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,360
Let's go.
Talking to drunks is a waste of breath.

531
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
- That's right. Let's go.
- You're just…

532
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,080
We're leaving.

533
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,160
- Ya'en.
- What?

534
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,560
Once a queen, always a queen.

535
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,400
- Come on. Get on.
- What are you doing?

536
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,880
I'll carry you home.

537
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,880
- Let me carry you.
- Cheng Kairan, enough.

538
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Stand up.

539
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,680
- On your feet.
- I'll carry you.

540
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,840
Stand up.

541
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,680
Had a few drinks, big deal.

542
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,920
Listen, don't go acting drunk
in front of my son!

543
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,360
Jiayu.

544
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,800
- Say goodbye to Uncle.
- Goodbye, Uncle.

545
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,600
Let's go.

546
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,160
Mom, careful.

547
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,320
And don't forget to recruit Li Jinyu back.

548
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,120
A grown man shouldn't be so petty.

549
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,040
It's exhausting.

550
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,040
Let's go.

551
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,400
- Wait…
- Don't say a word.

552
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
Careful now. Hold my hand.

553
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,640
Why are the headlights still on?

554
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,200
You may not drive,
but you sure know about cars.

555
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,040
This kid got talent to spare.

556
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,880
Come on.

557
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,280
Here comes Kai.

558
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,840
Why are you two coming back together?

559
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,640
Enjoy your reunion
with your little brother.

560
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,240
I'm out of here.

561
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,080
Say that one more time.

562
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,920
Are you hoping Cheng Kairan
takes a swing at me?

563
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,920
Or do you want to see us fight it out?

564
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,400
I said… Hey, you two…

565
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,080
Since when did you two hook up?

566
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,680
When I was at your bar.

567
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,840
Ye Meng,

568
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,480
there are plenty of decent men
in this town,

569
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,520
but you go and choose him?

570
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,160
No money, no power, no future.
Just a pretty face.

571
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,560
Exactly. I can't help it.

572
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,680
He's my type.

573
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
I'd pick him over you.

574
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,360
I always thought

575
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,520
you'd keep playing dumb forever.

576
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,080
But today, right now,

577
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
for this guy,

578
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,680
for Li Jinyu,

579
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,280
you're really willing
to come clean with me?

580
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,600
I am.

581
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,920
He keeps pushing me away

582
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,600
so he won't offend you.

583
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,440
Anything else?

584
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,760
If not, then stop coming around
just to hassle me.

585
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,280
Fine!

586
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,320
Perfect.

587
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
THE RISING SUN ILLUMINATES

588
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,680
He's gone.

589
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,280
Guess this human shield
can finally bow out in style.

590
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,440
You're not just a shield.

591
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,560
And if you ever take a beating
because of me,

592
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,440
I'll repay it with my life.

593
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,880
MOMENTS

594
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,440
BY DAY, SAPPHIRE MEDITATION LOUNGE
BY NIGHT, RUBY PASSION MATRIX

595
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,080
LEMONGRASS

596
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,920
LIFE, CITY NEON

597
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,880
<i>See?</i>

598
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,720
It stings a little,

599
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,160
but scars can be smoothed out.

600
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,560
If you let them.

601
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,040
YE MENG

602
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,040
<i>Spacing out on the balcony again?</i>

603
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,600
<i>Now hiring one all-purpose handyman.</i>

604
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,160
<i>Sir,</i>

605
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,080
<i>ready to start tomorrow?</i>

606
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
<i>My hourly rate's no joke.</i>

607
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,560
<i>Name your price. I've got money to burn.</i>

608
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,200
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

609
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,000
Other than singing,

610
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,520
what else can you do?

611
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,880
I play guitar.

612
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,760
Drums?

613
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,200
No.

614
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,080
He's gorgeous.

615
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,880
Is he the bar singer here?

616
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,480
He could debut as an idol.

617
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,320
Hey, cutie, can I add your WeChat?

618
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,480
Sorry, I don't add strangers.

619
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,600
Let me buy you a drink.

620
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,840
- No need.
- Fine, then.

621
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,480
Ladies, you can always follow our--

622
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,480
No, thanks.

623
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,640
You, um… Give me a smile.

624
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,760
Perfect.

625
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,000
Starting tomorrow,

626
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,040
you're hired.

627
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,040
But we've got KPIs.

628
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,920
You've got to add
ten new WeChat contacts every day.

629
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,720
Post our ads on your Moments.

630
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,960
And there's a liquor sales quota
every month.

631
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,000
Think you can manage that?

632
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,440
Sure.

633
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,760
Good!

634
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,600
And…

635
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,720
That face is about to steal my thunder.

636
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,720
