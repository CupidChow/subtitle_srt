 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:11,794
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

3
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:15,308
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

4
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:20,693
 ♫ With a sense of excitement You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:25,774
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:31,122
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:34,610
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,174
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:42,806
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:48,778
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:53,914
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,914 --> 00:01:01,094
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

13
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:05,994
 ♫ All I possess is drowned The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

14
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:11,258
 ♫ Has never changed If miracles could exist ♫ 

15
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:15,341
 ♫ Promises would be kept Please remember ♫ 

16
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:20,333
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

17
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:26,994
   

18
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:29,950
   

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,320
I used to prefer younger guys.

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,180
But I returned to reality
after the Spring Festival.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,960
- Here comes your dishes. 
 - Thank you.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:55,840

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Say something.

24
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,480
I asked you out today

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,360
because I needed your help with Jia Yu's homework.

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,800
Who asked you about that?

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,400
They're badmouthing younger men.
Don't you have any rebuttals?

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,060
Dig in.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,020
Women do mature faster than men of the same age.

30
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,180
Younger guys are too playful,
not suitable for long-term relationships.

31
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,740
He says we're immature.

32
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,300
An independent woman like you, Ms. Ye,

33
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,420
should go for a mature man,
maybe one year older than you, who's emotionally stable

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,700
and can support you financially.

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,440
Listen, bro. Youth means vitality.

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,140
Nowadays, older women prefer younger guys.

37
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,300
Who wants a lifeless guy with dead fish eyes?

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,020
Not you specifically. I mean.

39
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,360
Being older doesn't guarantee emotional stability.

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,660
Especially the ones wearing glasses.
Just thinking about it is disturbing.

41
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,080
I-I get your point, Dr. Gao.

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,500
You mean, compared to younger men,

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,040
older men might be better problem-solvers.

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,760
- Yeah.
- It's about personality.

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,320
Not age. Younger guys are sincere and passionate.

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,040
Older men are just cheesy schemers.

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,540
Not all older men are cheesy.

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,280
Younger men can also be mature and considerate.

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,560
Younger ones lack experience in caring for others. You have to admit that.

50
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,200
Is it worth boasting
if someone has many relationships?

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,360
That's not what I mean.
I'm saying young guys can't care for others.

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,700
We can take care of people, too.

53
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,480
What does it have to do with you?
We're just talking. This is ridiculous.

54
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,160
It's fine. Let's just eat.

55
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,760
You moved away fast for an old guy, huh?

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,140
Are you done?

57
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,120
- Just a discussion. 
 - This debate is pointless.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,460
Ms. Ye deserves someone with
matching education,

59
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,600
refinement, and upbringing for a promising future.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,660
Just say it. You think you're so educated.

61
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,520
That's why you're looking down
on us high school graduates?

62
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
Not at all.

63
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,640
Knowledge is not wisdom.

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,480
Refinement doesn't mean good character.

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,400
Good upbringing doesn't guarantee

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,420
- a promising future. 
 - Enough!

67
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,500
Stop making a scene.

68
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,160
Sorry, my friend's been sensitive lately.

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,500
You touched a nerve, so...

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,960
What nerve? I'm not sensitive at all--

71
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
That's enough. Both of you.

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,160
Stop bullying Dr. Gao.

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,640
Young guys like us
listen to the ladies. Learn from us.

74
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,160
- Sit down. 
 - Okay.

75
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,180
- Sorry about that, Dr. Gao. 
 - It's fine.

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,500
Dig in.

77
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,420
I have no appetite.

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,520
Dig in. Thank you.

79
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,540
- I've paid. Thank you. 
 - Take care.

80
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,680
Ya En.

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,980
Why is he here?

82
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,520
Aren't you Ye Meng's blind date from the wedding?

83
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
Hello.

84
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,160
They're on a date.
Don't be the third wheel. Come with me.

85
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,580
Why should I? What do you want?

86
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,860
I'm just thinking about
getting an education insurance for our son.

87
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,000
My colleagues are talking about it.
So I got tempted.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,320
Are you here to talk about the insurance or to show off your new car?

89
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,200
Isn't it normal for businessmen to change cars?

90
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,020
Ye Meng, you're her best friend.
Talk some sense into her.

91
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,840
What did I say last time? It's harsh, but true.

92
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
It's better to date someone with a job.

93
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,920
Wait, I just hoped to be Ms. Ye's backup option.

94
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,740
Being her backup shows that I'm decent enough.

95
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,960
You're being too modest.

96
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,380
With your credentials,
you'd top Ningsui's marriage market.

97
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,600
Anything else?

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,520
If you want to be a good father,
go reflect on yourself.

99
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,140
Be there for Jia Yu when he needs you.

100
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,480
What right do you have to criticize me?

101
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,740
You left the kid alone at home while partying.

102
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,940
Who left the kid alone?

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,100
Does it look like a party to you?

104
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,840
Can't I just have dinner out?
Only you get to dine out, huh?

105
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,600
Why are you judging me?

106
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,280
You're dining out with friends.
How is it not a party?

107
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,840
I'm eating out alone--

108
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,900
That's enough.

109
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,620
Step aside already. So annoying.

110
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,980
We're having fun here. Don't ruin the mood.

111
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,840
Chen Jian, visit Jia Yu
at his grandma's if you care.

112
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,520
Stop pestering us.

113
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,800
Keep hanging with these losers.
You'll corrupt our son.

114
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,280
What happened to my car?

115
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,130
Who did this?

116
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,180
Which asshole? Who was it?

117
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,900
Let's sit somewhere else.

118
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,900
- At my place?
- Sure.

119
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,800
- Shall we? 
 - Let's go.

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,775
Let's go.

121
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,720
 

122
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,160
Car wash fee? Like I need your money.

123
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,720
Audi has four rings.
Yours has four rotten eggs. Is it customized?

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,580
Wash it off. Or it won't come off once it dries.

125
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,500
- Kai, your bar's doing well. 
 - Not bad.

126
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,420
Mai.

127
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,600
Mai.

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,080
Dr. Gao, order whatever you want. My treat today.

129
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,720
Okay.

130
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,940
- I'll make a call.
- Alright.

131
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,460
Ya En, Ye Meng, long time no see.

132
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,520
- Sit. I'll get the menu.
- Alright.

133
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm going to the restroom.

134
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,560
Mai, what are you doing these days?
Want a side gig?

135
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,200
- Sure. What is it?
- I'll text you.

136
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,460
Okay. Thanks.

137
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,960
Come on.

138
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,760
How much is the car wash fee?

139
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,380
No need. It's nothing.

140
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,240
Come on, you love splitting bills.

141
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,920
Where were you? Dr. Gao's here with Ye Meng.

142
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,800
You like the music? I'm dying to know your taste.

143
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,020
With all due respect.

144
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,240
Make a move, or you'll end up being the best man.

145
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,020
Dr. Gao, do you work out?

146
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,440
Whenever I'm not in surgery, yes.

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,400
And you, Ms. Ye?

148
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,740
Do you work out?

149
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,920
Not really. I jog occasionally.

150
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,160
Good evening. Thanks for coming.

151
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,700
I'd like to sing a special song tonight.

152
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,340
Someone very important to me sang it for me.

153
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,040
She got drunk that night and said many things.

154
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:19,410
 Li Jin Yu, if anyone
calls you unworthy, 

155
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,500
 send them to me. 

156
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,840
 From now on, let me fight battles for you. 

157
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,120
I wonder if she still remembers.

158
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:58,630
 ♫ Your eyes ♫ 

159
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:04,544
 ♫ Are like meteors in the dark night ♫ 

160
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:13,208
 ♫ Streaking across the icy border ♫ 

161
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,536
 ♫ Reaching the depths of my heart ♫ 

162
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:19,388
 ♫ Just like this, you conquer me ♫ 

163
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:25,393
 ♫ The black goldfish ♫ 

164
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:32,029
 ♫ Got stranded in the desert ♫ 

165
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:40,540
 ♫ Even if all memories fade ♫ 

166
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,960
 ♫ I can't erase ♫

 ♫ Your figure in my mind ♫

 ♫ Every time I look at you ♫ 

169

 ♫ I want to get closer ♫ 

170

 ♫ Don't doubt ♫ 

181
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,480
Judging from what Li Jin Yu's dong,
I'm sure he's into you.

182
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,340
I'm tired.

183
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,280
I'll head back home now.

184
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,810
 

185
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,280
Thanks. One more sesame ball and soybean milk.

186
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,980
Coming right up.

187
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,040
I've paid.

188
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,080
Alright. Enjoy.

189
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,660
I won't go hiking. It's tiring.

190
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,440
Here's your order, miss. Enjoy.

191
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,140
Thanks.

192
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,260
The beach sounds nice. Let's watch the sunset.

193
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,280
What are you doing?

194
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,340
Changing the water for your goldfish.

195
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,540
Why did you take it out?

196
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,900
I'm putting them in the sun
to prevent black spot disease.

197
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,820
How do you know they have black spot disease?

198
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,040
Ye Meng told me when she asked
if I wanted a part-time job.

199
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,740
I thought it was some real job,
but she's just paying me

200
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,240
to come change the water
and let your goldfish get more sun.

201
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,920
She said goldfish get black spots
mainly from poor water quality

202
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,460
and lack of sunlight.

203
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,840
Look at your little black fish.
It's livelier after just some sun exposure.

204
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,800
I need to check in with Ye Meng.

205
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:21,560
 

206
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,220
Where did she go? Her photos look amazing.

207
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,940
 The beach sounds nice. Let's watch the sunset. 

208
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,640
See? I'm the master matchmaker.

209
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,280
 I used to prefer younger guys. 

210
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,320
 But I returned to reality
after the Spring Festival. 

211
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,060
Li Jin Yu.

212
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,680
What are you doing?

213
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,200
I thought you had left.

214
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,820
Do you own this beach?
Can't I come back after leaving?

215
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,810
Why did you come back?

216
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,900
Were you worried that I'd jump in?

217
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,680
No, I came to kill you
because my love turned into hatred.

218
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,610
Ye Meng,

219
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,040
will you still date me?

220
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:49,288
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

221
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:56,368

229
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,640
You can ride a bike, right?

230
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,860
Yeah.

231
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,760
Then take that one.

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,580
Can you slow down?

237
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,480
You can't catch up with me with that stamina.

238

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,040
What's wrong?

242
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,520
Nothing.

243
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,760
Is the battery dead?

244
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,520
I guess it's broken.

245
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,000
- Let me push it. 
 - No need. I got this.

246
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,920
You sure you don't need help?

247
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,340
Fine, you do it.

248
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,300
Hurry up. Or we'll be out here all night.

249
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,580
You're walking too fast. So energetic.

250
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:22,240
I sprained my wrist.
And my knee hurts. I can't walk.

251
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,340
So?

252
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,580
Give me your hand. Fee for the ride.

253
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,480
- I'll sit on the bike. 
 - You're awful, putting extra weight on the bike.

254
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,140
You're being gentlemanly.
And I paid for the ride. Let's go.

255
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,760
- Fine.
- Thanks.

256
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,720
It's not my fault if you fall.

257
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,760
- You did this on purpose.
- No.

258
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,580
I'm not getting off. Period.

259
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,720
What's the rush?

260
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,340
- I'm going to bed. Goodnight. 
 - Wait.

261
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,200
Ye Meng, can you stop being mad at me?

262
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
I'm not mad at you.

263
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,060
You clearly are.

264
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,440
I just don't want to talk to you right now.

265
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,700
Fine. If you don't want to talk to me,

266
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,000
take back the goldfish you left at my place.

267
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,720
Fine, I'll take them.

268
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,720
- Where's the camera on Ping An?
- It's lost.

269
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,140
Is it lost? Or did you throw it away?

270
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,730
Alright, you're cutting all ties, huh?

271
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,340
You even threw away what I left for Ping An.

272
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,000
Give me a box. I'm taking my goldfish.

273
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,820
Are you really ditching me?

274
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,540
You rejected me first.

275
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,200
But I regret it now.

276
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,540
Stop playing the victim card. It won't work.

277
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,940
Li Jin Yu, what are you doing?

278
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,650
So proactive suddenly? Is it because of Dr. Gao?

279
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,710
When will you end things with Dr. Gao?

280
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,510
What if I don't?

281
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,610
It's fine anyway. He's too busy as a doctor.

282
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,070
I don't have a steady job.
So I'm always available when you need me.

283
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,010
Your mindset is really problematic.

284
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:24,210
Did you ask Qiao Mai Mai
to change the water for the goldfish?

285
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,870
So a goldfish saved my dying relationship.

286
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,810
I was the one being saved.

287
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,070
You sound sentimental.

288
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,200
I've always thought I'm a loser.

289
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,970
I don't want to drag you down.

290
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:09,420
Being a loser isn't bad.
I enjoy being a loser somewhere alone.

291
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,070
Nobody cares or gossips about me.

292
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,370
I can't be as carefree as you.

293
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,994
At least I can't get fat or ugly.

294
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:30,170
Because you're shallow
and only care about appearances.

295
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,350
How could I seduce you if I became ugly?

296
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,910
When did you seduce me?

297
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,050
Right now.

298
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,250
Listen.

299
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,210
To what?

300
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,170
Close your eyes.

on our first day together, huh?

324
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,930
I'll pull out all your flowers.

325
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:43,690
Go ahead. You're experienced. You've done it once.

326
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,290
What?

327
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,870
Those flowers froze to death
during the Spring Festival.

328
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:56,310
You think I pulled them out because of you?

329
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:03,210
Were you bothered and couldn't sleep at night?

330
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,810
No.

331
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,770
When did you fall for me?
When did you start caring about me?

332
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:13,550
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to shower before visiting Grandma.

333
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:19,510
You're nervous. Answer me. I'm curious.

334
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,210
What?

335
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,790
Why are you showering again?
Didn't you shower last night?

336
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,570
- I care about hygiene, okay? 
 - Yeah, you care about hygiene.

337
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,610
Like others don't. I also shower every day.

338
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,490
The bathroom door's broken.

339
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,890
No peeking.

340
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,270
I'm not a pervert. Why would I peek?

341
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,250
Don't take it off.

342
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,790
It already fell off. Sorry.

343
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,230
Fine.

344
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,970
Li Jin Yu, what was your problem last night?

345
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,210
 What's wrong? 

346
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,720
 Should we be careful about... 

347
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,320
 well... 

348
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,170
 Li Jin Yu, 

349
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,450
 are you nervous? 

350
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,910
 Nervous? 

351
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,030
 No way. Why would I be nervous? 

352
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,350
 I'll take a shower first. 

353
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,650
 You are nervous. 

354
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:15,830
How come you're so bold?
Didn't anyone tell you to be less forward?

355
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,010
I'm bold because I'm older and more experienced.

356
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,270
Why are two goldfish missing?

357
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,970
I isolated the two
with black spot disease for treatment.

358
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,970
They'll rejoin the family after recovery.

359
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,714
I regret it now. I should have gotten you
a different birthday gift.

360
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:49,530
Like what?

361
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,870
Like a turtle, healthy,
long-lived, and easy to care for.

362
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,930
Then you wouldn't have pushed me away.

363
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:01,922
You're so full of yourself.
How'd you know it was because of that?

364
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:05,490
Because I'm smart and know everything.

365
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,250
What do you know?

366
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,410
 How's it with Ye Meng?
She's really not returning to Jiangbei? 

367
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,750
- Still contacting your ex?
- No.

368
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,090
- Then why is she contacting you? 
 - I never replied.

369
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,190
- I don't believe that. 
 - Let me show you.

370
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,070
No, thanks. You must have deleted the messages.

371
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,870
You think I could delete them that fast?

372
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,090
- Come to the market with me. 
 - What for?

373
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,490
No more questions. Get dressed. Hurry.

374
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,550
I'll keep the goldfish. You take care of this.

375
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,350
I think you're implying something.

376
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,210
Aren't you with Jiang Lu Zhi?
This gift is symbolic.

377
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,810
- I'll take this one, please. 
 - Okay, 45 yuan.

378
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,410
Besides, you'd break up with me over a goldfish.

379
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,350
I should get you something easy to keep,
even for the sake of our relationship.

380
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,370
That's enough. I've paid.

381
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,250
- Okay.
- Take it.

382
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,870
I should make it up to you. Let's go on a date.

383
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,550
Treat me to a movie, and I'll buy you dinner.

384
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,610
Salmon, steak, or the biggest
chain restaurant in town?

385
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,390
- The biggest chain restaurant. 
 - You sure?

386
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,750
Let's go for Braised Chicken Rice then.

387
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,730
Is it too late to switch to salmon?

388
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,510
Hello?

389
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,970
 Chen Jian's coming to the shop.
Take Jia Yu out for a bit. 

390
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,170
 Bring him back after Chen Jian leaves. 

391
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,690
What's he up to now?

392
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,790
 He's pestering me
because he doesn't want the divorce. 

393
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,210
Alright. I'm on my way.

394
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,110
- What's wrong? 
 - Let's go.

395
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,130
I'll treat you to a kids' meal.

396
00:33:09,598 --> 00:33:14,330
 

397
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,830
Amusement park again? I'm way too old for this.

398
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,370
- How old are you? 
 - I'm eight years old.

399
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,110
Eight-year-olds love amusement parks. Let's go.

400
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,410
No way. I'm not going.

401
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,210
Come on.

402
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,570
So cute.

403
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,030
- Come. 
 - I'm not going. It's scary.

404
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,630
Ready. Three, two... Jia Yu, smile!

405
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,130
- Take a photo for us. 
 - Take our picture.

406
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,770
- What's next?
- Your call.

407
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,490
Haunted house.

408
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,270
I'm too young to keep up.
Go ahead. I'll just chill here.

409
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:35,190
Chen Jia Yu, this is an amusement park.

410
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,890
He's scared of ghosts?

411
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:41,090
Are you afraid of ghosts?

412
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,970
Nonsense. Take care of my childish godmother.

413
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:50,350
I recommend the Ferris wheel.
It's more romantic and private.

414
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,490
I won't third-wheel you guys anymore.

415
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,890
Oh, call me if you need photos taken.

416
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,630
Ya En must figure out
what books this kid's been reading.

417
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,410
I can hear you.

418
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,830
Fine. Wait there. We'll be right back.

419
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,990
Go ahead.

420
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,690
Bye.

421
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,910
- Let's go. 
 - Where are you going?

422
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,830
- You think it's a real date? 
 - Isn't it?

423
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,950
What about the kid?
I won't let you take care of our baby.

424
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,490
Let's get some water.

425
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,090
Okay.

426
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,790
Wang Si Si? It really is you.

427
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,730
Why are you alone at the amusement park?

428
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,870
I'm here for fun. What about you?

429
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,830
Me? I was dragged here against my will.

430
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:52,190
Wang Si Si, why did you
glue teardrops on your mask?

431
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,230
Because I feel like the Little Mermaid.
She lives underwater.

432
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,790
But people see her tears when she's on land.

433
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,410
School's starting soon. I hate school.

434
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,530
I don't like people seeing my tears.

435
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,010
Have you told your parents and teachers?

436
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:16,050
I told Mom, but she's too busy making money

437
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,350
for my little brother to care about me.

438
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:25,590
I'm scared she will scold me and stop loving me.

439
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,870
So I stopped talking about it.

440
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,790
No way. Your mom definitely loves you.

441
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,250
It's you. Grim Reaper.

442
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,570
Did you tell your mom why you hate school?

443
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:48,790
Every time I try, she yells at me.

444
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,890
That makes me even sadder.

445
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,070
Grim Reaper, do you have any candy?

446
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,810
Can we still play the guessing game
with candy in pockets?

447
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:04,050
Let's play a different game today.
We have other friends here.

448
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,750
Alright.

449
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,790
I think your mask design is great.

450
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,430
Keep wearing it all the way home.

451
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,450
Your mom will notice it when you get home.

452
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,790
Then you can tell her why you made it this way.

453
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:24,090
But wearing a mask is weird. People will stare.

454
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:28,050
Don't worry. We'll join you and wear masks.

455
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,990
With the mask on,
you can make any expression you want.

456
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,870
Feel free to cry and laugh.

457
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,350
Whoever removes their mask gets eliminated.

458
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,710
It's a competition.

459
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,090
Come on.

460
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,210
This is for you. Grab one for me.

461
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,670
What color do you want? What're you making now?

462
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,930
Si Si, are you tired?

463
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,630
No.

464
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,990
Thank you for looking after my daughter.

465
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,390
How could you run off without telling me?
I've been searching everywhere.

466
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,430
It's okay. Si Si is a good girl.

467
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:21,750
Si Si, don't forget
what you wanted to tell your mom.

468
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,090
Bye, big brother and sister.

469
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,830
- Bye.
- Bye.

470
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,930
Is Si Si...

471
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,090
Kids can be very sentimental.

472
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:40,730
If their parents could notice the problem,
the kids would be better soon.

473
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:47,150
I regret it. I should've
painted mine as a clown like you did.

474
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,030
Yours looks nice. It's like a sunny day.

475
00:38:54,010 --> 00:39:01,230
You know what? You're even better than I imagined.

476
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,670
Really?

477
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,470
Yeah.

478
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,210
Jia Yu's back.

479
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,950
- Where is Wang Si Si? 
 - She left. Her mom picked her up.

480
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,870
Here.

481
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,430
Want to head back first?

482
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,730
I'll take Jia Yu to a bubble tea shop

483
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,930
to do homework, and walk him home.

484
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,710
No, since we came together,
we should leave together.

485
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,830
Someone's picking him up.

486
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,630
Who?

487
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,670
What's the emergency?

488
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,790
Pick him up.

489
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,730
Him?

490
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,990
Let's go.

491
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,870
That tutoring will come in handy.

492
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,750
You studied?

493
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,930
No, don't listen to him.

494
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,850
- Why did you get tutoring?
- It's my hobby.

495
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,030
Let's go, too.

496
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,100
I like the Olympiad. Let me teach you.

497
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,177
I've finished all those exercises already.

498
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,350
Why'd you come up?

499
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,050
To keep you company. It's chilly.

500
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,650
Come on.

501
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,630
What's on your mind?

502
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,930
Can I ask you something?

503
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,470
Go ahead.

504
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:41,090
I wasn't your boyfriend, but now I am.
So, I'm entitled to ask you this.

505
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,570
What is it?

506
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,430
How many ex-boyfriends do you have?

507
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,370
Three.

508
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,670
I don't believe you.

509
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,570
Will you stop being jealous for no reason?

510
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,950
I know I'm experienced,
and it's your first relationship.

511
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,650
But if I'd known you existed,

512
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,190
I'd have crawled through fire to reach you.

513
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:09,870
You're so good at sweet-talking me.
Only three exes? I don't buy it.

514
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,690
Here's your chance to come clean.

515
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,260
Six.

516
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,310
Actually, nine.

517
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,890
Sorry, ten.

518
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,470
Are we playing rock-paper-scissors?

519
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,930
Just kidding. I've only dated three guys.

520
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,090
For real?

521
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,130
Yeah, I swear.

522
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,050
Gou Kai included?

523
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,670
Of course not. Why would I
date a scheming businessman?

524
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:52,150
But it's weird how much you care about Gou Kai.

525
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,190
I'm still not over that photo.

526
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:01,790
Didn't he say he'll come to pick you up
after the Spring Festival?

527
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:07,490
It was a team photo.
Besides, who said I'd go with him?

528
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,490
I won't even show up. You'll tell him to get lost.

529
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,930
- Happy now?
- Kind of.

530
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,910
Did I do well? Proper attitude, right?

531
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,890
How about you?

532
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,350
Right. First love. I forgot.

533
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,350
You knew.

534
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,630
I care about this.

535
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,770
But something just occurred to me.

536
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,890
What is it?

537
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:37,450
Explain your relationship with Jiang Lu Zhi.

538
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,350
Jiang Lu Zhi wasn't my girlfriend.

539
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,270
Then what was she? Tell me.

540
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:47,530
Grandma kept urging me to get married.
So I lied about dating Jiang Lu Zhi.

541
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,130
We only met once.

542
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,630
No way. You were pursuing her.

543
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,890
Why did you act so cold when I pursued you?

544
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,350
- Why...
- And you were mean.

545
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,830
It's totally different.

546
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,270
How? Explain now.

547
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,970
Different how? Tell me.

548
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,350
I couldn't fake it with you
to lie to Grandma, right?

549
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,010
Why not?

550
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,570
Because I like you.

551
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:15,430
Say it to the sun.

552
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,610
Getting cold? Here, cover yourself.

553
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,890
Say it to the sun.

554
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,790
By the way, what were you doing
with Dr. Gao at the lighthouse?

555
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,150
With Dr. Gao? What do you mean?

556
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,690
The day you posted those photos.

557
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,790
I have no idea.

558
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,750
 - Gorgeous. Relax.
- Really? 

559
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,930
 Turn to the side. Hold still.
I'll make your legs look longer. 

560
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,930
 Three, two, one. Go. 

561
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,410
 Got it. Oh my. 

562
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,570
 - Really?
- Look. 

563
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,110
 All looking good, right? 

564
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,570
 - Perfect.
- I'll send them to you. 

565
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,450
 - Yeah.
- Come on. 

566
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,000
 They don't even need editing. 

567
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,050
 - Impressive, you've improved.
- Right? 

568
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,530
 - Shouldn't you pick up the kid?
- It's the weekend. 

569
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,810
 - I'll stay. Go home.
- I'll keep you company. 

570
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,570
 Keep Jia Yu company. I'm fine here. Go. 

571
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,150
 - Come on.
- Get going. 

572
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,750
 What? 

573
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:21,440
 

574
00:44:23,123 --> 00:44:27,040
 

575
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:37,050
