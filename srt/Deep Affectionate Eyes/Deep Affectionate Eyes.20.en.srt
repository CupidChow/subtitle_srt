ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>DEEP AFFECTION EYES</i>
BY ER DONG TU ZI ON JJWXC.NET

2
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,040
I haven't felt this happy in ages.

3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,760
Yeah.

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
What…

5
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,160
are your plans after this?

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,320
No plans.

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,960
I find life pretty relaxed now.

8
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,000
No more weird complications.

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,400
As for the future,
I'll take it one step at a time.

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,880
You're all set
to start a new life. You're…

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,440
not interested in a new relationship?

12
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm getting older.
Can't muster the energy anymore.

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,720
Honestly, I think

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,920
men are putting up
all the limits for women. Tired of it.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,280
Right now, I'm truly enjoying
this free-spirited happiness.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,760
Look. Freedom with my time,

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,680
freedom to choose,

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,520
and most importantly,
freedom with my emotions.

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,960
That's why I don't want
to go back to that kind of hardship.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,680
And just to be clear,
this isn't aimed at all men.

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,280
Kai, you're genuinely a good person.

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,960
And I'm truly, deeply grateful

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,360
for how you've cared for
and helped me and Jiayu all this time.

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,720
What are you doing?

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Well, seatbelt…

26
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,040
Seatbelt. My seatbelt…

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,920
- What's wrong with the seatbelt?
- It's… It's broken.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
- What's broken?
- Yours is broken.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,160
Where is it broken?

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,640
It's working.

31
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,600
It's suddenly working.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,880
- Get moving now!
- Okay.

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,880
Bye. Drive safe.

34
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,040
Fang Ya'en!

35
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,760
Happy divorce!

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,920
Just go already.

37
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,920
Jinyu, you're here.

38
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,320
Didn't we agree to discuss
the Hailan Port Phase III project?

39
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,320
Why are you the only one here?

40
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,160
Someone else will be here soon.

41
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,880
But before we get down to business,

42
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,800
I need to speak with you alone.

43
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
What is it about?

44
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,960
Jinyu,

45
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,880
I like you.

46
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,640
Back then, to be closer to you,

47
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,200
I cheered for you
outside the track when you raced.

48
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,200
When you played basketball until midnight,

49
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,720
I stayed with you until midnight.

50
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,760
All these years,
my feelings haven't changed at all.

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
Don't you like me even a little?

52
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
I came to discuss the project.

53
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,680
If it's about anything else,
let's drop it.

54
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,280
I refuse.

55
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,520
Auntie sent me here

56
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
for our arranged marriage.

57
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,360
Jinyu, I know you love to play

58
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,760
and want freedom.

59
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
I've thought it through.

60
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,920
After we marry,

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
I'd never interfere with your freedom.

62
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,520
I'll be the obedient,
understanding perfect wife.

63
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,360
Just let us be together.

64
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,560
The arranged marriage was
my mom's decision. Nothing to do with me.

65
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
I have matters to attend to. Leaving now.

66
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,920
- Not happening.
- Let go.

67
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,160
Jinyu,

68
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,400
this is President Ye Kang
from our project's cooperative bank.

69
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,240
What a coincidence.

70
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,280
President Ye Kang's daughter
also works at Hailan Port.

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,440
Ye Meng, to be exact.

72
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
Manager Ye actually
accompanied Mr. Li and me

73
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
on a tour around Ningsui
just the other day.

74
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,160
President Ye Kang,

75
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,800
this is Mr. Li, Li Jinyu,

76
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,840
the lead of our Hailan Port project.

77
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
- Hello.
- Sorry.

78
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
I need to use the restroom.

79
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,840
Lin Yangyang,

80
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,760
you're much smarter than I imagined.

81
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
Jinyu,

82
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,280
what are you talking about?

83
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
But petty cleverness is useless.

84
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,040
You should focus your energy

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
on understanding the project better.

86
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,720
You've searched everywhere possible?

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,080
Everywhere.

88
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Any updates?

89
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,600
You're here.

90
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,400
Did you find any clues?

91
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,960
This guy's counter-surveillance skills
are too strong.

92
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,920
Not a single trace.

93
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,680
Jinyu's here.

94
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,680
You two keep searching.

95
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Call if anything comes up.

96
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,400
- Okay.
- Got it.

97
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,760
Why the long face again?

98
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,120
Did you and Ye Meng have another fight?

99
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,160
Can't you wish me well?

100
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,880
Ye Meng's dad is back,

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,120
and he caught me

102
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,760
having dinner with Lin Yangyang today.

103
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,600
The worst part is
I couldn't explain myself

104
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
in front of Lin Yangyang.

105
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,320
So, now he thinks

106
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,480
I'm the scumbag

107
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
who deceived his daughter.

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,760
Uncle Ye's actually spot-on about people.

109
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,600
Now,

110
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,160
you're practically caught red-handed.

111
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,480
You can't clear your name now.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,720
This is tough to handle.

113
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,880
What's that supposed to mean?

114
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,960
You came to me today

115
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,679
because you want your strategist
to give you some ideas, right?

116
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,640
Now that you're so wealthy,

117
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,200
I can't keep providing free services.

118
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,919
Why so confident?

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
When have you ever helped
without making things worse?

120
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,640
This time, think carefully.

121
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,320
I've been running to Ye Meng's house
since childhood,

122
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,040
saw Uncle Ye plenty.

123
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,240
My combat experience is through the roof.

124
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,720
If you can't handle it,
I'll go to Gou Kai.

125
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,480
At least he pays me 250.

126
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,560
Fine. I'll pay.

127
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,080
Transfer done.

128
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,920
8.88 YUAN, PLEASE CONFIRM RECEIPT

129
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
Seriously, bro? You're still this stingy?

130
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,800
You're loaded now but only

131
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
gave 8.88?

132
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,080
Take it or I'm canceling it.

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,520
RECEIVING

134
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,880
Got it.

135
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Let me show you how it's done.

136
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,880
Uncle Ye works at a bank.

137
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,080
Throwing money at him won't work.

138
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,160
Tell me something I don't know.

139
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,520
Enough setup. Just say it already.

140
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,280
Uncle Ye

141
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,200
has a soft spot for kids
who graduated from top-tier universities.

142
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,840
He really values academic excellence.

143
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,720
Your…

144
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,720
high school background won't cut it.

145
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,920
Go get yourself a diploma

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,480
from one of the first-class universities.

147
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,360
So, this is your brilliant idea?

148
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,360
Seriously, bro, can you be
even the slightest bit useful?

149
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,920
This is totally solid!

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
If you can't manage it,
I'll take you there myself.

151
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,960
Forget it. I've finally figured it out.

152
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,760
Ye Meng's dad just doesn't like you.
It has nothing to do with your education.

153
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,440
Look who's talking.

154
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,400
Why don't you just ask Ye Meng directly?

155
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,400
She definitely knows her dad best.

156
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,480
Right now,
she's having dinner with her dad.

157
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,960
I just hope
I can still get through the door

158
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
when I go back tonight.

159
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Brothers from the inside.
Good luck. You're on your own.

160
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,720
Wait, what do you mean by that?

161
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,760
Give me my money back.

162
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,600
Is there any
financial transaction between us?

163
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,440
You're ridiculous.
Who do you think you are?

164
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,080
Honey, you're back.

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,400
I bought a bunch
of your favorite fruits today.

166
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
Cut them up myself.

167
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,680
Here, try some.

168
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
You must be tired after the long day.

169
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,520
Have some water.

170
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,120
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

171
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,760
I actually brought some fruit back too.
Here, try some.

172
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,560
Here.

173
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,080
Oh, durian?

174
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,480
You don't even like durian.

175
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,760
Why did you buy it?

176
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,360
Your father-in-law
asked me to bring it back.

177
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,720
Said our home could use one.

178
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,560
Honey, this…

179
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,320
We already have a washboard at home.

180
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,440
Even a keyboard
would work if needed, right?

181
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,600
This…

182
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,800
really isn't necessary.

183
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,320
A washboard doesn't leave
a lasting impression.

184
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,680
This does.

185
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,880
Did Dad tell you everything?

186
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,240
He told me it was quite the scene.

187
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,680
Not just a confession,
but also a high-society arranged marriage.

188
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
My dad doesn't usually watch dramas,

189
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
but he said
it was more entertaining than any show.

190
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
A father-in-law judging his son-in-law

191
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,280
was already like facing
a rival who "stole" his daughter.

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,360
But this time, I'm completely done for.

193
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,480
Honey.

194
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,600
I was wrong.

195
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,280
Do you think you could help me?

196
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,160
Help me salvage my image

197
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
in front of your dad?

198
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,840
Otherwise, if he forces us to divorce,
I'd be so wronged.

199
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
If it really comes to it,

200
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll deal with this durian.

201
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,600
I…

202
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
I'm putting it down.

203
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,280
I'm going to plead guilty
and ask for punishment.

204
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,480
Aren't you going to stop me?

205
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,760
Why would I stop you?

206
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,320
Where exactly does this thing even hurt?

207
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,280
It'll hurt your hand. Is it bleeding?

208
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,520
I was wrong.

209
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,880
What exactly were you wrong about?

210
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,040
I was wrong about everything.

211
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,320
Please, help me out.

212
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,240
Alright.

213
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,760
If you really want to win over my dad,

214
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,800
you need to start
with his hobbies and interests.

215
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,760
Hobbies and interests?

216
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,960
Dad.

217
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,080
Dad,

218
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,040
I heard from Ye Meng
that you really enjoy fishing.

219
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,880
I specially prepared some bait for you.

220
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,320
Would you like to give it a try?

221
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,760
I'm sorry,
but our bank has strict policies.

222
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,880
We can't accept gifts.

223
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,080
We're family.

224
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,320
This is just a son-in-law

225
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,920
showing respect to his father-in-law.

226
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,760
How did you set up the fishing spot?

227
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,560
I use precision baiting,

228
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,520
keeping the groundbait
and hookbait separate.

229
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,800
Well,

230
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,400
fish won't easily swim
to the center of the bait zone.

231
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm using black rice
mixed with bloodworms.

232
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,920
Maybe you should give it a try too?

233
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,600
Black rice and bloodworms?

234
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,880
Give it a try? Alright.

235
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,160
Let me give it a try.

236
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,960
Dad.

237
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,360
The Ms. Lin you saw yesterday

238
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,400
was just someone Mom arranged for me
as a marriage of convenience.

239
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,640
I never had any real connection with her.

240
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,320
It's just that Ye Meng and I
are keeping our marriage private for now,

241
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,600
so it wasn't the right time
to make it public.

242
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
Hiding your marriage like this…

243
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
What do you take our Ye Meng for?

244
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,240
You've got the wrong idea. My feelings
for Ye Meng are completely genuine.

245
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,600
It's just that
I've just joined the company,

246
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,440
and if this gets out,

247
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,200
it could start a lot of gossip.

248
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,040
I'm afraid she would get hurt.

249
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,040
Save your explanations.

250
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,840
I've met plenty of rich kids like you.

251
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,120
Looks like there's one.

252
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,160
It might be a big one.

253
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
One, two, three.

254
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,080
- It's fine. Come on, Dad.
- Come here.

255
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,720
Here's the rod. I'll get this.

256
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,000
How is it?

257
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,680
Over here, Dad.

258
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,880
This one's a big catch.

259
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,040
Didn't expect it to be this huge.

260
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,080
Get up here, now.

261
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,120
Come on.

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Meng.

263
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,440
- Look at the fish your dad caught.
- You're finally back!

264
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,119
It's already gotten dark.

265
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,119
Take a look.

266
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,680
How do you wanna cook this fish?

267
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,359
Li Jinyu.

268
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,359
What happened to your pants?

269
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,680
- How did your shoes get completely wet?
- It's nothing.

270
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,880
Dad, did you make him jump into the river?

271
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,800
How could I ever make him do that?

272
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,720
It was my fishing rod
that fell into the river.

273
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,720
He offered to go in and get it for me.

274
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,320
- Right, Li?
- Right.

275
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,720
I was the one who offered
to help Dad get the fishing rod.

276
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,640
It has nothing to do with him.

277
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,320
Exactly.

278
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,200
I'll go clean the fish.

279
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,480
Alright.

280
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Go change your pants.
They're soaked. Hurry up.

281
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,000
I've noticed that your dad
seems kinda afraid of you.

282
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,480
It's not just me he's afraid of.

283
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,440
He's even more scared of my three aunts

284
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,160
and the matriarch of our family.

285
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,880
Once you join us,

286
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,800
you'll probably be the only one
in the house he isn't afraid of.

287
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,960
So,

288
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,440
that makes me the lowest

289
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,040
in the family hierarchy?

290
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,880
You could say that.

291
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,680
So, don't worry,
he won't disapprove of you.

292
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,880
After all, you're the one
cushioning the bottom.

293
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,720
After hearing that,

294
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm not sure whether

295
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,080
I should be happy or upset.

296
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
Meng.

297
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,040
How would you like this fish cooked?

298
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,040
Let me take a look.

299
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,920
Hurry up and change your pants.
Don't catch a cold.

300
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,080
The floor is dirty.

301
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,680
Don't worry, I'll mop it in a bit.

302
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,400
Slice it for boiled fish.

303
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,440
No problem.

304
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,960
Go relax.

305
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,120
- I…
- I'll call you when it's ready.

306
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,040
But I can help.

307
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
- Go on. Take a rest.
- Are you two sure you can handle this?

308
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,240
I'll call you when it's ready.

309
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,840
You got this!

310
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,320
Dad, let me handle that.

311
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,280
Just let me put on an apron first.

312
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,840
Make sure you do it well

313
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,160
and clean everything thoroughly,

314
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,600
otherwise, it'll smell fishy.

315
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,960
Don't worry, Dad.

316
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,560
When slicing,

317
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,480
make sure to cut it thin.

318
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,480
That way, it soaks up the flavor better.

319
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,000
No problem, Dad.

320
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,120
Why don't you also take some rest?

321
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
I'll let you know when everything's ready.

322
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
No need.

323
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,640
I should stay and guide you.

324
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,200
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

325
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,000
Start from here.

326
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,400
Try to slice it as thin as possible.

327
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,520
No problem.

328
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,360
A little thinner.

329
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Right.

330
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,240
See how perfect that looks?

331
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,200
Exactly.

332
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Here.

333
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,680
- Try a bite first.
- Thanks.

334
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,000
Let me have a taste
and give you my review.

335
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,840
It's really delicious and full of flavor.

336
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,200
And your knife skills

337
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,720
have definitely improved.
It's sliced so thin.

338
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,840
Of course!

339
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,320
This is nothing.

340
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,640
Come on, Dad. No need to be modest.

341
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,760
Look how evenly and thin you sliced this.

342
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,680
Your knife skills
are seriously impressive.

343
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,480
But honestly,
this isn't just about knife skills.

344
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,160
It's about showing fatherly love.

345
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,200
You cook whatever I crave.

346
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,080
Doesn't that deserve some recognition?

347
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,120
You've already learned to play along
with my dad so quickly?

348
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
Alright, I'll show some appreciation.

349
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,200
Dad, thanks for all your hard work.
Thank you.

350
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,960
As long as you enjoy it,

351
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,800
any effort is worth it.

352
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,280
Here, Li.

353
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,200
- You have some too.
- Thank you, Dad.

354
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,320
I'll get the wine for you. I forgot it.

355
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,840
- What did you mean by that earlier?
- No, I really mean it, Dad.

356
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm serious.

357
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,520
Really.

358
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,200
Let me tell you.

359
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
Ye Meng was treasured and cherished

360
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
by our entire family as she grew up.

361
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,480
And as for her husband,

362
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,960
I have just one requirement.

363
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,560
Go ahead. I'm listening.

364
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,400
Be good to her.

365
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,680
Don't worry, I promise I will.

366
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Alright.

367
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,760
As you two build a life together,
some friction is natural.

368
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,800
Your upbringings and living environments

369
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
are different.

370
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,120
But as long as you

371
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,160
support and understand each other,

372
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,480
your life will only get better.

373
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,840
If Ye Meng ever does
anything unreasonable,

374
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,240
just let me know. I'll talk to her.

375
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,840
As for the house,

376
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,680
I won't interfere with you young people.

377
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,360
- I'm going to…
- Dad, here's the wine.

378
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,840
What kind of good wine is this?

379
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,840
It's nothing fancy.

380
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,960
Just something new I picked up.
Give it a try though.

381
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,960
It's pretty good.

382
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,640
Look what I found.

383
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,600
NEWSLETTER: HEARTFELT MOMENTS
AT NINGSUI WELFARE CENTER

384
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,240
No wonder we couldn't find Zhou Yu before.

385
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,200
He's been hiding in the welfare center
right here in our area.

386
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,240
Is he from the welfare center?

387
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,680
I found out that his parents
passed away when he was very young.

388
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,560
He lived in the welfare center
until he was 18.

389
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,240
Previously, he wasn't adopted

390
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,680
because of Wang Xingsheng.

391
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,960
Back when Wang Xingsheng first arrived,

392
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,960
he acquired the land at Hailan Port

393
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,960
and wanted to secure financing.

394
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,440
But as an outsider,

395
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
no one here trusted him.

396
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
So, he turned to the welfare center,

397
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,440
using charity as a front

398
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,720
to swindle money from all over.

399
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,320
He managed to raise a lot of funds,

400
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,040
but was soon arrested and imprisoned.

401
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,640
His actions ruined the reputation
of our local welfare center,

402
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
and the family that was originally
going to adopt Zhou Yu

403
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,280
ended up abandoning him.

404
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,160
What's wrong?

405
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,200
This is that welfare center
in the old district of Ningsui.

406
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,680
My mom also grew up there
when she was little.

407
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,920
NINGSUI WELFARE CENTER

408
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,320
- Brother Zhou Yu brought so many toys.
- I want one too.

409
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,480
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

410
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,400
Come on. No pushing! Here.

411
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,440
One at a time.

412
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,840
Brother Zhou Yu, I want one too.

413
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,360
- Give me one.
- Me too.

414
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
Give me one!

415
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,360
One at a time. Here, this is for you.

416
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,560
- I want one too!
- I want one as well!

417
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,840
- I want one too!
- Give me!

418
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,000
I want this one.

419
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,600
Here, Hua'er,

420
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,880
you help distribute these to everyone.

421
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,360
I got a stationery case.

422
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,520
- I want it!
- I want it!

423
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,640
I want it too!

424
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,600
How did you even track me down here?

425
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,320
Don't be nervous.

426
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,040
We just need to ask a few questions
to understand the situation.

427
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,480
I have nothing to say to you.

428
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Zhou Yu!

429
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,680
You know Wang Xingsheng, don't you?

430
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
Is it because of him
that you've been targeting us?

431
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,480
Aren't you just birds of a feather?

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
It's because of your bloody project

433
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,800
that so many children at the welfare
center lost their chance to be adopted.

434
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,240
What do you mean?

435
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,920
What does our project
have to do with the welfare center?

436
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,560
Let go!

437
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,880
- Explain yourself clearly.
- Let go of me!

438
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,200
Zhou Yu!

439
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,760
What happened?

440
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,360
Did you get into trouble again?

441
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,440
Zhou Yu!

442
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,880
We're from Hailan Port.

443
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,360
I know.

444
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,000
This kid has made
a lot of mistakes lately,

445
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,880
and I'm not making excuses for him,

446
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,640
but if it weren't
for the Hailan Port project,

447
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,160
the welfare center wouldn't be involved.

448
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,760
And he wouldn't have done these things.

449
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,560
How much do you know

450
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
about that project?

451
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,360
FILE BOX

452
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,920
The Hailan Port project

453
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
was also known as Tianhui City.

454
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,000
Wang Xingsheng
was a real estate developer.

455
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,240
He invested in Ningsui.

456
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,080
Through a business partner's referral,

457
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,840
he proposed that
we contribute land as equity.

458
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,840
Found it.

459
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
TIANHUI CITY PHASE I

460
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,160
That partner

461
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
also grew up here at the welfare center.

462
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,320
We had full trust in the project

463
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,800
she introduced.

464
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,160
But we never expected

465
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,240
that she would use our name
for investment fraud.

466
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,400
It wasn't until she was exposed

467
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,240
that the reputation of the welfare center

468
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,600
was also ruined by her.

469
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,640
Zhou Yu was one
of the victims back then too.

Shu Yi is my mom.

473
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,880
Do you know how she
and Wang Xingsheng met?

474
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm not sure about the details.

475
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,760
I just know they were quite close.

What brings you back at this hour?

478
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,720
Have you eaten yet?

479
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,600
I went to the welfare center
where my mom used to live.

480
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,000
Had a bite to eat nearby.

481
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,120
What did you guys eat out there?

482
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,680
Should I make you a bowl of noodles?

483
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,840
- No need, Grandma.
- No need.

484
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,120
Grandma,

485
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,200
do you know Wang Xingsheng?

486
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,560
No matter Wang Jinsheng or Li Jinsheng,

487
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,880
I don't remember.

488
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,160
Then what about this?

489
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,680
TIANHUI CITY PHASE I

490
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,240
I want to know if my mom's suicide

491
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,280
is related to this project.

492
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,520
Grandma,

493
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,960
I'm not a child anymore.

494
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,200
What are you all hiding from me?

495
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,960
Why can't you just tell me the truth?

496
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,160
Oh, you kid…

497
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
Why are you so stubborn?

498
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,960
Those are all things of the past.

499
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,440
What's the point of digging it up now?

500
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,760
She was my mom.

501
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,040
If I never find out the truth, I'll never
be able to move on with my life.

502
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Meng.

503
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,680
Not telling you the truth

504
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
was to protect you!

505
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,600
"Protect me"?

506
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
Fine.

507
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,840
I'll go find out myself right now.

508
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,440
And if I can't get answers,
I won't come back.

509
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,720
Meng!

510
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,680
<i>Back then, your mom mentioned</i>

511
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,320
<i>that an old friend</i>

512
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,120
<i>had introduced her</i>
<i>to a good investment project.</i>

513
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,000
You want to invest that much money?

514
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,800
Mom, you just don't get it.

515
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,040
The more you invest, the more you earn.

516
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,160
Is that friend of yours reliable or not?

517
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Mom,

518
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,160
this project is backed
by solid endorsements.

519
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,760
Both the government
and banks are involved.

520
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,040
It's absolutely reliable.

521
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Got it.

522
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,800
Just a second.

523
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,720
Mom, I can't talk right now.

524
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,680
Trust me.

525
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,160
We'll make the money back in no time.

526
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,600
<i>Later, that investor</i>

527
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,640
<i>suddenly became unreachable.</i>

528
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,720
Any luck?

529
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,040
<i>I'm sorry, the subscriber you dialed</i>
<i>is temporarily unavailable.</i>

530
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,200
Still can't get through.
No one's answering.

531
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,080
Send a message and check.

532
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,520
I think this is a scam.

533
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,800
He probably took the money and ran.

534
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,960
Absolutely impossible!

535
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,640
<i>Your mom tried every possible way,</i>

536
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,280
<i>but still couldn't find</i>
<i>any trace of that person.</i>

537
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
<i>Within days,</i>

538
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,480
<i>the other investors</i>

539
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,800
<i>started causing a scene</i>
<i>at the welfare center.</i>

540
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,200
He cheated me out of all my money too!

541
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,360
<i>There was nothing she could do.</i>

542
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
<i>Your mom was desperate too.</i>

543
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,280
<i>Without telling any of us,</i>

544
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
<i>she went alone</i>

545
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,400
<i>to Jiangbei to find that man.</i>

546
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,920
Why was I kept in the dark about all this?

547
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,960
I told them not to tell you.

548
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,720
Dad.

549
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,480
Meng.

550
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,600
I didn't want you
to see your mom in a bad state

551
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,720
before she passed,

552
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,120
and I didn't want people
to gossip about her

553
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,240
or stab her in the back
after she was gone.

554
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,600
Besides,

555
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,560
hasn't Wang Xingsheng

556
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,840
already been arrested and sentenced?

557
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,280
So, I believe this

558
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,560
should end here.

559
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Dad.

560
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,320
Do you have any idea
how I've lived all these years?

561
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,960
Every day, I'm filled with guilt and pain

562
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,640
because I believe Mom became depressed
because of my poor grades.

563
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,480
Honestly, I don't know what to do either.

564
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,280
I…

565
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,920
I thought keeping you in the dark
was for your own good.

566
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,560
Right.

567
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,520
You all think it's for my own good.

568
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,160
But have you ever
really considered how I feel?

569
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,760
Meng.

570
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,240
Meng!

571
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,480
Don't worry.

572
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,960
I'll go find her.

573
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,400
CLOUDWILD WANDERING, FRIENDS LIST

574
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,400
Why did you

575
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,920
come here alone to play games?

576
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
Get some fresh air.

577
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,040
Put something on. Don't catch a cold.

578
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,840
This game

579
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,280
probably doesn't have
many players anymore, does it?

580
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,440
Not many people play it anymore.

581
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,160
I used to play this game
a lot with my mom.

582
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,600
Whenever we teamed up,

583
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,800
we had a 100% win rate.

584
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,160
The ultimate duo. Pretty cool.

585
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,040
We used to often play games

586
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,680
<i>and gossip together</i>

587
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,960
<i>on this terrace.</i>

588
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
<i>My mom knew so many of my secrets,</i>

589
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,640
<i>but she never lectured me as a mother.</i>

590
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,560
She never placed any demands on me.

591
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,600
She often said,

592
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
"Meng,

593
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,680
nothing else matters.

594
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,240
Your happiness
is the most important thing."

595
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,200
To you,

596
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,440
she wasn't just a mother.

597
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,080
She was your best friend.

598
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,000
That's why you resent your dad

599
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,120
for not telling you the truth.

600
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,560
But I can tell

601
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,600
that your dad also loves you deeply.

602
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,040
Maybe

603
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,320
he just wanted you to live a happy life,

604
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,520
without carrying this burden.

605
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,040
More like running away from it.

606
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,320
How about

607
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,840
we find a chance to have a meal together?

608
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,080
You and Dad should sit down
and have a proper talk.

609
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,320
I don't want to talk.

610
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,480
There's nothing left to say.

611
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
We're all family.

612
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,440
In a family, grudges don't last overnight,

613
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,480
right?

614
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,320
Wait,

615
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,080
that doesn't sound right.

616
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,080
Why does it seem like
you've suddenly teamed up with my dad?

617
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,840
How could that be?

618
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,160
I'll always be on your side.

619
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
My stance is clear.

620
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,720
Look,

621
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,000
if you're doing well,
Dad's doing well, then I'm doing well.

622
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,040
But, of course,

623
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,520
you're the one who matters most.

624
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,199
Come on.

625
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,440
No more crying,

626
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,040
or your eyes will be puffy tomorrow.

627
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,520
Thank you.

628
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,440
What are you thanking me for?

629
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,800
Okay?

630
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,320
Alright.

631
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,920
You won't look pretty tomorrow
with puffy eyes.

632
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,719
Got it.

633
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,440
Yangyang,

634
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,120
how did it go with Jinyu?

635
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,840
That's just how he is.

636
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,960
Always a bit cold
and distant with everyone.

637
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,760
Don't worry, I'll be in Ningsui soon,

638
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
and I'll give him a piece of my mind.

639
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,080
Okay, talk later.

640
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,000
Chairman Li,

641
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,200
things aren't going smoothly with Ms. Lin.

642
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,400
Could the arranged marriage
between the Lin and Li families

643
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,640
be affected?

644
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,920
What arranged marriage?

645
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,480
This is just to offload Hailan Port
to the Lin family as quickly as possible.

646
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,920
Dr. Yang.

647
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,080
It's been a while.

648
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
Mrs. Li.

649
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,280
Jinyu,

650
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,920
this is the budget
for Phase III of our Hailan Port project.

651
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,960
Please take a look.

652
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,200
If everything seems fine,

653
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,000
we'll move forward

654
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,400
and start by demolishing
the fishing village.

655
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,600
Jinyu,

656
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,400
the fishing village
is in the best location in Ningsui.

657
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,320
Our Lin Group is willing
to collaborate with Hanhai Group

658
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,880
on Phase III precisely

659
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,000
because we recognize the strategic value
of the fishing village's location.

660
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,960
How about we end here for today?

661
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,840
Regarding Hailan Port Phase III,

662
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,080
I need to discuss it further with my team.

663
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Let's talk again later.

664
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,680
Alright.

665
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,840
Let's go.

666
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,520
I won't see you out then.

667
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
No need to.

668
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
- Mr. Li, no need to see us out.
- Goodbye, Jinyu.

669
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,880
<i>Dad,</i>

670
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,000
<i>don't forget to come home</i>
<i>for dinner tonight.</i>

671
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
The food's here!

672
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,640
Just one more soup

673
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,880
and everything will be ready.

674
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,400
Don't overwork yourself.
You must be exhausted.

675
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,600
Not tired at all.

676
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
I think Dad's here. I'll get the door.

677
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Coming!

678
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,760
Dad, you're here.

679
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,480
Jinyu.

680
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,360
Where's Meng?

681
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,240
She's waiting for you in the dining room.

682
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,760
Meng.

683
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,680
Dad.

684
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,960
Meng

685
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,160
had me prepare your favorite wine for you.

686
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,840
- Please, have a taste.
- Here.

687
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,600
I know you're still angry with me.

688
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,080
You have to understand

689
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,440
that it all happened so suddenly.

690
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,120
I had no time to process it.

691
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,640
At the time, I just wanted to protect you.

692
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,360
Maybe…

693
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,240
I was also trying
to avoid facing it myself.

694
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,720
To be honest,

695
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,880
your mom's sudden passing

696
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,600
hit me really hard.

697
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,240
I naively believed

698
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,280
that as long as we never brought it up,

699
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,880
the wound would never be reopened.

700
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,040
Now I understand it.

701
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,680
I was wrong.

702
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,640
Meng,

703
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,560
I apologize.

704
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm sorry.

705
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,920
Actually, I can't blame you entirely.

706
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Even if you had told me back then,

707
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,360
I probably wouldn't
have been able to handle it.

708
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,920
I was too young and immature,

709
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,440
prone to acting on impulse.

710
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,040
So, you're not still

711
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,120
angry with me now, are you?

712
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,920
Let go of the past

713
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,560
and live well.

714
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,640
Dad, you too.

715
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,640
You need to move forward.

716
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,200
That's what Mom would have wanted to see.

717
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,520
Alright.

718
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,280
Let's toast as a family.

719
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,640
Come on.

720
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,720
- Come on, Dad.
- Dad.

721
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,480
Jinyu.

722
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,680
I am entrusting Meng to you completely.

723
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,200
Thank you for your approval, Dad.

724
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,800
Did you cook all these dishes yourself?

725
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,040
Come on. Try his cooking.

726
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,360
Let me just wash my hands first.

727
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Okay.

728
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,640
Congratulations

729
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,600
on winning over your father-in-law.

730
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,200
Not bad, I guess.

731
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,840
Take this off.

732
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,600
You look pretty handsome in an apron.

733
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Really?

734
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,040
Then I'll wear it more often.

735
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,960
Right.

736
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,600
You said it.

737
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,800
No need to see me out. It's cold outside.

738
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,920
Then I'll walk Dad out. You stay.

739
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,560
Dad,

740
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,960
actually, I wanted to talk to you

741
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,520
- about something else.
- Go ahead.

742
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,200
Phase III of Hailan Port

743
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,760
is about to start construction.

744
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,600
And the fishing village
will be demolished.

745
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,200
Did you know about this?

746
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,680
I know. I approved it.

747
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,120
I don't understand.

748
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,040
This fishing village

749
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,120
is the most distinctive feature

750
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,760
and cultural charm of Ningsui.

751
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,920
When Hailan Port
was first established, it was promoted

752
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,640
as a development based
on the existing ecosystem,

753
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,560
not one that would remove it.

754
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
You're absolutely right.

755
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,360
Our little fishing village

756
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,240
is indeed wonderful.

757
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,520
But as you know,

758
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,480
it can't be scaled up or strengthened.

759
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,920
Why did the government
approve replacing our village

760
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,480
with Hailan Port

761
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,960
through investment promotion?

762
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,360
Isn't it precisely to boost tourism here

763
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,560
by bringing in big enterprises?

764
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,840
But this is where Ye Meng grew up.

765
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,080
It holds so many
cherished memories for everyone.

766
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,080
Dad,

767
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,040
how could you agree to tear it down too?

768
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,840
Don't just look at me.

769
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,280
See what Ye Meng said.

770
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,080
We need to look forward.

771
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,760
For the development of our community,

772
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,400
some things must be let go.

773
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,920
Alright, go spend time with Ye Meng.

774
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,240
Take care on the road, Dad.

775
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,880
Granny.

776
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,560
Wake up.

777
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,720
What's wrong?

778
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,640
Granny!

779
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,320
Granny!

780
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,840
Look here.

781
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,960
This is confirmed to be a brain tumor.

782
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,760
As for whether it's malignant or not,

783
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,160
we'll need to wait for a biopsy

784
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,800
after surgical removal.

785
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,360
The patient's condition
is very unstable right now.

786
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,600
You, as the family,

787
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,720
need to decide quickly

788
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,520
on whether to opt for conservative
treatment or proceed with surgery.

789
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,960
PLEASE SEE THE DOCTOR IN ORDER

790
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,320
<i>Given your grandma's age,</i>

791
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,360
<i>we actually don't recommend surgery.</i>

792
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,840
<i>The risks are very high.</i>

793
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,480
<i>However, if the surgery is successful,</i>
<i>she could potentially live</i>

794
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,600
<i>another ten years or more.</i>

795
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,400
<i>But as you know,</i>

796
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,480
<i>nothing is certain.</i>

797
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,320
<i>Ultimately, it's a decision</i>

798
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,600
<i>that needs to be made</i>
<i>by the family after discussion.</i>

799
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,840
