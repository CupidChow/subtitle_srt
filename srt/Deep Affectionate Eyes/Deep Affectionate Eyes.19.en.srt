ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>DEEP AFFECTION EYES</i>
BY ER DONG TU ZI ON JJWXC.NET

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,360
Phase one of Hailan Port

3
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,800
has cleared all safety checks
and fire drills.

4
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,520
The countdown ads
for opening day are already live.

5
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,520
All prep for the big day,

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,480
including venue setup,
equipment testing, and guest reception,

7
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,400
has been assigned.

8
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,880
The press release will be ready this week.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,120
PR will also sharpen the campaign

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,080
to target new clients.

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,160
Good.

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,280
That's all for now.

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
- Understood.
- Okay.

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,600
Ye Meng,

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,560
let's go over the proposal
again after lunch.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,280
- I think there's something…
- Let's go!

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
- I think there's…
- Let's go!

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
- I heard you.
- Wait, you…

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,280
Hands off.

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,320
See you, Mr. Li.

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,080
Mrs. Ye, good work today.

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,480
There's no one here.

23
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,919
- No one?
- Nobody.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,160
Honey, how are you?

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
- Tired?
- What are you doing!

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Come on. Bathroom break.

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,600
- I don't need to.
- I do. Keep me company.

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
- Come on.
- How's that my problem?

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Wait…

30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,120
Maniac.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,760
She's gone, she's gone.
No one saw you guys.

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,880
What is wrong with you?

33
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,400
I told you to cover for us,
not act like a thief.

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,840
Stop tailing me. Keep an eye on Gou Kai.

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
As long as he doesn't
tag along, we're fine.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,480
Makes sense. Makes sense.

37
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,800
Do you still need to go?

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,040
Wasn't planning to.

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,440
Let's get out of here.

40
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,160
Tai Mingxiao really goes overboard.

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,360
Anyway, honey,

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,840
give me more notes on that proposal later.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
You still need me
to give you pointers, Mr. Li?

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Everyone else might not know,
but you know I'm winging it.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,920
The real execution's always on you.

46
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,080
I'll give you my notes tonight.

47
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,960
Ye Meng.

48
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Why did you leave early?

49
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,600
Something urgent came up.

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,920
I thought

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
- we'd have a--
- Mr. Gou!

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,120
Been looking for you. Contract to sign.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,720
- What's your deal?
- Just sign.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,880
What do you want?

55
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,840
Tai Mingxiao, be straight with me.

56
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,960
Why have you been sneaking around lately?

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
What do you mean?

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,600
You keep ruining things for me,

59
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,840
hovering like I'm the enemy.

60
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,320
Some friend you are.

61
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,920
- You've got a problem.
- My problem's--

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,440
- A serious problem.
- Enough.

63
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
Mr. Gou,

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,519
you want to know where I was yesterday?

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,959
I went to see my husband.

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
We made up.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Wait.

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,120
You and him…

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
That's enough.

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,320
She said she reconciled with her husband.

71
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,440
Drop it, Gou Kai.

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
What's it to you?

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
What's it to you?

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
How's it not my business?

75
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,520
- How is it yours?
- Enough.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,840
Neither of you stand a chance.

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,120
Does it concern you?

78
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,960
You've got a problem.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,280
It actually concerns me.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
What happened?

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,920
Show's over.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,840
Does this concern any of you?

83
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,560
- Mr. Gou, let me take it.
- Gou.

84
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,440
Where are you going?

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,640
Gou,

86
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,880
you're really leaving?

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,360
Quick trip back to Jiangbei.
Something urgent came up.

88
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,520
Look, I never meant
to ruin anything for you.

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,960
You've always been a brother to me.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,400
But right now, I can't back you up.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
I've got my own problems.

92
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,520
So, your confession failed.

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
That's no reason to feel ashamed
and run back to Jiangbei.

94
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,960
- It's not shameful at all.
- Shut it.

95
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,880
Who said I failed? I haven't even started.

96
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,680
You call this not starting?

97
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,360
Enough.

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,480
Just keep an eye on Ye Meng for me.

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,160
Especially on the men circling her.

100
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,080
Especially Li…

101
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,920
Then don't stay mad at me.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,320
One day, you'll get it.

103
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,360
Are we good, Gou?

104
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,120
PARKING GARAGE EXIT, SLOW DOWN, ZONE C

105
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,880
Mrs. Ye, come to my office for a minute.

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,320
Okay.

107
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,840
Hey, if it's not urgent,
stop dragging her in here all the time.

108
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,960
Talk to me instead.

109
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,640
Mr. Tai, enough.

110
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Back to work.

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,360
What are you doing, Li Jinyu?

112
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,920
Gou Kai's gone.
Can't we finally stop hiding?

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,560
Hiding what?

114
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,320
At least wait till we're home.

115
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,280
Eyes are everywhere.

116
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,920
I can't help it.

117
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,480
You turning Gou Kai down to his face
was insanely hot.

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,880
Strong and sexy.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,760
You're twisted, Li Jinyu.

120
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,600
- I am not.
- Cut it out.

121
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,240
Where's Mr. Li?

122
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
Inside.

123
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,640
Lin Yangyang?

124
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
Stop.

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Li Jin--

126
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
Hello.

127
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,000
Jinyu, it's been ages.

128
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,160
Lin Yangyang?

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,040
It's me. I'm back in the country.

130
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,840
Why are you avoiding me?

131
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,880
Not happy to see me?

132
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,440
What are you doing here?

133
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,400
Business.

134
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,400
I ran into Auntie Li the other day.

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,720
She said you're leading Hailan Port.

136
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,280
And my dad wants me to handle
part of the hotel business.

137
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,400
Auntie suggested I come by, check it out.

138
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,400
Maybe we can collaborate.

139
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,520
I'll leave you two to it. I've got work.

140
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,760
I've got a call.

141
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,200
Hello?

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,039
Jinyu, Yangyang's with you, right?

143
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,000
<i>Back in university, you two were close.</i>

144
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,920
<i>She still thinks highly of you.</i>

145
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,040
She's got a project
that fits well with Hailan Port.

146
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,200
Talk it over.

147
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,680
Alright, I see.

148
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,640
<i>And since she came all this way,</i>

149
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
<i>treat her properly.</i>

150
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,440
Take her out, show her around.

151
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,640
Got it.

152
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,800
The woman you met earlier

153
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,920
is Mrs. Ye, the project lead.

154
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,520
How about I show you the site?

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,120
Anything you don't understand, just ask.

156
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,280
Perfect.

157
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,120
Mrs. Ye.

158
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,800
Come along with us to the site.

159
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,600
Alright.

160
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,120
This doesn't look good.

161
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,760
QUALITY IN EVERY STEP
EXCELLENCE IN EVERY PROJECT

162
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,600
This is the residential area.

163
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
Scheduled to finish
by next year's third quarter.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,160
Could you open this for me?

165
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,800
Thanks.

166
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Trust me. There's nothing
going on between them.

167
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,080
Absolutely nothing.

168
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,720
I'm not mad. Why are you explaining?

169
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,000
MATERIAL STORAGE AREA

170
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,880
Over there's all gravel and sand,
not too safe.

171
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,080
We'll stop the tour here.

172
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,480
Works for me. I'm tired anyway.

173
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,280
Since I'm finally back in the country,
how about dinner together?

174
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,840
Sure. Let's all go.

175
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Hard work today.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,160
Sounds good.

177
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,120
Alright then.

178
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,800
- This way.
- Let's go.

179
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm so glad to be here in Ningsui.

180
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,360
Thanks for keeping me company all day.

181
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,560
Cheers.

182
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,880
Of course. Cheers!

183
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,040
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

184
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,120
How's the wine?

185
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,560
I snuck it out of my dad's cabinet.

186
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,160
It's one of his treasures.
He won't even open it himself.

187
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,160
We don't really know wine.

188
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,680
Feels wasted on us.

189
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,920
Exactly. Yangyang, you say that,

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,240
but do we drink or not?

191
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,120
Don't be silly.

192
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,200
Seeing Jinyu again
is worth more than a bottle.

193
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm happy to share.

194
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,840
Then, thank you, Ms. Lin,
for your generosity.

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,760
Ms. Lin, you and Mr. Li seem close.

196
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,600
Well…

197
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,680
Back in school, I had a crush on him.

198
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,560
So, I guess you could say we're close.

199
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,680
Really? When was that?

200
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,520
I don't seem to remember.

201
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,000
That was forever ago. Ancient history.

202
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,920
And after

203
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,800
all those years abroad,
with all those men,

204
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,240
you're still stuck on this airhead?
I don't buy it.

205
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,800
What, foreign guys
are supposed to be better?

206
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,920
Quite the opposite.

207
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
- If anything, being away
- <i>I swear I rejected her clearly long ago.</i>

208
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,840
just made me more certain.

209
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,800
I only like men like Li Jinyu.

210
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,920
Mrs. Ye,

211
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
don't you agree?

212
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,840
Ms. Lin, you're beautiful,
sincere, and loyal.

213
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,120
Mr. Li should feel lucky.

214
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,920
Finally, someone who understands me.

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
- Come on.
- Okay.

216
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,360
No toasting across the table. I'll…

217
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,920
Everyone together. Cheers.

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,840
Alright.

219
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,200
- Cheers
- Bottoms up.

220
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,520
- Here.
- Cheers.

221
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,920
Mrs. Ye.

222
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,600
Ms. Lin.

223
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,320
Can I ask you something?

224
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,360
Does Li Jinyu have a girlfriend right now?

225
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I wouldn't know. We're not that close.

226
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,760
Then I'll assume he doesn't.

227
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,440
In that case,

228
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,200
I plan on pursuing him again.

229
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,160
You don't think I'm shameless, do you?

230
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,320
Not at all.
I actually admire your honesty.

231
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,200
When I chased my husband,
I was just as direct.

232
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
Wait, you're married?

233
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,160
You don't look it at all.

234
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,160
Then you must know exactly
how to win a man's heart.

235
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,440
Mrs. Ye, let's add each other on WeChat.

236
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,600
I won't always be in Ningsui.

237
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,440
And a man like Li Jinyu…

238
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,200
Someone could steal him away anytime.

239
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,320
So, I'll need you to be my eyes and ears.

240
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,920
If anyone shows interest in him…

241
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,720
Never mind. He wouldn't
look twice at just anyone.

242
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,640
But if you notice

243
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,640
he treats someone differently,

244
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,920
let me know.

245
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,360
- Well…
- Please. Help me out.

246
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,760
Alright. Let's add each other.

247
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,680
I'll scan you.

248
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,920
I sent my driver home.
Can you take me back later?

249
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,240
Then, let's all head back together.

250
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,400
How are you getting home, Mrs. Ye?

251
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,600
Not with you. A friend's coming.

252
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,600
Ya'en!

253
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,600
Everyone, this is my best friend, Ya'en.

254
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Then, let's go, Jinyu.

255
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,480
Then…

256
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,160
Take care on the way.

257
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,680
We're heading off too.

258
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,120
Yeah, us too.

259
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
- See you.
- Bye. See you.

260
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,640
No wonder you asked me to pick you up.

261
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,880
What's going on?

262
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,360
Let's grab drinks at Gem.

263
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,920
Wait, what?

264
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,600
TIEN CHIN C7-1

265
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,440
I won't walk you in. Get some rest early.

266
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,920
Why the rush? It's still early.

267
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,440
I've got plenty of project questions
I want your input on.

268
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,240
It's too late to talk work.

269
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,080
Let's set a time tomorrow at the office.

270
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Li Jinyu.

271
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
How have you been all these years?

272
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,680
I've been fine.

273
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,160
I've missed you.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,080
That's why when Auntie
asked me to come, I didn't hesitate.

275
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,440
You should know what that means.

276
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,160
Ningsui is nice,

277
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,680
but you belong in a bigger, brighter city.

278
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,680
I still remember you in college,
racing at WMC,

279
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,880
fearless, so full of life.

280
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Honestly, no one suits you better than me.

281
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,000
You're mistaken.

282
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,320
I thought you were here
to discuss alliance.

283
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,480
Marriage is alliance.

284
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,440
If we're together,

285
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,360
it's one plus one makes more than two.

286
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,320
And people like us?

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,720
We never had the freedom
to love whoever we want.

288
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,720
Marriage alliance?

289
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,760
That's too much.

290
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm not anyone special.

291
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,040
You give me too much credit.

292
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,480
If that's all, get some rest.

293
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,000
You like someone else, don't you?

294
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,800
ENJOY THE MOMENT

295
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,359
Oh my God.

296
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,200
LIN YANGYANG'S POSTS

297
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,000
Look at this. Yachts,

298
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
luxury cars, designer bags…

299
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,960
What's money worth?

300
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,160
No matter how much she has,
Li Jinyu's heart, mind, and eyes

301
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,280
are all on you.

302
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,920
He's got women orbiting him everywhere.

303
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,000
So, you're aware of that.
Then why keep your marriage a secret?

304
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,640
If you've got guts, go public.

305
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,480
Or…

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,280
do you two actually
like the thrill of hiding it?

307
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,080
- Maybe a little.
- Just a little?

308
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,880
Just a little.

309
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
- You're something else.
- A little what?

310
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,080
Just a little what?

311
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,120
What's so funny?

312
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,520
Laughing at a certain couple's
underground marriage.

313
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
When are you going

314
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,120
to make it official?

315
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,080
Do you know how much
I've risked my reputation

316
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
just to keep this marriage standing?

317
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,080
If this gossip spreads,

318
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,400
how am I supposed to find
a girlfriend in this town?

319
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,840
Reputation? Since when do you have one?
You look like you're enjoying the act.

320
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,560
- You're demanding five million here.
- Exactly.

321
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,760
Five million this and that.
Who am I doing all this for?

322
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,560
Tell me. Who am I doing this for?

323
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,280
Fine. You're right. For our marriage.

324
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,760
Here, let me toast you.

325
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,360
Now we're talking. Lower that glass.

326
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Kai.

327
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,880
Cheng Kairan.

328
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,720
But he's right.

329
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,240
You really going

330
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,200
to keep acting this out
with Li Jinyu forever?

331
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,320
And how's the digging going?

332
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,880
You'll have to ask him.

333
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,800
Cheng Kairan,

334
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,840
what about that Zhou Yu lead
Li Jinyu told you to check on?

335
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
- Cheng Kairan.
- What?

336
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,880
Don't play dumb.

337
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,080
Zhou Yu.

338
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,600
How's it going?

339
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,200
Zhou who now?

340
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,320
I…

341
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
What? You want Long Island Iced Tea?

342
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,400
- We didn't order that.
- With less ice?

343
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,680
Cheng Kairan.

344
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,280
One second.

345
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,320
Stop fooling around.

346
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,120
I'm not.

347
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,720
For Li Jinyu, brotherhood is just talk.

348
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,320
I'm not like him.
I stand by my people, alright?

349
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,040
We've already made up.
Just tell us. Nothing bad will happen.

350
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,200
It's true.

351
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,320
It's true.

352
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,280
You two are trying to set me up.

353
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,160
This bottle's on the house.

354
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,240
Unbelievable.

355
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,960
What, me reconciling with Li Jinyu
is that hard to believe?

356
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,240
Only to an idiot like him.

357
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,760
Tomorrow the divorce is official.

358
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,520
Finally.

359
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,200
The glorious single life of Fang Ya'en…

360
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,960
Here I come.

361
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,160
Why am I actually nervous?

362
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
Please, please,
let Chen Jian show up tomorrow.

363
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,080
No last-minute drama.

364
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,560
Relax.

365
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,360
If he refuses, I'll drag him there.

366
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,520
This marriage ends tomorrow.

367
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,800
- You mean it?
- I mean it.

368
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,160
- You'll be with me?
- Of course.

369
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,360
And what about me, huh?

370
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,520
What's it got to do with you?
Stay out of it.

371
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,080
Hey, come on.

372
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,640
We're all old classmates.

373
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,880
For the sake of old times,
I should be there.

374
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,600
Such a big occasion deserves a toast.
Come on.

375
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Cheers!

376
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
It's all in the glass.

377
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,920
Bottoms up!

378
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,320
He really finished it.

379
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,080
- What about Zhou Yu?
- What about Zhou Yu?

380
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Men.

381
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,920
Always covering for each other.

382
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,200
Useless.

383
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,120
Well, look who's here.

384
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,880
Mr. Li himself. What an honor.

385
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,240
Why are you home so late?

386
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,840
Peach blossom pastries.

387
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
Fresh out of the oven.

388
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,840
I couldn't come home early.
Didn't want to interrupt your date.

389
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,400
Ah, peach blossom pastries.

390
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,640
These are from the bakery
at Ms. Lin's hotel, right?

391
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,760
So kind of you.
Did you walk her to her room too?

392
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,560
I didn't.

393
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,960
I waited until she went upstairs,
then doubled back to buy these.

394
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
I swear that's the truth.

395
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,760
Fine. Come in.

396
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,560
Not you.

397
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,840
I meant Ping'an.

398
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,320
Dog comes in, you stay out.

399
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
Seriously? Wait.

400
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,480
So, my treatment's worse than the dog's?

401
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
He doesn't even care about me.

402
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,400
I disappear for two weeks,
he doesn't bark once.

403
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
- He's bad-mouthing you.
- I…

404
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
I rushed all the way back

405
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,560
just to bring you these,

406
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,160
and you still won't let me in?

407
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,600
What's the magic word?

408
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,120
Call me lady and admit you're wrong.

409
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,960
Kind lady, I was wrong.

410
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,880
Please let me in.

411
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,840
Unbelievable.

412
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
Ping'an, play outside for a while.

413
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,000
So it's just a marriage alliance prospect.
Why so guilty all of a sudden,

414
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,880
trying to sweet-talk me?

415
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,480
I wasn't.

416
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,760
I was just afraid you'd be upset.

417
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,200
Honey, I'm sorry.

418
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,520
I had no choice today. I'm sorry.

419
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,440
You saw the whole situation yourself…

420
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,640
I…

421
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Enough. Sit down.

422
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,720
Coming.

423
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,920
I'm not mad.

424
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,920
Honestly, I think
Lin Yangyang's kind of cute.

425
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
- Really?
- Really.

426
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,440
- You're more generous than I thought.
- Of course.

427
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,920
But she added me on WeChat
in the restroom.

428
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Asked me to spy for her.

429
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,520
And you added her?

430
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,120
When she finds out the truth,

431
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,840
she'll explode.

432
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,520
What else could I do?

433
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,200
It was just the two of us in there.

434
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,080
She was begging me. I had no choice.

435
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,320
But this woman…
She's the same type as my mother.

436
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,880
To her, business always comes before love.

437
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,880
When she says she likes me,
it's not me she wants.

438
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,280
It's the Li family's commercial value.

439
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,760
We'd better

440
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,680
keep our guard up.

441
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Got it.

442
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,640
Still…

443
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
you were a little jealous.

444
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
What's there to be jealous of?

445
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,560
You can deny it, but I saw it.

446
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,320
I wasn't jealous. Stop staring.

447
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,680
You're so full of yourself.

448
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,200
You're cute when you're jealous.

449
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,360
Nonsense.

450
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,920
I'm not jealous.

451
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,560
No.

452
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,800
Thought you said you weren't jealous.
So, why not?

453
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,800
No means no.

454
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,840
Not now.

455
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,240
Fifteen minutes.

456
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,560
- Fine.
- Hurry up. It's WeChat.

457
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,120
Who's calling this late?

458
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
Who do you think, Li Jinyu?

459
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,320
Cheng Kairan.

460
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,240
CHENG KAIRAN

461
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,040
Hello? What is it?

462
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
Bro, listen.

463
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,840
Ye Meng and Fang Ya'en
stormed into my bar just now.

464
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,080
<i>They interrogated me like I was on trial.</i>

465
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,080
I swear one of them
had a knife to my throat.

466
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,840
But I didn't crack.

467
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,000
<i>I kept thinking, we're buddies.</i>
<i>Blood is thicker than water.</i>

468
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,800
Not one word slipped.

469
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,520
Pretty loyal of me, huh?

470
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,240
Cheng Kairan.

471
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,160
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

472
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,840
When did I ever
put a knife to your throat?

473
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,000
CALL ENDED

474
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,760
He hung up?

475
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,480
I told him today

476
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,840
you and I were back together.

477
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,280
Then I asked about Zhou Yu.

478
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,200
He refused to say a thing.
Called it loyalty.

479
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,760
CHENG KAIRAN

480
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,560
<i>Bro, I'm done.</i>

481
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,480
<i>Turns out I'm the only one who ever cared</i>
<i>about this so-called brotherhood.</i>

482
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,640
<i>You've really let me down.</i>

483
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,400
<i>I'm honestly tearing up here, you know?</i>

484
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,520
<i>We're finished.</i>

485
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,600
Funny. I don't recall
ever having a brotherhood.

486
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,200
I've only ever had love.

487
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,720
<i>Funny. I don't recall</i>
<i>ever having a brotherhood.</i>

488
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,440
<i>I've only ever had love.</i>

489
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,440
Fifteen minutes must be up.

490
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,800
- Not even close.
- It's been plenty.

491
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,600
It's been three. Absolutely not.

492
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,320
Back off.

493
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,600
- You're jealous.
- Fine. I am.

494
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,320
- So, you admit it.
- No. Not jealous anymore.

495
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,440
Gone.

496
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,360
At least eat one of these.

497
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,000
Here, I'll grab it.

498
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,000
Tell me you only bought two.

499
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,360
- Four.
- Didn't share with anyone else?

500
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,840
Got you.

501
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,240
Four. Only for you.

502
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,280
Why would I buy them for anyone else?

503
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,360
Nice save.

504
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
Go on. Try one.

505
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,120

Ready for school, Jiayu?

510
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,040
Mommy has errands today.
I can't take you to school.

511
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,000
That's okay, Mom. I can go myself.

512
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,360
I'm leaving now.

513
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,800
Jiayu.

514
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,200
There's something I need to tell you.

515
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,680
Mommy's going to court today
to divorce your dad.

516
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Mom, you've really made up your mind?

517
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,200
My heart's all over the place.

518
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,520
I just keep worrying about you.

519
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,600
Mom, you don't need to feel guilty.

520
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,320
This is your life, your choice.

521
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,720
And whatever you decide, I'll respect it.

522
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,960
Just like you've always respected me.

523
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Don't be scared.

524
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,360
Thank you, Jiayu.

525
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,720
- Now hurry, or you'll be late.
- Bye, Mom.

526
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,960

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,000
SINGLE AND THRIVING, CHEERS TO LIVING

542
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,520
CONGRATS YA'EN, SINGLE AND FREE

543
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,560
OFF WITH HER KID TO THE LIFE SHE DESERVES

544
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Use Plan B for that project.

545
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,560
Start construction the day after tomorrow,

546
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,640
first thing in the morning.

547
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,200
Alright, bye.

548
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,400
CONGRATS, HAPPY SINGLE LIFE

549
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,840
You're really turning this bar
into a restaurant?

550
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,960
Yeah.

551
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,480
Gotta think long-term.

552
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,680
What if Jiayu's classmates ask?

553
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,920
Better they hear I run
a restaurant than a bar.

554
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,320
Not bad.

555
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,600
At least you stopped short
of a family café.

556
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,800
I actually considered it.

557
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,440
Place is just too small

558
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,160
for play equipment.

559
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,480
Kai.

560
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,800
The flowers are here.

561
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,520
Nice.

562
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,920
Is this pear fresh?

563
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
Just off the tree.

564
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,480
Perfect. Fresh pear for a fresh start.

565
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,200
Divorce looks good on her.

566
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,880
When are Ya'en and Ye Meng coming?

567
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,760
Ye Meng just texted. They're not coming.
Said they're celebrating

568
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,800
on their own.

569
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,520
Divorce papers signed. Freedom restored.

570
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,560
I feel incredible.

571
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,760
Ye Meng,

572
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,360
look at these younger guys.
Full of life, full of energy.

573
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,280
Can't believe how many years I wasted.

574
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Threw away a whole forest
for one rotten tree.

575
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,880
Young and stupid,

576
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,080
thinking trash was treasure.

577
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,800
That's you, Fang Ya'en.

578
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
True.

579
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,800
But I got Jiayu out of it.

580
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,480
That's my only win.

581
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,440
Now, I'm single.

582
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,520
And I fully intend to enjoy
some younger company.

583
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,440
That okay?

584
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,080
CONGRATS YA'EN, SINGLE AND FREE
OFF WITH HER KID TO THE LIFE SHE DESERVES

585
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,440
With this much effort,

586
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,440
you sure you're not planning a confession?

587
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,520
No.

588
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,440
We're just friends.

589
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
I just want to celebrate her escape.

590
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,840
Good.

591
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,160
Because if she shot you down,
you'd come crying to me.

592
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,200
What do you mean, shot me down?

593
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,920
Can't you wish me luck for once?

594
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,600
She just got divorced,
climbed out of one fire pit,

595
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,480
and you want her to jump into another?

596
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,040
Think that's realistic?

597
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,000
Wrong.

598
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,760
Freshly single is exactly
when a woman needs someone.

599
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
Hesitate and someone else will swoop in.

600
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,880
Go bold. Seize the moment.

601
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,760
When it's time, make your move.

602
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,600
Trust me, women understand women best.

603
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,640
Stay out of it. Don't stir the pot.

604
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,600
No, you stay out of it.

605
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,000
Maimai, sit.

606
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,640
Maimai's right. Women know women.

607
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,320
But you don't.

608
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,760
I don't?

609
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,160
I'm married.

610
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,480
I know women.

611
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
Sure you do.

612
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,080
If you really knew women,
Lin Yangyang wouldn't be

613
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,560
chasing you like a shadow.

614
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,880
So, tell me, what's your brilliant idea?

615
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,080
If you ask me, we hit her hard.

616
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,080
We team up, put on a show,
and scare her off once and for all.

617
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,679
Go, Maimai.

618
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,000
Perfect timing. Watch me.

619
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,360
- Hi there.
- Jinyu.

620
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,400
Hello, hello.

621
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,480
And you are…

622
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,120
You must be Jinyu's friend.

623
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,600
- How are you?
- What have you been busy with lately?

624
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,080
- Not performing here anymore?
- Not here?

625
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,280
No, I've stopped.

626
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
- He booked this table.
- I haven't seen you for ages.

627
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,360
- Over here.
- We missed you.

628
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,120
Let's sit down and chat.

629
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,280
That's true.

630
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,520
Please sit.

631
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,760
See all these flowers?
He set them up himself.

632
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,040
And he even picked this pear
this afternoon.

633
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,880
What should I get you?

634
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,320
Fix the lady a Maiden's Heart.

635
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,440
On it.

636
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,880
- Is this a pear?
- Yep.

637
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,240
Straight from Korla. Sweet as honey.

638
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,200
Let's add each other.

639
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,600
- Sure.
- Added you.

640
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
- Just added you.
- Me too.

641
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,800
He comes here all the time?

642
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,280
Keep in touch, okay?

643
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,120
He practically lives here.
Four or five hours a day minimum.

644
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,840
If he goes home early, he can't sleep.

645
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,280
Honestly, I could spill dirt on him

646
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,440
three days straight
without repeating myself.

647
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,080
He's always hanging around here.

648
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,800
He just sits here surrounded by girls.

649
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,960
Holding hands, leaning on shoulders.

650
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,480
Drives me crazy.

651
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,320
And get this. You know
Granny Li at the village?

652
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,160
Gray hair and all
and he still flirts with her.

653
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,320
No shame at all.

654
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,200
Couple of nights ago, in the bathroom

655
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
with some young girl…

656
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,640
The noises they made,

657
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,200
I couldn't even listen.
I was embarrassed for them.

658
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,200
This is supposed to be a respectable bar.
And look what he turns it into.

659
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,200
Oh, and the flowers.

660
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,800
He said

661
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,680
they were for you.

662
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,160
This pear too. Don't ask me
what message he's trying to send.

663
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,440
Not bad.

664
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,320
How's that?

665
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,600
Hey, don't get mad…

666
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Wow.

667
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,120
Unbelievable.

668
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,080
- Woah.
- Well…

669
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,200
Ah…

670
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,200
You got me.

671
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,120
Come on.

672
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
Easy, easy.

673
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,760
Hey, pretty ladies!

674
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,360
- Hi, ladies.
- Hey, gorgeous.

675
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,360
- What's going on here?
- You two look amazing.

676
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,480
Mind if we sit and have a drink?

677
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,120
- Can we join?
- How old are you kids?

678
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,280
With ladies this young and beautiful?

679
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,920
- We must be about the same age.
- Exactly.

680
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,920
Sweet talkers. Fine, sit down.

681
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,160
- Great.
- Awesome.

682
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,280
- Let's hang out.
- Yeah.

683
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,000
What's the game tonight?

684
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,480
Dice?

685
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,520
You know how?

686
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
What are the rules?

687
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,520
Highest number wins.

688
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
- So, big beats small.
- Yes.

689
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,320
- Got it. Let's roll.
- Alright.

690
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,560
- Come.
- Come on.

691
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,480
I'll go first.

692
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,880
CHENG KAIRAN

693
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,080
- So?
- Looks like you lost, lady.

694
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,280
Drink up.

695
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,200
- Drink up!
- Fine.

696
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,720
- We'll drink with you.
- Yeah.

697
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,480
We'll match you.

698
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,360
Let me fill your glass.

699
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,920
- Cheers.
- Fill her glass.

700
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,560
What the hell is Li Jinyu doing?

701
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,800
Has he lost his mind?

702
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,840
It's fine.

703
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,880
SEND

704
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,040
Keep pouring.

705
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,320
Yeah, don't be stingy.

706
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,120
- YOU BETTER COME
- NOPE. WE'RE HAVING FUN TOO

707
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,440
Li Jinyu!

708
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,200
Let's grab food later.

709
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,320
Look at this.

710
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,360
Which bar is that?

711
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,720
There isn't a bar in this city
I don't know.

712
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,200
- Come with me.
- Let's go.

713
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,600
Ladies, excuse us.

714
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,840
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

715
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,720
Roll again!

716
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,280
- Lost again!
- You lost again.

717
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,920
- Fine, I'll drink.
- Again?

718
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,040
First time, huh?

719
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,880
Don't fake it. Glass has to be empty.

720
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,520
- That's right.
- Yeah, come on.

721
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,920
Bottoms up.

722
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,440
- Bottoms up!
- We're out of booze.

723
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,120
Waiter, another round!

724
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
- What would you like?
- Here.

725
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,880
One of these and another bottle of that.

726
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,320
- Got it.
- Be quick.

727
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,640
Why do I feel like

728
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,640
this just turned into their party?

729
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,840
Because they're treating us
like easy marks.

730
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,760
Time to go.

731
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,400
Yeah, let's bail.

732
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
- Don't leave.
- Don't leave yet, ladies.

733
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,760
The night's just getting started.

734
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,320
Yeah, nightlife's only warming up.

735
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,360
- That's right.
- Relax, it's still early.

736
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,400
- Stay and have fun.
- Why rush?

737
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,520
- We're leaving, Ya'en.
- There!

738
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,440
<i>Stay a little longer.</i>

739
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
- I haven't tried this wine yet.
- Let's have another drink.

740
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,480
Hey.

741
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
I'm done drinking.

742
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,480
Come on. Drink with me instead.

743
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,600
Hey, hey. Let's drink together.

744
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,880
Drink with me.

745
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,520
Having fun drinking with my wife?

746
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,920
Sorry, bro. My bad.

747
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,240
Why are you here?

748
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,640
This place belongs to a buddy of mine.
Came to hang out.

749
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Perfect timing to toast your divorce.

750
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,000
You guys carry on. I'm out.

751
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,000
- Done already?
- Later.

752
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,280
What, did we ruin the mood
showing up too early?

753
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,880
Not bad.

754
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,200
But now that you've scared the boys off,

755
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,720
who's going to keep us company?

756
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,080
We'll keep you company.

757
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,680
That's right.
We're not such a bad replacement.

758
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,320
Please. Those kids were young.
You two are already dried-up old meat.

759
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,200
Old meat?

760
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,520
We went to the same school, remember?

761
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,680
They said you're the old meat.

762
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,840
Luckily I'm already married.

763
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,640
Otherwise, I'd be stuck single like you.

764
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,400
Don't twist the knife.

765
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,640
Come on.

766
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,680
Those boys don't get you. We do.

767
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,040
Let's play a game.

768
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,520
Boring. Enough of that. I'm going dancing.

769
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Come on, Meng.

770
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,720
I'll go with her.

771
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,200
What, leaving us just like that?

772
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,920
Wait for me!

773
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,920
- You're walking too fast.
- Come.

774
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,360
We should have a drink.

775
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,840
I don't drink.

776
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
Then what are you doing in a bar?

777
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,360
I'll take Ya'en home later.

778
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,040
Fine.

779
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,560
Watch our things. I'll check on Ye Meng.

780
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,360
Excuse me.

781
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,160
Watch these for us.

782
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,240
Sure thing.

783
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,600
Ya'en!

784
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,520
- I'll take you home later.
- What?

785
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,800
I said I'll see you home later.

786
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,120
I'm not in a hurry.

787
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,480
It's my divorce day.
I'm celebrating tonight!

788
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,560
Then I'll celebrate with you.

789
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,040
Oh, so it's fine for you
to drink with other women at Gem,

790
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,960
but I can't dance with a few boys?

791
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,480
That was me playing along
with Cheng Kairan.

792
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,000
Putting on the scumbag act
to push Lin Yangyang away.

793
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,680
And I'm supposed to buy that?

794
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,920
I'm a married man.

795
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,320
I know where the line is.

796
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,760
Those boys might be fun for a night,

797
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,720
but you're the one I actually want.

798
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,480
