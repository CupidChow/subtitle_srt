RECORDING 1

6
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,960
<i>Mrs. Li, the Ningsui project</i>
<i>is ready to go.</i>

7
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>The deal for the welfare center land</i>

8
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,680
<i>is basically settled.</i>

9
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
<i>What else do you need me to do?</i>

10
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,360
Find a way

11
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,480
to get Shu Yi invested in this project.

12
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,480
Bring in all her relatives
and friends too.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,280
Once that's done,
you can take the money and leave.

14
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,520
Mrs. Li,

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,480
aren't you asking me to commit fraud?

16
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,200
This doesn't seem right.

17
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,960
<i>It's different from</i>
<i>the investment plan we discussed before.</i>

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,080
<i>If anything goes wrong,</i>

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,960
<i>I'll be left holding the bag.</i>

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,160
You've been supporting me for years.

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,840
I won't treat you poorly.

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,240
If anything goes wrong,

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,800
just keep your mouth shut,

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,760
and I'll make sure
you get a substantial compensation.

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,400
Tell you what.

26
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,360
Whatever funds you raise,

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,120
you can keep all of it.

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,000
Not cold, right?

29
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,080
Not cold.

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,320
The surgery has been scheduled.

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,720
The doctor will operate soon.

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,000
So soon?

33
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Feeling nervous?

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,800
Pfft.

35
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,320
Why would I be nervous?

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,160
At my age,

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,280
I've been through everything.

38
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,360
What's there to fear? It's just a surgery.

39
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,920
In the blink of an eye,

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,040
it'll be over.

41
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,640
Keep eating,

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,280
keep drinking, and don't overthink it.

43
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,280
The old lady is something else!

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,880
You there.

45
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,000
You should

46
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,120
take something from me. Fear nothing.

47
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,520
That's the spirit you need.

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,600
Don't hide from everything

49
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,360
that comes your way. Face it bravely.

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,320
No running.

51
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,360
Got it.

52
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,480
After today,

53
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,080
you and I,

54
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,480
let's both toughen up,

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,160
each facing our own challenges.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
Don't leave me behind.

57
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
So, it seems

58
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,440
your mom was deceived,

59
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,960
and it's closely tied to Li Lingbai.

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,040
Although it's unclear what dealings
Li Lingbai has with Wang Xingsheng,

61
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
if this recording gets leaked,

62
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,960
things will blow up.

63
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,440
BLESSING

64
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,960
Wang Xingsheng probably intended to use
this recording to blackmail Li Lingbai,

65
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,560
but now he's disappeared

66
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,400
and left me with the recording.
He wants me to go after Li Lingbai.

67
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,640
It's too risky for you to go.

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,320
Li Lingbai is no pushover.

69
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,640
If you provoke her,

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
there's no telling what she might do.

71
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,640
I have to take this gamble.

72
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,440
What about Li Jinyu?

73
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,640
Does he know about this?

74
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,040
What's on your mind?

75
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,360
I was thinking,

76
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
if that USB drive hadn't been empty,

77
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,040
but instead contained evidence
of Li Lingbai's crimes,

78
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,040
what would you choose to do?

79
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
If she really

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,560
is connected to your mom's suicide,

81
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
I would never protect her.

82
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,680
That would come at a heavy cost.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Would you hate me for it?

84
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
No matter who it is,

85
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,480
if they've done wrong,

86
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,440
they should pay the price they deserve.

87
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,960
I just hope

88
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,120
you won't feel constrained because of me.

89
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,680
But after all, she is your mom.

90
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,160
Today, Granny talked to me.

91
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,120
She said

92
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,440
no matter what happens,

93
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,000
face it bravely.

94
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,160
Don't always think about hiding.

95
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,840
Even at her age,

96
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,760
she still has that kind of courage.

97
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,960
So, we should learn from her spirit.

98
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,480
Toughen up.

99
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,880
Do what you want to do

100
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,000
and bravely face the challenges.

101
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
Okay.

102
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,120
Ms. Ye!

103
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,320
- You can't go in. Ms. Ye!
- I need to talk to her.

104
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Ms. Ye, without an appointment,
you cannot enter.

105
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Leave us.

106
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,440
So ill-mannered.

107
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,000
Is this how you were taught to behave?

108
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,000
A mother like you, what right
do you have to talk to me about manners?

109
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
What are you here for?

110
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
You should listen to this.

111
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,840
<i>Mrs. Li, aren't you afraid</i>
<i>I'll drag your friend down</i>

112
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
<i>and ruin her reputation?</i>

113
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,720
<i>She deserved it.</i>

114
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,680
Ruin her reputation?

115
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
Compared to what I've endured,

116
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,480
<i>I've already been merciful.</i>

117
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,560
What are you trying to do?

118
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,240
I want to know the truth
about what happened back then.

119
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,440
I don't know what you mean.

120
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,000
What if I leak
this recording to the media?

121
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,360
This kind of juicy gossip

122
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
is sure to attract
a lot of interest, right?

123
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,480
Li Lingbai,

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,560
you might not care about yourself,

125
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,600
but you must care
about Hanhai Group's interests.

126
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
- Hello.
- <i>Meng, come back quickly.</i>

127
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,920
<i>Return to the old house. We're all here.</i>

128
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,720
<i>Someone reported you dad.</i>

129
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,960
<i>He's been taken away for investigation.</i>

130
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm on my way back.

131
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,960
Was it your doing?

132
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,040
Here's what happened.
Second Sister asked around

133
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,400
and found out that a distributor

134
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,800
took on a project for Hanhai,
then went to your dad for a loan.

135
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,000
Your dad approved it following procedure,

136
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,840
but the guy ran off with the money.

137
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,400
Now he's been accused of loan fraud,

138
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,120
and we don't know where he's been taken.

139
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,520
If the money isn't repaid,

140
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
your dad is in real trouble.

141
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,200
Really, sis?

142
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,000
What should we do then?

143
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,880
Don't scare yourselves like this.
The investigation is still ongoing.

144
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
Did something happen to Dad?

145
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,920
Let's talk outside.

146
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,160
What's wrong?

147
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,360
That USB wasn't empty.
I deleted the files on purpose.

148
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,040
It had evidence of Li Lingbai manipulating
Wang Xingsheng to set my mom up.

149
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
Today, I went to confront Li Lingbai.

150
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,680
I had a feeling
about the USB drive all along.

151
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,200
Knowing you,

152
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,080
if you hadn't gotten hold of it,
you wouldn't have just let it go.

153
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,520
I didn't think it through.

154
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,960
I never expected Li Lingbai

155
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,160
would have set a trap
for my dad so early on.

156
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault.

157
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,960
The most urgent thing now
is to resolve Dad's situation.

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,480
Give me a few days.

159
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,040
I'll find a way.

160
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,360
Are you going to confront Li Lingbai?

161
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,600
I'm going to see someone.

162
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,080
Maybe he'll have a solution.

163
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,160
HAILAN PORT PHASE III NOW LEASING

164
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,640
<i>Badou,</i>

165
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,480
there's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

166
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,240
It's about your grandfather.

167
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,720
He's abroad and supposedly very wealthy.

168
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
I'm telling you this

169
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,160
because I don't want you to have regrets.

170
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
If you want to know about
your biological father, you can ask him.

171
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,640
I won't regret it.

172
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,200
Rejecting so quickly.

173
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,600
Are you afraid I'd mind? Don't worry.

174
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,280
Granny doesn't mind at all.

175
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,040
You'll always be my precious grandson.

176
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,960
That's not it.
I just don't want to meet him.

177
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
In my life, I've only had one father,

178
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,200
and that's Li Mu.

179
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,080
Badou,

180
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,960
some things can't be avoided.
You've been running from this for years.

181
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,840
You need to learn to face it.

182
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,880
<i>Once you've figured it out,</i>

183
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,040
<i>reach out to him.</i>

184
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,600
CANADA

185
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,640
Li Jinyu has been gone
for two days already.

186
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,040
Do you miss him too?

187
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,680
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you dialed</i>
<i>cannot be reached right now.</i>

188
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,240
<i>Please try again later.</i>

189
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,040
When are you coming back?

190
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,760
- Hello.
- <i>Meng.</i>

191
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
<i>Jiayu is missing.</i>

192
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,040
<i>The teacher said he didn't go to school</i>
<i>this afternoon. I can't reach him either.</i>

193
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
- Don't panic. I'm on my way to you now.
- Okay.

194
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,200
Ya'en.

195
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
Jiayu is missing.

196
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm going to find Chen Jian now
to see if he's there.

197
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,600
You… Don't panic. Let's…

198
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,360
Let's meet at the school gate first.

199
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,760
I have to go.

200
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,960
Car keys, phone.

201
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,360
KINDERGARTEN

202
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,200
- Ya'en!
- Ya'en!

203
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
Where is Jiayu? What happened to Jiayu?

204
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,400
The teacher…

205
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
The teacher told me Jiayu
has been missing since this afternoon.

206
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,200
They thought I picked him up.

207
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,960
Jiayu is well-behaved.
He wouldn't skip school.

208
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,160
Maybe Chen Jian picked him up?

209
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,040
No, I called him. He said no.

210
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,200
What about his classmates?
Maybe they went out together?

211
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,240
No, I've asked everyone.

212
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,680
Only Jiayu is missing.

213
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,800
- I see.
- Did something happen to him?

214
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,920
Don't panic!

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,120
Let's split up and search.
Think about where he usually goes, okay?

216
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,720
If we find him,
let's call each other right away.

217
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,520
- Let's search!
- Don't worry.

218
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,880
- Drive safely!
- I know.

219
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,880
- Drive safely!
- Okay!

220
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,040
- To the right.
- Okay.

221
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,240
- To the left.
- Okay.

222
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,520
Jiayu.

223
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,440
I'm so…

224
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,200
Hello. What's going on here?

225
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm looking for our kid.

226
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,360
Have you seen a little boy

227
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,760
with bangs and a round haircut,
about up to my height?

228
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,040
Haven't seen him. This is a film set.
Please leave.

229
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,080
Oh, you're filming.

230
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,280
- Sorry.
- Thanks for your cooperation.

231
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,800
Sorry about that, really.

232
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,640
SPIKY BEAR TRENDY PLAYTOWN

233
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,760
Excuse me. Coming through. Thank you.

234
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,800
Boss, hello. Hello, boss!

235
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,600
My friend and I came with a kid last time,

236
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,600
about this tall, with bangs
and a bowl cut, and we sat right here.

237
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,480
- Have you seen him today?
- No.

238
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
Hello.

239
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,000
Have you seen this child?

240
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,000
- Sorry, didn't notice.
- Didn't notice.

241
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,040
Thank you.

242
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,640
Sorry to bother you.
Have you seen this child?

243
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,160
No, I haven't seen him.

244
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,360
Hello, classmate.

245
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,120
Have you seen this student?

246
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,920
No.

247
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,920
- Can you take another look?
- I haven't seen him.

248
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,160
- No.
- Thank you.

249
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Jiayu.

250
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Jiayu!

251
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Jiayu!

252
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Hello. Can I ask
if either of you have seen…

253
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,960
Jiayu!

254
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Jiayu!

255
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,760
What's going on here?

256
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,680
Who did you get into a fight with?

257
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,320
- Where are they?
- None of your business!

258
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
Yu,

259
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,880
aren't we brothers? You got into a fight
and didn't even call me?

260
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,080
We were never brothers to begin with.

261
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,360
Why… did you get into a fight?

262
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,400
They were talking trash.

263
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,720
Saying my mom was with some bar owner.

264
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,720
That's why they divorced.

265
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,120
I just hate
that I couldn't take them all on.

266
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,520
Your mom and I…

267
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,840
My mom didn't cheat.

268
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,080
I know what kind of person my dad is too.

269
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,040
Their dirty mouths are their problem.

270
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,600
If I see them again,
I'll still beat them up.

271
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,120
Next time, I won't lose.

272
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,320
This is all us adults' fault.

273
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,640
We've let you down.

274
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
Don't tell Mom the truth.

275
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,440
I don't want her to worry.

276
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,440
Don't worry.

277
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,520
Ya'en,

278
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,080
I found Jiayu.

279
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,280
He's at the wetland park.

280
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,320
Does it hurt?

281
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,120
- It hurts.
- Let me take a look.

282
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,000
If he tries to hit you again,
just use your hands to protect your face.

283
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,040
Hear me?

284
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,000
- Jiayu!
- Chen Jiayu!

285
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,520
Who told you to come here by yourself?

286
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,240
You scared me to death. Come here!

287
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,240
- Ya'en, don't!
- Ya'en!

288
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,200
- Ya'en!
- Don't! Ya'en!

289
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,920
Physical punishment
isn't encouraged these days.

290
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,040
I already talked to him earlier.

291
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,600
He admitted his mistake.

292
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,960
He won't learn without punishment.

293
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,480
If anything happened to you today,
you'd regret it for the rest of your life.

294
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
- What's wrong with your neck?
- I'm fine.

295
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,880
- Let me see.
- What happened?

296
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
- How did this happen?
- How did this happen?

297
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
Where did you scrape it?

298
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,080
Mom, my classmate grabbed my stuff
and wouldn't give it back,

299
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,480
so we got into a fight.

300
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,480
Chen Jiayu, you got into a fight?

301
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,000
And these marks are from them hitting you?

302
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,440
- I'm going to see your teacher.
- No!

303
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,880
- Ya'en!
- I'm an easy target…

304
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,160
Stop!

305
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,840
It's just some roughhousing among kids.

306
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,320
No big deal.

307
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,520
When we get back,
I'll teach him a few boxing moves.

308
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
He'll definitely win next time.

309
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't worry.

310
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,200
What kind of talk is that?

311
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,080
"Next time"? What's next time
supposed to look like?

312
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,720
Broken arms and legs?

313
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,800
You were always in fights as a kid,

314
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,760
roaming the streets.
You want to teach my son?

315
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
Chen Jiayu never used to fight
until you taught him to box.

316
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,680
- That's why he got into a fight.
- Ya'en.

317
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,600
Exactly!

318
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,480
What kind of behavior is that?
All day long,

319
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,440
it's "Kai and Yu", messing around.

320
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,960
It's not just messing around.

321
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,280
What I taught him were self-defense moves.

322
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,040
Are you talking about self-defense?

323
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Does self-defense have to mean fighting?

324
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,760
He's not your son.
You don't care about him, but I do!

325
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
I don't want him fighting with others.

326
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,120
Come home!

327
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,320
Mom.

328
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,840
Go!

329
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,760
Kai, don't blame her.
She's just worried about Jiayu.

330
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,640
What's his name?

331
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,640
Speak up!

332
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,720
NINGSUI SEAFOOD

333
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,400
Come here.

334
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,240
Does it hurt, son?

335
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
Don't move. Does it hurt?

336
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,560
You had me searching
everywhere for you today,

337
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,200
and then you got into a fight.

338
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,000
And now you're the one who's angry?

339
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,280
What happened today was my fault,

340
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,320
but you shouldn't have spoken
to Kai like that just now.

341
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,160
Why can't I say that about him?

342
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,360
It's because he taught you boxing
that you fought!

343
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,280
That's not true!

344
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,680
I learned boxing
because I didn't want to be bullied.

345
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,200
Mom,

346
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,440
you said you'd respect my choices,

347
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,360
and I choose boxing.

348
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,240
I worry about you. I feel your pain.

349
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,880
I am afraid of these incidents.

350
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Mom,

351
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,160
I'm not the center of your life.

352
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,320
If you cluck around me every single day,

353
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,680
I feel like I'm suffocating.

354
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
Then, Jiayu, you have to promise Mom

355
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,640
that no matter what happens in the future,

356
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,920
you cannot let me lose track of you.

357
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,880
Promise me.

358
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,720
Mom,

359
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,640
I'm not a kid anymore.

360
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,360
Does it hurt?

361
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
- Will you fight again?
- No, I won't.

362
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,640
Alright, go rest now.

363
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,320
Don't get it wet.

364
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,600
Don't move. Go on.

365
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,080
You can leave first.

366
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,640
- Okay.
- I'll lock up.

367
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,200
I'll get going then.

368
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,320
<i>He's not your son.</i>
<i>You don't care about him, but I do!</i>

369
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,960
<i>I won't let him</i>
<i>get into fights with others.</i>

370
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,120
<i>You were always in fights as a kid,</i>

371
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,560
<i>roaming the streets.</i>
<i>You want to teach my son?</i>

372
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,440
<i>What I said today was too much.</i>
<i>Please don't take it to heart.</i>

373
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
<i>It's fine.</i>

374
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,400
THE RISING SUN ILLUMINATES

375
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,160
Meng.

376
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,840
Dad.

377
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,040
- Alright.
- You're finally back.

378
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,920
See? I'm perfectly fine.

379
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
Did you suffer a lot?

380
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,720
Not at all. What are you talking about?

381
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,080
Actually, I was quite lucky this time.

382
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,200
The borrower turned himself in

383
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,200
and cleared my name.

384
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,760
As for that project,

385
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,680
it wasn't some empty shell for loan fraud.

386
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,320
Hanhai genuinely intended to carry it out.

387
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,120
As long as you're okay.

388
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
You must have been worried sick, right?

389
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,160
Of course, I was worried.

390
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,040
But most of all, it's Grandma.

391
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,040
She's frantic.

392
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,360
Look at me. My trouble caused

393
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,840
everyone so much worry.

394
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,320
How about we go have dinner
at Grandma's tonight?

395
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,800
Get going. I need to make a phone call.

396
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,720
Okay.

397
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,280
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello.

398
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,040
Dad's back.

399
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,880
<i>I know.</i>

400
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
What about you?

401
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,880
When are you coming back?

402
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,680
<i>Turn around.</i>

403
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,920
Why didn't you tell me before?

404
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,640
I wanted to surprise you.

405
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,120
Honey,

406
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,200
I just realized I can't live without you.

407
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,240
Dear,

408
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm home now, aren't I?

409
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,000
What are you up to?

410
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,280
Tell me the truth.

411
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,080
Did you go find Li Lingbai?

412
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,600
I didn't contact her.

413
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
I went abroad

414
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,360
to meet my grandfather.

415
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,520
Granny gave me his contact info
before she was hospitalized.

416
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,760
Honestly, I never planned to see him

417
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,320
and thought I'd never have

418
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,440
a connection with him in this lifetime.

419
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,280
But after meeting him,
I realized it wasn't a big deal.

420
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
If it weren't for me,

421
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,200
you wouldn't have had to see him.

422
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Not entirely.

423
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,160
I also wanted to know
what happened back then.

424
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,960
I had to face it sonner or later.

425
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,440
And it's not like I lost out.

426
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,280
The old man's loaded.

427
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,240
Even richer than Li Lingbai.

428
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,400
The money my dad used
to settle the accounts was from him?

429
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,640
No.

430
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,520
All of this
was orchestrated by Li Lingbai.

431
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,000
The old man
tracked down that lending company

432
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,280
and got the money back.

433
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Li Jinyu,

434
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
thank you.

435
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,600
Just a "thank you", and that's it?

436
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,560
What do you want, then?

437
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,240
Let me lean on you and nap for a bit.

438
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,880
<i>I'll take care of Bai's situation for you.</i>

439
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,960
<i>As for the past,</i>

440
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,800
<i>some things are better left unsaid.</i>

441
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,160
Look at you all with those long faces.

442
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,760
It's just a surgery.
I'll be out in no time.

443
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,520
You better mean it, Granny.

444
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,200
You promised to see me off to college.

445
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,000
Study hard. I'll be waiting for you.

446
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,160
Don't be scared, Juhua.

447
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,280
You'll just take a nap.
It'll be over before you know it.

448
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,680
I'll be waiting for you.

449
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,480
Don't worry.

450
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,120
Badou, give me your hand.

451
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,040
Meng.

452
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,440
Take good care of each other.

453
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,480
Once you're out, focus on recovering.
Then we'll visit the tea mountains, okay?

454
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,800
Hang in there.

455
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,600
Take care now. Don't worry.

456
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,000
- I'm going in.
- Stay strong.

457
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,000
Granny, stay strong.

458
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,680
We'll take the patient into surgery.
Please wait outside.

459
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,920
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

460
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,560
Chairman Li,

461
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,520
I just got a call.

462
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,440
Someone stepped in
to resolve Ye Kang's situation.

463
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,480
How did Li Jinyu manage to pull this off?

464
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
It wasn't Li Jinyu.

465
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
- It was…
- It was me.

466
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,400
Lingbai is right here.

467
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,800
Chairman Wang, it's been a while
since I last saw you here.

468
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,920
If I didn't come to the company today,

469
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,160
I'd have no idea how badly
you've messed up Hanhai.

470
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,360
That stunt you pulled at Hailan Harbor

471
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,160
caused Hanhai's stocks to plummet.

472
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,200
The board members
are highly dissatisfied with you.

473
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,480
If you can't manage the company properly,
it's time to step down.

474
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,080
Chairman Wang, you must be joking.

475
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,720
I've dedicated myself diligently
to this position for years.

476
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,200
Moreover,
as the largest shareholder of Hanhai,

477
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,360
how can you force me to step down?

478
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,720
Chairman Li's acquired shares from several
minority shareholders of the group.

479
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,160
Furthermore, a number of veteran
shareholders are now backing him.

480
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Li Changjin,

481
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,720
along with his grandson

482
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,520
Li Jinyu, collectively holds
15% of the shares.

483
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,320
Who do you think really controls Hanhai?

484
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,360
So, you're all ganging up against me now?

485
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,880
As for me,

486
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,200
I only care about the group's interests.

487
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,800
Who sits in that position is irrelevant.

488
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,680
I came today to inform you.

489
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,000
Rather than being ousted
by the board later,

490
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,200
it's better to resign now
and leave with some dignity.

491
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,400
You can't even handle
your own family affairs.

492
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
How can we entrust the group to you?

493
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,720
Handle something for me.

494
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,840
- You must be thirsty.
- Not really.

495
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,000
Have some water.

496
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,200
OPERATING ROOM
DOCTOR-PATIENT CONSULTATION ROOM

497
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,040
The doctor's out.

498
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,720
He's out.

499
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,480
- How did it go?
- Doctor, what's the status?

500
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,960
The surgery went well.

501
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
Don't worry. Follow
the post-operative care instructions.

502
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,480
- Thank you.
- We appreciate it, Doctor.

503
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,720
Thank you.

504
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,120
That's such a relief.

505
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,800
Why don't you take Grandma home first?

506
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,760
Grandma, let me take you home first.

507
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,280
After that, I'll get Granny Tou
some clean clothes to change into.

508
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Alright,

509
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,520
we'll head back now.
Meng will come pick you up later.

510
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,320
- Get some rest early, Grandma.
- Okay.

511
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,760
We're heading off.

512
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,600
- Take care on the road, Meng.
- Take care.

513
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,000
- You must be exhausted.
- I'm fine.

514
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,080
All good now, brother.

515
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,880
<i>You there.</i>

516
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,240
You should take something from me.
Fear nothing. That's the spirit you need.

517
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,440
<i>Don't hide from everything</i>
<i>that comes your way.</i>

518
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,440
<i>Face it bravely.</i>

519
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
<i>No running.</i>

520
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,040
What are you doing?

521
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,880
