1
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:11,901
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:15,515
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,300
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,829
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:25,981
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:31,229
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:34,717
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:38,181
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:42,813
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:49,085
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:53,821
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:55,901
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,901 --> 00:01:01,085
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:03,101
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:06,069
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,965
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:11,293
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:13,348
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,325
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:20,340
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,757
 

22
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,184
 

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,040
I've done everything you asked.
Where's the surveillance footage?

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,520
Assign me the Hailan Bay project
and I'll delete the footage right away.

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Don't push your luck.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,800
Don't be so harsh.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,240
I just want to share your burdens, Mom.
Is that wrong?

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,760
Stop pretending to be obedient.
You came back for revenge, didn't you?

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,840
True. Actually, you know me well.

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,160
So why would you make things hard for me?

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,000
This petty project means nothing to you.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Let me take over
and I'll delete the footage right away.

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,720
And I'll keep my mouth shut
about Wang Xing Sheng's disappearance.

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Fine. Deal.

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,440
But I don't want to
hear about Wang Xing Sheng again.

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,400
You know how I do business. Don't ask for trouble.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,040
Rest assured. I just want what's rightfully mine.

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,240
I hate to make things ugly
unless it's my last resort.

39
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,600
We're family after all. You're my beloved mother.

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,520
I'll take my leave now, Ms. Li. See you tonight.

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Mr. Wang, forget about the mess of Hailan Bay.
It's someone else's problem now.

42
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,240
Welcome.

43
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,680
- You'll see her soon.
- Welcome.

44
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
- Hello.
- Everyone's inside.

45
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,240
Jin Yu! I've missed you so much.
You're finally back.

46
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,000
How could you be so cold? You never visited us.

47
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,960
Enough. People might think I wronged you.

48
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,760
Come on, let's drink.

49
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,320
What's wrong? Why aren't you
drinking with our buddy?

50
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,976
Stop calling him "buddy".
Has he ever texted you all these years?

51
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,080
Nonsense. We're the Three Musketeers in Jiangbei.

52
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,240
That's still a thing? I thought you'd replaced me.

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,560
We did. Long ago.

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,600
Ye Meng, come meet everyone.

55
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,600
This is Ye Meng, our company's beauty.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,360
She's not just pretty
but also exceptionally skilled.

57
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,760
Ye Meng, this is Li Jin Yu I've mentioned,

58
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,840
Gou Kai's innocent childhood friend.

59
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,800
He owns 15% of Hanhai Group's shares.

60
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
It may sound insignificant, but it's a lot.

61
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,840
We've met before.

62
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,000
My mistake for not recognizing
Mr. Li's wealth earlier.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,040
Lucky by birth. I'm jealous.

64
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Hi, everyone.

65
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,440
- Ms. Li.
- Ms. Li.

66
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,680
Jin Yu has finally grown up and become mature.

67
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,000
He volunteered to share my burdens.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,840
Now we can work together as a family.

69
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,640
Sometimes I regret sending him abroad so young.

70
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,040
I felt guilty, worried he'd go astray.

71
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,640
But he excelled academically
and remained a perfect son.

72
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,480
As your mom, I'm truly proud of you.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now, he has the support of his best friends.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,040
It makes me so happy. Let's drink.

75
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Yeah. Brothers forever. Ye Meng.

76
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Come on.

77
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,800
To our success.

78
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
Cheers.

80
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,520
Alright, keep chatting. I'll greet others.

81
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,800
Okay.

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Don't drink too much.

83
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,560
Mr. Li is such a talented young man
and a great son. How rare.

84
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,200
Stop flattering me. But we can talk over drinks
if you're interested.

85
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,360
Ye Meng can't drink. I'll drink on her behalf.

86
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,800
Who are you to drink on her behalf?

87
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,880
Isn't she married?

88
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,200
That's just a rumor. I know my employees.

89
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm going to the restroom.

90
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Gou Kai's relentless.
He even follows her to the bathroom.

91
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,480
Can't you tell? He's pursuing Ye Meng.

92
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Are you mad at me?

93
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,520
Gou Kai, isn't it obvious?

94
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Didn't I tell you I'm married? Learn boundaries.

95
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,360
You keep saying you're married. To whom?

96
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,200
Let me see the guy.

97
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,000
Aren't you dating someone, too? Where is she from?

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,280
Ningsui.

99
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,800
Ye Meng's husband is also from Ningsui.
Do you know who he is?

100
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,200
What's wrong with you?
Why are you obsessing over my husband?

101
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,480
Are you having a crush on him?

102
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,320
What are you talking about?
I'm just concerned about you.

103
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
Yes, I do.

104
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Who is it?

105
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,920
It's me.

106
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
Fine. May I use the restroom now, Mr. Gou?

107
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Sure.

108
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,120
Thank you. Where are you going?

109
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,480
To the men's room. Okay?

110
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,080
This is ridiculous. Stop messing around.

111
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,520
What's wrong with everyone?

112
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,640
What are you doing? Let me go.

113
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
Back to Gou Kai?

114
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,120
You pretended not to know me. What's going on now?

115
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,440
Are you scared that Gou Kai might be upset?

116
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:19,400
Yeah, I'm terrified. But you're
even more scared than me, aren't you?

117
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,560
They have decent wine here.
Want to get a bottle for your mom, Mr. Li?

118
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,040
It's hard to get a cab here.
Let me give you a ride.

119
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,440
No need.

120
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,640
My lawyer friend dug up something
on Wang Xing Sheng. I'll tell you on the way.

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,040
Let me give Miss Ye a ride.
We've all been drinking.

122
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,720
My driver has arrived. Safety first.

123
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,840
No need. You're the client.
I couldn't possibly trouble you.

124
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,920
I'll ride back with Mr. Gou.

125
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,480
My driver's been waiting.
Who doesn't have a driver these days? Let's go.

126
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,600
I could use a ride.

127
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,400
Go home by yourself.

128
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,480
You...

129
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,360
How are you getting back?

130
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Want a ride?

131
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,040
Great, give me a ride then. Thanks.
I live kind of far, though.

132
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,840
No problem.

133
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,200
Don't take it personally.
Li Jin Yu's always like this.

134
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,040
Tai Ming Xiao said Li Jin Yu's girlfriend
is also from Ningsui. Do you know each other?

135
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
No, we don't.

136
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,160
Good, you'd better keep your distance from him.

137
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,800
That guy was trouble overseas,

138
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,120
hanging out with hooligans,

139
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,090
smoking, fighting, and drinking.

140
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,200
Completely wild.

141
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,680
You saw it earlier. He put on
that innocent act in front of Li Ling Bai.

142
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
So pretentious.

143
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,440
Mr. Li had an eventful time overseas.

144
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,360
You're interested in him?

145
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,200
Could you stop being crazy?
Tell me about Wang Xing Sheng.

146
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,960
Tell me who your husband is,
and I'll tell you about Wang Xing Sheng.

147
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I just don't get it. Why are you so curious?

148
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,280
He's just a guy from the town, nothing special.

149
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,160
Then what do you see in him?

150
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,840
Tell me about Wang Xing Sheng, or I'm getting out.

151
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,520
Someone's following us.

152
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,920
Lose them.

153
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,920
Wang Xing Sheng has been convicted of
something like illegal fundraising.

154
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,640
He acquired a land plot in Ningsui.

155
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,200
The project failed due to broken capital chains.
Later, the Hanhai Group acquired the land.

156
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,120
That's the history of Hailan Bay.

157
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,200
When did it happen?

158
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,160
In August 2016.

159
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,880
August 2016?

160
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,520
 You know how I do business. Don't ask for trouble. 

161
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,736
I can't shake them off.

162
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:18,080
 

163
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,040
In July 2016, my mother committed suicide.

164
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,800
Then Wang Xing Sheng went to prison.

165
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,520
Six months later, Hanhai Group took over.
This is too much of a coincidence.

166
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,280
You suspect your mom's suicide
is connected to Wang Xing Sheng's fraud?

167
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,160
Yeah, that's right.

168
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Change of plans. Head back.

169
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,680
You were following me in case
Gou Kai came to the hotel with me?

170
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,480
I'm here to see my wife.

171
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,040
I'll call the police.

172
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm your husband. It's not trespassing.

173
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,520
Fine.

174
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Let's get divorced.

175
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,491
 

176
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
What do you mean?

177
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,560
What do you think?

178
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,720
I went back to Li Ling Bai
to investigate your mom's case.

179
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,000
You don't know Li Ling Bai.

180
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,072
 She's not as easy to handle as you think. 

181
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,760
 She's always been ruthless. 

182
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,680
 I suspect she's already making moves. 

183
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,000
 So let me look into Wang Xing Sheng, okay? 

184
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,120
Or you'll be in danger.

185
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,320
Listen, I'll get to the bottom of it
no matter how dangerous it is.

186
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,400
Why do I feel I don't know you anymore?

187
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,600
Li Jin Yu, I'm exhausted.

188
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,520
I'm done guessing whether you're lying.
Just sign the papers.

189
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,720
Ye Meng.

190
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,192
 ♫ You ♫ 

191
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,368
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

192
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,583
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

193
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,384
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

194
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:34,304
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

195
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,504
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

196
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,928
 

197
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,944
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

198
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:47,072
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

199
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:53,056
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

200
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:57,024
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

201
00:17:57,024 --> 00:18:03,040
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

202
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:07,360
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

203
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,944
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

204
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:17,024
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

205
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:20,800
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

206
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:27,032
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

207
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:31,869
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

208
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:34,825
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

209
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:36,992
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

210
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:41,792
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

211
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,936
 ♫ But why ♫ 

212
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:47,456
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

213
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:52,509
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫ 

214
00:18:56,503 --> 00:19:00,993
 

215
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,360
 
 He was a witness in my mom's suicide case. 

216
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,200
 But he still hasn't confessed to me. 

217
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,440
 I suspect Li Ling Bai has something to do
with my mom's death. 

218
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,840
Oh my god. Are you saying
Li Jin Yu is a secret rich heir?

219
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
His mom might be related to your mom's death?

220
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,400
And you've gone from spouses to enemies.

221
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,440
I didn't realize how dramatic it would sound.

222
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,600
I don't know this version of Li Jin Yu.

223
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,200
I even suspect that
the one in Ningsui is his twin.

224
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,880
So what's your plan?

225
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,760
I'll divorce him when the time comes.

226
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Listen, getting divorced
isn't as simple as you think.

227
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,960
I've been sorting through transfer records
and financial statements recently.

228
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,360
It's been driving me crazy.

229
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,520
Forget it. Enough complaining. Get some sleep.

230
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,640
I need to open the store early.

231
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,160
Goodnight.

232
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,960
Goodnight.

233
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,416
 

234
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
Ya En.

235
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Hello, Mai.

236
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,040
My friend's birthday is coming up.

237
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,120
Could you help me pick a dress as a gift?

238
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,240
Sure. How old is she?

239
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,760
About my age.

240
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,640
What style does she usually wear?

241
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,280
Something lively and colorful.
She loves vibrant patterns.

242
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,080
How about pairing these together?

243
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
That works.

244
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
That's it, then?

245
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,360
- Okay.
- Alright.

246
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,760
How much is it? I'll pay via WeChat.

247
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,760
No need. I'll put it on Mr. Cheng's account.

248
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,160
That's not right. Kai will scold me.

249
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,000
I just won't tell him.

250
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,120
Alright, you're so good to me.

251
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,400
Don't mention it.

252
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,360
What brings you here today?
Did your boss give you time off?

253
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,120
We've been slow lately.

254
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,520
Kai's too overwhelmed to keep an eye on me.

255
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
What happened?

256
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,980
It's infuriating.

257
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,000
Someone's targeting our bar,

258
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,240
flooding us with fake bad reviews.

259
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,000
Our business... keeps declining because of this.

260
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,280
Did Kai offend someone?

261
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,960
I-I don't really know.

262
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,800
Ya En, don't tell anyone I told you.

263
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,680
I won't. I promise.

264
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,360
- Alright, I have to leave.
- Okay.

265
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

266
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,840
Bye.

267
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Bye.

268
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,080
Who could he have offended?

269
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,320
Oh no.

270
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,824
 

271
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,160
Why are you here during business hours?
Don't you have work today?

272
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,440
Are you hiding something?

273
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,000
How could I hide anything from you?

274
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,560
Unless I want an early death.

275
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:54,640
 

276
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,000
What's this?

277
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,360
Business is slow.
I'm just boosting sales with promotions.

278
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,680
Business has its ups and downs.

279
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,800
It's normal.

280
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,520
It's because of Chen Jian, isn't it?

281
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,040
Who's the snitch?

282
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,720
You think I can't read reviews?

283
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,000
It's not really because of his bad reviews.

284
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,440
That jerk! He deserves worse
than just a bucket of paint.

285
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,600
You threw paint at him?
You're not in trouble, right?

286
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm fine. I just paid some compensation.

287
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,040
Let me handle this next time.

288
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,440
Don't worry about me.
Business will go back to normal.

289
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,480
Kai.

290
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,720
I think we should keep our distance.

291
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,640
My problems with Chen Jian shouldn't involve you.

292
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,480
I don't mind being involved.

293
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,800
But gossip spreads fast.
No one listens to explanations.

294
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,600
People might misunderstand us.

295
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,144
I-I'm not scared of gossip.

296
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:24,440
I visit you because...
I-I really like Jia Yu. We get along well.

297
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,680
You can't stop me from visiting
just because people might gossip.

298
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,920
M-My bar is already struggling.

299
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Now you won't let me see my best friend?

300
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:43,200
Wait, why are you crying
all of a sudden? Stop crying.

301
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,360
Anyway, let's meet less often.

302
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,080
But you can text me. Okay?

303
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,640
No! If you stop me from visiting...

304
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,760
What should I do now?

305
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,280
Seriously.

306
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,760
Mai, Kai is crying. Talk to him.

307
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:06,600
It's not that I'm weak. I'm heartbroken.

308
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
 

309
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,400
Let me check again.

310
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,040
Alright, hurry.

311
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,200
Why did you come?

312
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,840
Mr. Gou doesn't seem happy to see me, huh?

313
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,640
Nonsense. But shouldn't you be heading
to the new project? Why are you back?

314
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,880
How else could I confront you, Mr. Gou?

315
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:52,040
Why did you suddenly transfer me away
and bring Ye Meng back?

316
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,320
Didn't you promise to bring me back
after Hailan Bay's opening?

317
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,480
Something came up.
We'll transfer you back after the new project.

318
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,480
You're still lying. What am I to you?

319
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,760
Obviously, a star employee.

320
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,680
I apologize if I led you
to misunderstand something.

321
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,280
But we're strictly professional. Nothing more.

322
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,520
So you've been using me from the start.

323
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,800
You approached me and gave me the project
just to undermine Ye Meng.

324
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,560
Now that Ye Meng's back, I'm useless to you.

325
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,920
So you're kicking me aside now?

326
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,480
I approached you? You approached me first.

327
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,160
The project was Ye Meng's to begin with.
I assigned it to you temporarily.

328
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,320
Now that she's back,
she'll get the project back, right?

329
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,240
You're shameless.

330
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,560
Don't you know Ye Meng is married?

331
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,560
Yeah, I do.

332
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,680
Listen. I'm done playing your games.

333
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,000
I quit.

334
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,400
Don't you adore Ye Meng?

335
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,160
Then I'll pray you keep loving her forever.

336
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,920
I'll be waiting for your downfall.

337
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,440
Thank you. Please wait.

338
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,200
I'm sorry for leaving abruptly.

339
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,080
There's a lot of work to hand over to you.

340
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,520
It's okay. Don't blame yourself.

341
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,360
It's sudden, but Gou Kai
wronged you in the first place.

342
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,040
I'd quit too. What's your next move?

343
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,240
- Haven't decided yet.
- Here's your coffee.

344
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,040
I may take a break in my hometown.

345
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,800
Thanks.

346
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
Sounds alright.

347
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,400
The Hailan Bay project has a new manager?
Will they replace the whole team?

348
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,920
No, don't worry. The new manager is our friend.

349
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,560
He is Ms. Li's son and Gou Kai's childhood friend.

350
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,640
I thought Ms. Li's son was in elementary school.

351
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,560
Not Li Zhuo Feng, but Li Jin Yu.

352
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,920
Which Li Jin Yu?

353
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,080
It's a difficult name.

354
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,480
J-I-N. Y-U. He was my college roommate.
He's also from Ningsui.

355
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,080
Do you know him?

356
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,040
No, but the name rings a bell.

357
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,200
I knew it.

358
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,480
Can I ask you something?

359
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,360
You've been in Ningsui for so long.
Have you ever seen Ye Meng's husband?

360
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,280
What does he do?
What does he look like? So mysterious.

361
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,320
No, I haven't met him. I'm busy.

362
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,160
I have to go. Let's talk next time.

363
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,960
Where are you going?

364
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,240
Who is her husband?

365
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Mr. Gou.

366
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,520
Meng.

367
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,360
The new manager
of the Hailan Bay project is my acquaintance.

368
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,000
Relax. Don't be nervous.

369
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Okay.

370
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,200
Li Jin Yu.

371
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,840
Hi, everyone. I have an announcement to make.

372
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,440
From now on, I'll be in charge
of the Hailan Bay project.

373
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,160
We know each other well, so I'll be direct.

374
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,480
I won't outsource PR anymore.
I've built my own team.

375
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,560
As for the project...

376
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,160
I'll be in charge.

377
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,880
Mr. Gou, long time no see.

378
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,240
Mr. Li, our team passed rigorous evaluations
and signed the contract with you.

379
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,160
You can't just cancel our collaboration.
Are you joking?

380
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,360
This is no joke.

381
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,160
As the project manager,
I have every right to make changes.

382
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,296
Really?

383
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:12,680
The contract clearly states

384
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,600
that unless the service provider
makes major errors,

385
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,640
the client can't terminate the contract at will.

386
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,680
I've reviewed your new trial operation plan.

387
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Our evaluation says it's subpar.
Does that sound like a solid reason?

388
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,760
Of course, you can
end our cooperation for any reason.

389
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,680
But we can choose not to accept it.

390
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,160
Contracts legally bind both parties.

391
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,440
If you disrespect contract terms,
we'll file a lawsuit.

392
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,080
Go ahead. Think you can win the lawsuit?

393
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,520
The result doesn't matter.
Hailan Bay's trial opening is starting soon.

394
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,480
If we sue now, negative publicity would likely

395
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,720
delay the trial opening.

396
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,560
I hear Hanhai Group values this project.
Is this what you want?

397
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,080
The team can stay, but redo the plan.

398
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,880
Mr. Li.

399
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,560
Sure.

400
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,760
Submit the new plan by Monday.

401
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,920
Don't force it if you can't do it.
Just pack up and leave.

402
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Meng, one week...

403
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,040
No problem.

404
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,360
Don't worry about the shops at Hailan Bay.

405
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,560
New operations officer
Cheng Kai Ran will handle it.

406
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,440
With the opening approaching, everyone is pressed
for time and can't afford to run around.

407
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,800
Please stay here for now. Alright?

408
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,600
Mr. Gou.

409
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,520
Is there anything else? We have work to do.

410
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:13,920
Mr. Li, please don't interfere with my work.
Don't forget our agreement.

411
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,920
Clothes really make the man.
You've hidden yourself well.

412
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,080
What do you want?

413
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,400
Let's talk about Ye Meng.

414
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,360
People don't know that you're married.

415
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,360
Including your best friends Gou Kai,
Tai Ming Xiao, and even your mom.

416
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,280
Don't try anything. Ye Meng and I
are already processing our divorce.

417
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,840
Out of nowhere?

418
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,960
I just joined the company.
I need a marriage alliance to secure my position.

419
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,760
Ye Meng is not my choice.

420
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,920
Well done. Such a good actor.

421
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,160
Do you have to fake a divorce to protect Ye Meng?

422
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,760
I know what she's investigating.

423
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,240
What do you want?

424
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,320
Replace Gou Kai's team and make me
the PR head of the Hailan Bay project.

425
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,200
Otherwise,

426
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,520
I wonder how Li Ling Bai would react
to the news of your marriage.

427
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,360
Mr. Cheng, this way please.

428
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,760
Mr. Li, Mr. Cheng is here.

429
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,000
Here. Bring me that contract.

430
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,600
Yes, Mr. Li.

431
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,160
Why did you ask me to meet
at Ye Meng's company? Where is she?

432
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,040
She went out for lunch.

433
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,480
Then what are you doing, sitting in her chair?

434
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,960
This is my company.

435
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,320
It's only been a few...

436
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,480
Mr. Li, here you are.

437
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,080
Wait, what did you call him?

438
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,640
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li?

439
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,280
Is she an actress? How much is your daily wage?

440
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,160
Mr. Li, what does your friend mean?

441
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,200
Go back to work.

442
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,560
Yes, sir.

443
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,000
So devoted. Great actress, my friend.

444
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,320
Come on. Take a look.

445
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,360
I want you to manage the shops at Hailan Bay.

446
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,360
 
Li Jin Yu, Legal Representative of Hailan Bay...

447
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,440
Nice prop work. "General Manager".

448
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:52,960
 

449
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,000
It really is you.

450
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,640
How did you become
the general manager of Hailan Bay

451
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,800
after just a few days in Jiangbei?

452
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,160
My mom owns Hanhai Group.

453
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,480
So you're giving me the shop management rights...

454
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,840
Since you have experience managing Jubaoshi,
it's better to entrust this job to you.

455
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,440
How convenient. I don't buy it. Tell me the truth.

456
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,720
Or I won't help, no matter how much you pay.

457
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Ye Meng is divorcing me.

458
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,800
Why? What happened?

459
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,660
My mom might be related to her mom's suicide.
I want her to stop investigating.

460
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,280
It's not that I won't help...

461
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,680
But why not just tell Ye Meng directly?

462
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't let this ruin your marriage.

463
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm afraid my mom might target Ye Meng
if she finds out about the investigation.

464
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,040
You know, Wang Xing Sheng
may be gone because of my mom.

465
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,560
The company's full of her informants.
I need your help.

466
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,040
But no one can know.

467
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,240
If Fang Ya En finds out

468
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,968
that I helped you instead of Ye Meng,

469
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,960
we're both doomed.

470
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,440
We're different.

471
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,400
How are we different?

472
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,440
Even at your worst, you're only staying in place.

473
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,480
You're so mean...

474
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,480
Mr. Li, coming back to this,

475
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,650
you really need to make it up to Ye Meng.

476
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,760
This is serious.

477
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,720
Meanwhile, I'll do as you say.

478
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,160
See you around. Mr. Li.

479
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,800
This counts, right?

480
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,200
Of course.

481
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,080
I knew you had potential when I interviewed you.

482
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,200
My buddy, love you. Text me if anything comes up.

483
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,280
 
What?

484
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,784
As soon as Li Jin Yu took over
the Hailan Bay project,

485
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:33,960
he kicked you out
and brought back his ex, Jiang Lu Zhi?

486
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,200
Yeah, I never expected him to go this far.

487
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,800
But that makes no sense. Why would he do that?

488
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,240
The strangest part is that Jiang Lu Zhi
didn't expose my relationship with Li Jin Yu.

489
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,560
I suspect she made some deal with him.

490
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Also, Li Jin Yu put Kai in charge of
the Hailan Bay's shops.

491
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,560
Kai? What's Li Jin Yu trying to do?

492
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,640
He's hindering my investigation.

493
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,680
 Right. Look into Kai. Find out what they're up to. 

494
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,360
Alright. Kai can't keep secrets. Leave it to me.

495
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,120
 Let's stay in touch. 

496
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
Okay.

497
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
Bye.

498
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,360
Mom, what happened to Kai?

499
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,280
Nothing. He's fine. Go to sleep.

500
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,400
The food was great today. I think I gained weight.

501
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800
Get back to revising the proposal.

502
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,520
Meng, it's the tenth revised version.

503
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,720
See if it needs further improvements.

504
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,272
 

505
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,280
Ye Meng.

506
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,320
This is my home. Yours is over there.

507
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,120
Wait.

508
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,760
Do you need anything?

509
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,000
Why aren't you going in?

510
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,720
Hello, what's up?

511
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,920
Nothing much.
It's just that I fought with Ye Meng.

512
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,280
What?

513
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,200
But you can't tell Grandma.

514
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,520
Make sure they don't come to my place tonight.

515
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,920
Rest assured, my lips are sealed.
I won't breathe a word.

516
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,320
Hi, Granny. Jin Yu and Ye Meng had a huge fight.

517
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
- What?
- He just called me crying.

518
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,680
He was sobbing... So heartbroken.
What should we do, Granny?

519
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,480
Enough.

520
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,120
Hello. Why are you calling?

521
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,320
Meng and Jin Yu fought.
Meng even mentioned divorce.

522
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,120
What? They can't get divorced.

523
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,760
Did you fight?

524
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,520
Of course not. We're perfectly fine.

525
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,760
I'm new to the company, so I want to
discuss work strategies with Manager Ye.

526
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,800
Grandmas, why are you both here?

527
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,600
We brought chicken soup.

528
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
Let's go in.

529
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,120
Get in. Open the door.

530
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,560
Come on.

531
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,360
Be careful.

532
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,605
 ♫ You ♫ 

533
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:42,781
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

534
00:42:43,677 --> 00:42:45,996
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

535
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:52,797
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

536
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:58,717
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

537
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:02,877
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

538
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:05,341
 ♫ Go ♫ 

539
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:07,357
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

540
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:11,485
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

541
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:17,469
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

542
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:21,437
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

543
00:43:21,437 --> 00:43:27,453
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

544
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:31,773
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

545
00:43:31,773 --> 00:43:35,357
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

546
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:41,437
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

547
00:43:41,437 --> 00:43:46,198
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

548
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:51,445
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

549
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:56,282
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

550
00:43:56,282 --> 00:43:59,238
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

551
00:43:59,238 --> 00:44:01,405
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

552
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:06,205
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

553
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:08,349
 ♫ But why ♫ 

554
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:11,869
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

555
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:16,922
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
