00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,920
OUTPATIENT

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,840
GENERAL PRACTICE, PEDIATRICS

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,080
Come, let me take over.

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,200
You rest a bit.

6
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,200
You come running over now
to play the devoted dad?

7
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,080
When the teacher called you at noon,
why didn't you pick up?

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,960
Stuck in another
unavoidable business lunch, I suppose?

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,560
I know you resent me.

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,720
I'm not a good father, nor a good husband.

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,200
But these banquets and drinking parties…

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,400
You think I want to go?

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,280
I go to those parties
to grovel and flatter until I'm sick.

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,960
I ended up in the hospital multiple times!
You think I do this for myself?

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,960
Jiayu's tutoring,

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,120
summer camps, trips…

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,840
Do you have any idea what they cost?

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,520
With the company downsizing,

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,880
if I don't suck up to them,

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
- how could you handle all this alone?
- Fine. Save your excuses.

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,280
Tomorrow,

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,400
we sign the divorce agreement.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,480
I don't want your child support.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,120
Just give me Jiayu.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,520
Really? You insist on taking it this far?

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,400
Did I really choose to take it this far?

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,080
If we really divorce,

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,400
our child becomes
"that kid with divorced parents."

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,640
Will his classmates mock him?

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,840
When he's sick or at school events,

31
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,280
- other kids have both parents there.
- Keep your voice down.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,240
LAB RESULTS

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,600
Only he's with a single parent.

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
You think that won't break him?

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,640
This town runs on gossip.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,160
How can you let him endure
a lifetime of whispers?

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,080
You are aware now?

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,200
I know it's meaningless to say this now,

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,360
but think carefully.

40
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,520
In this world, besides me,
what man could ever

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,680
love him like I do?

42
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,520
Just think about the child.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
- Give him a complete family.
- Stop raising your voice.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,760
This divorce,
it's not some impulsive whim of yours.

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
Kai.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
The lab results are out.

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,480
Should we have the doctor review them?

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Thank you.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
I'll handle this as his father.

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,240
Thanks, Kai.

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,160
For getting Jiayu to the hospital today.

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,160
How much did you spend?
I'll transfer it to you.

53
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
Not much. Don't worry about it.

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Don't.

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
You're not family to Jiayu.

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,280
My son's expenses aren't your burden.
How much? I'm transferring it.

57
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,080
I said no need.

58
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Look, you must be busy with your business.

59
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,960
Frankly, I think you should stop
dropping by our house so often.

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,400
People might talk. It's not appropriate.

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,960
Enough of your nonsense, Chen Jian.

62
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,280
Ignore him, Kai. Thank you.

63
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
I'll head out now.

64
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,000
If you need anything else,

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,160
- just call anytime.
- Alright.

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,760
Get back safely.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,040
Stop pretending to be the good guy here.

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,920
He was kind enough to bring Jiayu here.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,320
- None of his business.
- Mom!

70
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
- Son, you're awake.
- You're awake.

71
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,200
- Easy, easy now.
- How are you feeling?

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,520
Still not well?

73
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,080
Why is Dad here?

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,280
Of course, I came.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
I heard you were sick.
Did you think I wouldn't worry?

76
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,800
NINGSUI CIVIL AFFAIRS BUREAU

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,720
Chen Jian,
pulling your disappearing act again?

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,080
How many times is this now?

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Are you sure?

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Is Jiayu feeling better?

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,760
He's bouncing off to school,
full of energy.

82
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Because of Jiayu, you softened?
Don't want to divorce anymore?

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,080
Sometimes I truly

84
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,560
despise myself.

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,960
I know Chen Jian will never change.

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,720
All that fake concern
at the hospital was just an act.

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,480
But then I think of Jiayu.

88
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,800
Wouldn't it be better for him
to have a complete family?

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,880
After all, having both
biological parents present

90
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,960
ensures his mental
and physical well-being.

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,160
He deserves to grow up whole.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,760
My marriage may be rotten to the core,

93
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,080
but I won't let my child
pay the price for my failed choices.

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,400
Yan'en,

95
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,760
I know you love Jiayu deeply.

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,920
But I hope you can learn
to love yourself too.

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,560
Jiayu is so perceptive.

98
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,360
Seeing you stay
with such a man for his sake

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,680
will hurt him more
than having a single parent.

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,520
Enough about my messy life.

101
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,080
Let's talk about you and Li Jinyu.

102
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,600
This cold war
between you two isn't sustainable.

103
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
What else can I do?

104
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,080
Swallow my pride

105
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,920
and beg for reconciliation?

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,080
It always ends the same.

107
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,120
He never thinks about the future.

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,320
But I shouldn't blame him.

109
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,400
I never planned for this either.

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Yet seeing him act
like he could walk away anytime,

111
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,120
it just cuts deep.

112
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
Your pain is normal.

113
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,440
If you felt nothing at all,

114
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
then it would be Li Jinyu who should cry.

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,440
But I feel like I care too much.

116
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,680
This relationship may seem
like I am dominating it.

117
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,400
Like I'm in control.

118
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,240
But in reality,
I'm completely trapped by his emotions.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,280
When we fight,

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,120
I regress to an 18-year-old,
digging up old grievances,

121
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,880
keeping score of who cares more.

122
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,000
You weren't this insecure at 18.

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,200
You…

124
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,720
have fallen deeper than I imagined.

125
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,520
Ye Meng went to see her former boss?

126
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,560
The one named Gou…

127
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,480
You know him?

128
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,320
Saw him in her Moments.

129
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,160
No wonder you were distracted that day.

130
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,280
You just left me there.

131
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Did you two have a fight?

132
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,040
Ye Meng has high standards.

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,480
Let's be honest.

134
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,200
You only barely edged me out.

135
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,040
From where I stand,

136
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,360
it's just coffee,

137
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,200
nothing more. Relax. Come on.

138
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,840
She's going back to Jiangbei with him.

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,800
Claims she needs
to investigate her mom's case.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,240
You can't stop her from doing this,

141
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
and you definitely
shouldn't fight with her over it.

142
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,200
I was angry at first,

143
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,440
but our fight wasn't about that.

144
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,200
Then what was it about?

145
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,360
She always thinks
I don't plan to stay with her long-term.

146
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,600
But how do I prove it? With words?

147
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,320
The more I say,

148
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,880
the more it sounds like
I'm trying to trap her in Ningsui.

149
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,840
You think silence is good for her?

150
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,760
I can't stand people like you,

151
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,600
who never communicate properly.

152
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,760
At least I want to talk
but have nowhere to say it.

153
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
You also have a chance to speak.

154
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,760
It just depends on whether you seize it.

155
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
How exactly am I supposed
to seize it? Enlighten me.

156
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,320
Just say it outright,

157
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,400
but I doubt you have the courage.

158
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,600
You think I don't dare?

159
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,720
Watch me.

160
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,440
HOW ARE THINGS WITH CHEN JIAN?
IS THE DIVORCE PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY?

161
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,640
YA'EN

162
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,160
But with their divorce still pending,

163
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,680
would this interfere?

164
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
I’d feel so guilty.

165
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,880
Where did you get
all this confidence from?

166
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,440
Don't take your bad mood out on me.

167
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,040
- Bottoms up!
- Alright.

168
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,520
That's enough.
You've had too much. You're clearly…

169
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,720
drunk. Okay, no more drinking.

170
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,000
- What's wrong?
- Look!

171
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,000
What is it?

172
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,080
Not a single message until now.

173
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,960
What does this mean?

174
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,480
Trying to break up with me? For real?

175
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Fine.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
He isn't texting you,

177
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,240
but can't you be the one
to text him first?

178
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,840
Why should I be the one to text him?

179
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,840
- What's wrong?
- I won't text first.

180
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Why won't you text him?

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,640
A woman never admits defeat.

182
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Listen,

183
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,520
in relationships, we can't keep score.

184
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,080
The more you tally,

185
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,800
the more it reveals how deeply you care.

186
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,920
You text him.

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,280
- What should I text him?
- Just text him!

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,760
Look at you.

189
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,320
- Text him!
- What should I even say?

190
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,920
You tell me. What should I text?

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,360
Just text, "Ye Meng is drunk."

192
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,400
Quick!

193
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440
Okay. "Ye Meng is drunk."

194
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,920
Now what? See if he shows any concern?

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,600
"She's in danger, extreme danger."

196
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,160
- Too childish. Fine. "Extreme danger."
- Quickly!

197
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,120
Are the words "I'm sorry"
really that hard to type?

198
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,040
The phone's about
to burn a hole through the screen.

199
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
You have the nerve to say that to me?

200
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,160
Let's swap.

201
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,800
You draft mine, I'll draft yours.

202
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,960
Help me craft a message

203
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,800
that's thoughtful but not pretentious,

204
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,680
engaging but not…

205
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,960
intrusive.

206
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,000
Think about it.

207
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,440
<i>Ye Meng's drunk and insists on going home.</i>

208
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
<i>I have to pick up Jiayu urgently.</i>

209
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
<i>Get back there and keep an eye on her.</i>

210
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,760
You're leaving? What about me?

211
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,200
You clearly care desperately.

212
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,960
Stop pretending!

213
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,960
And why are you taking my phone again?

214
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,920
Boss, let me draft one for you.

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Seriously, my writing is pretty solid too.

216
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,040
Anyone in our bar got real writing chops?

217
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,560
Women understand women best.

218
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,840
- Handle it.
- Okay, thinking.

219
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,640
No need to thank me, Boss.
Just give me a raise when this works.

220
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,640
Absolutely must.

221
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
<i>Is Jiayu better now?</i>
<i>Are the divorce papers finalized?</i>

222
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
<i>Not divorced yet. Stop prying.</i>

223
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,920
I…

224
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,760
Why has she not divorced yet?

225
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,480
Is this never-ending?

226
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,680
HAILAN PORT PHASE III NOW LEASING

227
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,360
Ye Meng.

228
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,480
Li Jinyu.

229
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,440
Get inside quickly.

230
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,600
Come on.

231
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,720
Let me pour you some water.

232
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,680
Save it.

233
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,160
You didn't hesitate
to cut contact for a whole day.

234
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,880
Why the sudden concern now?

235
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,960
How much have you had to drink?

236
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,200
Can't I even drink

237
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,880
when I'm unhappy?

238
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,720
My words were too harsh that day.

240
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,320
Can you comfort me?

241
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Hold me.

242
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,080
I'm leaving for Jiangbei tomorrow.

243
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,000
Can we please not fight?

244
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,480
Get some rest early.

245
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,960
It's freezing.
Why aren't you going inside?

246
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,200
- Come on.
- You went to Ye Meng's place?

247
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,600
- She's drunk.
- Did you two have a fight?

248
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,160
No.

249
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,839
So, you're upset

250
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,319
because you knew Ye Meng
was going to Jiangbei?

251
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,839
That blabbermouth Qiao Maimai!

252
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,319
Don't change the subject!

253
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,599
She's going to Jiangbei,
not vanishing forever.

254
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,880
Stop making a scene with that long face.

255
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,359
If you're afraid she won't come back,

256
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,160
either tell her how you feel
or go with her.

257
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,120
Li Lingbai is in Jiangbei.

258
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,400
There's no way I'm going back.

259
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,160
I know all about your family drama,

260
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,040
but Ye Meng doesn't.

261
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,400
Try seeing it from her perspective.

262
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,920
She's completely confused.
To her, it's just a business trip.

263
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,080
Why are you being so sensitive?

264
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,160
Why does everyone keep blaming Jiangbei?

265
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,120
That's not it.

266
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm just angry at myself.

267
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,880
I used to drift through life,

268
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,520
never planning for the future.

269
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,040
Now,

270
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
for the first time, I feel regret.

271
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,040
Why didn't I push harder back then?

272
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,320
At least finish university,

273
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
get a decent job,

274
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,840
give her a stable life.

275
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,440
And…

276
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,960
she can't be trapped in Ningsui forever.

277
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,320
Regret?

278
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,680
What future can you even offer?

279
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,440
You men are all full of nonsense!

280
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,400
So self-righteous!

281
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,160
Instead of assuming,
why not actually ask her what she wants?

282
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,520
Afraid to ask?

283
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Scared the result

284
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,680
will be like your childhood,
being abandoned again?

285
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,680
You need to believe in Meng.
She's not that woman,

286
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,440
and you're not that powerless kid

287
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,680
from childhood anymore, Badou.
You can change.

288
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,200
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,440
Got it.

290
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,800
I don't need it.

291
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,160
Don't catch a cold.

292
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,960
Wake up!

293
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,160
Go to bed early.

294
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,400
No staying up late!

295
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,040
Don't worry.

296
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,920
Don't worry, Mom.
It's just a few pieces of clothing.

297
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,960
Hello.

298
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,360
Delivery here.

299
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,800
Your requested flowers have arrived.
Should I leave them at the door?

300
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,840
I don't want them anymore.

301
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,080
If they can't be returned,
just throw them away.

302
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,600
I said I only deliver. I don't…

303
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,440
Had a fight, didn't you?

304
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,120
No, it's nothing.

305
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,960
Then why are you
in such a frantic rush to leave?

306
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,080
It's not like I'm not coming back.

307
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,800
When will you be back?

308
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,280
Can you promise me?

309
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,800
You're her neighbor?

310
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,760
Such beautiful flowers.
What a waste to discard them.

311
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,160
Do you want them?
If you want, then move them with me.

312
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,720
I said delivery only.
No relocation services.

313
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,560
Gardener Li!

314
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,800
Since I'm not really good at gardening,

315
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,160
I'm entrusting this yard to you.

316
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,240
Now I truly understand

317
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,000
Li's feelings.

318
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,440
I remember

319
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
when we sent you
to Jiangbei for university,

320
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,600
we thought you'd return after four years.

321
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,520
But who could have guessed
you'd be gone for ten?

322
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,240
You didn't like Li before.

323
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,480
Now you're speaking up for him?

324
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,920
Isn't it because he's handsome?

325
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,120
But most importantly, you like him.

326
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,840
Otherwise, how would Grandma
ever give anyone the time of day?

327
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,200
Come on. Eat up now!

328
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,800
That would be terrible.

329
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,800
What if he doesn't like me that much?

330
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,040
Okay, I'm done eating. I'm leaving.

331
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,760
Didn't even take one bite!

332
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,800
This kid…

333
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,320
Mom, you eat it.

334
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
<i>Ye Meng,</i>

335
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,800
<i>truthfully, what I wanted</i>
<i>to tell you today</i>

336
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,600
<i>wasn't any of this.</i>

337
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,960
<i>I meant to say,</i>

338
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,800
<i>before meeting you,</i>

339
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,200
<i>I hated this world.</i>

340
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
I kept everyone at arm's length.

341
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,720
Then you appeared.

342
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,320
I started to think,

343
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,000
maybe I'm not as broken as I believed.

344
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,760
<i>But today, at your home,</i>

345
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,560
<i>I suddenly realized</i>
<i>that I'm still keeping everyone out.</i>

346
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,960
The only difference is,

347
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,360
I dragged you into my world

348
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,360
<i>and locked the door.</i>

349
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,200
<i>But your world</i>
<i>shouldn't be trapped like this.</i>

350
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,280
That night by the sea,

351
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,520
I was terrified you'd walk toward me.

352
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Because I knew

353
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,800
I'd fall for you without a doubt.

354
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
No exceptions.

355
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,200
Driver, I'll get off here.

356
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,760
RONGHAI TAXI, ECO-FRIENDLY TRAVEL

357
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,920
<i>If you ever come across a sick goldfish,</i>

358
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,880
<i>the smartest thing you can do</i>
<i>is stay away.</i>

359
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,400
Because all it will do

360
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,880
is drag you into the dark with it.

361
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,760
Li Jinyu.

362
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Happy Spring Festival!

363
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,080
RELEASE TO SEND

364
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

365
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,280
<i>The person standing by your side</i>

366
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,760
<i>shouldn't be someone like me.</i>

367
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,600
<i>I can't even set off fireworks with you</i>

368
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,600
<i>or spend Spring Festival's Eve</i>
<i>with your family.</i>

369
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,960
<i>You'd better not play games with me.</i>

370
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,080
<i>If I fall for someone, it's permanent.</i>

371
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,600
<i>What a coincidence. Me too.</i>

372
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,880
TAXI

373
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,240
Li Jinyu.

374
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,120
Why are you back?

375
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,080
What are you doing here?

376
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,600
I thought it would take you
at least two weeks to come back.

377
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,840
By then, the weather would be warmer,
just in time for the flowers to bloom.

378
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,720
Then you could see your dream garden.

379
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,560
I wonder if you’d like it?

380
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,360
Look.

381
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,920
Good-looking or not?

382
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,080
Gardener Li.

383
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,120
But I thought by then, at least,

384
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,640
you will not be angry anymore.

385
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,280
This must be what you

386
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,160
dreamed a home could feel like.

387
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,800
For the sake of the flowers--

388
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,160
Li Jinyu.

389
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,800
Will you marry me?

390
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,000
Ya'en told me marriage is a gamble.

391
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,000
So, want to bet with me?

392
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,960
What kind of reaction is that?

393
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,680
Don't tell me
you're just playing around with me.

394
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,200
I know I'm not being rational right now.
I'm a mess, but I--

395
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,040
I'm sorry I don't have a ring.

396
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,920
These flowers will have to do for now.

397
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,920
But I believe

398
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,160
proposals should come from men.

399
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,840
This isn't some game to me.

400
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,040
I've genuinely fallen for you.

401
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,360
Ye Meng.

402
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,240
Will you marry me?

403
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,280
Yes, I will.

404
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,120
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION OFFICE

405
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,560
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

406
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,200
HEAVEN-MADE MATCH
MAY YOU THRIVE FOR A CENTURY TOGETHER

407
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,400
I'm going to the restroom.

408
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,040
Hello.

409
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,920
<i>What's the meaning of this?</i>
<i>Trying to back out?</i>

410
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,360
No, it's not that.
I'm just really nervous.

411
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,400
What's going on with you two?
This is like a drama series.

412
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,080
Yesterday breaking up,

413
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,640
today getting married?

414
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,560
Such a plot twist!

415
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,760
Unless Li Jinyu

416
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,680
took a bullet for you or something?

417
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,560
I just don't get it.

418
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,240
Don't say you can't
make sense of it. I can't either.

419
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,160
Half of it was impulse.

420
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,320
The other half just felt right, I guess.

421
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Today, watching him build
that flower wall in my home,

422
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,360
I finally felt it.

423
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,560
That sense

424
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,280
of every word being answered,
every promise grounded.

425
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,000
All those past conflicts and tensions

426
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,400
suddenly seemed insignificant.

427
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,120
Alright, fine.

428
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,040
You're both crazy, perfect for each other.

429
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,200
So, are you still going to Jiangbei?

430
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,320
I have to go.
Flight's at 6:30 tomorrow morning.

431
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,240
Does he know?

432
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,360
I don't know how to explain it.

433
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,880
Anyway, we're getting married now.

434
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,200
What's the point of staying angry?
Just sweet talk him and it’ll be fine.

435
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,000
Alright.

436
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,400
At least you'll have
a wedding night to remember.

437
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,000
You better sweet-talk him good tonight.

438
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,240
I'm all mixed up right now.
Let's not talk for now.

439
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
- I need to get my head straight.
<i>- Don't be nervous.</i>

440
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,240
Bye-bye.

441
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,920
Is it our turn now?

442
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,120
Don't be afraid. I am here.

443
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,679
What are you doing?

444
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,239
You seem a bit nervous.

445
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,639
I'm not that nervous actually.

446
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,560
Let's go.

447
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,800
DOUBLE HAPPINESS

448
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,040
Now, let the newlyweds take your vows.

449
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,120
Wedding--

450
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,560
Alright. One, two, three.

451
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,239
- Marriage vows.
- Wedding vows.

452
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,880
- Wedding.
- Sorry!

453
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,000
- Wedding vows.
- Wedding vows.

454
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,000
- We voluntarily enter this marriage.
- We voluntarily enter this marriage.

455
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,280
- From this day forward,
- From this day forward,

456
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,880
- we will face life’s challenges together,
- we will face life’s challenges together,

457
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,760
- in joy and adversity alike,
- in joy and adversity alike,

458
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,840
- standing as one through all trials,
- standing as one through all trials,

459
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,560
- sharing life’s burdens and blessings,
- sharing life’s burdens and blessings,

460
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,840
- until death parts us.
- until death parts us.

461
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,720
The couple…

462
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,640
Li Jinyu…

463
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,520
And Ye Meng.

464
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,120
Congratulations!
Come on, you two. Look here!

465
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,560
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

466
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,120
NINGSUI CIVIL AFFAIRS BUREAU

467
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,760
Here, drink something hot to warm up.

468
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,200
What are you smiling about?

469
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,440
Laughing at you.

470
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,960
Look, this photo
actually makes you look devoted.

471
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
When I first met you,

472
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,320
I thought you were a player,
with girls everywhere.

473
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,560
Add me on WeChat?

474
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,640
Turns out,

475
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,480
you're the real charmer.
You had me hooked in just a few days.

476
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,120
Not completely settled, I guess.

477
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,240
There's still one thing left unfinished.

478
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,240
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

479
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,960
Just like that, we got married.

480
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
It wasn't impulsive,
and the child will have his surname.

481
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,360
Marriage is a major life event
for both of you

482
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,720
and for both families.

483
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,640
How could you make such a hasty decision

484
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,840
without even notifying anyone?

485
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,680
So, I made a special trip
to tell you in person.

486
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,600
Well, now you know. We're leaving.

487
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,840
Let's go before they process this.

488
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,240
Otherwise, we'll be stuck here,
getting lectured.

489
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,680
Wait.

490
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,760
After all, marriage is a lifelong event.

491
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,200
Leaving like this isn't right.

492
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,440
Give me a moment.

493
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,840
I need to go back
and talk to them properly.

494
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,280
- You two acted so well just now.
- I totally bought it.

495
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Yeah, your acting was too good!

496
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,600
Fill it up!

497
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,920
- This marriage is finally happening.
- Cheers!

498
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,240
Grandma.

499
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,280
Grandma, Big Aunt,
Middle Aunt, Little Aunt.

500
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,240
I will do everything in my power
to take good care of Ye Meng.

501
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,400
Rest assured.

502
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,400
Personally, I think it's fine

503
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,440
for the child to carry the Ye surname.

504
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,040
It all depends
on whether Ye Meng likes it.

505
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,840
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave now.

506
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,200
Goodbye.

507
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,840
So touching!

508
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,600
<i>Beat the gongs!</i>

509
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,240
Our Meng is so happy.

510
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,120
<i>Meng finally married!</i>

511
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,800
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

512
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
How did it go?

513
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,760
It's nothing.

514
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,800
Just…

515
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,880
They're quite different
from what I imagined.

516
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,680
Different? How so?

517
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,120
It's actually nice. Let's go.

518
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,800
MAY ALL GO WELL, YE RESIDENCE, 1705

519
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,320
Come on, high-five!

520
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,520
Let me help you.

521
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,320
- Feeling good, Yu?
- Hell yeah.

522
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,160
How come you haven't come
to find me to hang out lately?

523
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,320
My bar's been crazy busy lately.

524
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,640
It'll calm down after a while.

525
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,480
I thought you were like me,

526
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,440
also worrying about my mom and dad.

527
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,800
Seems like they're not
getting divorced after all.

528
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,960
Jiayu,

529
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,960
I know you're a very sensible child.

530
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,920
But right now,

531
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,880
I just want you to be happy and joyful.

532
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,000
Don't let adult matters weigh you down.

533
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,920
My mom is doing this for me,

534
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,680
but I don't need them to.

535
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,400
They pretend like
nothing happened in front of me,

536
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,160
and I have to play along.

537
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,600
I'm so tired.

538
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,560
Listen,

539
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,960
whenever you're unhappy

540
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,400
or tired,

541
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,520
just call me anytime.

542
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,160
If you need anything,
I'll be there, no questions asked.

543
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,960
Let the adults
worry about their own problems.

544
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,240
You just focus on being happy every day,

545
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,360
alright? Come on.

546
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,760
- Let's go another round!
- Alright.

547
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,320
- Go!
- Go!

548
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,840
I hope my little Yu
stays happy and joyful forever.

549
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,320
What time's your flight tomorrow?

550
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,560
Changed to tomorrow morning at 6:30.

551
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,800
Don't be mad at me.

552
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,040
Li Jinyu.

553
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,560
Today's our first day married.

554
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,320
You can't spend it angry with me.

555
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,920
Can't you think of something else?

556
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,000
No.

557
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,760
Are you…

558
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,760
getting shy on me?

559
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,080
Come now. We're married.

560
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,520
So, sis, your mind’s been

561
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,480
in the gutter since day one, huh?

562
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,640
You've got it backwards.

563
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,520
I fell for you first,

564
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,440
and that was just…

565
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,920
