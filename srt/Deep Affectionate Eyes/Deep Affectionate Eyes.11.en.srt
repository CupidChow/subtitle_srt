2
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,680
This little yard of yours is lovely.

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,080
Li Jinyu's the gardener behind it.

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,080
Figures.

5
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,120
Men only show off all their hidden talents

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,760
when they're trying to please a woman.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
But I have to admit, he did a good job.

8
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,400
- Want me to take your picture?
- Go on.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,480
These are ready. I'll give it to Ya'en.

10
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
Ye Meng skipped breakfast
just to play host.

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,200
Ya'en got up at dawn to take Jiayu
to school. She must be hungry.

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
Who are you to make demands?

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,400
Her little brother with no blood ties
or her pursuer?

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,360
Take it, take it, quick.

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,800
That's plenty. Save some
for Ya'en. She loves these.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,080
…next time.

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,960
Food's here.

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,480
Let me see. Try this one.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,960
Is it hot?

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,680
Maybe just a little.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,440
I should just go eat dog food
with Ping'an.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,200
Single life matters too.

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,680
Honestly, I should've grabbed a kids' meal
after school drop-off.

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,480
What am I putting myself through here?

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
- Okay, maybe a little hot.
- Ya'en.

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,240
- Just a bit hot.
- Ya'en, this batch is ready.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,200
- Really?
- Try some.

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,520
Great, thanks.

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
Maimai, you eat first.

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,240
Thanks, Ya'en.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,960
- Careful, it's hot.
- I'll grab some drinks.

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,600
- So good.
- Not bad, right?

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Cheng Kairan.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,800
Choose your seat carefully.

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,920
Are you on Ye Meng's side of the family
or Li Jinyu's?

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,600
Ye Meng's side, of course.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,280
Then I'm part of the bride's family too.

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,160
I'm with Meng.

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,120
Since when are you her family?

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,600
See? The battle lines are drawn.

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,240
Now, since we're
the bride's family, how about…

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,280
a no-penalty question round?

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
I'm in. Love it.

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,880
Alright, who goes first?

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
Me.

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,360
Before you met Ye Meng,

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
what was your ideal type?

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,320
I didn't have one.

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,160
Come on, impossible.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,960
You've never dated,
never even fantasized it?

51
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,240
- Right?
- Exactly.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Just say it. I won't hold it against you.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
I really didn't have an ideal type.

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,240
But… I did know the kind of girl

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,280
I would never date.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,000
And that is?

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,560
I know.

58
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,520
An older woman.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,240
Definitely not someone like me.

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Hey, we agreed no holding grudges today.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,120
And I just decided
to hold a grudge tonight.

62
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
- You literally just said…
- I just decided.

63
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,800
My poor eyes.

64
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,760
I can't with you two.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,960
- What's that supposed to mean?
- My goodness.

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,800
- My bad, my bad.
- Sweet for you two.

67
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,960
But the rest of us?

68
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,520
We're just suffering as collateral damage.

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,360
Li Jinyu, let me tell you something.

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,760
One time, Meng asked me

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,880
to take some photos of her at the beach.

72
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Turns out they were bait shots

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,480
- to hook a guy.
- Ya'en!

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,600
She ditched me right after.

75
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,560
- The wind nearly blew me away that day.
- That picture?

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,240
- I get the picture.
- And another time…

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,640
- Another time?
- Eat.

78
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
Nice trick.

79
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,560
Fine, fine.

80
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,400
But let me ask a real question
on behalf of the bride's family.

81
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,600
You're from Jiangbei, right?

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,080
So, your household registration's there.

83
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,800
What about social security?

84
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,800
I don't have it yet.

85
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,720
Not with no full-time job.

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,000
No social security?
Then what about when you have kids?

87
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,720
Their schooling, your retirement?

88
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
Sure, you can feed yourself now.

89
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,520
But what about the future?

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,640
Ye Meng's supposed to starve with you?

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,920
Ya'en, that's enough.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,200
Wait.

93
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,960
How could anyone let Ye Meng starve?

94
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,480
Don't worry, I'll cover you.
Tomorrow, I'll sign you up.

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
My bar's legit.

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
Stop butting in.

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,320
If I don't bring this up,

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,320
Ye Meng's aunts definitely will.

99
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,560
If you two are serious
about staying together,

100
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,160
these are things you have to think about.

101
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
And you need real solutions.

102
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,360
I know I sound blunt,

103
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,040
but it comes from experience.

104
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,360
Don't take it the wrong way.

105
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,280
I've said my piece. Bottoms up.

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,120
Thanks, Ya'en.

107
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,960
I'll really take your words to heart.

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,240
Is this even cooked?
I can't bite through it.

109
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,760
That's medium rare.

110
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,400
Beef's safe to eat that way.

111
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
I just seared it a little.

112
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,880
Oh yeah?

113
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,080
Trust me. Eat.

114
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,240
That tree looks beautiful.

115
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm telling you,

116
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,200
what Fang Ya'en said wasn't wrong.

117
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,800
The Ye family isn't easy to marry into.

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,440
I know that.

119
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
You don't know squat.

120
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,440
I've already thought it through for you.

121
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,600
Hailan Port's project.

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,400
HAILAN PORT PHASE III NOW LEASING

123
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,160
I heard the company behind it
wants to expand in Ningsui.

124
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,880
They're planning
to demolish the old houses in town.

125
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
When the payouts come,

126
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,520
decide whether you'll buy a new place
or invest in something else.

127
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,320
What are you two plotting about?

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
Just chatting. Here.

129
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
I'll handle it.

130
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,480
Alright, I'll take you both back.

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,520
Sounds good.

132
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,800
We're off then.

133
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,560
- Bye.
- Bye.

134
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,440
- Bye.
- Bye, Meng.

135
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
- See you.
- Bye.

136
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,240
Think it over.

137
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,880
You're not upset by what Ya'en said,
are you?

139
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,760
Not at all.

140
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,200
We grew up together.

141
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,880
We're the same age,

142
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,280
but she's always looked after me
like an older sister.

143
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,000
I know. She means well.

144
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
Funny though,

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,880
my first interrogation
by the bride's family.

146
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,000
So, that's what it feels like.

147
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,400
What I want you to know is this.

148
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,680
Whatever you decide to do,

149
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,560
as long as you're happy,
that's enough for me.

150
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,960
- I hear you.
- Li Jinyu.

151
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,960
What is it?

152
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,200
I love days like this.

153
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,080
So do I.

154
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,160
Come on.

155
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,840
Honestly, I thought they'd grill me too.

156
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,280
I prepped for nothing.

157
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,440
What did you prep?

158
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
Things like what part of you I love most

159
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
or when I think you're the sexiest.

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,440
And when's that?

161
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,360
When you play the guitar.

162
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,320
Teach me.

163
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,920
You think you can learn?

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,360
Of course.

165
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,440
I'll prove I'm the most talented student
you'll ever meet.

166
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,280
I'll think about it.

167
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,160
Nothing to think about. Teach me now.

168
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,200
Hurry.

169
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,000
You can't even open a door,
and you want to play guitar?

170
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Alright then, my student.

171
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,200
- Careful.
- Okay.

172
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,920
Slide your arm through.

173
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,600
Too high.

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
What are you playing?

175
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,640
- Where's it supposed to be?
- A pipa?

176
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,159
- Don't make fun of me.
- Fine. Lower it down.

177
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,240
Then…

178
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,240
That's better.
This hand presses the chords.

179
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,440
The chords.

180
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,320
- Like this?
- And this hand…

181
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,200
This hand strums.

182
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,400
- Not bad, right?
- Not bad.

183
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,520
I want to learn our song.

184
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
Alright.

185
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,680
Here.

186
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Let me show you.

187
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
First chord, like this.

188
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,480
That's the shape.

189
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,040
- See it?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,200
Hand here.

191
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
Index finger on this string.

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
Relax.

193
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,280
Okay, relaxing.

194
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,240
- Push up a bit.
- Alright.

195
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,240
Hey, focus.

196
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,800
This deserves a spot
on Moments, don't you think?

197
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
Fine.

198
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,160
- Done yet?
- Not yet.

199
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
- Wait.
- Hurry it up.

200
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
One second.

201
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,520
I need a caption.

202
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
Good.

203
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Now…

204
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,000
- One, two, three…
- Two, three…

205
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,720
Gou!

206
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,440
It's mating season in the animal kingdom.

207
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,240
Ever heard of knocking?

208
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
Forget knocking. Look at her post.

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,120
Look.

210
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,280
YE MENG'S POST
THE WORLD AND YOU INTERTWINE.

211
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,840
Regret it now?

212
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,680
I told you not to mess with Ye Meng.

213
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
You wouldn't listen.
And then what happened?

214
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,040
She moved back home and met someone.

215
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
Stop staring.

216
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,480
If you want answers, ask her yourself.

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
Other fingers off the strings.

218
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,320
- Like this? Or like this?
- That's it.

219
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,840
What about like this?

220
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,000
GOU KAI

221
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,880
Your phone.

222
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,440
Let's keep going.

223
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,960
If it's awkward,

224
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,880
- I'll step outside while you answer.
- No need.

225
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,640
I just blocked him.

226
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,960
You didn't have to.

227
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,520
What if you need to work
at his company again?

228
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,560
Never. I promise I'm not going back.

229
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,120
- What's wrong, Mr. Li? Upset with me?
- Not at all.

230
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
Then let me make it up to you.

231
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,880
Well…

232
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,400
- Say you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.

233
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
- Call me babe.
- Babe, I was wrong.

234
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,760
That was too fast.

235
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,440
Babe, I'm sorry.

236
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,360
Babe, my babe.

237
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,760
Enough, enough.

238
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
Stop.

239
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,920
You sound like a rooster at dawn.

240
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,800
Then teach me a little more.

241
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,560
Come here.

242
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,280
No, hug first.

243
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,400
Hug.

244
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,320
A big hug.

245
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm not a kid.

246
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,680
You can't hug me like that anymore.

247
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,360
‪TRANQUIL HARMONY

248
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,240
‪MY WHOLE WORLD FITS IN YOUR HANDS

249
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,760
SALES SUPPORT MANAGER
ACCOUNTING MANAGER, HR TRAINEE

250
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,520
SALES OPERATIONS SPECIALIST, HR SPECIALIST

251
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,520
Why don't you put the package inside?

252
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,640
Aren't we in a hurry to see your grandma?

253
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Give me your hand.
I've got something for you.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,040
- Quick.
- What is it?

255
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,200
Congratulations. You've just unlocked
the key to your girlfriend's front gate.

256
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,560
Is this really okay?

257
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,480
Of course.

258
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,320
If I'm ever away in Jiangbei,

259
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,040
you can help me
grab packages or something.

260
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
Sound good, sir?

261
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
Sounds good.

262
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,240
Let's go.

263
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
Wang,

264
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
I'll be discharged in a couple of days.

265
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,040
I'm actually going to miss you.

266
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,920
We've bonded, you know?

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
My grandson is so sweet.

268
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
See this wheelchair?

269
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,640
He bought it for me.

270
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,880
But if I take it home,
it'll just sit there.

271
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,040
So, I'll give it to you.
You'll refuse, of course.

272
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,240
So, this is my final offer.

273
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,840
That way, after I'm gone,

274
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
- you'll have something to remember me by.
- Granny!

275
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,560
Meng!

276
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,880
- Why are you standing up?
- You're here.

277
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,360
Grandma, stop talking about that chair.

278
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,720
- I'm not.
- We're not selling it.

279
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,480
Listen to you.

280
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,640
Talk to Badou for me. Tell him
to get my discharge papers ready.

281
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,640
You can't leave
without the doctor's sign-off.

282
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,000
One more night.

283
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,440
No, I remembered something.

284
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,000
Isn't there free check-ups back in town?

285
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,040
That'll save you money, sweetheart.

286
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,680
- Isn't that better, you silly?
- Silly.

287
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,080
If you try to trick me,

288
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,520
I'll have Ping'an walk you there.

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,440
I thought with a girlfriend,
you'd finally soften up.

290
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,600
Still heartless.

291
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,560
But fine. I promise
I'll go for the check-up.

292
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,000
He's only doing this
because he cares about you.

293
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,960
Here, have an orange.

294
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
- Always defending him.
- Let me peel you an orange.

295
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,840
Have him peel it.

296
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,920
- You do it.
- I'll do it.

297
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,040
Wang…

298
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,000
Three hundred.

299
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,400
That must be the flowers I ordered.

300
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
- Try this…
- I'll go grab them.

301
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,480
- Granny, I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

302
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
Don't be long. I'll wait for you.

303
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,120
Hello?

304
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,000
<i>It's me. Gou Kai.</i>

305
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,520
What is wrong with you?

306
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,400
You've been calling nonstop
these past few days,

307
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,040
switching numbers like a scammer.

308
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Check your monitor.

309
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
I'm in Ningsui,
standing outside your door.

310
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,120
What?

311
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,560
Come meet me.

312
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,240
You still need the check-up.
I'm not eating.

313
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,960
Listen,

314
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,640
if I really go home, I just worry…

315
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,080
What if I get in the way of you and Meng?

316
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,720
Sure, we wouldn't share a room,

317
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,280
but I don't sleep much anymore.

318
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,160
Unlike you young people…

319
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,440
At your age, full of fire…

320
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,480
- Stop.
- Burning hot…

321
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,040
You don't stay up because you can't sleep.

322
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,040
You stay up because
you're glued to your phone.

323
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,640
And besides, Ye Meng doesn't live with me.

324
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,240
Be serious.

325
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,080
I heard there's a new development
in this area.

326
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,240
The doctors and nurses say it's nice.

327
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
It's called… Hailan Port.

328
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,520
All the money you've ever given me,

329
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,040
I've kept it safe in the bank.

330
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,480
So, I can buy you a place
of your own when you get married.

331
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,600
<i>Enough talking.</i>
<i>I'm at a café waiting for you.</i>

332
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,800
In a couple of days,
take Meng to check out some places.

333
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,000
You're already dating. Marriage is next.

334
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,480
You need your own house, right?

335
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,760
I'm still waiting on a great-grandchild.

336
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,880
And her family needs to see
you can provide.

337
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,760
Are you even listening?

338
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm not going.

339
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Not going?

340
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,520
So, you never planned
to settle down with her, is that it?

341
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,440
It's not necessary.

342
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,319
It's too soon to think about that.

343
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,800
What is wrong with you?

344
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,000
What do you mean not necessary?

345
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,720
Then what is necessary?

346
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,240
- Badou, I--
- That's not what I mean.

347
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,200
Right now,

348
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,839
Ye Meng's only here for a break.

349
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,400
She won't stay in Ningsui forever.

350
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,160
Where she goes after,
that's not decided yet.

351
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,560
I don't want to trap her
with talk of houses

352
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
before she's ready.

353
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,840
That's not how it works.

354
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,640
No matter where she ends up
working or living,

355
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,080
don't you think you should
talk with her first?

356
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
Clear things up,

357
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,520
so she doesn't misunderstand you.

358
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,800
I hear you.

359
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,360
Use that head of yours.
Think things through.

360
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,600
Got it?

361
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,040
- <i>Had to meet someone.</i>
- Who's that?

362
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,920
<i>The flowers for Granny</i>
<i>are at the nurses' station.</i>

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,080
<i>Pick them up for me.</i>

364
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
OKAY, DON'T WORRY

365
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,840
Ye Meng said she had something to do.

366
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,240
I'll grab the stuff she bought you.

367
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,560
She bought it for me?

368
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,120
Go on then, quick.

369
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,960
What-- What are you doing here?

370
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,480
Don't worry about it.

371
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,040
What was that song…

372
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
you played at your concert
the other night?

373
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,280
My pleasure. Right up.

374
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,200
Here. Welcome to the fandom.

375
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
- Go on. Back to work.
- Got it.

376
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,720
Who blasts that at this hour?

377
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,920
You-- You're here.

378
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
- Close your eyes.
- Why would I?

379
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,160
Just trust me. Close them.

380
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,120
Try to feel it.

381
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,000
Now breathe in.

382
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,360
Breathe out.

383
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,240
Feel it?

384
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,840
Enough.

385
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,000
I can't play Qiao Maimai's death metal.

386
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,280
I didn't ask you to.

387
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,200
I mean… Did your heart speed up?

388
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,320
No.

389
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,560
Just made my ears hurt.

390
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,520
What?

391
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,400
You're testing
the customers' patience now?

392
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,640
It has nothing to do with the customers.

393
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,160
I just want to figure out…

394
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,600
That night, when my heart was pounding,

395
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,240
was it because of this nightmare
of a song or because of--

396
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,640
So, tell me.

397
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,560
When you realized you liked Ye Meng,

398
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,320
was your heartbeat as fast as it is now

399
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,000
listening to this music? Or even faster,

400
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,000
bang bang bang, like one-eighty,

401
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,960
pounding like crazy?

402
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,960
You need a doctor. Go check yourself in.

403
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,560
I'm serious. I'm losing my mind over this.

404
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,040
I think I like Fang Ya'en.

405
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,960
I think… I might actually like Fang Ya'en.

406
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,720
But then I'm not sure.

407
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,440
I mean, come on.
How could I possibly like her?

408
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,040
She's bossy, loud,
always ordering people around.

409
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,320
She's the last person I should fall for.

410
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,800
But that night at the concert,

411
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,800
when I saw her laughing so freely…

412
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,240
I was happy too.

413
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
So, what you're saying is,

414
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,200
you don't even know yourself
whether you like her or not.

415
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Then why are you telling me? Go tell her.

416
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,160
I…

417
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,000
don't have the guts.

418
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,720
That's why I need you to come with me.

419
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,000
So, you admit you're a coward.

420
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,600
Fine, I admit it. I'm a coward. Happy?

421
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,720
Now just come with me.

422
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,480
We'll stay far away.
Just one look, that's all.

423
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,840
I've got work.

424
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,120
I'll still pay you.

425
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,760
Extra job, extra pay.

426
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,880
Triple.

427
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

428
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,240
Let's move.

429
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,160
Maimai.

430
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,080
Watch the bar.

431
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,400
- You got it.
- Good!

432
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,320
So, this is where you grew up?

433
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,200
Not bad.

434
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,600
Nice and laid-back.
Perfect for retirement.

435
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,920
But not for someone like you.

436
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
Even the coffee's mediocre.

437
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,160
Mr. Gou,

438
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,800
go back to Jiangbei
and drink your overpriced beans.

439
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,640
Change that temper of yours, will you?

440
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,680
Never.

441
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,920
Just spit it out.

442
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,000
Why'd you park so far away?

443
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,760
If we park closer, she'll spot us.

444
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,760
This way, we can just watch
from a distance,

445
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,040
get a sense of things.

446
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,520
You sound like a creep.

447
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,000
Like a stalker.

448
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,400
Who are you calling a creep?

449
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,000
- Sounds more like you.
- Ya'en, taking out the trash?

450
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,280
Looking gorgeous today.

451
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,920
- Thanks.
- Stop by the shop later.

452
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,240
- She is coming.
- Sure thing.

453
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,200
Unbelievable.

454
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
One day parading her love life,

455
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,640
the next sneaking around with her ex?

456
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,400
Seriously?

457
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Is she coming this way?

458
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,240
Tell me she's not.

459
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,800
She's didn't see us, did she?

460
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,640
Jinyu. Jinyu. Jinyu.

461
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,240
Jinyu.

462
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,880
Tell me she's not coming this way.

463
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,720
Ya'en.

464
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,800
Hey.

465
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,800
What are you two doing here?

466
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
Jinyu wanted to see you.

467
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,400
Then, let's talk at my shop.

468
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,600
It's freezing out here.

469
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,800
Come on, move, hurry.

470
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,360
So cold. Come on.

471
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
It's freezing. Come on.

472
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,560
I'll make you some tea.

473
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,840
Actually, Ya'en…

474
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,640
I'm not going in.

475
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,760
Why not?

476
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,280
He's the one who wanted to see you.

477
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,400
Said he had something to say.

478
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,560
Right?

479
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,160
So, you two talk. I'm heading back.

480
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,560
Leaving already?

481
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,880
I've got work.

482
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,920
Oh, fine.

483
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,560
Have a good talk.

484
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

485
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,160
Hey.

486
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,160
Right turn.

487
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,520
Geez.

488
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,920
Seriously?

489
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,360
Actually, I--

490
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,600
<i>You owe me big, girl.</i>

491
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,880
<i>You're sitting in a café with Gou Kai.</i>

492
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,080
<i>Jinyu almost caught you,</i>
<i>but I covered for you.</i>

493
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,080
Fine.

494
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,360
I admit I was wrong. I'm sorry.

495
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,960
Come back with me.

496
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,040
YA'EN: JINYU ALMOST CAUGHT YOU
BUT I COVERED FOR YOU

497
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
Gou Kai,

498
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,760
in case you didn't hear me the first time,
let me spell it out for you.

499
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,160
I am not going back.

500
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,800
Got yourself a boyfriend?

501
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,560
I saw your post.

502
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,920
Local guy, right?

503
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,160
Fine to play around.

504
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,320
You plan to stay here forever?

505
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,800
And why not?

506
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,160
For the record,

507
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,080
I'm dead serious about him.
Believe it or don't.

508
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,720
How serious?
Bring him out. Let me take a look.

509
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,000
I know exactly what you're thinking.

510
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,760
Stop talking down to me
like you're doing me a favor.

511
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,160
From day one, you and I
lived in different worlds.

512
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,640
Quit fooling yourself.

513
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,240
If you wanted stability,
you'd never have come to Jiangbei.

514
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,280
When I was young,
I wanted to chase something big.

515
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,200
But later, I realized,
that world isn't for me.

516
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,880
I don't like it.
Is that hard to understand?

517
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,880
Ye Meng, everything I did, I did for you.

518
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,440
- I hope…
- If that's all, I'm leaving.

519
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,960
By the way, Gou Kai,

520
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,320
you've gotten real preachy.

521
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,240
Can I have the check, please?

522
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,680
Your beans aren't up to par.

523
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
- Mediocre.
- Pah!

524
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,200
Why are you here?

525
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,160
You came to chat?

526
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,120
- Right…
- Let's chat.

527
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,280
Okay.

528
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,680
Actually, remember that suit
I dropped off?

529
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,280
It's a little loose.

530
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,840
- You wanted it taken in?
- Yes.

531
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,800
Already finished.

532
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,920
Here it is.

533
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,640
- Here. If it doesn't fit, let me know.
- Okay.

534
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,840
I'll transfer you on WeChat.

535
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,080
Forget it.

536
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,080
Then… let me buy you a coffee.

537
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,000
Good.

538
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,640
‪OPEN, WELCOME

539
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,400
- Kai.
- What?

540
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,040
Uh…

541
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
Uh… Let me…

542
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,640
Let me re-measure you.

543
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,080
Alterations might not be exact.

544
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,120
Give me that.

545
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,560
Come here. Let me re-measure you.

546
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,880
Come back here.

547
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,200
Let me take your measurements again,

548
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,800
so the fit's exact this time.

549
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,000
Come on. Jacket off.

550
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
No, no, I'll keep it on.

551
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Stay still.

552
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,080
Relax.

553
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,600
Relax.

554
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,440
Why are you shaking?

555
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,840
Been up too late. Heart's been racing.

556
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,000
Then go to bed earlier.

557
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,400
Can't sleep.

558
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,120
- Hand here.
- Okay… Okay, here.

559
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,640
Good. Length's fine. Now turn.

560
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,000
Left or right?

561
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,320
Either.

562
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,560
Why do you keep dodging?

563
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
Your shoulders are pretty broad.

564
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,120
Really?

565
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,120
- You work out?
- Of course.

566
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,760
Turn around.

567
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,200
What, are you ticklish?

568
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
- Ya'en, I'm here to pick up my clothes.
- Alright.

569
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
One second.

570
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,600
- Since when do you do men's wear?
- I don't.

571
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,600
Then is this… your boyfriend?

572
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,120
No. This is my little brother.

573
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
Closer than blood. Here you go.

574
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,960
- He looks good.
- Right?

575
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,760
- Got a girlfriend?
- No.

576
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,680
Perfect.

577
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,680
Come sign up at my matchmaking agency.

578
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,400
Yeah, why not?

579
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,160
He's a real catch.

580
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,120
Around here. he's practically a…
diamond bachelor.

581
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,480
Keep an eye out.
I'll slip you a fat red envelope.

582
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,000
No!

583
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,760
I…

584
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,640
I already like someone.

585
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,160
Oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

586
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,280
Then never mind.

587
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,760
- I'll get going then.
- Sure.

588
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,720
Call me if you need me.

589
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,560
Alright, take care.

590
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,480
So, I tricked it out of you.

591
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,960
Last time, you swore you didn't.

592
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,760
What's so hard about admitting it?

593
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Who is she?

594
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,480
Do I know her?

595
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
Sort of.

596
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,400
Yeah, you know her.

597
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,320
Really?

598
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,240
Then who? Hold on a second.

599
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,480
Hello? Ms. Chen?

600
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,840
Okay, I'm on my way.

601
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,400
- What's wrong?
- Jiayu's throwing up

602
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,320
- and everything. I've got to go.
- I'll go with you.

603
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,320
- I've got it.
- Good.

604
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,280
- Let's go.
- Lock it.

605
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,280
Locked.

606
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,200
And didn't he say he was going to

607
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,040
personally come to take
you back after the Spring Festival?

608
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,840
Even if he comes to get me,
you think I'd actually go?

609
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,080
I won't even show my face.

610
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,760
<i>You can just tell him to get lost.</i>

611
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,440
Sorry.

612
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,480
That's it for tonight. Thanks, everyone.

613
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,400
- Come on. One more song.
- Not even one?

614
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,560
- What's going on?
- Yeah, sing another.

615
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,560
Jinyu, you in a mood tonight?

616
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,080
Only strumming, no singing.

617
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Nothing like that.

618
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,760
What's wrong?

619
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,200
Bad day?

620
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,800
I've got a girlfriend.
The kind I plan to marry.

621
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,800
As expected, Meng keeps you
on a tight leash.

622
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,440
Jinyu.

623
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,360
We've been trying forever
to hire an accountant.

624
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,680
If you know anyone, keep an eye out.

625
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,240
- You made it.
- Mr. Gou.

626
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,160
Come in.

627
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,320
Jiang, send me the file
on that thumb ring seller.

628
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,560
Thanks for the help.

629
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,200
No problem. We're friends.

630
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,360
Good. Once I'm back in Jiangbei,
we'll celebrate properly.

631
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,560
Have a seat.

632
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,520
You buying a thumb ring?

633
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,920
No, it's an antique.

634
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,280
Asking for Tai Mingxiao.

635
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
All done with work?

636
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,840
I thought about dropping by.

637
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,960
Please.

638
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,440
You showing up in Ningsui
is already rare enough.

639
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,760
Hailan Port's about to soft-open.

640
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,600
As the boss, I had to check it out.

641
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,640
But tomorrow, I'm back to Jiangbei.

642
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,360
In such a rush?

643
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,040
Since you're here,

644
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,640
why not ask your right hand out
for dinner, a coffee?

645
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,240
Aren't you my right hand?

646
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,280
If you want dinner, just say it.

647
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,280
Pick the spot.

648
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,800
Don't play dumb.

649
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,840
You know I meant Ye Meng.

650
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,640
I know.

651
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,760
But you told me
she's not leaving Ningsui,

652
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,400
planning to settle here, start a family.

653
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,480
I can't force her.

654
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,240
Besides, I saw her post.
She's seeing someone.

655
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,520
He's from here.

656
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,720
Do you know him?

657
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,360
I've seen him. Don't really know him.

658
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,480
But yeah, he seems like her type.

659
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,480
Good for her.

660
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,120
What, you curious about her boyfriend?

661
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,920
No. You brought her up,

662
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,160
so I just asked.

663
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,880
Doesn't matter.

664
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,960
You free later?

665
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,600
We could grab a drink.

666
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,800
Next time. I'm wiped tonight.

667
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,840
I'll see you tomorrow.

668
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,200
Alright.

669
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,560
I'll get going. Rest up, Mr. Gou.

670
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,640
Bye.

671
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
JIANG

672
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,560
WANG XINGSHENG, MALE, AUGUST 25, 1979

673
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,280
BACHELOR'S DEGREE, NOT OVERSEAS CHINESE

674
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,679
Reading?

675
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,480
Had dinner yet? I brought cake.

676
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,159
Cake? What's the occasion?

677
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,440
Went to a café this afternoon.

678
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,280
The cake was amazing.

679
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,679
Had to bring you some.

680
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,000
PRACTICAL ACCOUNTING

681
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,679
Meeting someone there?

682
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,000
From town? How'd it go?

683
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,480
Didn't go well.

684
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,639
Talk fell apart.
Won't be seeing each other again.

685
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,280
Completely unreliable.

686
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,400
Then stick to reliable friends next time.

687
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,440
Practical Accounting.

688
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,159
Wait, are you studying for the CPA exam?

689
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,560
An accountant vibe on you?
That's a stretch.

690
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,880
Should I call you Accountant Li?

691
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,560
I was just browsing.

692
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,880
Browsing…

693
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,680
or thinking of finding a steady job
because of me?

694
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,840
Aren't you only staying
in Ningsui for a while?

695
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,080
I'm here for the long run,
to take care of Grandma.

696
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,720
Fine.

697
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,520
You stay with her.

698
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
I'll stay with you. How about that?

699
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,120
Weren't you planning
to go back to Jiangbei?

700
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,000
What, missing me already?

701
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,120
Then I won't leave.

702
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,520
Ye Meng…

703
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,800
I take every word you say to heart.

704
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,240
So,

705
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,000
don't make promises you can't keep.

706
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,240
And don't try to sweet-talk me.

707
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,920
I'm not.

708
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,920
The future's unpredictable.

709
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,480
But right now, leaving isn't on my mind.

710
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,080
Alright.

711
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,320
<i>Heard from Jiang</i>

712
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,760
<i>you've been looking</i>
<i>for the thumb ring seller.</i>

713
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,920
<i>I've got some leads.</i>

00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,000
<i>Want the information?</i>

715
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm heading out.

716
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,720
Don't stay up reading too late.

717
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,640
And eat the cake.

718
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,640
You came. Sit.

719
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,920
No need.

720
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,840
You have information
about the thumb ring seller.

721
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,880
What is it?

722
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,760
There's no rush.

723
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,920
Have a drink while we talk.

724
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,680
I don't have time.

725
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,360
He got you on a leash?

726
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,320
I know you resent me.

727
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,040
Got a guy just to spite me?

728
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,640
You don't need to.

729
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,680
Come back with me,
and I'll act like nothing ever happened.

730
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Wang Xingsheng.

731
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,120
He's the one who sold that thumb ring.

732
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
He used to be a real estate developer,

733
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,440
big on antique collecting.

734
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,400
Wang Xingsheng?

735
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,640
Where is he now?

736
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,760
Jiangbei.

737
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,440
I can reach him
under the guise of business.

738
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,280
Why'd you come out in this rain?

739
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,560
Where were you so late?

740
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,120
I met someone. Let's talk inside.

741
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,080
That guy from the café again?

742
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,960
Didn't you say the talk fell apart,

743
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,200
that you'd never see him again?

744
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,280
I didn't plan to.

745
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,800
But he texted me.

746
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,560
He said he has a lead
on my mom's thumb ring.

747
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,560
Your ex-boss, right?

748
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,280
Yeah.

749
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,720
Why didn't you tell me?

750
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,760
I didn't want you upset.

751
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,240
And…

752
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,120
I need to go to Jiangbei.

753
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
For how long?

754
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,480
I don't know.

755
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,360
He said he'd set up a meeting
with the seller.

756
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,640
If I can meet him,

757
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,640
I'll finally know the truth
about my mom's death.

758
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,000
Once I have answers,
I'll come straight back.

759
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,880
And if you never meet him?

760
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,240
You'll never come back then?

761
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,120
How could I not come back?

762
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,600
Don't you see?
That ex-boss of yours still wants you.

763
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,280
He's dangling that thumb ring as bait.

764
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,560
He's not going to let you go so easily.

765
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,600
I know what I'm doing.

766
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,320
From the start, you never planned
to discuss this with me.

767
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,040
You were just going to go, weren't you?

768
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,080
I'm discussing it with you right now.

769
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,400
This isn't a discussion.

770
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,520
This is you informing me.

771
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,560
What do you want me to do?

772
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,080
Stop investigating my mom's death
just for a relationship

773
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,800
you think has no future?

774
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,760
You overheard me and Grandma
at the hospital?

775
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,640
I did.

776
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,760
I was about to tell you
my ex-boss came to town.

777
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,480
Then I heard you say

778
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,920
that what we have isn't worth a future.

779
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,480
That's not what I meant.

780
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,680
I meant,

781
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,960
I know you won't stay in Ningsui forever.

782
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,560
And I don't want to hold you back
from whatever's ahead.

783
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,600
So, you don't want to hold me back…

784
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,960
or you just don't think this is worth it?

785
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,760
Figures.

786
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,960
It's always been me doing the chasing.

787
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,440
I was the one celebrating
your birthdays, confessing,

788
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,440
posting about us like a fool.

789
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,160
And you?

790
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,640
You're always in this state,
like you could walk away anytime.

791
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,120
So, that's really what you think of me?

792
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,160
Does what I think even matter?

793
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,080
What matters is what you think.

794
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,280
We should take a step back.

795
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,000
How's the boy doing?

796
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,320
Still running a fever?

797
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,360
The fever's gone.

798
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,520
Let's keep him one more night.

799
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,720
Are you the only one looking after him?
Where's his father?

800
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,480
Sorry, Doctor.

801
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm his dad.

802
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,640
You can take turns watching him.
That way, it's not all on one person.

803
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,920
Make sure he doesn't get dehydrated.

804
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,760
- Understood.
- Right.

805
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,200
Use a cotton swab dipped in water.

806
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,880
- Keep his lips moist.
- Got it.

807
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

808
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,800
No problem. You just take care of the kid.

809
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,240
How'd he get gastroenteritis?

810
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,360
Did he eat something bad?

811
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,360
GENERAL PRACTICE, PEDIATRICS

812
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,880
Here, let me.

813
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,840
You take a break.

814
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,920
