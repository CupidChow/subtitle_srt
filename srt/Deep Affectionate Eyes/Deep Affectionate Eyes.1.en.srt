00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,760
Ye Meng,

3
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,680
you really didn't have to quit.

4
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
Since we were kids,

5
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,360
this isn't the first time
you've lost to me.

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,520
No, wait.

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
When it comes to men,
you've always had the upper hand.

8
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,840
Only thing is…

9
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,920
Gou Kai's not falling for your act.

10
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,800
Jiang Luzhi,

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,400
I don't care if you like trash,

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,080
but picking up a piece of trash
just to shove it in my face…

13
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,440
That's taking it too far.

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,600
Can't have him,
so you pretend you don't care.

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
You haven't changed a bit.

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,840
It's fine if you go back home.

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,080
Gou Kai and I are together now.

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,520
It'd be awkward for you

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,400
to keep working here.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,520
Is that all you've got?

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,680
Your whole world spins around men.

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
What's that supposed to mean?

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,640
Looks like you don't know.

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,160
The client you stole from me?
I've sent them to another firm.

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,080
Next time you want to start something,

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,640
know who you're up against.

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,520
Jiayu, come help me.

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,960
No, leave the big box.

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,240
Take this one upstairs.

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
- Okay.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Hello?

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,840
<i>Ya'en, it's me.</i>

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,960
Cheng Kairan?

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,400
What do you want?

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,640
<i>I heard Ye Meng's coming back to Ningsui.</i>

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,720
It's been years.
You're still hung up on that?

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,080
She's not coming back.

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,520
She called me a few days ago.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,960
Said she bought a place in Jiangbei.

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,200
No way she's coming…

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,240
back.

42
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,720
<i>What did you say?</i>

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,760
OPEN, WELCOME

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,880
<i>Ya'en?</i>

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,680
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I've got to go. Talk later.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,800
<i>Hello?</i>

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,560
Ye Meng!

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,440
Fang Ya'en!

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,960
- Why are you back?
- Just now,

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,760
literally just now,
Cheng Kairan told me you were

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,160
coming back. I didn't believe it!

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,040
It's been years. Give me a break.

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,240
How long are you here for?

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,680
For a while.

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,840
I quit my job.

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,960
Pass me your concealer.

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,640
Why'd you suddenly quit?

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,320
Did someone hit you? Who was it?

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
A guy or a girl?

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,880
Did you hit back? Call the cops?

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,720
Knowing you,
you wouldn't just let it slide.

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,640
You're the side chick?

63
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,360
You quit out of nowhere,
show up here with bruises…

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Listen, as your friend,

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,840
I can turn a blind eye if you're dating…

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,640
Date a dozen for all I care.

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,600
But that… That's crossing the line.

68
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,920
Fang Ya'en,

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
can you give me some credit?

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
You think my morals are that low?

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,000
Why not say men are fighting
to be my side dude?

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,680
Here, use this.

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,480
So, who was it?

74
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,480
You want to know?

75
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,440
Not telling you.

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,520
You won't even tell me?

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
You don't love me anymore!

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,280
- Don't hit me.
- It's stuck.

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,720
- Here, right here.
- Hang on.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,440
MAY ALL GO WELL, YE RESIDENCE, 1705

81
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
Coming!

82
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,120
Looking gorgeous.

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,400
Come on in.

84
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,680
Careful, it's heavy.

85
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,400
- You're back.
- You've gotten so skinny.

86
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,640
Guess what? Today, I ordered

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,640
your favorite Nantang crab pot.

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
- Mom…
- Meng.

89
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,400
Did you get that limited edition
I asked for?

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,840
I did. It's in my suitcase.

91
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
- Take it later.
- Nice.

92
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
- It was impossible to get.
- Thanks.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,680
Sis,

94
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,640
add another dish.

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Dr. Gao will be here soon.

96
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,440
Dr. Gao? Which one?

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,320
No one in particular.
Just… a client of mine.

98
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,040
Middle Aunt, what is this?

99
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,520
Nothing.

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,440
He's a great young man.

101
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,360
Good career. He's a doctor.

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,080
Big-hearted too.

103
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
A couple of days ago,
he introduced me to a huge order.

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,520
Since you're back now,

105
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
what's wrong with meeting a new friend?

106
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,920
Isn't this a bit much?

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
I just got back.

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,400
Come on, sis, really?

109
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,280
You really can't stop thinking

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
about your little business, can you?

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,280
So, in your eyes, that's all I amount to?

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm telling you,
I'm not in the mood for this right now.

113
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,200
If you push me, I'll walk out.

114
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,200
- No one's--
- Alright, alright!

115
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,000
Everyone, quiet.

116
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,200
Hear me out.

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,840
Meng,

118
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
the guest will be here any minute.

119
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,760
We can't afford to be rude.

120
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,320
It's just a meeting. What's to fear?

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Blame it on our family's lousy luck,

122
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,760
generation after generation.

123
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,720
Look at us three, no kids.

124
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,400
And your dad only had you,
his one and only.

125
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,520
We've been dreaming of you
moving back to Ningsui,

126
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,800
settling down,
and giving this family a baby.

127
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,120
- Come on. Go inside…
- Come.

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,440
- Let's go…
- Go.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,840
I'll help you

130
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,160
take off your makeup.

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,160
Meng, what do you think of this room?

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,680
This, I just bought for you.

133
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,440
Meng, let's wash your face,
take off your makeup.

134
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
- Fine, I hear you.
- I'll help you.

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,520
Got it.

136
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
I'll wait outside.

137
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,400
Don't take too long.

138
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,120
Coming!

139
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
Dr. Gao, welcome.

140
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
- Please, come in.
- Hello.

141
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,800
Meng, hurry up.

142
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
- Dr. Gao's here. Come on out.
- Dr. Gao.

143
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,840
- Hi.
- Welcome. Have a seat.

144
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,640
- This way.
- Mom.

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,840
- There you are.
- Dr. Gao.

146
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,400
- Please, sit.
- Have a seat.

147
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,880
Look at him, such a considerate young man,

148
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,240
- bringing so many gifts.
- My pleasure.

149
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,320
- Have a seat.
- Granny, have a seat.

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,480
- Take a seat.
- Sit.

151
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
- Meng.
- Alright, I know.

152
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,560
She just got back.
Let her fix herself up a bit.

153
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,480
Dr. Gao, which department are you in?

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,040
Orthopedics.

155
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,200
- That's hard work.
- It's alright.

156
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,000
I used to be in cardiac surgery.

157
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
Just transferred over.

158
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,680
Want a banana? Here, have one.

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,280
- I want one.
- I'm good.

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,200
- Have one.
- Really. I am fine.

161
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,800
I'll take one.

162
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,160
What are you doing?

163
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Coming!

164
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
- Your delivery.
- Alright, thanks.

165
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,240
Meng, your crab pot rice is here.

166
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,720
Almost ready!

167
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
She's coming.

168
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,080
NANTANG CRAB POT

169
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,680
Hey, handsome, give me a hand.

170
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,600
- I'll pour that for you.
- It's fine.

171
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,440
Thanks.

172
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680
Got your clothes dirty.

173
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,760
You're skinny, but pretty strong.

174
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,320
Meng, come on.

175
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,880
327-3 XINGYI ROAD

176
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,200
OCEAN BLUE BAY PHASE III NOW LEASING

177
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,840
What is this place now? A barbecue stall?

178
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,320
Wasn't it Nantang Crab Pot before?

179
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,280
They moved a long time ago.
This spot's changed hands

180
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
more than a few times since.

181
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,800
Do you know where they moved to?

182
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
How would I know?

183
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,640
Alright, thanks.

184
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,160
<i>Where did you disappear to?</i>

185
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,920
<i>Dr. Gao's still waiting for you.</i>

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,080
<i>Get back here.</i>

187
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm taking Ya'en to the hospital.

188
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,920
Almost there.
You take good care of Dr. Gao.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll take him out next time.

190
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,200
NANTANG CRAB POT

191
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
NANTANG CRAB POT

192
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,880
What are you looking at?

193
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
I'll charge you.

194
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,760
Your QR code won't even scan,

195
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
and you still want money?

196
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,480
If you're broke, why date at all?

197
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,240
Anyway, I'm busy.

198
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Hanging up.

199
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,320
We meet again.

200
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,040
Want my WeChat?

201
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,120
No.

202
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm looking for Nantang Crab Pot,

203
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,040
but this code won't scan.

204
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,920
They've moved.

205
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,120
Is it far?

206
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,600
Pretty far.

207
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,080
Are you heading back? Give me a lift.

208
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,840
Not on your way?

209
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,920
NANTANG CRAB POT

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
Here you go.

211
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,920
Enjoy your meal. I'll clear this for you.

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,840
HOUSE SPECIAL BASS, DRY-BRAISED PRAWNS

213
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Alright.

214
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,600
- Appreciate it.
- No problem.

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,200
Excuse me. One crab pot rice.

216
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,200
Coming right up!

217
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,680
Here you go.

218
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,160
- Thanks.
- It's hot.

219
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,160
Alright.

220
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,600
You're back, Jinyu.

221
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,680
Good thing you showed up today.

222
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,920
With your cousin away,

223
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,040
I'd have no delivery help.

224
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,840
There's food inside. Go grab it.

225
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,680
Hello?

226
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,680
<i>Just saw your message.</i>

227
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,880
That crab place we used to love as kids

228
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,400
seems to have moved
because business wasn't great.

229
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,080
Not sure where to.
I'll ask around tomorrow.

230
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,560
No need. I already found it.

231
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,720
<i>How'd you find it?</i>

232
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,120
Asked some younger guy.

233
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,360
<i>Younger guy?</i>

234
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,520
Was this a meet-cute?

235
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,840
Why are you so sure
about the younger guys in this town?

236
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,120
<i>Oh, and if Grandma asks,</i>
<i>tell her you broke a bone.</i>

237
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,760
Why am I breaking bones again?

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,040
Since we were little,

239
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
you've broken every limb I have
in your stories.

240
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,640
<i>By now, Grandma must think</i>

241
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,880
<i>I'm only alive</i>
<i>thanks to some divine intervention.</i>

242
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Thanks.

243
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,160
Alright, see you.

244
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
Mom!

245
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,600
Do not touch me…

246
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,280
Hi. Mind if I add you on WeChat?

247
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,680
Got it, thanks.

248
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,960
I got it.

249
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,560
MAY ALL GO WELL, YE RESIDENCE, 1705

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
Stop right there.

251
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,400
Come here!

252
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,480
What's wrong?

253
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,040
Still up?

254
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,680
Careful. You'll get dark circles.

255
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
Then I'll have to buy you eye cream.

256
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,800
What's going on?

257
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,200
Well… I just took the chance today

258
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,080
to talk to him about some other business.

259
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,080
Asked him to help promote
some health products.

260
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,080
You have no idea
how much trouble I go to for you.

261
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,240
I'm only trying to set you up
with someone dependable.

262
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,000
Mom!

263
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
In our Ye family,

264
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,880
we've never gone back on our word.

265
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,280
A guest came all the way here,

266
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,720
and you jumped out the window to escape.

267
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,320
How am I supposed
to show my face after that?

268
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,440
Can we keep this short?

269
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,920
I've been on a plane all day. I'm beat.

270
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm heading to the old house later.

271
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,800
Meng,

272
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,720
Grandma's already moved in with me here.

273
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,680
Why go back there?

274
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
That place is falling apart.

275
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
You're just afraid
Dr. Gao will show up again.

276
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,280
It's not that.
I just don't think it's right.

277
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,960
Haven't I told you before?

278
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,080
I like younger men.

279
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,280
Younger? What for?

280
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,440
So the two of you

281
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,240
can get married
and wreck my house together?

282
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,040
Now, Mom, I can't agree with you on--

283
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,640
Shut it, you fool.

284
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,960
Go to bed.

285
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,240
Hey, you talk to her.

286
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,960
So, how much younger are we talking?

287
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
There's no set rule.

288
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,560
A couple of years younger is fine.

289
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
Seven or eight works too.

290
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,360
You…

291
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,040
Oh, that reminds me.
Ya'en's still in the hospital.

292
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,000
She broke her leg.
I gotta bring her some toiletries.

293
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,760
Get back here!

294
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,120
I called her place tonight.

295
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,840
She's perfectly fine.

296
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,360
She'll be the death of me.

297
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,160
Don't be mad, Mom.

298
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,319
What's this? Who's that?

299
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,319
Fang Ya'en.

300
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,119
She really did break her leg.

301
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,240
What happened to you?

302
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,760
Ye Meng,

303
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,160
you totally jinxed me. Look at my foot.

304
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,200
What did the doctor say?

305
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,000
Said I just have to stay off it
and let it heal.

306
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,160
Ye Meng?

307
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,680
You're Mrs. Ye's granddaughter,
right? Meng?

308
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,840
- Yeah.
- Ye Meng.

309
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,760
Well, it's been six or seven years

310
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,400
since you moved out of the old house.
Haven't seen you once.

311
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,800
Granny Tou?

312
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,720
That's me.

313
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,720
Yeah… It's been forever.

314
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,400
You've gotten so pretty.

315
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,360
- Thanks.
- Let me introduce you.

316
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,160
This is my grandson,

317
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,400
Li Badou.

318
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,520
Go on. Say hi to Sis Ye.

319
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,480
We used to be neighbors.

320
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,880
When he moved to Ningsui,

321
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,640
you'd already gone to Jiangbei for school,

322
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,080
so you never crossed paths.

323
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,760
Go on. Say hello.

324
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,000
Hello.

325
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,880
Don't mind him.

326
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,880
He's such a stiff.

327
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,080
Awkward, tongue-tied.

328
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,520
Can't get a word out to save his life.

329
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,000
It's fine. Granny,

330
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,200
how'd you hurt your leg?

331
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,840
A couple of days ago,

332
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,720
I was fixing up the flower shed
and took a bad fall.

333
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,760
You need to be careful.

334
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,960
We'll chat for a bit.

335
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
- Come here.
- What?

336
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,960
That neighbor boy is seriously handsome.

337
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,440
You never noticed before?

338
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,520
He's alright.

339
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,880
"Alright"? That's what you call "alright"?

340
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,240
Your standards must be sky-high.

341
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,320
I like the ones who behave.

342
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,120
Badou,

343
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
I want this wine.

344
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
Can't afford it.

345
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,920
Then have Jiang buy it.

346
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,640
She can afford it.

347
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
And why should she?

348
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,080
Aren't you two boyfriend and girlfriend?

349
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,080
Oh, right.

350
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,080
Your birthday's in a couple of days.

351
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,960
Have her get it for you
as a birthday gift.

352
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,320
We just started dating,

353
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
and you want me
to hit her up for presents?

354
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,040
That's not a good look.

355
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,800
If you're not into her, just say so.

356
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
I'll fix you up with someone else.

357
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,680
Oh, hey,
Mr. Liu's granddaughter is perfect.

358
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,080
She's got her own house and car,

359
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,520
and she's not asking for a dowry.

360
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,360
She'll even throw in

361
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,800
300k cash as a wedding gift.

362
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,720
Why don't we just do this?
You sell me off.

363
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,480
Whatever price you get,

364
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,200
you can keep.

365
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,520
Then you can take the money,

366
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,320
eat, drink, travel the world,

367
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,840
and I'll go be some woman's
live-in husband,

368
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,240
taking care of her whole family.

369
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,120
That work for you?

370
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,200
Get lost.

371
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,040
Maimai, keep an eye on Grandma.

372
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
I'm going to pay the bill.

373
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,440
And put your headphones on.
This is a hospital. Don't disturb people.

374
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,600
Plug it in.

375
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760
You do know how, right?

376
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
- He's good-looking and pretty tall.
- I'll get some rest.

377
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
- See as much as you can if you like.
- Let me know if you need any.

378
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,960
- I'm doing the looking for you.
- Stop it.

379
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,520
I'm not feeling great. Don't wind me up.

380
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,720
- Hey,
- Yes?

381
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,200
is your brother really named Li Badou?

382
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,000
That's just his nickname.

383
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,920
You wouldn't guess now,

384
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,240
but my grandma says when he was a kid,
he was dark and scrawny,

385
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,840
like a little broad bean.

386
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,120
So, the name stuck.

387
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,880
His real name's Li Jinyu.

388
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,440
<i>Jin</i> is the character with <i>ge</i> and <i>jin</i>.

389
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,560
<i>Yu</i> is the one that stands for island.

390
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm his cousin.

391
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,880
By the way,

392
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,560
I heard your grandma say

393
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,320
his girlfriend's Jiang, right?

394
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,480
Why didn't she come?

395
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,000
She works in Jiangbei. Doesn't have time.

396
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,000
I like her though.

397
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,200
She's beautiful and makes
seven figures a year.

398
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,680
Her last name's Jiang, right?

399
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,240
Is she from around here?

400
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,400
Yeah, she's from Ningsui too.

401
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,920
Is she Jiang Luzhi?

402
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,240
Yeah. You know her?

403
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,240
Is she kind of a big deal?

404
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,600
I heard she just got a raise
and doubled her salary.

405
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,480
And she jumped to some…

406
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,520
What's it called?

407
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,000
A service consulting company.
She's a project manager now.

408
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,880
- Geometric Field.
- Yeah, that's the one.

409
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,440
Wait. Wasn't that your company?

410
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,360
Thanks for telling us.

411
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,760
- Anytime.
- Enjoy your game.

412
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
You didn't quit over Jiang Luzhi, did you?

413
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Bingo.

414
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,280
She swooped into our company

415
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,480
and snatched my project.

416
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,480
The clients my team and I
spent six months landing,

417
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,400
Gou Kai gave to her directly.

418
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,520
Did Jiang Luzhi hit you in the face?

419
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,200
Just don't let me run into her.

420
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,040
Don't worry.

421
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,840
She's got it worse than me.

422
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,960
Let go! I said let go!

423
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,720
- Jiang Luzhi, are you out of your mind?
- Let go!

424
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,080
You actually hit me?

425
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,800
What are you looking at?
I'll claw your eyes out!

426
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,720
Let's go. Let's go.

427
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,720
Bunch of busybodies.

428
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,840
Alright, that's enough.

429
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,360
Keep it down. You're disturbing people.

430
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
No, I'm giving you props.

431
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,040
I knew you'd never be a pushover.

432
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,840
Alright… Thanks a lot.

433
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,440
Wenwen, hold off on that contract for now.

434
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,880
I'll check with Mr. Gou first.

435
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,800
- Is Mr. Gou in?
- Yeah, he's here.

436
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Are you ticklish, Mr. Gou?

437
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,320
Are you ticklish? Not even a little?

438
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,360
Sorry to interrupt. Is now a good time?

439
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,840
Perfect timing.

440
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,840
Let me introduce you.

441
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,560
Ye Meng, Jiang Luzhi.

442
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,280
You two know each other, right?

443
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,080
We do.

444
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,240
It's been a while.

445
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,200
Luzhi's officially

446
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,960
joining our company today.

447
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,000
The project you're on
will be handed over to her.

448
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,800
Excuse me?

449
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,440
My team spent six months on that project,

450
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,360
and now it's hers?

451
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,000
Luzhi might be a better fit,
easier to communicate with for the client.

452
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,920
So, that's how you "communicate", huh?

453
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,600
Alright.

454
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,200
You two carry on.
I'll get out of your way.

455
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,440
Hey.

456
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,880
Your girlfriend's Jiang Luzhi, right?

457
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,320
What about it?

458
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,480
She's got a boyfriend… in Jiangbei.

459
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
So?

460
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,880
So, she's cheating on you.

461
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,360
Are you telling me this

462
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,920
as a favor,

463
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,160
or do you have it out for her?

464
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,880
Let me guess.

465
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,880
She

466
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,840
stole your man?

467
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,840
You barely know me,
so here's the truth.

468
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,840
I'm not exactly a good person.

469
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
Just admit you want the drama.

470
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,280
No need to pretend
you're doing me a favor.

471
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,880
Kid, you're not just paranoid,

472
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,240
your taste is terrible.

473
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,480
I wouldn't look twice
at any guy she's into.

474
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
Got everything sorted for you.

475
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,320
Where'd you just go?

476
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,640
I went to pay the bill.

477
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,120
That young guy looked really upset

478
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,040
when he came back in.

479
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,160
Did you do something to him?

480
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,000
I didn't do a thing.

481
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,200
Why assume the worst of me?

482
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,720
Because I know you too well.

483
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,720
What do you know?

484
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,840
Fang Ya'en.

485
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,480
That's enough.

486
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,320
What about Jiayu tomorrow? I'll take him.

487
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,720
Don't bother. He's with my mom.

488
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,960
You should just head back.

489
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,880
Alright, I'm going.

490
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,080
Get some sleep.

491
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,840
Big brother, got any more candy?

492
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,280
Your teeth are about to fall out,
and you still want candy?

493
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Your mom will smack you.

494
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Didn't know you were this mean.

495
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,520
Come on. Guess.

496
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,880
I've got four pockets.

497
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,760
Which one has candy?

498
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,960
Pick right and it's yours.

499
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,120
Liar. Not the pants pockets.

500
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,800
I saw you
take it out of your jacket pocket.

501
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm not lying.
All four pockets have candy.

502
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,920
Go on. Guess.

503
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,160
Okay…

504
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,160
This one.

505
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,960
There really is!

506
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,600
Big brother,
you're the richest person I know.

507
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,720
All four of your pockets have candy.

508
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,520
I don't even have one pocket.

509
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,280
Tricked you. That was my last piece.

510
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,960
Make sure you brush your teeth.

511
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,640
Or tomorrow the dentist pulls them all.

512
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,280
Big brother,

513
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,000
which room are you in?

514
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
Can I come visit you?

515
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,520
I think you're really cool.

516
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,280
Dressed all in black,

517
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,320
like some…

518
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,520
grim reaper out of a movie.

519
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,400
You want more of my candy, don't you?

520
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,600
I might not show up every day.

521
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,800
Depends on my mood.

522
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,200
Fine. I'll head back.

523
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,560
Otherwise, Mom will say
I'm misbehaving again.

524
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,600
Bye, Grim Reaper.

525
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,600
I heard you have a boyfriend in Jiangbei.

526
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
Don't you think you owe me an explanation?

527
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,640
327-3 XINGYI ROAD

528
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,800
I'll grab you some more fruit.

529
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,720
Alright.

530
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,160
And milk too? Alright.

531
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Bye.

532
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,920
PURE MILK

533
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,080
That's heavy.

534
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,320
Sorry about this. Our register's down.

535
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,480
I'll add it up by hand.

536
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,400
No problem.

537
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,240
Nineteen…

538
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,680
Forty…

539
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,680
Fifty-eight…

540
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,000
Plus 55…

541
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,840
That's 178.80.

542
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,120
Yes, that's right.

543
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,120
You're pretty good at math, handsome.

544
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,280
Thanks.

545
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,400
Careful on your way out.

546
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
Sixty-eight.

547
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,800
Hold on a second.

548
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,480
Hard to believe after all these years
as a corporate slave,

549
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,880
I'm here running errands for you.

550
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,480
You jinxed me.

551
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,640
Shouldn't you be the one
taking care of me?

552
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,120
Alright, alright, sorry.

553
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,280
What do you want to eat?

554
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,160
Not now. I've got a real question.

555
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,120
Has Cheng Kairan reached out to you?

556
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
No.

557
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,200
Good.

558
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,760
Then don't go anywhere either.

559
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,000
Wait until I'm discharged.

560
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,600
Hi, Granny.

561
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,840
Keep going.

562
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,080
Do you and that doctor know each other?

563
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,560
He keeps sneaking looks at you.

564
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,200
All you think about is Li Badou.

565
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,640
Just the fact he's Jiang Luzhi's boyfriend

566
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,800
is enough for me to pass on him.

567
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,160
Correction.

568
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,520
Ex-boyfriend.

569
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,600
They broke up? Who ended it?

570
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,880
Keep playing.

571
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,160
Keep playing innocent, Ye Meng.

572
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,320
Don't tell me you don't know what you did.

573
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,600
What exactly did I do?

574
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,000
You're not usually the meddling type.

575
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,520
The only reason

576
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,600
you went after Li Jinyu was because

577
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,080
he was with Jiang Luzhi.

578
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,480
How do you know they split?

579
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
Last night,

580
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,160
just because of their breakup…

581
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,400
Granny Tou scolded Li Jinyu
about it all night.

582
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,400
Honestly,

583
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,480
this has nothing to do with Li Jinyu.

584
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,960
You really shouldn't have…

585
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,000
You know.

586
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,440
What do you mean?

587
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,480
I was helping him.
He should be thanking me, actually.

588
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Fine. Call it meddling.

589
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
I'll apologize to him.

590
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,080
Good, good.

591
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,680
That poor guy.

592
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,440
I'll be right back.

593
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,480
Stop rushing me. I'm already on my way.

594
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
I heard you.

595
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,800
I'll be right back.

596
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,040
Hey, girl.

597
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,080
Can you tell me where your cousin works?

598
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

599
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
Thanks, everyone, for coming tonight.

600
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,160
So, what are you singing today?

601
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,840
Haven't decided yet.

602
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,560
Hey, kid, can you step outside?

603
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,800
I need to talk to you.

604
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,840
Sorry. Excuse me.

605
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,320
NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR DRINKS

606
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,800
What is it?

607
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,560
I… Actually, I--

608
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,520
Take it.

609
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,040
JIANG LUZHI

610
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,480
Hello?

611
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,800
<i>I just saw your WeChat message.</i>

612
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,639
<i>Sorry, Jinyu.</i>

613
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,080
- <i>I'm--</i>
- Congratulations.

614
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,159
<i>I'll explain everything when I get back.</i>

615
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,400
<i>This one's my fault.</i>

616
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,080
Got it. Anything else?

617
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,520
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

618
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,880
<i>Work's been crazy lately.</i>

619
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,360
<i>That's why I didn't tell you sooner.</i>

620
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,520
<i>But please, don't let my family know--</i>

621
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,199
Happy now? Stop pestering me.

622
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,000
No, wait. Don't be like that.

623
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,239
I know breakups hurt.

624
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,440
Why's there no signal?

625
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,680
Did a woman just come out of here?

626
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,000
Didn't see.

627
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,840
Did a woman go in a second ago?

628
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
This is the ladies' room.
What do you think?

629
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,040
Sir, sir! The men's room is that way.

630
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,640
Don't need you telling me. Mind your own.

631
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,840
- Sir, sir!
- Ye Meng!

632
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,400
Come out!

633
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,360
Let go of me.

634
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,400
This is the ladies' room.

635
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,600
Ye Meng, I know you're in there!

636
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
Come out right now!

637
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,040
Move!

638
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,080
- Sir, please…
- Ye Meng!

639
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm begging you, sir. Don't--

640
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,360
- Is there a woman inside?
- Sir.

641
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
- Did she just--
- Calm down, please.

642
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,880
What are you doing?

643
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,000
Don't make it hard for me.

644
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,600
I can't answer to the owner.

645
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,520
I'm the owner here. How dare you accuse--

646
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,920
- Let me in--
- Yeah, right.

647
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,160
Let me clue you in.

648
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,920
Ten guys a day

649
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,840
stumble in here claiming
they're the owner.

650
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,160
You're drunk. Go puke it out.

651
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,640
- What's your problem?
- Stop messing around.

652
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,120
Step aside. Ye Meng!

653
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,280
I know you're in there!

654
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,680
Come out now!

655
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,600
Don't do this!

656
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,640
- Need a hand?
- Isn't it obvious?

657
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,760
- Thank you.
- Call me "big brother."

658
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,920
I can't stand being called "kid".

659
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,480
So what?

660
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,320
You think I can't handle this
and need big brother's help?

661
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,800
Hands off.

662
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,800
Ye Meng!

663
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,800
Why are you just standing there? Hurry!

664
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,480
- Okay.
- Come on.

665
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,960
Put a little muscle into it.

666
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,320
Higher. A bit higher.

667
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,120
- Check by the window.
- Put me down!

668
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,080
- He's got people outside.
- Ye Meng!

669
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,520
Zhang, who hired him?

670
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,680
Help, somebody!

671
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,560
- Where's Captain Wang?
- He's harassing me!

672
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,480
Let go!

673
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,920
- Don't make a scene.
- Let go of my leg!

674
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,920
Now!

675
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,720
- Over here.
- Ye Meng!

676
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,400
Ye Meng!

677
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
Ye Meng, come out!

678
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,520
- Ex-boyfriend?
- Ex nothing.

679
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,720
Think of something, quick.

680
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,720
Take off your clothes.

681
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,800
What are you doing?

682
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,840
Give me your jacket.

683
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,480
And your shoes. Put mine on.

684
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,480
Ye Meng!

685
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,520
Come out!

686
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Sit down.

687
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,480
When they come in, play along.

688
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,680
Where's Zhang?

689
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,160
- You can't barge into the ladies' room.
- I know!

690
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,280
Let me go!

691
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,960
Who brought this idiot in here?

692
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,400
Listen up!

693
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,040
I'm the owner of this place!

694
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,720
I came in to check

695
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,040
if my friend was inside,

696
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,840
not to storm the ladies' room!

697
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,520
Mind your own business!

698
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,040
Go back to drinking.

699
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,840
He is the actual owner.

700
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,320
Alright, move along.

701
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,160
And you.

702
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,640
Pick up your paycheck tomorrow,

703
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,480
and don't let me see you again! Get lost!

704
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,880
Ye Meng!

705
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,920
- Ye Meng!
- What's up, Kai?

706
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,920
What are you doing here?

707
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,760
What do you think?

708
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,360
Can you stop doing that stuff in my bar?

709
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,880
Did you
see a woman come in just now?

710
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,560
Didn't notice.

711
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,160
I was busy inside.
How would I know what's going on out here?

712
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,280
I was shouting loud enough.
You didn't hear me?

713
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,320
Not a word.

714
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,360
Who's that girl

715
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,480
in there with you? What's her name?

716
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
No clue. Didn't ask.

717
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,280
Really?

718
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,640
You've got some nerve.
Come on.Let me take a look.

719
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,760
She's getting dressed.

720
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,520
Just one look. I need to know

721
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,880
if she's someone I know.

722
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,280
Okay? Just a peek.

723
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,160
She's really not wearing anything…

724
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,840
Sorry, sorry, my apologies, miss.

725
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,200
You two are unbelievable.

726
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,280
That's enough, Kai.

727
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,640
Cut me some slack here.

728
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't care if I get caught on camera,

729
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,680
but she's a girl.

730
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,520
If this spreads,
how can she stay in this town?

731
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,000
Where can she even hide?

732
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,400
What are you dong?

733
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,680
Step aside, please.

734
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,880
Stop filming.

735
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,240
- He doesn't need to raise his voice.
- Really.

736
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,400
Hey, cut it out. Let's go.

737
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,200
He's already gone.

738
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,000
Thanks.

739
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Can you hand me my clothes?

740
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,600
<i>Seems my story's already told</i>

741
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,360
<i>Stuck at a crossroad, I can't move forward</i>

742
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,400
<i>Trying to steady the beat of my soul</i>

743
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,080
<i>Eyes still linger, tears about to fall</i>

744
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,160
<i>I pretend I'm calm, but it's all a show</i>

745
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,280
<i>Inside I'm hurting more than you know</i>

746
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,480
<i>So many words I want to say</i>

747
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,400
<i>But I won't look back, I'll walk away</i>

748
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,600
<i>I can't control, no more</i>

749
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,200
<i>Don't want to explain it all</i>

750
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,360
<i>You already know, though I don't speak</i>

751
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,760
<i>I just don't want to see you hurt</i>

752
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,720
