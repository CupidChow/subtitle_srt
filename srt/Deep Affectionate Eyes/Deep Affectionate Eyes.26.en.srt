00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,240
SIX MONTHS LATER

3
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,160
Bro,

4
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,760
is this what you call
a "beachside vacation cottage"?

5
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,320
You mean this old rural house?

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,880
You lied to me.

7
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,840
You're overthinking it.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,000
You're not staying here.

9
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,800
You'll be… over there.

10
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,680
Granny!

11
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,920
- Your grandson is here!
- Coming.

12
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,480
Coming.

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,600
My darling grandson!

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,480
Granny missed you so much!

15
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,480
- I've already tidied up your room,
- Give it to me.

16
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,760
filled it with toys.

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,200
Look at this free-range chicken.

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,600
It even has double eyelids.

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,160
Tonight, I'll cook it into soup
to nourish you properly.

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
Look how thin he's become,

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,640
just like a little monkey.

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,080
Enough of it.

23
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,639
That's disgusting!

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,160
I'm not eating that.

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,440
You think it's disgusting?

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
You little rascal!

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,920
Stop dodging!

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Who spoiled you this badly?

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,040
Eat it or don't.

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Starve then.

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm going.

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,040
You're going home.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,440
Come on. Let's go home.

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
Go home with Granny.

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,600
Since you won't eat, I'll save it.

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,840
Bro,

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
when is Mom coming to pick me up?

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,440
So, you really don't like it here?

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,200
But then again,

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,280
when I first arrived,

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,640
I had a tough time too.

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,120
Really?

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,880
So, you think Granny is really strict too?

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
She was way stricter
with me than with you.

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,480
Even hit me a few times.

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
But honestly,

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
she's all tough talk.

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,360
Deep down, she cares about us
more than anyone.

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Right after being discharged

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,200
from the hospital, she cleaned your room

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,560
and learned to cook your favorite dishes.

52
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,880
She kept pestering me about
when I could bring you home.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,560
But I still miss Mom.

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,040
Even though she made mistakes.

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,880
She misses you too.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,760
But now,

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
you have Granny,

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,440
and you have me as your brother.

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,200
Don't worry.

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,480
We'll all take good care of you.

61
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
But it's alright.

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
We'll take it slow.

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
Badou! Zhuofeng!

64
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,360
What are you two doing?

65
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
Get back here for dinner now!

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,959
- Coming!
- Hurry up!

67
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
Let's go?

68
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,480
How's your little brother doing?
Is he adjusting alright?

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,280
Not bad. He's adjusting
much faster than I did back then.

70
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,600
What are you looking at?
You're smiling so happily.

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,160
I want to show you something!

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Look!

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,560
See?

74
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,240
This kitten is so adorable!

75
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,600
Let's get a Devon Rex too.

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,360
They're gorgeous and super affectionate.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,040
- So cute!
- Affectionate?

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,600
The best part? It hardly sheds any fur.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,120
We're not getting one.

80
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Why?

81
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,840
We already have Ping'an.

82
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,880
If we get a cat, it'll get jealous.

83
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,440
Ping'an hardly ever stays home.
What would it have to be jealous about?

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,720
If you don't want a cat, just say so.

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,520
Don't use Ping'an as an excuse.

86
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,920
Seems like you're
way more devoted to that dog

87
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,400
than to me!

88
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
You're twisting this around.

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,000
You were the one who wanted
a cat first. So unfaithful.

90
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,240
You're getting jealous over a cat?

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,880
I married you, Li Jinyu!

92
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,640
Whatever.

93
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,640
Fine.

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,080
Let's go check out a cattery
when we have time.

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
That's right!

96
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
Pinky swear.

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,480
Pinky swear.

98
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,480
Swear!

99
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's keep looking.

100
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,280
So adorable, see?

101
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,960
Not as cute as Ping'an.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
I'm the prettiest!

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,760
You're pretty.

104
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,720
Finally, wrap it
three times around the wrist.

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,000
Make sure to wrap it tightly.

106
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,480
- Just like this?
- Before we formally start

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,720
learning boxing,

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,560
we need to protect our bodies.

109
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,800
Make sure to tuck your wrists inward.

110
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,800
- Like this?
- Yes, tight against your body.

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,200
- No, like this.
- Like this?

112
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,600
Yes, press snugly against your cheeks.

113
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,240
And keep your arms

114
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,520
tight against your ribs

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,400
- to protect your sides
- Like this.

116
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,240
from punches. Both sides here.

117
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,520
Alright, let's end
today's lesson here, okay?

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
- Alright.
- Let's do it.

119
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,240
Let me take you home.

120
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,720
No need. My mom's picking me up later.

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,640
- Your mom's coming?
- Jiayu.

122
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Mom.

123
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
You…

124
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,560
are here to to pick up Jiayu.

125
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,800
So, how's business been
since you converted this place

126
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,360
into a restaurant? Going pretty well?

127
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,360
Mostly just regulars.

128
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,480
It's getting by.

129
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Let me pack up his things,
then we'll head out.

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,240
Okay.

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,720
Cheng,

132
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
why are you ignoring my calls?

133
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,920
I finally found you!

134
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,960
- Ms. Liu!
- Ya'en, you're here too.

135
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,880
Your blind date is tomorrow at noon.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,160
Kai, you're going on a blind date?

137
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
It's not me.

138
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,240
I didn't know anything about this! What?

139
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,280
- What blind date?
- Your mom set it up with me.

140
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,280
Besides, last time at Ya'en's shop,

141
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,880
weren't you still thinking
about finding a girlfriend?

142
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Listen, this girl
has really great qualities.

143
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,240
No harm in meeting her.

144
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,360
- Right?
- No, I--

145
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,520
Ya'en, quick, help me
talk some sense into your brother.

146
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
He's just too shy for his own good.

147
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,040
- My mom…
- Exactly.

148
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,080
Just give it a try.

149
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,200
You wouldn't want to miss out.

150
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,240
- Right!
- I…

151
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,080
What are you so shy about?

152
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,000
Besides,

153
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,880
your family already paid the deposit.

154
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,800
Let me tell you.

155
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,480
I actually have professional standards,

156
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,440
unlike those matchmaking agencies
that just take money and do nothing.

157
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,720
- I--
- Right.

158
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,240
Ms. Liu is totally reliable.

159
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,000
- Let's go, Jiayu.
- Let's go, Mom.

160
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,039
We're leaving.

161
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,080
Okay.

162
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,919
- Bye-bye, Kai.
- You…

163
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
Wait. My mom mentioned nothing to me.

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Your mom already paid the deposit.

165
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,480
Alright, I'm done talking.

166
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,280
Tomorrow at noon at Tide Restaurant.

167
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,640
Don't be late.

168
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,200
You hear me?

169
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,320
Don't be late.

170
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,880
Jiayu.

171
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,040
You…

172
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,560
Just go.

173
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
- Don't be late, you hear?
- Alright.

174
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Alright, I'm going.

175
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
- Okay.
- Don't be late.

176
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,000
Alright.

177
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,120
Bye, Ms. Liu.

178
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,280
Mom,

179
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,520
a woman called Ms. Liu mentioned something

180
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,280
about you arranging
a blind date for me tomorrow?

181
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
Hello. Reservation for Ms. Fang.

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
Right this way, please.

183
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,000
I thought you didn't like this restaurant.
Why did you pick this one?

184
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,400
I've grown up now. Tastes change.

185
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,640
Okay, okay.

186
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,280
Kai, what a coincidence.

187
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,440
Excuse me.

188
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,760
What a coincidence!

189
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,240
Your friend?

190
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,360
Well…

191
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,840
my parents

192
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,800
said we should get to know each other.

193
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,360
The blind date?

194
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,680
It's not like that!

195
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,000
Then just enjoy your meal.

196
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,440
We won't be third wheels here. Go ahead.

197
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,360
No.

198
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,400
Kai, bye-bye.

199
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,280
You order, Jiayu.

200
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,240
Thank you.

201
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,960
I'll have…

202
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,720
the fried chicken wings,
mashed potato salad,

203
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,840
and this… What's it called? Sanma fish?

204
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Sorry about that.

205
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,800
I ran into an old acquaintance.

206
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
No problem.

207
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,720
I assume Ms. Liu has already
filled you in on my information?

208
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,280
For drinks, one vanilla milk tea.

209
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,240
And then, add an apple cake too.

210
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,160
Here you go.

211
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,280
Alright.

212
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,640
Ms. Liu, the matchmaker who set us up

213
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,560
on this blind date…

214
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,680
She didn't tell you?

215
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,840
Is it possible our parents

216
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,240
communicated about this
between themselves?

217
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,720
Then, let me introduce myself.

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

219
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,880
Both my parents are teachers too.

220
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm an only child.

221
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,240
I already own a car and an apartment.

222
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,360
I'm just looking for someone with
similar circumstances here in Ningsui.

223
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,520
Chen Jiayu,

224
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,280
did you bring me
to this restaurant on purpose?

225
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,720
Mom, I didn't. How could
you think that? I'm your own son.

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
How could my own son
be so calculating toward his own mom?

227
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Then, how could my own mom
say one thing and mean another?

228
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,360
Can't outtalk you.

229
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,640
What do you think of me?

230
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,040
You seem really great.

231
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,040
I also think we're quite compatible.

232
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,280
Appearance, height,
financial status, all good.

233
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,280
It's rare to meet someone
decent-looking through blind dates.

234
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
Since we both feel positive,

235
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
why not give dating a try?

236
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,760
Actually…

237
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,600
Better not.

238
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,840
It's not you. It's me.

239
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,720
I… have feelings for someone else.

240
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,080
Even though she hasn't accepted me yet,

241
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm not giving up.

242
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,160
I agreed to meet today

243
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,760
specifically to be honest with you

244
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,240
and to apologize.

245
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
No problem.

246
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,320
Having someone to cherish is a good thing.

247
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,840
You should've told me earlier

248
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,240
to avoid misunderstandings.

249
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,960
For today, let's just consider it
making a new friend.

250
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,800
Here's to you achieving your wishes.

251
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,360
Good luck with your pursuit of love.

252
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,840
Wishing you all the best too.

253
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,720
Thank you for your understanding.

254
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
By the way,

255
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,640
I opened a restaurant right by the beach.

256
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,520
You and your girlfriends

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,840
should come dine there sometime.

258
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,480
Absolutely. Definitely will.

259
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,000
Mom, what are you up to?

260
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Taking photos of you.

261
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,480
This spot has such a nice atmosphere.

262
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,640
Wait, let me strike a pose.

263
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,960
Let me see.

264
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
It's blurry. Let's take one outside.
The lighting isn't great here.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,080
Mom, I need to tell you something.

266
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,440
I wasn't going to say it

267
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,680
because it was supposed
to be a secret between Kai and me.

268
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,560
What is it?

269
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,120
That time I got into a fight at school,
you remember, right?

270
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,440
How could I forget?

271
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,720
Actually, it was because

272
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,640
they were talking about you and Kai
behind my back.

273
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,160
Otherwise, I would never
have thrown the first punch.

274
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
Why didn't you
tell Mom about it back then?

275
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,560
I didn't want you
to blame yourself or get upset.

276
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,680
Kai felt the same way.

277
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,840
Eat up quickly before it gets cold.

278
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,800
I never thought

279
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,520
there was anything wrong
with you and Kai being together.

280
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,640
In fact, it makes me happy

281
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,920
because there's one more person
to protect you alongside me.

282
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,560
Mom understands now.

283
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,520
MENG CALLING

284
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,960
Hello, Meng.

285
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,960
<i>Sweetie, where are you?</i>
<i>Are you busy this afternoon?</i>

286
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm having a meal with Jiayu right now.

287
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,720
It's fine, Mom.You should
go with Aunt Meng this afternoon.

288
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,920
I made plans with Wang Sisi
to go to the library.

289
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,200
Alright then. I'm free now.

290
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,120
Where are you?

291
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,320
<i>See you at the café then.</i>

292
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,680
Sounds good.

293
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
What's going on? You look furious.

294
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,760
Did you have a fight with someone?

295
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,680
Li Jinyu?

296
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,600
What's wrong now?

297
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,280
He's learned to stand me up now.

298
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,080
Last night, we agreed
to go to the cat shelter to adopt a cat,

299
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
and now he's pretending to be busy.

300
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,920
I think he doesn't
want me to have a cat at all.

301
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,360
Are you two actually arguing

302
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,360
or just flirting?

303
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
We are flirting,

304
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,360
but honestly,

305
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,160
do you think we might be
hitting that marital burnout phase?

306
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,640
You two? No way!

307
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,600
You're practically glued together 24/7.

308
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,640
If you're more than 100 meters apart,
you turn on shared location.

309
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,800
It's not that exaggerated.

310
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,480
Just keep showing off your love!

311
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,520
Then I need to make it clear to him.
What does he mean by this?

312
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,840
You don't look quite yourself today.

313
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,960
What's going on?

314
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
Do I?

315
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,080
Not really.

316
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,320
Why would someone else's blind date
have anything to do with me?

317
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,040
Blind date? Who's on a blind date?

318
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,320
Did Cheng Kairan go behind your back
on a blind date?

319
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,920
Watch your words!
What do you mean, "behind my back"?

320
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
What does that have to do with me?

321
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,360
Besides, blind dates are a good thing.

322
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,000
As his older sister,
I should be happy for him.

323
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,640
Yes, and the girl is quite pretty.
I saw her, and think they're a good match.

324
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,600
Who is she?

325
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,120
Someone from our town? Do I know her?

326
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,640
I don't.

327
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
See if you recognize her.

328
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,800
The same girl who used
to smash bricks over punks' heads

329
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,160
now resorts to sneaky photos?

330
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,840
- Turned paparazzi?
- What? What sneaky photos?

331
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,520
You hand them over to me!
I was taking pictures of Jiayu

332
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,240
and just happened
to catch her in the background.

333
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,160
Give them to me!

334
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,240
You're really not acting like yourself.

335
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,360
It's weird.

336
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,480
- How am I being weird?
- Super weird.

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,200
Am I?

338
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,720
Be honest with me.

339
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,200
Have you been avoiding Kai lately?

340
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,480
Why didn't you go to the opening that day?

341
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,920
I was busy. Not avoiding anyone.

342
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,640
Fang Ya'en, sometimes
you really should learn from me.

343
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,000
Look,

344
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,760
although Li Jinyu
and I started off impulsively,

345
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,240
we made it work in the end.

346
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,040
Don't let one bad experience
make you overly cautious forever.

347
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,839
If you like someone,

348
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
just give it a try.

349
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,120
So annoying.

350
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,000
Pathetic, isn't it?

351
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,960
- Getting shy?
- I'm not! I really…

352
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,960
Honey.

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,960
You're back!

354
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,440
Quick, come sit down.

355
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,920
You must be exhausted today.

356
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,360
Still remembered to come home?

357
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,840
You stood me up
and didn't come back until this late.

358
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,680
Is it because
you don't want to see me either?

359
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,000
I didn't.

360
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,520
Honey, I'm sorry.

361
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
The reason I didn't want you to get a cat

362
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,080
is because you looked at that cat

363
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,000
brighter than you ever look at me.

364
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Why are you competing with a cat?

365
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,520
Don't tell me you think
I see you as just a cat?

366
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,960
Stop looking at me like that.

367
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,560
You do kind of act like a big cat.

368
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,880
But don't think that'll distract me.

369
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,320
Seems to me we've hit
that marital burnout phase, haven't we?

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,960
Marital burnout?

371
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Where did you get that term?

372
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,160
It is burnout!
You can't even stand the sight of me now.

373
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,360
Then let me show you

374
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,920
what real burnout looks like.

375
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,480
What are you doing?

376
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,120
Who's really in burnout? Does
the sight of me disgust you that much?

377
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
No, I'm feeling really sick right now.

378
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,880
You… For real?

379
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,320
For real?

380
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,560
Why did you buy so many of them?

381
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,240
I'm worried that these are unreliable.

382
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,760
You still can't read this?

383
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,920
It's written right here.

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,920
It's all about
whether there's one line or two.

385
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,120
How's it going?

386
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,680
I'm almost done.

387
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,000
How is it?

388
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,200
If we were to have a baby,

389
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,200
would you be a good father?

390
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
I will definitely
strive to be a good father.

391
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,000
Congratulations on your upgrade.

392
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,640
I'm so excited. Is the baby okay?

393
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,800
The baby is fine.
I'm the one feeling dizzy.

394
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm going to be a dad!

395
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,680
Li Jinyu.

396
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,160
Alright, from now on, no moving around.

397
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,560
- Lie down.
- I have to lie down?

398
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,120
Here, careful now. Lie down.

399
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,520
- I haven't taken my shoes off yet.
- Here, let me do it.

400
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,480
PROSPERITY AND SUCCESS

401
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,560
Hello.

402
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,960
Hello.

403
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,120
Check, check.

404
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,200
Hello.

405
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,120
Hello.

406
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,800
- Hello.
- Come on.

407
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,520
Here. Give it to me!

408
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,560
Be careful!

409
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,920
Stop making a fuss.

410
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
I can't even hold drinks now?

411
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,760
Listen, you're pregnant now.

412
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,200
This embryo just implanted.

413
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,160
You need to be careful.

414
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,400
Stop being so careless.

415
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,520
- Got it.
- Right. Just sit down now.

416
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,320
- If you need to do anything, tell us.
- Right.

417
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,320
- Not one move.
- Sit down.

418
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
- Rest.
- Here. Fruit platter.

419
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,720
- Quick.
- Give it to me.

420
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,680
I gathered everyone here today

421
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,600
because I have great news to share.

422
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,120
Come here, Jiayu.

423
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,920
- Come hear the good news.
- Hurry, Jiayu.

424
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,000
Our Maimai

425
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,960
received an acceptance letter
from Jiangbei Academy of Music!

426
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,240
Really?

427
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,920
- That's amazing, Maimai!
- Alright.

428
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,840
Keep it low-key!

429
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,440
Actually, you can basically get in
to that school by paying tuition.

430
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,600
I used the savings from my part-time job.

431
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
Anyway, I, Qiao Maimai,

432
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,400
have finally stepped onto the path
of pursuing my music dream.

433
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,280
Thanks for everyone's support all along.

434
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,120
Enjoy the food and drinks today.

435
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll definitely work my last shift
at Gem Restaurant with full dedication.

436
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,440
- That's wonderful! Go for it, Maimai!
- I absolutely will!

437
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,040
Well done!

438
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,960
Really well done!

439
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,760
Why did you only get here now?

440
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,480
The traffic was insane! I said forget it,

441
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,800
but Mr. Gou insisted on coming.

442
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,440
I came to see
if an acquisition is feasible.

443
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,080
This place is pretty mediocre.

444
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,640
Not many customers,
no distinctive features.

445
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,600
Alright then,

446
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm heading out.

447
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,800
Stop the act.
Didn't you have business with Jinyu?

448
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Did I?

449
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,280
Yeah, you definitely should.

450
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,120
Hurry up!

451
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,640
During this time,

452
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,360
I've done some serious thinking.

453
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,960
I also had my faults.

454
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,920
I, Gou Kai, am not a petty person.

455
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,720
Let's just let bygones…

456
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,400
be bygones.

457
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,320
Come on.

458
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,400
Drink up.

459
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
We're still brothers.

460
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,200
This settles everything.

461
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,240
You're drinking without me?

462
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,800
Come on, man.

463
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
If you're talking acquisition,

464
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,040
you have to negotiate with me.

465
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,920
I hold the operating rights to the shop.

466
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,680
It has no distinctive features.

467
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,440
My place doesn't have
any distinctive features?

468
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
Li Jinyu, our headliner.

469
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
Maimai.

470
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,840
- He's calling you.
- Oh.

471
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,120
Future super star.

472
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,480
- Hello, boss.
- You know what?

473
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,520
In the future, I'm planning
to turn this place into a music diner.

474
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,560
Guests can enjoy meals
while listening to live performances.

475
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
It's called "live house".
You've probably heard of it?

476
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,360
Should it be pronounced as "live house"?

477
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,040
You have a proper Chinese accent.

478
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,080
Not too bad, right?

479
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,120
I might consider investing,

480
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,480
but didn't you deceive me before?

481
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,520
Perform something first.

482
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,280
I'm the boss. Why would I perform?

483
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,840
They're giving you a chance here.

484
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Women understand women best.

485
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,240
This one's actually good.

486
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,160
Sing it!

487
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,880
- Kai, sing a song!
- A song!

488
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,440
- One song!
- One song!

489
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,920
One song!

490
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,520
Sit down properly.

491
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,120
I'll sing…

492
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,920
everyone a love song.

493
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,320
Although this song is…

494
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,640
jarring,

495
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,200
the first time I heard it,

496
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,040
I thought it was the rhythm

497
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,440
making my heart race.

498
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
It was only later that I realized

499
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
it was actually because of her,

500
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,240
the girl next to me at the time.

501
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,120
- Wow.
- Who is she?

502
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,960
Maimai.

503
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,800
Wait, how did he…

504
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,800
This is way too good!

505
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,280
- <i>Rage</i>
- Rage.

506
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,360
<i>Grief</i>

507
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,120
Cheng Kairan, stop singing. Now!

508
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,320
Kai, cut!

509
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,360
<i>Agony</i>

510
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
<i>Despair</i>

511
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Look, Ya'en is stunned.

512
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,640
- Kai, stop!
- Alright!

513
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,680
<i>Rage</i>

514
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,760
Stop, enough!

515
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,440
- No more singing!
- Wasn't it pretty good?

516
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,760
What's wrong?

517
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,440
- Didn't it sound good?
- Alright.

518
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,880
- Get down now!
- Maimai, keep it going.

519
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,320
- I'll keep it going.
- Follow my vibe.

520
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,480
- This feeling of mine.
- Okay.

521
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,280
- Kick it off!
- Maimai's going to sing.

522
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
Let's go! We're going too!

523
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,360
Coming!

524
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,880
- Mine isn't good enough?
- You're not going to sing this too?

525
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,160
You can sing whatever you want. Come on.

526
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,600
Come on. How about you sing instead?

527
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,800
You do it.

528
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,120
You're the lead singer.

529
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,960
You need to guide us through the song.

530
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,920
Can you sing it?

531
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,040
I can't.

532
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,560
My singing, is it alright?

533
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,640
Is your throat sore?

534
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,320
It's okay.

535
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,680
Have an orange.

536
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,720
If you're not busy

537
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,760
the next few days,

538
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,000
let's go for coffee.

539
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,680
Like… an afternoon tea thing.

540
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,960
Which day?

541
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,280
How about…

542
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
tomorrow?

543
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,920
Sounds good.

544
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,960
Come here!

545
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,680
Sit.

546
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,960
Eat more, Ping'an.

547
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm going to be a father.

548
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,280
Honestly, I'm feeling
quite nervous about it.

549
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
We're the same,

550
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,280
both abandoned,

551
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,840
then adopted.

552
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,240
But I hope

553
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,600
he won't have to go through any of that.

554
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,640
I'll work hard

555
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,320
to become a good father.

556
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,040
Give him a wonderful childhood.

557
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,280
You're going to be an uncle now,

558
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,520
so try to be more family-oriented.

559
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,360
If the baby is unhappy,

560
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
you're in charge of tail-wagging.

561
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,040
If he wants to climb high,

562
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
be the cushion.

563
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,080
If she's a girl

564
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,040
who pursues love, like her mom,

565
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,280
you…

566
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,800
Never mind.

567
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,240
I'll handle that myself.

568
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,680
Overall,

569
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,800
I just hope

570
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,040
the baby grows up happily

571
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,320
and healthily.

572
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,520
No wonder it took so long to feed the dog.

573
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,760
It turns out you were confessing
your feelings to the baby.

574
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,520
Not just to the baby,

575
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,640
but to the baby's mother too.

576
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,800
Thanking them

577
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,600
for making me feel less alone.

578
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,360
What is that talk
about pursuing love like her mom?

579
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,840
What do you mean?

580
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,280
I think it's great.

581
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,280
Otherwise, how would I have ended up
with such a beautiful wife? Right?

582
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,800
That level of awareness is acceptable.

583
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,600
But if our child is a girl? That won't do.

584
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,160
Say that again, I dare you.

585
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,640
Come on. Let's go inside and rest.

586
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,440
Aunt Meng!

587
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,720
I bought a gift for the baby.

588
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,960
Been waiting for you! Hurry up!

589
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,160
- Stop bouncing around!
- I'll get it.

590
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,080
Walk slower.

591
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,360
Don't worry, I'm fine.

592
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,800
We're waiting for one more player.

593
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,280
Why am I going straight to the table?

594
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,760
This is making me a bit embarrassed.

595
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,440
Hurry up and come in! My dad's waiting.

596
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,840
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

597
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,000
- The problem is, I don't know how.
- I'll teach you.

598
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,280
- What about playing cards?
- Sure.

599
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,840
It could work.

600
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,440
YE'S HOUSE

601
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,760
- They have cards here.
- Okay.

602
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,440
If you don't know, then learn.

603
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,240
Once you become a father,

604
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,800
you'll need to master

605
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,400
every skill imaginable.

606
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,600
Got it.

607
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,400
Don't think
rolling dumpling skins is simple.

608
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,440
Actually, it's the easiest way
to put in effort without getting credit.

609
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,080
It's just like managing a family.

610
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,080
To maintain family happiness,

611
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,040
you must apply
your energy in the right way.

612
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,920
Once you get the force right,

613
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,160
both the inside
and appearance turn out perfect.

614
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,760
Plus, it gains resilience.

615
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,480
Dad's teaching is spot-on.

616
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,680
The dumpling skins you roll
are especially resilient.

617
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
Even when I overfill them,
they don't leak.

618
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,240
- Listen…
- Uncle Ye,

619
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,520
why don't you take a break
and have some water?

620
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,360
Don't just teach
your son-in-law everything.

621
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,920
- Teach me too.
- This.

622
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,080
Yes. A bit more filling.

623
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,040
A bit more.

624
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,920
Otherwise, it's all skin.

625
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,040
Good.

626
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,040
Pinch the center first.

627
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,480
Right.

628
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,600
Push in from both sides.

629
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,000
Thanks, Dad.

630
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,360
I'll still need you

631
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,520
to teach me all about postpartum meals

632
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,280
and dumplings later on.

633
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,800
You want to learn this too?

634
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,720
Do you know?

635
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,840
There's a whole lot of nuance to it.

636
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,760
You…

637
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,760
should start by learning
to make the dumpling skins.

638
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,800
Come on. Give it a try.

639
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,920
Isn't this favoritism?

640
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,320
Watch and learn.

641
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,000
Bro, I've finished
trimming all the vegetables.

642
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,159
Can I go out and play now?

643
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,040
What play? Go wash some water chestnuts.

644
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,880
Your sister-in-law's favorite filling
is mushroom and water chestnut.

645
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,360
I don't want to hang out with you anymore.
You always making us work.

646
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,520
Had I known,
I wouldn't have come here with you.

647
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,600
Get a move on!

648
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,800
Maimai,

649
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,639
when did you pick up this skill?

650
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,880
Self-taught talent.

651
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,440
The perfect chance to practice.

652
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,480
If her fingers aren't enough,
there are always toes.

653
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,239
Granny, school's starting soon.

654
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,880
I need to earn some pocket money.

655
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,400
Don't worry, my skills are top-notch.

656
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,520
I trust you.

657
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,639
Granny, pick one too. I'll do yours later.

658
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,719
This pink leopard print?

659
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,639
It'll go with your red high heels.
So trendy,

660
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm telling you.

661
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,080
This isn't long enough.

662
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,360
Granny wants them longer,
with that glow-in-the-dark effect.

663
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,600
When I spin them while dancing,

664
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,280
everyone will be so dazzled,

665
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,520
they can't keep their eyes open.

666
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Let's add some fireflies to the nails too.

667
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,520
- Okay, no problem.
- What do you know?

668
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,840
Maimai,

669
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,840
just use this French nude pink

670
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,560
- for Grandma.
- This one?

671
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,680
- Sure.
- It's low-key.

672
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,880
- Not too flashy.
- French?

673
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,120
I need to make sure my great-grandson

674
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,920
feels his great ancestor's

675
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,640
standards for aesthetics

676
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,080
right from the womb.

677
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,480
Meng,

678
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,760
don't forget to read Shakespeare's sonnets

679
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,760
to my great-grandson every night.

680
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,160
Come on. We've already got plans

681
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,840
to become big bosses, right, Meng?

682
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,000
Grandmas,

683
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,080
the baby isn't even
the size of a soybean yet.

684
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Aren't you thinking a bit too far ahead?

685
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,160
No way. Prenatal education

686
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,640
has to start from inside the womb.

687
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,520
Then I'll teach the baby
some authentic Chinese swear words.

688
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,720
Speaking nonsense again.

689
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,840
Three of Bamboo.

690
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,760
I win.

691
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,760
I need that tile to win.

692
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,680
Really?

693
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,360
- I--
- That's double fireworks.

694
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,640
- For real?
- Let me see.

695
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,120
- It really is!
- Who discarded it?

696
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,040
- Are you stupid or what?
- It's Meng, of course.

697
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
Is it the discarder pays all?

698
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,240
- Of course.
- Fine.

699
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,920
Pregnancy brain lasts three years.

700
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,600
So true!

701
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,520
Our Meng wasn't
exactly sharp to begin with.

702
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,120
Now, the baby's
absorbing all her brainpower.

703
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,240
- That's about enough.
- Baby,

704
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,080
even though you'll carry
our Ye family name,

705
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,560
that brain of yours

706
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,920
better take after your father,
not your mother.

707
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,960
A scholar can accept defeat
but not humiliation.

708
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
- Again!
- One more round!

709
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
- One more.
- Meng, listen to Middle Aunt.

710
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,560
If you want your baby to be smart,

711
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,560
you need to start supplementing
during pregnancy.

712
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,480
Luckily, I have the latest batch

713
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,160
of prenatal vitamins
and fish oil right here,

714
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,400
plus DHA for the baby

715
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,720
to boost brain development.

716
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,080
- Alright.
- Sending you the info now.

717
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,480
The results are incredible.

718
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Alright.

719
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Second sis,
you've switched tracks pretty fast.

720
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,280
Selling maternal and baby products now?

721
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,920
Last time you forced
those beauty supplements on me,

722
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
I ended up vomiting and with diarrhea.

723
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,360
- Be careful.
- You getting sick

724
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
was your poor constitution.
What's that have to do with my products?

725
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,160
It's nationally certified.

726
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,880
Besides, the country is now
encouraging second and third children.

727
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,120
I'm just following the trend.

728
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,920
- What would you know about it?
- Yes.

729
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,360
Now I get it.

730
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,520
Why you played mahjong with us today

731
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,320
instead of paying New Year's visits
to that so-called Mr. Wang and Li.

732
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,200
The target clients were here all along.

733
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,160
Will this ever end?

734
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,800
I'm doing what's best for Meng.
What would you know?

735
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,040
Always stirring up trouble.

736
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,480
- I didn't!
- No more aggression.

737
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,680
Honey!

738
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,440
Take a good look
at the maternal and baby products

739
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,640
Middle Aunt sent you!

740
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,000
- Got it!
- Already sent it.

741
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,040
Already sent it!

742
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,960
Look how fast she is.

743
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,600
Dad, I'm going to check on Meng.

744
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Alright, stop being angry.

745
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,520
Honey, how are you holding up? Tired?

746
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,400
Not tired. I'm just getting started.

747
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
- I'm going to win against them properly.
- I'll help you.

748
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,440
So, now you're teaming up,

749
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,640
does that mean
double the loss if you lose later?

750
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,400
- Sure thing.
- Double it is!

751
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,360
That mahjong tile, I can play it too.

752
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,720
Let me take a look for you.

753
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,520
You two, will this ever end?

754
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
You keep bringing in reinforcements.
Whose loss counts? I'm done.

755
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,520
- No…
- Don't! I'll take a look for you!

756
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,480
- I'll help…
- I'll buy Meng…

757
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,760
- I'm done playing.
- Who's playing?

758
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,000
- Who's next?
- Don't!

759
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,720
- Big Aunt plays!
- Sure.

760
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,640
- You play.
- No, Big Aunt plays.

761
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,840
Let me check for you!

762
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,440
X-ray vision!

763
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,960
The moment I arrived, you started winning.

764
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,920
- Big sis, bring me luck.
- How did this happen?

765
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,600
Coming!

766
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,920
- Here. Now it's your turn to open.
- Roll the dice!

767
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,960
Here.

768
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,880
You two.

769
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,320
- It's a Six!
- Six!

770
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,200
- What's he doing?
- Six points for the opposite door.

771
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,280
Slow down.

772
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,720
No need to be so careful.

773
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,480
Come on.

774
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,720
I love days like this.

775
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
Li Jinyu,

776
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,680
I've been holding back
a question for ages.

777
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,440
On that first day we met,

778
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,720
at your doorstep,

779
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,560
when you thought
I was asking for your WeChat,

780
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,080
who were you actually on the phone with?

781
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,960
I… forgot.

782
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,040
Nonsense. You forgot?

783
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,800
With a memory like yours? No way.

784
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,240
Spill the truth.

785
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,200
Actually,

786
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,480
I wasn't on a call at all.

787
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,040
No call?

788
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,080
327-3 XINGYI ROAD

789
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,480
HAILAN PORT PHASE III NOW LEASING

790
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,120
How did this turn into a BBQ stand?

791
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,840
Wasn't this the Nantang Crab Pot before?

792
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,480
Nantang Crab Pot
moved out a long time ago.

793
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,920
Do you know where they moved to?

794
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,120
How should I know?

795
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,080
<i>I noticed you earlier.</i>

796
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,880
<i>I saw you walking toward me,</i>

797
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,480
<i>so I pretended to be</i>
<i>on a call or something.</i>

798
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,960
Li Jinyu.

799
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,000
You know what they say,

800
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,600
"The best hunters often appear as prey."

801
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,560
You’re so good!

802
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,280
What, you regret it now?

803
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
Too late.

804
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,280
No regrets.

805
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,200
Li Jinyu.

806
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,240
The world loves you

807
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,440
as much as I do.

808
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,960
Look at that cloud.

809
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,320
Doesn’t it look like your eyes?

810
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,120
You think my eyes actually look like that?

811
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,240
Yes.

812
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,040
Has anyone ever told you?

813
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,640
You show deep affection in your eyes,
even when staring at a trash can.

814
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,800
No at all.

815
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,240
Actually,

816
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,960
the world I used to see was colorless.

817
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,960
Until you came along,

818
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,800
that's when I learned

819
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,280
I can see and taste this world
with the sweetest flavors.

820
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,640
Like…

821
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,200
sunsets taste like tangerines,

822
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,240
or fireworks smell like watermelons.

823
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,560
Alright!

824
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,840
Any sweeter and I'll get diabetes.

825
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,080
Seriously though,

826
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,840
I see something else in your eyes now.

827
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
What is it?

828
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,240
Your devotion to your family

829
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,960
and…

830
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,280
your passion for life.

831
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,240
And?

832
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
And me.

833
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,680
Who?

834
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,840
Li Jinyu!

835
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,080
I'm here.

836
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,520
THE END

837
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,400
