2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,319
I've done everything you asked.
Where's the surveillance footage?

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,440
Give me the Ocean Blue Bay project,
and I'll delete the surveillance footage.

4
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,160
Don't push your luck.

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,160
No need for harsh words.

6
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,240
As your son, is it wrong
to want to show filial piety

7
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,360
and share your burdens?

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,600
Enough with the obedient act.

9
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,120
You came back this time
just for revenge, didn't you?

10
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,160
True.

11
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,040
You do know me well.

12
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,080
Since you understand me,
why bother holding a grudge?

13
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,520
That project means little to you anyway.

14
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,560
Just agree,

15
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,000
and I'll delete the footage immediately.

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,160
I won't even mention

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,000
Wang Xingsheng's disappearance.
You have my word.

18
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,320
Deal.

19
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,680
But the Wang Xingsheng matter ends here.

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,440
You know how I operate.

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,760
Don't test me.

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,680
Rest assured.

23
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,320
I only want what's rightfully mine.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,560
Unless pushed too far,
I'd prefer to avoid ugly confrontations.

25
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,920
After all, we're still mother and son.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,320
Must keep up the loving family act, right?

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,680
I'll take my leave now, Mrs. Li.
See you tonight.

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,480
Attorney Wang,

29
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,640
put those Ocean Blue Bay messes
on hold for now.

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,560
Someone's offering to cover for us.

31
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,880
Welcome.

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,480
- You'll see her soon.
- Welcome.

33
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
- Hello.
- Everything's inside.

34
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
Airhead!

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
I've missed you so much!
You finally came back.

36
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,760
How could you be so heartless?

37
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,400
All these years without a single visit.

38
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Alright.

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,640
Anyone would think
I'd actually done something to you.

40
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,680
Come on. Let's have a drink.

41
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,040
What are you doing?

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,840
Our brother's back.
How can we not drink to that?

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
Stop throwing around the word "brother".

44
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,080
Did he ever message you all these years?

45
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,280
What are you saying?

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,840
We're the Three Blades of Jiangbei.

47
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,640
You still kept the "Three Blades" here?

48
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,880
I thought you'd replaced me.

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Actually,

50
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,440
we replaced you long ago.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,480
Ye Meng,

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
come over and meet him.

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,320
Let me introduce Ye Meng to you,

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,480
the face of our company.

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,600
Not only stunning

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,760
but also incredibly skilled
professionally. Ye Meng,

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,920
this is airhead, Li Jinyu.
I mentioned him before.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
He's Gou Kai's childhood friend.

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,520
He holds 15% equity in Hanhai Group.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,880
Don't underestimate 15%.
That's seriously impressive.

61
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,160
We've actually met before.

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,920
My apologies for failing

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,080
to recognize Mr. Li's substantial fortune.

64
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,640
Truly blessed by fate. I envy that.

65
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,160
Everyone's here.

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,560
- Mrs. Li.
- Mrs. Li.

67
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,160
- Mrs. Li.
- Our Jinyu has finally

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,640
learned to be considerate. Rare indeed.

69
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,880
He offered to share
my burdens voluntarily.

70
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,400
Now, our family can truly unite as one.

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,280
I've always felt guilty

72
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
sending him abroad so young.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
Back then, I just feared he'd go astray.

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,360
But he exceeded all expectations.
Top grades, obedient, filial.

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,680
As his mother, I'm truly proud.

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,880
And now, with you brothers supporting him,

77
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,200
nothing could make me happier.
Let's toast to that.

78
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,400
Yes. Brothers forever.

79
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,400
Ye Meng.

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,880
- Come on.
- To the success of our project.

81
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Alright. You all chat first.

83
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,080
- I want to greet some people.
- Okay.

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,000
Go easy on the drinks.

85
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,840
Mr. Li is both talented

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,120
and filial, truly remarkable.

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,640
Save the flattery.

88
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,080
But if you're genuinely interested in me,
we can talk over drinks.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,000
Ye Meng can't drink. I'll take her place.

90
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,880
What gives you the right to drink for her?
In what capacity?

91
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
Isn't she already married?

92
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,480
Where did you get that fake news?

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,520
She's my employee.
You think I wouldn't know?

94
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
I'm going to the restroom.

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,320
Gou Kai is really persistent, huh?

96
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,240
Even follows her
to the restroom like a lost puppy.

97
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,480
Didn't you notice? He's into Ye Meng.

98
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
He's actually pursuing her.

99
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,880
Are you upset?

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
Gou Kai, is my anger not obvious enough?

101
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Didn't I tell you I am married?
Could you show some respect?

102
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,400
You keep talking about this marriage.
Why not bring him out?

103
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,640
Just let me see him once.

104
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,800
Ah, aren't you dating someone too?
Where's she from?

105
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,880
Ningsui.

106
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,960
Same place as Ye Meng's husband?

107
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,320
Do you know who her husband is?

108
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,480
Do you have nothing better to do?

109
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,240
Why are you always fixated on my husband?

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,960
Actually, do you have a thing for him?

111
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,320
What are you talking about?
I'm just concerned about you!

112
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,360
- Yes, I know.
- Who's he?

113
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,280
Me!

114
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,360
Fine.

115
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,480
I need to use the restroom.
Is that acceptable, Mr. Gou?

116
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,800
- Yes.
- Thank you.

117
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Where are you going?

118
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
The men's room's here. Acceptable?

119
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
This is ridiculous.

120
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,600
Stop messing around.

121
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,160
What's going on with everyone today?

122
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
What are you doing?

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
- Move!
- Who exactly should I move for?

124
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,560
You pretended not to know me
this morning. What's this now?

125
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
What?

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,040
Afraid Gou Kai might get upset?

127
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,080
Yeah, terrified.

128
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,799
But you're more scared than I am,
aren't you?

129
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,799
The wine here isn't bad.
Want to bring a bottle to your mom,

130
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,920
Mrs. Li?

131
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
It's hard to get a cab here.
Let me drive you back.

132
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,480
No need.

133
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,960
Actually, my lawyer friend dug up
information about Wang Xingsheng.

134
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,480
I'll fill you in on the way.

135
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,560
Let me take Ms. Ye home.

136
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,240
Everyone's been drinking,
and my driver's already here.

137
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
Safety first.

138
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,000
No need.

139
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,880
You're the client.
We couldn't possibly trouble you.

140
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll take Mr. Gou's car.

141
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,360
My driver's been here forever.

142
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,600
Who doesn't have
a driver these days? Let's go.

143
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
Then I'm going with you.

144
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,680
Go alone.

145
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,920
You…

146
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
How are you getting back?

147
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,160
- Why not leave together?
- Sure,

148
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
give me a ride.

149
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,240
Thanks, bro.

150
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
I live pretty far out.

151
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,240
No problem.

152
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,720
Don't take it personally.
Li Jinyu's always been like this.

153
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,960
I heard from Tai Mingxiao

154
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,840
that Li Jinyu's girlfriend
is also from Ningsui.

155
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,440
Do you know each other?

156
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
No.

157
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,040
Good that you don't know him.
Better keep your distance.

158
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
He's been trouble since his overseas days.

159
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,160
Always mixed with delinquents.

160
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,960
Smoking, fighting, drinking, you name it.

161
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,320
Wild and reckless.

162
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,800
Did you see

163
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,040
how he just put on that innocent act
in front of Li Lingbai?

164
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,640
The whole performance
is disgustingly fake.

165
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,160
Mr. Li's overseas life
was certainly eventful.

166
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,920
So interested in him, are you?

167
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,880
Could you stop being so sensitive?

168
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,520
Didn't you want to talk
about Wang Xingsheng?

169
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,840
Tell me who your husband is,
and I'll tell you about Wang Xingsheng.

170
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,920
I'm genuinely puzzled.
What's there to be curious about?

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,320
Just a small-town nobody
with zero redeeming qualities.

172
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,600
Then what's in it for you?

173
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,080
Are you going to talk
about Wang Xingsheng?

174
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,320
If not, I'm getting off.

175
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
Someone's tailing us.

176
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,280
Lose him.

177
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,160
Wang Xingsheng has a fraud record,

178
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,040
specifically
in illegal fundraising charges.

179
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,680
Back in Ningsui,
he acquired a plot of land,

180
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,400
but it quickly went stagnant
due to broken funding chains.

181
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,160
Later, it was acquired by Hanhai Group,
now known as Ocean Blue Bay.

182
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,400
When did the incident occur?

183
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,040
August 2016.

184
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,440
August 2016.

185
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,840
<i>You know how I operate.</i>

186
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,200
Don't test me.

187
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,000
Can't ditch them.

189
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,760
In July 2016,
my mother passed away by suicide.

190
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,680
Wang Xingsheng
was imprisoned shortly after.

191
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,920
Six months later,
Hanhai Group took over the project.

192
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,160
The timing is far too coincidental.

193
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,400
Are you suggesting Auntie's suicide

194
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,400
might be connected
to Wang Xingsheng's fraud case?

195
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,800
Exactly.

196
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,760
Change of plans. Let's head back first.

197
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,280
EXIT, LOWER LEVEL 1

198
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,920
CAUTION: DRIVE SLOW

199
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,560
What?

200
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,240
Afraid Gou Kai would go back
to the hotel with me, so you tailed us?

201
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm here to see my wife.

202
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,400
Don't test me. I'll call the police.

203
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm your husband.
That doesn't count as illegal entry.

204
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,680
Fine.

205
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,360
Let's get a divorce.

206
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,600
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

207
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,040
- What do you mean by that?
- You know what I mean.

208
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,200
I returned to Li Lingbai
to investigate properly,

209
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,920
to give you answers.

210
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,560
You don't understand what she's like.

211
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,520
<i>She's far more dangerous than you imagine,</i>

212
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>and she always plays dirty.</i>

213
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,920
<i>I suspect she's already making moves.</i>

214
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,240
<i>So,</i>

215
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,080
<i>let me handle</i>

216
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,560
<i>the Wang Xingsheng investigation alone.</i>

217
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,440
- I can't risk your safety.
- Listen,

218
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,400
anything related to my mother,
I'll investigate it,

219
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
no matter how dangerous.

220
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Why do you feel like a stranger now?

221
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Li Jinyu.

222
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,800
I'm truly exhausted.

223
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,560
I can't spend another second
guessing which of your words are real.

224
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,840
Just sign the papers.

225
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,040
Ye Meng.

226
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,760
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

227
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,440
<i>He was an eyewitness</i>
<i>to my mom's suicide case.</i>

228
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,360
<i>Yet to this day,</i>
<i>he hasn't confessed anything to me.</i>

230
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,520
<i>I suspect my mom's death</i>
<i>is connected to Li Lingbai.</i>

231
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,560
Oh my God!

232
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
You mean

233
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,920
Li Jinyu is a secret rich heir

234
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,480
and his mom's involved

235
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,120
in your mom's death? Now you two went

236
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,280
from lovers to mortal enemies?

237
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,080
I hadn't realized
how absurd this was until you said it.

238
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,880
The Li Jinyu now
is a complete stranger to me.

239
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,160
I'm starting to wonder
if the version in Ningsui

240
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,800
was actually his twin.

241
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,440
So, what's your plan now?

242
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
When the time comes…

243
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
we'll divorce.

244
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,920
Just so you know,

245
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,920
divorce isn't as simple as you think.

246
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,480
I've been sorting through

247
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,160
years of transfers and expense records
these past few days.

248
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,640
It's utterly overwhelming.

249
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,600
But enough complaining.

250
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,480
Get some sleep now. I need to open
the shop early tomorrow anyway.

251
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,760
- Good night.
- Good night.

252
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,560
YA READY-TO-WEAR, VINTAGE, HANDMADE

253
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,040
- Ya'en!
- Maimai's here!

254
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,200
A friend of mine has a birthday
coming up in a few days.

255
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,360
I'd like to pick out a dress
from your shop as a gift.

256
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,640
- Help me choose one?
- Sure.

257
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,240
How old is your friend?

258
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,600
About my age.

259
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,720
What style does she usually wear?

260
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,040
Something lively and cute.

261
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,240
She loves vibrant colors.

262
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,160
What about pairing it like this?
Does this work?

263
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,360
Yeah, that works.

264
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,360
- Let's go with this.
- Great!

265
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,320
Fine.

266
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,840
How much? I'll WeChat transfer you now.

267
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,200
No need.

268
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,640
Put it on Boss Cheng's tab.

269
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,440
This isn't appropriate.
Kai will scold me later.

270
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,040
What if we just don't tell him?

271
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,640
Alright then.

272
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,160
Sis, you're way too good to me.

273
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,720
Since when are we so formal?

274
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,640
What brings you to my shop today?

275
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,440
Did Boss Cheng finally let you out?

276
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
We've been pretty idle lately.

277
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,680
Kai is swamped.

278
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,320
No time to keep tabs on me.

279
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,760
What's going on with him?

280
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,320
Don't even get me started. I'm furious.

281
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,360
Someone's been targeting our shop lately,

282
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,320
posting tons of malicious reviews online.

283
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,520
It's killing...

284
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,480
our business.

285
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,040
Then, has your boss offended someone?

286
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm not really sure about this.

287
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,280
Ya'en, please don't tell anyone
it came from me!

288
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,360
- I won't say a word.
- Okay.

289
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,400
- I'll go now.
- Fine.

290
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

291
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,120
Bye-bye.

292
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,280

293
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,760
Who could he possibly have offended?

294
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,400

Business…

305
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,840
has been slow lately,
so I'm running promos

Who's the big mouth that told you?

Nobody told me. I've got eyes, you know?

My bar's bad business

313
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,720
has nothing to do with his damn review.

314
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,560
This bastard!

315
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,040
Pouring paint over him
is letting him off easy!

316
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,840
Did you throw paint on him?

317
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,040
Are you okay then?

318
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,640
All good. Settled it
with some compensation.

319
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,400
Just let me deal with this next time.

320
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,080
Seriously, stop worrying.

321
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,800
It will settle down soon.

322
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,120
Kai,

323
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,280
it's better if we
don't see each other anymore.

324
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,680
My feud with Chen Jian
was never your burden to bear.

325
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,280
I am not afraid of getting involved.

326
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,120
But rumors are vicious.

327
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,880
Once they spread,
no amount of explaining will help.

328
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,840
I'm worried…

329
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,880
people might get the wrong idea about us.

330
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,400
I… I'm not afraid of gossip.

331
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,360
The reason I come to see you is because

332
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
I really like Jiayu.

333
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,440

You can't just stop me

335
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,000
from seeing you guys
because of what some people say.

336
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,040
Look, business is already this bad,

337
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,800
and now you won't even let me
go see my best mates.

338
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,840
Whoa there, big guy! Since when
do grown men turn on the waterworks?

339
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,520
Oh my God!

340
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,960
Please don't cry.

342
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Anyway, let's just meet less.

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,200
But we can still text, okay?

344
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,840
No. You stop me from going.

345
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,760
- You stop me from going.
- How am I supposed to handle this?

346
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,360
- I really…
- Ouch!

347
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,720
Maimai, your boss is crying.
Go comfort him, quick.

348

00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,080
How could that be?

357
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,640
But shouldn't you be on your way
to the new project right now?

358
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,560
Why are you back?

359
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,520
How else could I demand
an explanation from Mr. Gou?

360
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,680
Mr. Gou,

361
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,120
you transferred me without a word

362
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,920
and brought Ye Meng back to replace me.

363
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,160
What's the meaning of this?

364
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Didn't you promise
that once Hailan Port launched,

365
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,640
I'd return to your side?

366
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
There's been a minor oversight.

367
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,360
Once you wrap up the new project,
we'll transfer you back.

368
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,160
Still lying to me?

369
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,840
What exactly do you take me for?

370
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,960
Of course, you're a key asset.

371
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,160
If anything I said
caused a misunderstanding,

372
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,920
I apologize.

373
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,320
Between us, it's strictly
a superior-subordinate relationship.

374
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,120
Nothing more.

375
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,360
So, from the very beginning,
you were using me as a pawn.

376
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,880
You wooed me and gave me the project

377
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
just to suppress Ye Meng.

378
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,640
Now that Ye Meng is back,
I've served my purpose.

379
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,280
So, you're kicking me to the curb?

380
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,000
I wooed you?

381
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,440
Isn't it the other way around?

382
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,520
Besides, the project
always belonged to Ye Meng.

383
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,160
I only temporarily assigned you to it.

384
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,600
Now that she's back,
it's only natural to give it to her.

385
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,160
Sound about right?

386
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,960
You're utterly shameless!

387
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,120
Don't you know Ye Meng is already married?

388
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,960
I know.

389
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,800
Listen carefully.

390
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,320
I'm done playing games with you.

391
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,280
It's me firing you now.

392
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,360
You like Ye Meng, don't you?

393
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,040
Then I'll pray to every god
that you never fall out of love.

394
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,120
I'll be waiting to see
how this ends for you.

395
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,760
GOLDEN CIRCLE GROUP

396
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,880
- Thank you.
- Wait a moment, please.

397
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,280
I sincerely apologize
for this abrupt resignation.

398
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,560
I will hand over all pending tasks to you.

399
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,320
Don't blame yourself.

400
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,200
It was abrupt,

401
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,440
but Gou Kai's actions were unprofessional.

402
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,800
I'd resign too in your position.

403
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,600
What's your next step?

404
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,760
Haven't decided yet.

405
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,000
- Here's your coffee.
- Go back home,

406
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
take some time to recover.

407
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,000
Thank you.

408
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,080
Pretty good.

409
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,600
I heard the project lead
for Hailan Port changed.

410
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,080
Will the team be replaced too?

411
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,480
No, don't worry.

412
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,600
It's all in the family.

413
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,080
The new lead
is Mrs. Li's son from Hanhai Group.

414
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,840
He and Gou Kai grew up together.

415
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,720
Mrs. Li's son? How come I remember him
just starting elementary school?

416
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,200
Not Li Zhuofeng. It's Li Jinyu.

417
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,080
Which Li Jinyu?

418
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,320
The name is quite tricky to write.

419
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,440
"Jin" as in leather-axe,
"Yu" as in island.

420
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,040
He was my college roommate.
Used to be in Ningsui too.

421
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,360
You know him?

422
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,120
I don't know him,
but the name rings a bell.

423
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Like you'd actually know him.

424
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,080
Let me ask you something.

425
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,360
You've been in Ningsui so long.

426
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,920
Have you ever seen Ye Meng's husband?

427
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,680
What does he do?

428
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,840
What does he look like? So secretive.

429
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,160
Haven't seen him. I've got things to do.

430
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,480
I'll head out now.
Let's catch up next time.

431
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,160
What?

432
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,360
Where are you off to?

433
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,880
Really?

434
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,000
Who the hell is her husband anyway?

435
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,560
- Mr. Gou.
- Meng.

436
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,280
I'm quite familiar with the business lead
for the Hailan Port project.

437
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,560
Everyone just relax.
No need to be nervous.

438
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,600
Okay.

439
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Li Jinyu?

440
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,480
Everyone's here.

441
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm here to announce from now on,

442
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,840
I'll be taking charge of Hailan Port.

443
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
Since we're all acquainted,

444
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,520
I'll be direct.

445
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,240
I won't be outsourcing PR anymore.

446
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
I've assembled my own team.

447
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,280
As for the project lead…

448
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,640
I'll be taking charge.

449
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,320
Mr. Gou, long time no see.

450
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,920
Mr. Li, our team went through
rigorous corporate evaluation

451
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
before securing this contract.

452
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
You can't just cancel
our cooperation on a whim. Are you joking?

453
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,840
Of course, I'm not joking.

454
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,160
As the lead of Hailan Port,

455
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
I have the authority
to make personnel changes.

456
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,920
Is that so?

457
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,640
The contract explicitly states,

458
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,680
"Party A shall not terminate
the contract at will

459
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,480
unless Party B
commits major errors or negligence."

460
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,920
We've reviewed your newly launched
trial operation proposal

461
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,520
and deemed it unsatisfactory
after evaluation.

462
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,480
Is that reason sufficient for termination?

463
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,840
Of course,

464
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,880
you may refuse cooperation for any reason.

465
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,760
But we reserve the right
to reject that decision.

466
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,240
A contract exists
to legally bind both parties.

467
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,800
If you show such disregard
for contractual integrity,

468
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,120
we will pursue litigation.

469
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,560
Fine.

470
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,840
Do you think you can win this lawsuit?

471
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,400
Winning or losing isn't the point.

472
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,680
Hailan Port is about
to start trial operations.

473
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,480
If we file a lawsuit now,
any negative publicity

474
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,360
could force a delay.

475
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,080
I hear Hanhai Group
prioritizes this project.

476
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,600
Is that the outcome you want?

477
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
The team can stay.

478
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,800
- But the proposal must be revised.
- Mr. Li.

479
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,880
Sure.

480
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,840
Submit the new proposal by next Monday.

481
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,000
If you can't meet this deadline,
don't force yourself. Just go.

482
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,600
Meng, one week…

483
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,400
No problem.

484
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,720
Don't bother with the shops
entering Hailan Port from now on.

485
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,840
I'll hand over all operations
to the new director, Cheng Kairan.

486
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,400
With the opening approaching,
everyone's pressed for time.

487
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,400
No room for back-and-forth trips.

488
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,960
I'll have to ask you to bear
with the temporary arrangements here.

489
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,880
Any objections?

490
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,040
Mr. Gou?

491
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,920
Anything else?
We need to get back to work.

492
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,360
Mr. Li, please stop obstructing
my work from now on.

493
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,720
Don't forget our agreement.

494
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Truly, clothes make the man.

495
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,600
You've hidden it well.

496
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,160
Why did you want to see me?

497
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
Let's talk about Ye Meng.

498
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,960
Seems like nobody knows
you two are married,

499
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,920
not even your best friends,
Gou Kai and Tai Mingxiao.

500
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,920
- Not even your mother.
- Don't think about scheming anything.

501
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,240
Ye Meng and I are already
negotiating the divorce.

502
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
A sudden divorce out of nowhere?

503
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
I just joined the company.

504
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,440
What I need
is a marriage that'll secure my position.

505
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,360
Ye Meng and I aren't compatible.

506
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,360
What an act!

507
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,600
A truly brilliant performance.

508
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,560
Is this fake divorce
really necessary to protect Ye Meng?

509
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,680
I know what she's investigating.

510
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,640
What do you actually want?

511
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,680
I want you to replace Gou Kai's team

512
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,640
and make me the PR lead
for the Hailan Port project.

513
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,720
Otherwise,

514
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,760
who knows how Mrs. Li Lingbai
might react when she finds out

515
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,880
about your marriage?

516
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,000
Mr. Cheng, please come in.

517
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,640
Mr. Li, Mr. Cheng has arrived.

518
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,840
Here.

519
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,080
Please bring me that contract.

520
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,320
Right away, Mr. Li.

521
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,440
Wait, why did you ask me to meet

522
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,320
at Ye Meng's company? Where is she anyway?

523
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,560
She went out for lunch at noon.

524
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,360
What are you doing here?
Why are you sitting in her chair?

525
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,560
This is my company.

526
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,280
A few days without--

527
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,800
Mr. Li, your documents.

528
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,080
Wait, what did you call him?

529
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,120
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li?

530
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,000
Is this an actor?

531
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,880
- You earn…
- Mr. Li,

532
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,880
- What does your friend mean by this?
- It's fine.

533
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,080
Get back to work.

534
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,280
Understood, Mr. Li.

535
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,280
Such strong conviction!
A truly exceptional actor.

536
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,840
- Seriously, brother.
- Alright,

537
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,440
let's review the plan.

538
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,120
I intend to put you in charge of managing

539
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,760
the shops entering Hailan Port
after its launch.

540
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,480
PARTY A: HAILAN PORT

541
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,440
Hailan Port?

542
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,000
Legal Representative, Li Jinyu.

543
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
You guys went all out with these props.

544
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,200
General manager!

545
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,160
MARKET ANALYSIS

546
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,680
HAILAN PORT, LI JINYU, GENERAL MANAGER

547
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,360
It really is you!

548
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,920
Wait, how did you go
to Jiangbei for a few days

549
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,280
and come back
as the general manager of Hailan Port?

550
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,640
The owner of Hanhai Group is my mom.

551
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,120
Then, what's this about

552
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,560
granting me
management rights for the shops?

553
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,040
I was thinking,

554
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,680
since you have experience managing Gem,

555
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,320
you can handle this best.

556
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,480
That reason is too simple.

557
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,440
I don't buy it.

558
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,080
Give it to me straight,
or no amount of money

559
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
will make me help you.

560
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,960
Ye Meng wants a divorce.

561
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,160
Wh… Why?

562
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,440
My mom might be connected
to her mother's suicide case.

563
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,960
I don't want her investigating this.

564
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,240
It's not that I won't help.

565
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,360
But seriously…

566
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,000
Why not just tell Ye Meng about this?

567
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Don't let it ruin your marriage.

568
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,080
I'm afraid that

569
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,400
if my mother finds out
Ye Meng is investigating this case,

570
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,880
she might target her.

571
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,840
You know about
Wang Xingsheng's disappearance, right?

572
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,080
That might be connected to my mother too.

573
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,920
The company is full of her informants.

574
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,120
I need your help to investigate,
but no one can know.

575
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,880
If Fang Ya'en finds out…

576
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,400
I'm helping you instead of Ye Meng…

577
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,840
we're both screwed. Seriously.

578
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,120
We're not the same.

579
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,920
How are we different?

580
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,520
Even at your worst,
you're just standing still.

581
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,760
Way to put it…

582
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Mr. Li.

583
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,560
But seriously,

584
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,760
you really need to figure out
how to make it up to Ye Meng.

585
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,920
This isn't a trivial matter.

586
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,720
As for what you mentioned…

587
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,720
I'll keep it in mind.

588
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm leaving.

589
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,640
Mr. Li.

590
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,280
This granting counts, right?

591
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,120
Of course it counts.

592
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,960
Knew you had it during the interview.

593
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,360
Brothers in heart. Love you, man.

594
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,720
Call me if you need anything.

595
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,000
NINGSUI SEAFOOD

596
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,360
What?

597
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,760
You're saying Li Jinyu's first move
after taking over Hailan Port

598
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,600
was to kick you out and replace you
with his ex, Jiang Luzhi?

599
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,320
Yeah.

600
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,840
I never thought he'd go this far.

601
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,080
That doesn't make sense.

602
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,240
What's his angle?

603
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,120
The weirdest part is Jiang Luzhi.

604
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,680
She never exposed
my relationship with Li Jinyu.

605
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,320
My guess is she and Li Jinyu
cut some kind of deal.

606
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,080
Oh, and Kai too.

607
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,120
Li Jinyu handed Hailan Port's shops
over to him.

608
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,760
Kai?

609
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,320
What the hell is Li Jinyu trying to pull?

610
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,160
He's trying to stop me
from investigating my mom's case.

611
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,200
<i>By the way, can you look into Kai for me?</i>

612
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,840
<i>See what kind of scheme they're running.</i>

613
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,080
Alright. Kai can't hide anything.
Leave it to me.

614
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,880
<i>Let's stay in touch if anything comes up.</i>

615
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,600
- Sure.
- Bye-bye.

616
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,040
Mom, what's wrong with Kai?

617
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,320
He's fine, totally fine!

618
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,680
Go to sleep now!

619
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,880
The food was delicious today.
I feel like I've gained ten pounds.

620
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,560
Then get back to revising the proposal.

621
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,000
Meng, this is the tenth
revised version we've prepared.

622
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,920
- Take a look.
- Hm.

623
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,400
Let us know if there are areas
that need refinement.

624
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,320
‪HAILAN PORT PHASE III NOW LEASING

625
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,480
Ye Meng.

626
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,400
This is my home. Yours is over there.

627
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,400
Wait.

628
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,960
What's up?

629
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,800
<i>Let's go.</i>

630
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,080
- Why not go inside?
- Why not go inside?

631
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,600
Hey, bro. What's up?

632
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,280
Well, it's nothing urgent.

633
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,080
Just wanted to tell you something.

634
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,600
I had a fight with your sister-in-law.

635
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,760
What?

636
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,600
But you absolutely
cannot tell Granny, okay?

637
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,600
And make sure
they don't come to my place tonight.

638
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,800
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.

639
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,240
I won't breathe a word of it.

640
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
Hello, Granny.

641
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,000
My brother and Ye Meng had a fight.

642
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,160
- A huge fight!
- What?

643
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,680
It's true. He just called me crying,
really heartbroken.

644
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,880
- What should we do, Granny?
- I have to go!

645
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,160
Hello.

646
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Why call if nothing's wrong?

647
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,480
Your granddaughter
had a fight with my grandson.

648
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,440
<i>Meng's talking about divorce now.</i>

649
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,400
What? Absolutely not!

650
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,920
- Had a fight?
- Had a fight?

651
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
No way.

652
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,840
How could that be? We're perfectly fine.

653
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,960
I just joined the company,

654
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,320
so I thought I should

655
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,120
exchange ideas and learn from Ms. Ye.

656
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Grandmas, what brings you here?

657
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,040
Brought some chicken soup.

658
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,280
- Let's go in.
- Everyone inside now.

659
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,600
- Open the door, quick!
- Come on.

660
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,680
- Take it slow, Granny.
- Sure.
