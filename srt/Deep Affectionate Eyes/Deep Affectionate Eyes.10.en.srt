- Granny, give me a more "struggle" look.
- Got it!

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
One, two, three.

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,400
- Did I get it?
- Yeah.

6
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,920
Okay.

XUANJIN LIFE SUPERMARKET

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,240
You scared me to death!
How did you get here so fast?

26
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,920
Gotta be fast for a reward.

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
Alright, go ahead to pick.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,280
Buy three, get one free. What a deal.

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,200
"Food and sex are basic human desires."
Why are you shy?

30
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,240
I forgot the eggs. I'll go get some.

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,560
Li Jinyu, what do you mean by that?

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,200
I thought you could live on love

33
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,240
and didn't need your sisters anymore.

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm a carnivore.

35
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,880
Water is not nearly enough for me.

36
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,960
Who's starving you?

37
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,520
Is it my face that's not pretty enough,
or is it my body that's not good enough?

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,360
The mood was perfect.
How could he just stop like that?

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,040
Yeah,

40
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,640
with a body like that, it's a shame
you're wearing a sports bra.

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
It's comfortable.

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400
Come here.

43
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,640
- I refuse.
- Let me share some wisdom with you.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,520
- What are you doing?
- Come here and listen.

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,520
Oi.

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,840
You're practically a married widow,
yet you know all this?

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,080
It's been ages since your last… you know.

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,640
- Look at you.
- None of your business!

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,800
Just do as I say.

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,040
I guarantee Li Jinyu
will turn into a wolf tonight.

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
And I really don't like your outfit today.

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Come here. Let me get you a new one.

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Like you're some fashion icon!

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,840
Why care about my outfit?
I don't have a younger guy to impress.

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,840
You're dressed like
a Scottish theme party yourself,

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
- and you're giving me fashion advice?
- I'm working.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,399
Working? Your loud shirt…

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,640
UNSAFE BUILDING. KEEP OUT.

LINGERIE LIFESTYLE

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
- Check, please.
- Certainly, one moment.

61
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,080
- Your total is 399. Thank you.
- Got it.

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,560
Hello there!

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,880
He is…

64
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,080
This is my agent, Mr. Wang.

65
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,520
- I've paid.
- Sure. Mind your step.

66
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
Let me pack that for you.

67
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,160
How much?

68
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,000
That'll be 299 yuan, please. Thank you.

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
- All ready?
- Yes.

70
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,280
- All secured.
- Tripod's set.

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
I've completed my purchase.
Are you nervous?

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,600
- A little.
- No worries.

73
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,960
Don't be nervous.

74
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
- Easy. Don't worry.
- Let's go.

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,000
- Is it nearby?
- Yeah, right around here.

76
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,040
- Five minutes' walk.
- Okay.

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,080
Hey, I'm sending you my location now.

78
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,120
Get here.

79
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,360
What took you so long?

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
Don't you feel cold dressed so lightly?

81
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,240
It's nothing.

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,000
What do you want?

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,520
I just saw Maimai go in with two guys.

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,760
That agent from before.

85
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,520
They've got cameras, probably shooting.

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,240
You stood here this whole time
just to say that?

87
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,240
Bet she's still chasing
her celebrity dream.

88
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,160
Just ignore her.

89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
I thought you were taking me
to see Uncle Yang again.

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,720
No.

91
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
It is lingerie sets
in those bags they're holding.

92
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,760
Maimai, these are today's
shooting costumes.

93
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
Thanks, bro.

94
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
Wait, bro. I thought
we were shooting a commercial.

95
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,480
Isn't this just an ad shoot?

96
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,440
Bro, I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can shoot this kind of content.

97
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,640
You're just killing time here!

98
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,240
Li,

99
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,280
it's her first time
doing a shoot like this.

100
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,080
She's bound to be a little shy.

101
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,600
Come. Have a seat.

102
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,560
Look, you've already
paid the training fee, right?

103
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,760
You borrowed money
from small loans with high interest.

104
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,360
The rest of the fees…

105
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
The company thinks you have potential.
You've got the qualities.

106
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
So the company covered part of it for you.

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
As for this part, didn't we agree

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,400
you'd work it off by shooting ads?

109
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,680
Isn't that right?

110
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,600
Besides, aren't the streets full of people

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,400
shooting ads and photos now?

112
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,600
Even big celebrities do it!

113
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
If you want to be in this industry,

114
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
you have to have
professional ethics, right?

115
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,360
To put it in lofty terms,

116
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,200
this is about
sacrificing for art, isn't it?

117
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,480
Right?

118
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,480
Maimai,

119
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,120
if you really don't want
to do the shoot, don't worry,

120
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
we would never force you.

121
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,200
But you have to think about

122
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,240
all that money you already paid.

123
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,880
Even taking out those small loans.

124
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,240
That training fee?
Well, that's certainly non-refundable.

125
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,640
You've invested so much.

126
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
You're now just one step away
from your dream.

127
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
Would you really give up so easily?

128
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,080
Brother, are you staying here forever?

129
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,560
Yeah, I'm good here.

130
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,680
What's so good about it?

131
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,200
Stuck in this dead-end town,
you'll never get anywhere.

132
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,480
Not like you.

133
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,280
I'm heading to the big city.

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
The world out there is huge,

135
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,679
and I know I'll find what I'm looking for.

136
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,080
INCOMING CALL FROM BROTHER

137
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,160
Maimai!

138
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,320
This is my business card.

139
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,080
WANG TIANQI

140
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,520
Hello? Who is this?

141
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
Hello. Your delivery is here.

142
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
<i>I didn't order anything.</i>

143
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,840
Wrong number?

144
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,920
<i>No food order here.</i>

145
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,600
Food delivery!

146
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,960
- I didn't order any food.
- Open up!

147
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,080
I didn't order any food.
What's this about?

148
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,080
- Maimai!
- What are you doing?

149
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,000
- What's going on?
- What?

150
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
- What are you doing?
- Get off!

151
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,360
- Let go!
- Are you doing okay?

152
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
<i>I'm heading to the big city.</i>

153
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
The world out there is huge,

154
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,920
and I know I'll find what I'm looking for.

155
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,120
I already checked it for you.
Nothing's different.

156
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,400
That's because
you don't even want to look.

157
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,240
You've been there since birth,
got everything you wanted.

158
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,600
Of course you don't care!

159
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,280
How about we move to a big city together?

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,400
We can look out for each other.

161
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,160
No.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,840
It's fine.

163
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll go there on my own someday.

164
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,680
Maimai,

165
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,560
have some water.

166
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,880
I've already talked to your brother.

167
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,600
Stay at my place tonight, okay?

168
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,560
Don't cry anymore.

169
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,000
Your brother got
all the scammed money back.

170
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,800
Those two got arrested.

171
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,720
He took care of those photos too.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,480
Wanna hear about my Jiangbei days?

173
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,280
Never even told your brother.

174
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,160
God, it's so embarrassing.

175
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,160
Made a bigger mess than you ever did.

176
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,440
My family thinks
I've made it big in Jiangbei.

177
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,800
Truth is, everyone is struggling there.

178
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,200
We are all the same.

179
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,600
Killing yourself day and night

180
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,320
for an apartment.

181
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,520
<i>Working overtime.</i>

182
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,000
<i>Drinking and socializing with clients.</i>

183
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,840
<i>Sometimes even putting up with shit.</i>

184
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,520
<i>But even after all that?</i>

185
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,680
<i>I couldn't quit,</i>

186
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,960
<i>not with that year-end bonus on the line.</i>

187
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,600
<i>Still short on the down payment.</i>

188
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
I really thought
I was close to breaking through.

189
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,200
Then Jiang Luzhi showed up,

190
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
your brother's ex.

191
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,800
She connected with my boss,
waltzed into my company,

192
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,200
and stole my project.

193
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,760
I hit my breaking point and walked out.

194
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,880
So, you just let her get away with it?

195
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,800
I wasn't gonna take that shit.

196
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,200
I torpedoed the company project.

197
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,080
Jiang Luzhi was camped
outside the boss's office, waiting

198
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,680
to see me crash and burn.
Then she slapped me across the face.

199
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
So, I went full on her ass.

200
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
Slapped her back,

201
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,200
yanked off her damn hair extensions,

202
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,160
and kicked her in the shin.
Best revenge ever.

203
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,480
Ye Meng, you're straight-up legendary.

204
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,360
You didn't see me

205
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,640
ugly-sobbing on the way back to Ningsui.

206
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,600
Years of dreams crashed and burned,

207
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,360
years of work down the drain.

208
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,640
Full circle, back to square one.

209
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,200
I was right where you are now.

210
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,240
But look at me today,

211
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,840
still in one piece.
And hey, I even met your brother.

212
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,680
Do you think what I did back then

213
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,920
was pathetically stupid?

214
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,800
Of course not.

215
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
Exactly.

216
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
We wanted to leave this town

217
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,560
for bigger dreams, and we weren't wrong.

218
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,200
The real villains are those

219
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,120
who exploited us with malice.

220
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,800
Maybe today's disaster

221
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,040
isn't even a bad thing.

222
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,880
Maybe the world is just
forcing you to grow up.

223
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,680
Hey,

224
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,960
enough tears for those trash humans, okay?

225
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,720
I'm just mourning for myself.

226
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
You've all been to Jiangbei,

227
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
touched your dreams.

228
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,440
Even if it's gone now,

229
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,720
you can always restart.

230
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,520
But me?

231
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,800
I've never left Ningsui,
not since the day I was born.

232
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,960
This time, I thought

233
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,960
I'd finally step closer.

234
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,960
But look at me now.

235
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,080
How pathetic.

236
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,560
I don't want to rot here like my brother,

237
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,000
but maybe dreams

238
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,839
just aren't for people like me.

239
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Who is it?

240
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
<i>It's me.</i>

241
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
Who?

242
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,720
Finally decided to call me.

243
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,240
I missed you like hell.

244
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,280
Who can make you so excited at midnight?

245
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,080
Airhead.

246
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,760
A traitor's words? Not worth my pulse.

247
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,120
Hey.

248
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,560
Where you at? Wanna hang out?

249
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,040
I'm still in Ningsui.

250
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,400
<i>I wanted to ask.</i>

251
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,600
Do you know any good music schools?

252
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
My cousin's looking to enroll.

253
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,520
No prob. I got this!

254
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,680
So, when are you coming back?

255
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,040
I'm not coming back.

256
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,720
You're not coming back?

257
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,040
Got a girlfriend there or something?

258
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,760
Seriously?

259
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,920
Who is she? Where's she from?

260
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,080
None of your business.

261
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,000
<i>You…</i>

262
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,880
Hello!

263
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,760
The airhead actually got a girlfriend.

264
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,800
Who the hell left the AC on all night?

265
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
Is the company's money not real money?

266
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,720
What a waste.

267
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,160
Keep up the act.

268
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,680
Such a tightwad!

269
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,360
OCEAN BLUE BAY PHASE III NOW LEASING

270
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,240
How is she?

271
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,280
She's doing much better now,

272
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,800
and she told me to tell you
not to worry about her.

273
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,400
Thank you for your help today.

274
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,360
So, how are you gonna thank me?

275
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
How would you like me to thank you?

276
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,280
What are you doing?

277
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,440
Morse code. Focus.

278
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Fine.

279
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,280
"May I constructively
criticize my visionary leader?"

280
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,280
Yeah, your boss does sound
sketchy as hell. I'm hearing you.

281
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,800
Who's talking about the boss?

282
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
I'm talking about us! Us!

283
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,040
- It's about us?
- Yeah.

284
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,560
Well then, I'll have to guess.

285
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,080
W. I…

286
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,960
bought a new bag.

287
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,440
A bag? It's a bra!

288
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,040
Weren't you raised abroad?
Shouldn't you know this?

289
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,040
I figured it out this afternoon.

290
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,760
I was going to wait. I'm not in a hurry.

291
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,040
I was afraid you'd just take off
after having your fun.

292
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,280
Did you…

293
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,400
get everything you need ready?

294
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,840
When did you prepare it?

295
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,560
After that time when we hit the brakes.

296
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,480
I really thought you were above all that.

297
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,480
My bad for giving you the wrong idea.

298
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,080
Wait. Hold on!

299
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,320
Just wait a second!

300
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,160
Oh no!

301
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,240
What's wrong with you?

302
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,280
Have some brown sugar water.

303
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,080
Thank you.

304
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,120
Here. Warm your stomach.

305
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,080
Why do you have this?

306
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,400
Qiao Maimai bought it.

307
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,360
She doesn't get along with her family,

308
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,920
so she sometimes crashes here.

309
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,360
Crashing here? Then where does she
actually live? With you?

310
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,280
What are you thinking?

311
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,920
Of course she shares the room with Granny.

312
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,960
Here.

313
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,240
If she lives with Granny, then why
is this thing in your possession?

314
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,560
She's always tossing things around.
Had to rescue this one wave item.

315
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,360
For real?

316
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
Cross my heart!

317
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Would I lie to you?

318
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,080
Maybe I should just
toss all this stuff out later.

319
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,400
No way! Keep them for me.

320
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,760
Does it still hurt?

321
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,320
My feet are cold.

322
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,120
How are you feeling now? Any better?

323
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,840
Negative. Persistent pain.

324
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,400
What should we do?

325
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,160
I'll look it up for you.

326
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,080
What's wrong?

327
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,840
Don't bother looking.

328
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,640
It hurts me.

329
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
It just hurts.

330
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,520
Why is it always one step short?

331
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Either we're missing this
or that comes up.

332
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,400
It's nothing!

333
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,800
We have our whole lives ahead of us.
What's the rush?

334
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
But I want it now!

335
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,360
You owe me compensation.

336
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,480
What do you have in mind?

337
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,520
Kiss me.

338
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
Better now?

339
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,960
Sixty percent there.

340
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,760
Hey, why so absent-minded?

341
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,360
Cheer up!

342
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,360
Go on. Sweep

343
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
the trash on the floor

344
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,040
and clear the melon seed shells

345
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,160
off the table. The guests
will be here any minute.

346
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,680
Why are you here?

347
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,640
Maimai, why are you hiding? Get up!

348
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,760
Come out!

349
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
But I have to work.

350
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,920
Come here.

351
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,720
Hey, young man, give me a hand.

352
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,360
Granny Tou.

353
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,080
- Granny can stand up now.
- Yes, right.

354
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,520
It's a medical miracle.

355
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,840
Stand firm.

356
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,800
Take this.

357
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,080
Granny.

358
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,160
Silly girl, what's wrong with you?

359
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,280
Wanting to be a star

360
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
is perfectly respectable, right?

361
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,240
This card…

362
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,520
Consider it your grandma's investment.
I'll be the investor.

363
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
What you need now

364
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,440
is a professional teacher…

365
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,960
What do you call it?
To teach you vocal singing.

366
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,480
Come here.

367
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,320
The money on this card isn't enough.

368
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
Granny sold the house

369
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,960
to invest in you.

370
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,120
- No, Granny.
- Listen carefully.

371
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,760
I'd sell the wok and the stove.
I will always be behind you.

372
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,200
Maimai,

373
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,440
your brother found a music
training institution for you in Jiangbei.

374
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,720
Once everything's settled,
you can go register.

375
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,800
- Thank your brother.
- Bro.

376
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,720
You've always wanted
to play my guitar, right?

377
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,560
Take it with you when we go back.
Practice hard.

378
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,040
Don't embarrass me when you're at school.

379
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,480
- Really?
- Um…

380
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,040
Granny, I'm sorry.

381
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,000
I know I was wrong.

382
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,360
Look at you. Why are you crying?
Don't be such a crybaby.

383
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,520
- Stop it now.
- Don't even mention right or wrong.

384
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,200
Didn't you say you wanted to be a singer?

385
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,760
If you keep crying like this,
you'll ruin your voice sooner or later.

386
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,960
Right.

387
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,440
I've decided.

388
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,040
I will never give up on my dreams.

389
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,960
But for now,
I won't rush to make them happen.

390
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,280
I need to take it step by step

391
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
and achieve one small goal at a time.

392
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,480
Right.

393
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,760
What "small goal"?

394
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,520
I want to establish myself
on the Gem stage

395
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,760
and replace the top performer, Li Jinyu.

396
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,920
And here I thought
it was something serious.

397
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,080
That's on me.

398
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,080
Tonight, we'll hold
a solo show just for you.

399
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,960
Do you mean it?

400
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,720
You mean it?

401
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,800
Thank you.

402
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,240
- Granny.
- Go for it!

403
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,680
Go for it!

404
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,680
Step right up. Don't miss out!

405
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,920
- Welcome!
- Qiao Maimai's solo show!

406
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,800
- Bring one friend, get a free beer!
- Come inside!

407
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,360
Bring two, get a pair!

408
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,280
Come inside!

409
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,880
Welcome!

410
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,080
She's not a waitress.
She's a singer at Gem.

411
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,920
Post the photos on social media, please!

412
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
Our Qiao Maimai has big dreams.

413
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,800
She's gonna tour
the whole country one day.

414
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,080
So, as her friends and family,

415
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,600
we hope everyone
will support her all the way.

416
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,840
- Let's give every dream a stage to shine!
- Exactly!

417
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,880
It's not easy to hold
onto a dream these days, right?

418
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,440
- Thanks!
- We're locals. Gotta back our own!

419
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,560
Thank you!

420
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,960
- I'm gonna go call in some favors.
- Alright. Thanks.

421
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,000
Step right up…

422
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
- Thank you!
- Buy one, get one free!

423
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,080
Welcome!

424
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,480
Why are you looking at me?

425
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,200
There's no way
I'm drinking any alcohol today.

426
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,320
No. I meant to ask.

427
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,600
Why hasn't Jiayu come?

428
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,520
Hey, you there, come over here!

429
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,400
Dude, it's a bar.

430
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,240
It's not like he can just walk in
if he feels like it.

431
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,760
Should've turned this
into a restaurant back then.

432
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,480
Right. Change it now. Hurry up!

433
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,600
- Welcome!
- Change it!

434
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,840
Welcome, everyone! Support Qiao Maimai!

435
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,240
Right this way.

436
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,160
Step right up. Don't miss out!

437
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
- The brightest star in Ningsui,
- Come inside!

438
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,840
Qiao Maimai, with her solo show tonight!

439
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,600
Doesn't it feel like watching the most
promising kid from the whole village

440
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,880
finally debut?

441
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,480
- You're pretty good with metaphors.
- Grab whatever you like.

442
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,640
- Welcome!
- So?

443
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,560
Earlier, you said you didn't fit in here.

444
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,600
How about now?
Feeling part of the crowd yet?

445
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,960
Come on. Grab a beer! Beer here!

446
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,680
- Not only do I not hate it anymore,
- Get yourself a bottle too.

447
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,320
I actually kinda love it here.

448
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,120
Welcome!

449
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,560
Haven't felt this way in a long time.

450
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
Come get your beer!

451
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,520
- Heartfelt warmth.
- Go ahead. Take one!

452
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,440
- Here, beer for you.
- Okay.

453
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,640
Come on in.

454
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,040
Hey, you over there, come here!

455
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,320
- Keep the music playing! Keep dancing!
- Hey, young man, come over here!

456
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,120
Qiao Maimai!

457
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,360
QIAO MAIMAI CONCERT
FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS!

458
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,880
Where should I sit?

459
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,160
Right here is fine.

460
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,800
- Thank you.
- Take it slow.

461
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,680
- Be careful.
- Hello.

462
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,080
Look at all these people.

463
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
Maimai is definitely a hit now.

464
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,280
You've gotta be part of the hype squad.
We need to keep the energy high.

465
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,200
- Don't worry. I've got this!
- I have all the camera angles set up!

466
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,120
Let's get this party hyped!

467
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,120
- Can I drink this?
- Everyone, put in some energy.

468
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,480
- Yes, but just a little.
- Raise your hands high.

469
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,800
- It's free!
- Sway to the rhythm of the music.

470
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,520
Little Aunt, what brings you here?

471
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Aren't they cool?

472
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,760
- This is actually really cool.
- Did it just for this.

473
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,040
- Granny!
- Hello!

474
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,040
- This is my Little Aunt.
- Right. I'm her Little Aunt.

475
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,720
Hello.

476
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,360
MAIMAI GO FOR IT

477
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,480
- Maimai!
- Maimai!

478
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,200
- Get loud!
- Maimai! Qiao Maimai!

479
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,160
- Qiao Maimai!
- Maimai!

480
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,280
Maimai!

481
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Go for it!

482
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,720
Maimai, soar fearlessly!

483
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,960
Your tide of supporters will never cease!

484
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,880
Where did you even get that line?

485
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,840
I made it up for her. It's a fan chant.

486
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,360
- Go, Maimai!
- Maimai!

487
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,560
- Maimai!
- Yeah!

488
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,680
First of all, thank you all
for coming to my performance tonight.

489
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,600
Next, I'd like to sing a song

490
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,960
about love for everyone. Thank you!

491
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,560
Maimai!

492
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,960
Looks pretty awesome to me. So cool!

493
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,360
Maimai!

494
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,960
Maimai!

495
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,320
Maimai!

496
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,200
Wow!

497
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
GO, MAIMAI

498
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,680
<i>Rage</i>

499
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,880
<i>Sorrow</i>

500
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,120
<i>Stripped away his sunlight</i>

501
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,880
<i>Pain</i>

502
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,560
<i>Despair</i>

503
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,240
<i>Yet love remained his faith</i>

504
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,800
So loud!

505
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
What did you say? I can't hear you.

506
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
What is it? So loud.

507
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,080
What performance is that?

508
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,840
Stop making Maimai uncomfortable. Get
hyped and do your job as the vibe squad.

509
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,960
Start cheering now! Maimai!

510
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,320
Maimai is so awesome!

511
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,880
Oh my gosh!

512
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Too loud.

513
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,960
Is this Maimai's usual level?

514
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,600
We originally planned
to send her to music school,

515
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,240
but now it seems unnecessary.

516
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,880
I can't stand the performance.

517
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,680
Let's leave.

518
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,840
- We should go.
- Let's leave.

519
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,440
Terrible song.

520
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,920
Maimai!

521
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,080
Don't go, everyone!

522
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,880
Please stay!

523
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,320
This is amazing!

524
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,920
Wait. You call this good?

525
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,000
- Terrible song.
- Maimai!

526
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,240
She should just stop.

527
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,080
Let's leave.

528
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,640
She should never be a singer.

529
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,040
Maimai!

530
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,400
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

531
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,240
- Sorry about that.
- Come back again.

532
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,200
- Sorry about that.
- Maimai is really something.

533
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,960
- She is new. Sorry.
- She is way off key.

534
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,880
And they debuted with this?

535
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,680
- Sounds awful. Never heard anything worse.
- Yes.

536
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,720
She is just new.

537
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,520
- Granny.
- What are you talking about?

538
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,840
You don't get it, do you?

539
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,639
Shut your mouth.
That's called rock and roll.

540
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,920
- Don't be angry, Granny.
- Show some respect with your words!

541
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,560
- Sorry about that.
- No hard feelings, bro.

542
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,600
- Don't stop me. I haven't finished yet!
- Next time,

543
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,000
- I'll be the one singing.
- They weren't exactly wrong though.

544
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,760
Don't be angry, Granny.

545
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,560
Maimai.

546
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,120
Your singing… was okay.

547
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,080
As for school,
we'll talk about that later.

548
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,639
Give the card back to Granny for now.

549
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,920
I'll keep it safe for you.

550
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,120
Let's go.

551
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,480
- Let's go.
- Come back with Granny.

552
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,600
Don't catch a cold out here.

553
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,159
Don't forget to give me the card later!

554
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,239
I'm heading out too.

555
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,520
It's fine, Maimai. You're good.

556
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,040
Maimai, you're amazing! So rock and roll!

557
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,600
I gotta take a photo with you.

558
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,520
Come on!

559
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,360
Boss, you've got great taste.

560
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,960
Next time there's a show,
you gotta call me.

561
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,080
Absolutely!

562
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,840
I'm sorry.

563
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,760
So tired.

564
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,160
Let the world burn.

565
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,200
Maimai is really happy today,

566
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,440
and Granny is happy too.

567
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,880
Ye Meng, thank you.

568
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
- Were you happy today?
- Of course.

569
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,040
I haven't been this happy
in such a long time.

570
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,760
Me too.

571
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,360
GRANNY TOU'S POST: MAIMAI IS THE BEST

572
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,080
MAIMAI'S POST

573
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,840
YE MENG'S POST
THE WORLD MAY MEAN NO HARM TO YOU

574
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,400
What are you up to?

575
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,960
Morning, my boyfriend!

576
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,200
- It's such a nice day. What are you up to?
- Nothing special.

577
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,440
If you're free,
could you take a photo for me?

578
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,560
Sure.

579
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,840
Walk faster.

580
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,000
Coming.

581
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,360
So lifeless this early in the morning?

582
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,400
Take a photo for me.

583
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Come on.

584
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,400
No.You gotta help me
take that kind of photo.

585
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,800
You know, the really casual vibe.

586
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,600
Just snap it while I'm walking.

587
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,200
- Okay?
- Sure, no problem.

588
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,560
One, two, three.

589
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,680
One, two, three.

590
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,520
Done.

591
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,600
- Get your hand off!
- What's wrong?

592
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Look at this photo you took!

593
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,080
Is this how you see me?

594
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,000
My head looks huge,
and my body looks tiny!

595
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,120
I think it's pretty good.

596
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,760
"Good"?

597
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,040
Let me show you how it's done properly.

598
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,320
Look.

599
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,600
See?

600
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,320
Do you feel the love in this shot?

601
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,480
Can you sense the vibe? Notice the angle?

602
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
You're a guy. You're tall.

603
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,200
I'm a girl. I'm a bit…

604
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,000
shorter. So, when you take photos,

605
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,120
you need to crouch down a little
and tilt your phone upward slightly.

606
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,840
That's how my legs look longer.

607
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,800
This is an essential skill
for boyfriends on trips.

608
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,200
You're not single anymore, you know!

609
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,280
Seems that doctor
is pretty impressive after all.

610
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,560
What doctor?

611
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,080
That Dr. Gao or whatever?

612
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,440
Didn't he take the photo for you?

613
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,040
Dr. Gao.

614
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,040
Sometimes I really feel bad for Dr. Gao.

615
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,400
Not only did he get rejected,

616
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,200
but you also use him as a punching bag

617
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,360
to vent your jealousy.

618
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
What does that mean?

619
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,880
Ye Meng!

620
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,880
Let me walk you out.

621
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,640
No need. I can get back on my own.

622
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,960
I know

623
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,680
you don't like me right now,

624
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,360
but I believe

625
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,040
feelings between people can change.

626
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,080
Do I still have a chance?

627
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,120
Dr. Gao,

628
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,120
thank you for liking me,

629
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,800
but I already
have feelings for someone else.

630
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,120
So, you already rejected him
that day because of me?

631
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,000
Stop smiling.
I can see you're trying to hide it.

632
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,280
You're that pleased, huh?

633
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,680
Who's smiling? I wasn't smiling at all.

634
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,680
Acting all innocent but so calculating!

635
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
- Who are you talking about?
- You!

636
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,720
But honestly,

637
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,360
don't you think
this yard looks too bare right now?

638
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Let me show you a garden
I saved in my wishlist in Jiangbei.

639
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,600
Look, isn't it beautiful?

640
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,960
Gardener Li!

641
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,040
Since I'm not really good at gardening,

642
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,400
this yard at home
will have to be your domain.

643
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,720
Gardener Li feels this one
is not that great. Hard to pull off.

644
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,040
I'm begging you.
You're the only all-rounder in our family.

645
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
I genuinely think
you excel at everything you do.

646
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,520
If this yard is in your hands,
I know it'll become absolutely beautiful.

647
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,720
Hold on.

648
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,040
I'll do it,

649
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,720
but don't you think
you should compensate me a little?

650
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,320
- Seriously, PDA this early?
- What are you two up to?

651
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,720
What? Let me see!

652
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,840
I didn't do anything!

653
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,720
What brings you here?

654
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,400
I invited everyone.

655
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,000
Today's weather is perfect.
I want the whole village

656
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,600
to hear our happy news.

657
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,600
Do you have a grill at your place?

658
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,800
