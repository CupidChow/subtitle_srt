2
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Come in.

3
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,480
Hold on. Let me turn on the lights.

4
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,520
Yes, turn them on.

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,760
Get inside.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,840
Juhua, give me a hand.

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,000
Coming. I'll help.

8
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
What's all this?

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,600
I told the grandmas
I found a new job at Hailan Port.

10
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,680
Didn't say my exact position.

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,400
And I figured you wouldn't want them
to know we've been fighting.

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,760
Food's here.

13
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,080
Soup's ready.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,280
- Quick, quick.
- Right.

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,400
Quick, sit down.

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,800
Go on, both of you, sit.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
Come on.

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,000
Hurry up.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,960
Come on.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
You, sit down.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,440
Meng, sit here.

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,240
Sit.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,880
Here.

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
Meng.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,240
Have some soup.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Meng,
you've lost weight these last few days.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,120
Just gone to Jiangbei for work
and look at you, pale as paper.

28
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm fine.

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,840
That's makeup.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,480
She's always been fair.

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
Here, Jinyu, have some soup.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
Drink this.

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,800
Thanks, Granny.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,560
Your big aunt
made this especially for you.

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,400
It's nourishing.

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,920
- Drink up.
- Yes, drink up.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,160
- Grandmas.
- Sure.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,160
I already ate too much at dinner.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
I can't finish this now.

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,480
I still have some work,
but once I'm done, I'll drink it all.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,200
Work at this hour?
It's after office hours.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,880
What kind of terrible boss

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,800
makes you work overtime after dark?

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,320
Tell me. What's more important?

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,440
Your health or your job?

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,480
- Family comes first.
- Exactly, family first.

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,200
Next time,

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,560
- I'll give your boss a good talking-to.
- Do it.

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,400
- Fire him if you have to.
- Fire him.

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,280
- Granny's right.
- Exactly.

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,720
Some people do need to be taught a lesson.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,600
What a lousy boss. Drink up.

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,080
Drink, Meng.

54
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
Drink it.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,960
There. Good.

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,000
- Refill her bowl.
- No, really, that's enough.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,200
Do you ladies have other things to do?

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
Maybe get some rest.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,560
Of course we do.

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
- Yes.
- Mahjong.

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
Yes, we're playing mahjong.

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,800
You drink.

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Get the table out.

64
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
- Come.
- Quick.

65
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,760
- Over there.
- Come on.

66
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
Bring it here.

67
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,160
Careful.

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
More soup?

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,720
No, thanks.

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,560
Should we just go in?

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,480
Wait a bit longer.

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,400
Okay.

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,920
What exactly did Grandma Ye tell you?

74
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,280
She said to wait for her instructions.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,120
Instructions? What instructions?

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,320
She didn't say.

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,320
- Maybe she'll call.
- Well…

78
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,640
Did she say when?

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,680
No. I don't know anything.

80
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,320
Useless.

81
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,040
Maybe we should sneak in and listen.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
You go.

83
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,120
You go.

84
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,519
I don't dare. What if we get caught?

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
- Then hug me. It's freezing.
- Fine, hug.

86
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,080
I'm the dealer.

87
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
Three.

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,120
- Your turn.
- It's your turn.

89
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,520
Grandma, I really need to work.

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
We've already played eight rounds.

91
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
Can we stop now?

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,880
Two more.

93
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,640
- Yes, two more.
- Just two.

94
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,600
And since everyone's here tonight,
let's talk about the wedding.

95
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,640
- Yes, let's do it.
- Right.

96
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,800
Right.

97
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,600
You're both working

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
- at Hailan Port now.
- Yes.

99
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,080
- That makes things easier.
- Exactly.

100
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,560
So, what about the house?

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
We're not in a rush for that.

102
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
How can you not be in a rush,

103
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,360
Meng?

104
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,560
Don't worry.

105
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,600
Badou's dowry is safe with me.

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,640
If it comes to it, I'll sell the garden.

107
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,120
- Exactly.
- That's right.

108
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,600
No point waiting.

109
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,880
We'll go look at houses tomorrow.

110
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,280
First thing in the morning.

111
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,000
Grandmas, I'm really tired.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,640
I'd like to rest early.
You should too, okay?

113
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,480
Fine, fine. I'll call your middle aunt

114
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,760
- and Maimai.
- Yes, call them.

115
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,880
I'll do it now.

116
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,240
They live far. Don't bother them.

117
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,760
- It's fine.
- It's fine.

118
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,080
- Mom.
- Grandma.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,480
Next time, call me earlier.

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
I had a pile of things to do.

121
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

122
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,680
Didn't you call me over

123
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,240
to play mahjong?

124
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
She hadn't called yet.

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,440
Just passing by.

126
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,640
- Passing by.
- What a coincidence.

127
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,680
- Exactly.
- I just happened to be nearby too.

128
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,600
Fate, right?

129
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,000
Enough standing around.

130
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,120
Come on. Sit down.

131
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,440
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

132
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
- You have fun. We're going to our room.
- Off you go.

133
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,680
Go sleep.

134
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,920
Sleep with your wife.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,480
- Okay, go.
- Hold her tight.

136
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,920
You idiot.

137
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
No sense at all.

138
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,000
You nearly gave us away.

139
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
It's freezing out there.
We almost caught a cold.

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,200
Serves you right.

141
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,520
That's not important.

142
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
What matters

143
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,560
is that we settle the wedding tonight.

144
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,880
We'll play mahjong till dawn
if that's what it takes.

145
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,360
- Yes.
- Let's do this.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,880
Honey,

147
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,520
maybe skip working
on the proposal tonight.

148
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,760
You're exhausted. Get some rest.

149
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
Are you going to help?

150
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,960
You're so eager to push me out.

151
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,680
Li Jinyu.

152
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,200
You and the grandmas really think
this little act will work?

153
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,560
I didn't bring them here.

154
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,400
- It's them--
- I'm being serious.

155
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
They've just seen how hard
you've been working.

156
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,640
They came to check in,

157
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,320
- bring you some soup.
- Save it.

158
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,120
No, honey, I swear it wasn't me.

159
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,520
But yeah, it was.

160
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,480
Meilan, hurry and play.

161
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
Nine Bamboo.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,960
I can't keep my eyes open.

163
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,880
Maimai,

164
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,840
find me some heart pills. Hurry.

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,600
Grandma, I can't either.

166
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
Middle Aunt, you go.

167
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,240
Bring me a coffee.

168
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,240
Pung!

169
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Three Bamboo.

170
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,679
- Three Bamboo?
- Yes.

171
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,600
My turn?

172
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,840
Four Character… Don't want it.

173
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,760
What? Discard.

174
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
No, I'll dry it myself.

175
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,280
Let me.

176
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,600
Careful. You almost hit your head.

177
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,080
What are you doing?

178
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm tired. Going to sleep.

179
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,600
Then sleep properly.

180
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
Move your hand.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,880
Li Jinyu!

182
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,560
Not moving.

183
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,360
Since when did you start being shameless?

184
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,800
Since right now.

185
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,840
You're impossible.

186
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,840
THE RISING SUN ILLUMINATES

187
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,280
Ye Meng.

188
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,240
Ye--

189
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,200
Ms. Ye, someone's posted
about formaldehyde

190
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,880
under the promo video.

191
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,760
It's getting pushed to the top.

192
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,760
Mr. Li, the revisions are ready.

193
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,080
If there are no issues, please sign off.

194
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,000
LUSH GREEN LIVING

195
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,160
- I just reviewed it.
- Mr. Li.

196
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,280
Some of the data still isn't clear.

197
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,560
I'll fix it and bring it back.

198
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
One moment.

199
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,720
Mr. Li,

200
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,920
- I have something to report.
- Go ahead.

201
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,800
HAILAN PORT

202
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,000
For Phase Three,

203
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,520
I'll use the data from the first
two phases to refine our strategy

204
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,280
and build a model
we can duplicate for future campaigns.

205
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,760
Take a look.

206
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,080
THE FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS
ARE THROUGH THE ROOF!

207
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,040
We have a problem.
Check out our Weibo page.

208
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,880
HOW DARE THEY CALL THIS HEALTHY LIVING?

209
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,880
Formaldehyde over the limit?
What's going on?

210
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,920
Your team's in charge.

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,040
You owe us an explanation.

212
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,320
Our Weibo page
is flooded with posts about this.

213
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,400
If it keeps spreading,
the first thing people will think of

214
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,240
when they hear Hailan Port
is formaldehyde.

215
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
That would be a disaster.

216
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,600
And since your team
manages all the accounts,

217
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,120
if this blows up,
the blame falls squarely on you.

218
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,920
Mr. Li, you said you wanted results
that looked good without overspending.

219
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,720
Then take a look at my plan.

220
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,120
TESTING REPORT

221
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,160
Ningsui Environmental Bureau
just reposted our video.

222
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,960
They publicly confirmed everything.

223
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,960
I saw that negative comment
the day I took over this account.

224
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,960
Ms. Ye,
someone's posted about formaldehyde

225
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,760
under the promo video.

226
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,080
It's getting pushed to the top.

227
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,520
Keep an eye on it.

228
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,680
- If it gets worse, alert me right away.
- Got it.

229
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,360
If someone wants
to stir things up, we'll flip it

230
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,080
and make it work for us.

231
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,400
TESTING REPORT

232
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,520
The narrative's already shifting.

233
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,240
Yeah.

234
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
The backlash is fading fast.

235
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
With an official endorsement behind us,

236
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,160
the negative buzz will die down,
and we've gained

237
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,520
more visibility in the process.

238
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Mr. Li, this is my cost-cutting,
results-driven approach.

239
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,680
It saves half the budget you set.

240
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,560
Looks like this seat
really does belong to me.

241
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,720
A bet's a bet.

242
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,040
Mrs. Ye,
you're even sharper than I imagined.

243
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,080
Thanks.

244
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,520
Problem solved.

245
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,240
Impressive.

246
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
Did you check that IP address?

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,120
Yeah. Sending it now.

248
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,400
SAFETY FIRST

249
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,000
Zhou Yu.

250
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
Take a look.

251
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,680
You know what to do. Don't forget.

252
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,520
This is definitely the IP address

253
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,840
that posted the comment.

254
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,760
Is that Jiang Luzhi?

255
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,680
Ye Meng's here too.

256
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,960
Tail Jiang Luzhi. I'll follow Ye Meng.

257
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,520
Got it.

258
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,400
Why are you following me?

259
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,520
I…

260
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,760
Calm down.

261
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
It's fake?

262
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,800
Are you hurt?

263
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,800
Drop the act.

264
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
He works for you, right?

265
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,280
- What?
- Jiang Luzhi was behind it.

266
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
You only brought her in
to push me out.

267
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,280
You're overthinking.

268
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
I just thought with the way things are

269
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,520
- between us now--
- Quit the excuses.

270
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
If you're that afraid
of anyone finding out,

271
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,440
sign the divorce papers.

272
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,040
Never. Don't even dream about it.

273
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,120
- Ye Meng…
- Let go.

274
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,400
Let go, Li Jinyu!

275
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,720
Li Jinyu!

276
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
What the hell are you doing? Let her go!

277
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,760
Let go!

278
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,440
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

279
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,000
Ye Meng's part of my team.

280
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
You're just the client.
You don't get to boss us.

281
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,360
This is between us. None of your business.

282
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
There's nothing between us.

283
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,000
Ye Meng.

284
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,040
- Ms. Wang.
- Luzhi.

285
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,080
Long time no see. What brings you here?

286
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,480
- Visiting my mom.
- Good.

287
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,400
Drop by the school sometime.

288
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,520
Take care.

289
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,560
Whoa.

290
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,920
What are you doing here?

291
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,480
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

292
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,040
What are you doing here?

293
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,360
This is Jiang Luzhi's house.

294
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,960
What?

295
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
- Luzhi who?
- Don't play dumb.

296
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,680
You're not here to tip off
your little buddy, are you?

297
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,640
No, no. I was just walking past
and thought of him.

298
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,760
Have you been tailing me?

299
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,440
Didn't you say the other day
we should cut down on contact?

300
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,000
Exactly.

301
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
And I didn't contact you.

302
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,880
I just happened to pass by
and ran into you.

303
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,120
I was saying hello.

304
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,360
Since when is that stalking?

305
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,240
Right…

306
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,400
Well, you've said hello. I'll get going.

307
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,400
Hold on.

308
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,880
Why do you look so guilty?

309
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,120
Guilty?

310
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Me? Not at all.

311
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,960
You look exactly like a man
with something to hide.

312
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,920
Tell me the truth.

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,040
Li Jinyu still can't let go
of his ex, can he?

314
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,640
And you've been helping him sneak around.

315
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,440
What… What are you even talking about?

316
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,720
I'll call Ye Meng right now.

317
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,880
No, no, wait! Don't.

318
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,520
I just… I noticed

319
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
Jiang Luzhi switched jobs.

320
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,920
I thought she was up to something,
so I came to check it out.

321
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,920
That's your excuse?
Let's see if Ye Meng buys it.

322
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Please, don't call her.

323
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,680
Can you stop dragging
Ye Meng into everything?

324
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,320
I'm just following orders, okay?

325
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,960
Don't make this harder for me.

326
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,560
Cheng Kairan, answer me.

327
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,120
Whose side are you on,
mine and Ye Meng's or Li Jinyu's?

328
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,880
I… Of course, I'm on your side.

329
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
But don't you remember…

330
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,040
this alley?

331
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,000
Stop trying to change the subject.

332
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,680
Listen.

333
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,800
Whatever Li Jinyu does,

334
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,160
you tell me immediately. No hiding it.

335
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,920
So, wait… Am I supposed
to contact you or not?

336
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,240
Well, on this,

337
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,040
yes, you should absolutely contact me.

338
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
And you'd better not delay.

339
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,160
I'm leaving.

340
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,040
Ya'en!

341
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,960
You don't remember this alley?

342
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

343
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,880
I'm home already.
Why are you still following me?

344
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,560
What's going on between you and Li Jinyu?

345
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,400
I told you. Strictly business.
Client and contractor.

346
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,360
Wait.

347
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,280
I've known him for years.

348
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,000
His face is always stone cold.

349
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,640
Never seen him look at someone like that.

350
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,200
You're hiding something, aren't you?

351
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,920
What you saw was tension.

352
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,440
A hostile client-vendor relationship.

353
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

354
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,280
- Nothing to talk about. Go home.
- Hold on.

355
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,200
327-4 XINGYI ROAD

356
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Uh…

357
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,920
It's still early.
I've never been to your place before.

358
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
- Can I come in?
- Not happening.

359
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,280
Cousin-in-law!

360
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,040
Maimai.

361
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,160
Here to feed the dog?

362
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,840
What dog?

363
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,120
- And this is…
- My boss.

364
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,160
Nice to meet you, boss.

365
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm Qiao Maimai,

366
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,880
her cousin-in-law.

367
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,200
My cousin is her husband.

368
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,960
What's up?

369
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,960
Oh, right.

370
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,200
My cousin's at Gem tonight.
Want to come with me?

371
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Gem?

372
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,720
The bar in town.

373
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,880
I've got things to do. You go ahead.

374
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,680
Alright. Call me when you're free.

375
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,000
Bye!

376
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,000
Why are you still standing here? Go.

377
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,160
Just let me come in for a bit.

378
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,800
Did you not hear her?

379
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,600
My husband runs a bar.
He's deep in that life.

380
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,920
Still want to come in?

381
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,120
Ye Meng.

382
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
What now?

383
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
You've really let me down.

384
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
How did you become like this?

385
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,040
What is wrong with him?

386
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,320
GEM MUSIC BAR
MUSIC BAR FESTIVAL, SPRING WAVE IGNITES

387
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,080
In a bit…

388
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,560
Li Jinyu

389
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,080
is coming to see me.

390
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,040
I swear I didn't

391
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,640
mean

392
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,960
to contact

393
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,080
you.

394
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,000
Oops.

395
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,600
Don't look at me like that.

396
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,040
You're creeping me out.

397
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,680
Uh, that photo… I already sent it.

398
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,560
See for yourself.

399
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,320
After Jiang Luzhi met with that guy,

400
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,640
she went back to her parents'.

401
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,240
No surprises.

402
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,160
Nothing unusual.

403
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
- Relax.
- You got spotted, didn't you?

404
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,280
No way.

405
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,680
I'm great at staying invisible.

406
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,920
But if you're worried,

407
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,920
I'll tail her again tomorrow morning.

408
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,600
Li Jinyu, have you lost your mind?

409
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

410
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,040
When I was shadowing Jiang Luzhi,

411
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,200
I ran into Fang Ya'en.

412
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,000
And I'm pretty sure

413
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,560
Ye Meng sent her to keep tabs on me.

414
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,960
Please, don't put me
in the middle of this.

415
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,600
It's tearing me apart.

416
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,240
And this knife…

417
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,000
It's a toy?

418
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,640
Take this!

419
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
Nearly gave me a heart attack.

420
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,120
Ye Meng was attacked by the guy

421
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,320
who met with Jiang Luzhi.

422
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,960
He had this on him.

423
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,440
And Ye Meng? Is she okay?

424
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
She's fine.

425
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,800
The attacker was Zhou Yu,

426
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,320
an intern brought in

427
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,080
for the Hailan Port project.

428
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,440
I think he's also tied

429
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,480
to that negative comment.

430
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,360
I've had someone

431
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,960
pull his HR file.

432
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,960
Look into his background for me.

433
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,400
Jinyu.

434
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,800
What are you doing here?

435
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,200
Talking business with him.

436
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,600
Mr. Gou!

437
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,800
And you are…

438
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,360
Let me give myself
a proper introduction. Cheng Kairan,

439
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,720
owner of this bar.

440
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,440
So, you run this bar.

441
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
Pleasure to finally meet you.

442
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,160
I've heard plenty about you.

443
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,560
Always wanted to see for myself.

444
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,560
See what exactly?

445
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,880
Your charm.

446
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,920
Specifically, what makes
Ye Meng choose you.

447
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,960
I wanted to know
what's so special about you

448
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,200
that she'd marry you so willingly.

449
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,240
Charm's obvious,

450
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,880
isn't it?

451
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,680
But marriage…

452
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
- That's…
- Kai.

453
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,200
You and Ye Meng grew up together.

454
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,200
Nobody on the outside

455
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,240
can really understand what you two share.

456
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,000
And Gou Kai,

457
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,360
always jealous,

458
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,920
always after someone else's girl.

459
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
If she doesn't like you,

460
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,000
it is your problem.

461
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,960
Yeah, maybe ask yourself why.

462
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,080
Ye Meng's standards have always been high.

463
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,920
Average guys don't even register.

464
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,600
She's not into your type,

465
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,200
all appearance and no depth.
She likes men like me,

466
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,120
real businessmen.

467
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,280
No offense.

468
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,680
Mr. Cheng, right?

469
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,920
Yeah.

470
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,160
I'll get straight to the point.

471
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,640
You and Ye Meng are not a match.

472
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,320
And word is you two are already divorcing.

473
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,760
So, let's make a deal.

474
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,960
Even the divorce news is out.

475
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,120
That hurts, man.

476
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,520
Alright…

477
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,000
Five million.

478
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,520
Wire me five million

479
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,040
and I'll walk away

480
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,400
from Ye Meng forever.

481
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,880
How much?

482
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,000
Five million.

483
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,400
You really dare ask that?

484
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,640
Yeah. Isn't that how it works in dramas?

485
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,000
You hand me a blank check,
I write in the number?

486
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,040
But if you don't have that kind of money,
stop pretending you're loaded.

487
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,920
Since this is our first meeting,

488
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,720
I'll give you a discount.

489
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,640
Two hundred and fifty.

490
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
Two hundred and fifty what?

491
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,240
Two hundred and fifty yuan.

492
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,440
Come on, Mr. Gou. With all your money,

493
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,920
you can't even put down that much?

494
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,920
That's not true love.

495
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,200
Jinyu, what's that supposed to mean?
Whose side are you on?

496
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,400
On the side of true love.

497
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,000
Fine.

498
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,080
- I'll transfer it.
- Wait, you're serious?

499
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,200
I was joking.

500
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,320
Do I look like I'm joking?

501
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Do I look like I need your pocket change?

502
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,320
True love is priceless.

503
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,920
Good.

504
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,640
Then I'll show you

505
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,880
just how much love is really worth.

506
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,040
Hailan Port's going smoothly.

507
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,960
Nice work.

508
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,680
Come to Ningsui for a team retreat.

509
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,720
Guy's out of his mind.

510
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,360
He really thinks
Ye Meng and I are a thing?

511
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,280
What if he actually hands me five million?

512
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,600
You're out of your mind.

513
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,360
Ye Meng is worth more than money.

514
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,400
Says the guy who once
couldn't scrape together 500

515
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,720
and now acts all high and mighty.

516
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,720
You're a textbook case
of a nouveau riche mentality.

517
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,640
Pathetic.

518
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,280
How long are you planning
to keep this marriage under wraps?

519
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,080
Until the Hailan Port project
is wrapped up

520
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,240
and Li Lingbai's people leave Ningsui.

521
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,200
You owe me five million.

522
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,280
But hey, if you don't pay, that's fine.

523
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,240
We're buddies, right?

524
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,200
You bought those
smear accounts, didn't you?

525
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
You think work

526
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,240
is just some game where you get
to scheme against Ye Meng?

527
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,280
So, she ran crying to you?

528
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,640
I'm only doing what I want.

529
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,480
How I do it is none of your business.

530
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,520
I agreed to a deal with you.

531
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,120
That didn't mean you could gamble
with the company's reputation.

532
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,120
If I catch you pulling stunts

533
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,320
like this again, especially

534
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,240
if they hurt Ye Meng,

535
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,640
our deal is done.

536
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,000
Airhead.

537
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,040
Why's she still here?

538
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,200
None of your concern.

539
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
What are you doing here?

540
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,080
Company retreat.
Dropped in to check on you.

541
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,160
And guess what?

542
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,280
Ye Meng and her small-town husband

543
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
are finally splitting.

544
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,600
Who told you that?

545
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,960
Gou Kai.

546
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,880
Why else would he

547
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,280
suddenly throw a retreat

548
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,200
and ask me to set up
a love confession scene?

549
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,560
Love confession?

550
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,200
- Where?
- Aurora Racetrack.

551
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,760
You should come.

552
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,240
He's footing the bill anyway.

553
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,200
Only problem is,

554
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,000
I have no idea
how to set up a confession stage.

555
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,800
Still here this late?

556
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
Shouldn't you be at home
playing the rich wife?

557
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,200
Why act like a wage mule here?

558
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,920
Or did that hidden marriage of yours

559
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,480
blow up in your face?

560
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,120
If I'm stuck working overtime,

561
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,400
isn't it because of you?

562
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,240
No clue what you're talking about.

563
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,440
Check your WeChat.

564
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,920
That blurry back shot?
Even my mom couldn't tell it's me.

565
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,160
This is your idea of framing me?

566
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,840
Framing you?

567
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,320
If I wanted to,

568
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,880
the second Zhou pulled a knife on me,

569
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,080
I'd have handed this to the cops.

570
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,200
Would've been cleaner.

571
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,920
Zhou Yu attacked you?

572
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Impossible.

573
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,640
I only said his last name was Zhou.

574
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,440
Never said it was Zhou Yu.

575
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,280
You set me up.

576
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,920
He really did come after me.

577
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,680
But let's be honest.

578
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,920
With your nerve,

579
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,240
the most you'd dare
is hiring him to spam bad reviews.

580
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,360
You'd never risk more.

581
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,480
What are you doing?

582
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,720
Giving you one chance to apologize.

583
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,000
Come on. Drink.

584
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,240
I really can't drink anymore.

585
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,640
Alright, fine. I'll drink.

586
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,440
I'm sorry. Is that enough?

587
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,880
You've baffled me since we were kids.

588
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,520
In third grade, you were
already ratting me out.

589
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,639
When you get nervous,
you pinch your fingers the same way.

590
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,600
Never changed.

591
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,000
You really do know me.

592
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,520
And you know me just as well.

593
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,639
You think I wanted this?

594
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,000
Growing up, your grades
were worse than mine,

595
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,920
but you never cared.

596
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,280
Teachers and classmates praised me,

597
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,440
but you didn't bat an eye.

598
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,199
But with that face of yours,

599
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,880
you lived louder than anyone.

600
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,760
If I really didn't care,

601
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
would I have quit

602
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,440
Gou Kai's company just to save face?

603
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,320
You really envy my face?

604
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,600
Truth is, I envy you more.

605
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,800
At least you've got the brains for it.

606
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,480
But tell me, Jiang Luzhi,

607
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,760
don't you have your own life?

608
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,680
Why do you spend every day watching mine?

609
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,080
Be honest. It's not Gou Kai
you're obsessed with.

610
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,520
It's me, isn't it?

611
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,880
You're out of your mind.

612
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,200
Though I'll admit,

613
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,280
the reason I joined Gou Kai's company

614
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,280
was because I thought you liked him.

615
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,720
I wanted to get under your skin.

616
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,480
Exactly.

617
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
I'm the one you've been obsessed with.

618
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,480
You just won't admit it.

619
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,880
Who would've thought…

620
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,200
the joke's on me.

621
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
So?

622
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,080
You awake now?

623
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,880
I still remember

624
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,320
when you came back for graduation
and gave that speech.

625
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,360
You stood on that stage, shining,
talking about your dreams.

626
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,120
You said you'd study harder than anyone,

627
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,160
make it to the big city,

628
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,800
to be somebody,

629
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,600
to know yourself,

630
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,840
to love yourself,
and to surpass yourself.

631
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,440
That cringe speech?

632
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
I forgot it years ago.

633
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,400
Can't believe you still remember.

634
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Jiang Luzhi,

635
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,280
you should start living for yourself.

636
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,960
Maybe. But I still hate you.

637
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,240
Right back at you.

638
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,520
I'm leaving.

639
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,600
A headhunter's been calling.

640
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,720
The offer's way better
than what I get at Hailan Port.

641
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,880
At least I won't be stuck
working for you and your husband.

642
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,160
And for the record…

643
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,200
The only reason Li Jinyu let me stay

644
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,920
was because
I threatened to expose your marriage.

645
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,120
He wanted to protect you.

646
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,840
But tell him not to worry.

647
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,360
Even if I quit now,

648
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,880
I'll still hold up my end of the deal.

649
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,240
I won't blow your cover.

650
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,680
Ye Meng.

651
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,360
I hope you're happy.

652
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,680
Today's all about freedom.

653
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,600
If you want food and drinks, come with me.

654
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,600
If you want to lie down and chill,
head over there.

655
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,520
And hey, Gou Kai's picking up the bill.

656
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
- Nice!
- Let's go!

657
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,520
Let's go!

658
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,320
This is one of the projects
our company's about to launch.

659
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,120
Let me take you for a lap.

660
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,840
I'll pass.

661
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,800
You're going to be in charge

662
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,920
of the racetrack proposal.

663
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,480
At least get a sense of the place.

664
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,760
What are you doing here?

665
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,280
Tai Mingxiao asked me to come.

666
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,280
Haven't raced in a long time.

667
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,920
Want to try me?

668
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,200
When's the last time you raced?

669
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,240
Your skills must be rusty.

670
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,720
Afraid you'll lose?

671
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,960
Get in.

672
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,960
Wait.

673
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,160
About the proposal…

674
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,160
I've got a few ideas

675
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,800
I want to discuss with Mrs. Ye.

676
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,840
Why don't we talk them over in my car?

677
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,280
Li Jinyu, what exactly are you playing at?

678
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,280
And what's with the matching outfit?

679
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,920
You did that on purpose?

680
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,120
Mr. Gou, you're the contractor.

681
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,880
I'm sure you don't mind.

682
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,440
CARVOLUTION MOTOR

683
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,960
Ye Meng, watch yourself.

684
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,080
About my mother's death…

685
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,320
You were the witness, weren't you?

686
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,920
