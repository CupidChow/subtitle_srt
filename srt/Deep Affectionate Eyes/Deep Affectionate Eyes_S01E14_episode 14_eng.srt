1
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:11,882
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:15,496
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:17,281
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,810
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,962
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:31,210
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,698
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:38,162
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:42,794
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:49,066
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:53,802
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:55,882
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,882 --> 00:01:01,066
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,082
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:06,050
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,946
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:11,274
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,329
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,306
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:20,321
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:30,560
 

22
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:41,172
We found the couple who got you into trouble.
Should we teach them a lesson?

23
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:45,120
What's with all the "teach lessons" talk?

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,208
We're living in a society governed by law.
Didn't you learn anything?

25
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,600
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:02,048
S-Sir. T-They...

27
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,892
Greetings, Mr. Qian.

28
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:09,632
Day drinking already?

29
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:16,892
Put it away. He hits people with liquor bottles.

30
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:23,968
Don't be nervous. We're here to apologize.

31
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:31,392
Apologize? Come on. There's no need for that.

32
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:35,328
If anything, I should be thanking you both.

33
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:41,856
If you hadn't sent me to jail, I wouldn't have
received my legal enlightenment.

34
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:47,012
Then I might've gone down a much darker path.

35
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:51,092
You two are my saviors.

36
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,296
You're flattering us.
We genuinely came to apologize.

37
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:58,512
It was a misunderstanding.
We never expected things to escalate.

38
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:04,312
I got this premium Lao Ban Zhang tea
through a friend. Would you try it?

39
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:09,248
We also came to discuss
some business opportunities.

40
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:17,092
Business opportunities? Have a seat.

41
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:24,608
As you can see, I'm only running this tea house.

42
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:30,432
Besides, we're not exactly close.
How are we going to do business together?

43
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,732
Don't get us wrong. My wife is deeply interested
in that thumb ring of yours.

44
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:39,872
Don't even think about it. It's not for sale.

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,408
We're not asking to buy it.
We just need the seller's information.

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,304
Confidentiality is key in my line of work.

47
00:03:54,304 --> 00:04:01,152
I forgot. Sir, can you help us? I appreciate it.

48
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:08,864
You think I'm the type to sell out for money?

49
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:12,432
I-I really can't accept this.

50
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:18,784
Sorry, I forgot the rest. Will you think it over?

51
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:29,332
Well, I don't know that guy very well.

52
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:33,152
We just met a few times.

53
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:39,472
His name is Wang Xing... Wang Xing Sheng.

54
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:41,552
- Do you have a photo?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:44,576
Yeah, I do. Wait a second.

56
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:52,192
Wang Xing Sheng. That's him.

57
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:13,664
A friend introduced him to me.

58
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:18,932
I don't know where he is now.
Let me make some calls.

59
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,772
That would be great.

60
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:29,184
Mr. Zhang. Hi, this is Fat Buddha.
I need to ask you something.

61
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:34,252
That Wang Xing Sheng
who sold me the thumb ring. Any idea where he is?

62
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:39,936
You lost contact after he was put in jail?
Why was he in jail?

63
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:45,152
No idea? Okay. Alright, bye.

64
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:51,552
Mr. Ma. Hi, this is Fat Buddha.
I need some information.

65
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:56,212
That Wang Xing Sheng who sold me
the thumb ring. Where is he now?

66
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:59,252
I want to move some goods through him.

67
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:05,120
Yinhe Hotel? Got it. Thanks.

68
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,240
Yinhe Hotel.

69
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,132
- He's at the Yinhe Hotel?
- Yeah.

70
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:10,432
- Thanks.
- No problem.

71
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:12,672
Won't you stay for tea?

72
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:26,816
Mr. Wang, someone was looking for you.
I told them where you are.

73
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:31,012
Yeah, they're on their way now.

74
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,432
No idea. I don't know what they want. Alright.

75
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,824
This should be the Yinhe Hotel.

76
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:51,792
Yeah, but there's another inn
called Yinhe Hotel nearby.

77
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:52,864
"He" as in "lotus".

78
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,912
Check that one. I'll look around here.

79
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:57,272
- Got it.
- Keep in touch.

80
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,048
- Hello.
- Hello.

81
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:04,000
Could you tell me Wang Xing Sheng's room number?

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,496
We're not allowed to disclose guest information.

83
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:09,252
I'm his colleague, here to deliver a contract.

84
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:12,352
- Please register first.
- Thanks.

85
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:19,132
- Here.
- Let me check for you.

86
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,720
Sir, can you go faster?

87
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,768
Okay, I'll try.

88
00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:48,592
Done paying.

89
00:08:57,672 --> 00:08:59,488
Wang Xing Sheng.

90
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:24,932
I sent you a location pin. Come here.
I found Wang Xing Sheng.

91
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:48,552
Ming Xiao, I'm sending you a location pin.
Can you come help?

92
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,312
Okay. Thanks.

93
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:01,920
Wang, long time no see. Why did you ask me out?

94
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,792
I just wanted to meet my friend.
You've been avoiding me since my release.

95
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,968
Can't I finally catch up with my old friend?

96
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:20,032
Right, didn't your husband and that woman
from Ningsui get into trouble here?

97
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:25,872
You called me here for this?

98
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,992
- We settled this, didn't we?
- Did we?

99
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:38,972
You pushed me to acquire the land in Ningsui
and promised to back me up.

100
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,472
That's why I raised all those funds.

101
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:46,792
But the moment I went down,

102
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:52,096
you pulled that trick and took my project
as if you had it all planned.

103
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:59,968
Now the Hailan Bay project is expanding,
and you're raking it in.

104
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:04,892
Was that pittance you gave me fair?

105
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,680
You took the money. We had a deal.

106
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,568
I changed my mind.

107
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:17,472
What about the rules?

108
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:20,592
You approached me because I was a rule-breaker.

109
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:31,592
After all I've done for you these years,

110
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:37,600
aren't you afraid I have dirt on you?

111
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,472
Excuse me.

112
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,920
Over here.

113
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,216
Why are we here? Where's Gou Kai?

114
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,322
What about him?

115
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,840
Isn't this his club?

116
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,792
This is Gou Kai's club?

117
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,736
He co-runs it with a naïve friend of mine.

118
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,672
- Do you know the passcode?
- Yeah.

119
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:40,480
Hurry.

120
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,972
Where is he?

121
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:02,400
Why's the rush? What's wrong?

122
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,472
- I saw Wang Xing Sheng.
- Wang Xing Sheng?

123
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,648
- Here?
- Yeah.

124
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:11,592
How'd he know the code?
No one's been here for ages. Why did he come?

125
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:16,392
No idea, but I saw a car leaving.
Maybe he was in that car.

126
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:20,704
- There's surveillance. Let's check the footage.
- Okay.

127
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:29,672
Why is the computer off?

128
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,592
Let me see.

129
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,972
The connections are working.

130
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:00,432
So what happened?

131
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:06,880
The casing is warm. Someone tampered with it.

132
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:08,864
Did you see anyone else?

133
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:13,272
I've been at the entrance this whole time.
Only one car left.

134
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:17,272
- There's a back exit. Let's take a look.
- Okay.

135
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:46,304
Sorry for the trouble. We lost something,
and the surveillance system crashed.

136
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,960
- It's okay. Take a look.
- Thank you.

137
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,336
I-Isn't this my naïve friend?

138
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:09,172
Your friend?

139
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:12,052
Did he delete the surveillance footage?

140
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:24,172
We took this photo during college.
He's pretty handsome, huh?

141
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:33,408
They seemed close. Why did they fall out?

142
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:38,632
Because of the World Memory Championship.

143
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:44,736
They worked on it for several semesters.

144
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:50,112
But Li Jin Yu withdrew the day
before the competition, and they lost.

145
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:52,704
He got harshly criticized.

146
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:59,592
Then they fell out.
Li Jin Yu left and never came back.

147
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,264
Why did he leave Jiangbei?

148
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:05,088
No idea.

149
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:08,672
Gou Kai and I suspect it's because of his mom.

150
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:11,808
Though she's Hanhai Group's chairwoman,

151
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:14,016
she never treated him as her son.

152
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,016
 

153
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:32,096
Wait. Excuse me.

154
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:39,328
Is this Li Ling Bai?

155
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:50,368
She was the one who just drove out.

156
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:58,112
Why did she come here?
To see her son or Wang Xing Sheng?

157
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:02,672
If she came to see Jin Yu,
why did they leave separately?

158
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:06,792
If she came to see Wang Xing Sheng,
then Hanhai Group was involved.

159
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,892
And why was Jin Yu here?

160
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:14,272
This is so messy. I'll call him.

161
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:24,352
He's not answering.

162
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:53,152
How much money do you want this time?

163
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:57,232
You're so crude.

164
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:02,496
Why did you come to bother me
instead of staying in Ningsui?

165
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:06,232
I'm here for the drama.

166
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,728
What drama?

167
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:13,712
You should know better.

168
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:17,088
You haven't driven a car in years, Ms. Li.

169
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:22,560
You must be meeting someone important
to drive in person today.

170
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:31,072
Same old passive-aggressive tone.

171
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:36,960
Don't be mean. I was just showing concern.

172
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,972
But aren't you nostalgic, staying in touch
with friends from eight or nine years ago?

173
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:45,012
That's not like you.

174
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:51,012
What are you implying?

175
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:57,664
Remember that suicide case
at Jiumenling years ago?

176
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:01,832
 I drove by that day
and saw two people arguing in a car. 

177
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:04,512
 But I couldn't see the man's face. 

178
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:10,212
Later, I heard a woman
committed suicide at Jiumenling.

179
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:15,172
I told the police what I saw,
including the car's license plate.

180
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:21,024
But the next day, you confronted me in rage.

181
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:27,772
 How dare you testify in this mental state?
Take some responsibility. 

182
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:32,932
 I'm certain of the license plate I saw. 

183
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:38,052
 Yeah, that plate belonged to
my business partner Wang Xing Sheng. 

184
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,152
 But we were discussing business
on Chenghuai Road at that time. 

185
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:44,332
 How could he be at Jiumenling? 

186
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:46,132
 No way. 

187
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:49,408
 I saw it clearly. 

188
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:52,864
 Those pills have messed with your memory. 

189
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:58,752
 Isn't it enough to get your father killed?
Now, you want to ruin my business? 

190
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:01,172
 Do you even care about this family? 

191
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:08,592
 I truly thought I had memory issues 

192
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:11,392
 and went to the police that same day. 

193
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:19,328
But they'd already closed it as suicide.

194
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:21,672
So I didn't dwell on it.

195
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:25,392
But seeing you two together today,

196
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:32,800
I suddenly recall
many suspicious details from back then.

197
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:39,712
On the 15th, when it happened, you returned
from a business trip in the afternoon.

198
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:46,880
Chenghuai Road was closed due to heavy rain.

199
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,064
How did you meet your partner there?

200
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:06,944
Well...

201
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,776
Investigate all you want.
It's got nothing to do with me.

202
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:14,472
Don't rush off, Ms. Li.

203
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:19,552
The show's not over yet.

204
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:42,552
 Aren't you afraid I have dirt on you? 

205
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:49,052
 If things blow up, wouldn't I make
an excellent tainted witness? 

206
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:54,832
 I'll spill every detail of your dirty job. 

207
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:56,892
 You know the consequences. 

208
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:03,592
 We didn't need to reach this point. 

209
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:07,040
 You know me best and what I want. 

210
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:14,912
 Give me what I want,
and I'll leave you alone forever. 

211
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:22,812
 I know you're decent enough not to shortchange me. 

212
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:41,772
What if I give this to...

213
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:48,832
The police? Go ahead.

214
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:58,632
Who said anything about the police?
What if I give it to the board or media...

215
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:01,932
Right after Wang Xing Sheng was put in jail,

216
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:04,972
you took over the Hailan Bay project.

217
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:09,372
Years later, he came out penniless.

218
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:14,252
Desperate, he came to you for money.
Then he vanished.

219
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:19,552
How would that look? Wouldn't people dig deeper?

220
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:24,432
Do you think you can withstand scrutiny?

221
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:36,448
Li Jin Yu, what do you want?

222
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:45,012
 Mr. Li, Wang Xing Sheng's car
disappeared at the Hanhai Group. 

223
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:49,472
 This case is beyond us.
Hanhai Group is too powerful. 

224
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:52,592
 Someone has to investigate from within. 

225
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,352
I thought you'd bring me
to Hanhai's GM office to discuss this.

226
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:31,632
To withdraw such a large sum
requires proper procedures.

227
00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:35,092
Stay here for a few days.

228
00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:49,152
You're toying with me?

229
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,728
You got me wrong. It's a huge amount.
I don't have that cash on hand.

230
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:16,852
Fine. One more day.

231
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:33,352
What's going on?

232
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,592
You're breaking the rules,

233
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,632
so I'm playing along.

234
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:49,344
Let me warn you. If you lock me up,
the evidence will get out there.

235
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:51,168
Think carefully.

236
00:25:54,372 --> 00:25:58,240
Well, well. Get some rest.

237
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,132
Take care of him.

238
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:04,672
- You're crossing the line. Don't touch me.
- Sit.

239
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,312
- Don't touch me. I'll sit.
- Sit.

240
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,172
Have you had dinner?

241
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:33,292
How could I have any appetite?

242
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:37,344
I've been calling you all afternoon.
Why didn't you answer?

243
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:40,092
My phone died.

244
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:51,232
I went around Yinhe Hotel today,
but didn't find anything.

245
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:54,132
You? Did you see Wang Xing Sheng?

246
00:26:56,576 --> 00:27:01,972
No, I followed him to a club, then he disappeared.

247
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:13,132
But there was a back exit.
He probably escaped through there.

248
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:28,480
But I found something
particularly interesting there.

249
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,092
I saw a photo of you and Gou Kai.

250
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:35,812
Did you know each other?

251
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:45,012
I've known him since childhood.
Tai Ming Xiao was my college roommate.

252
00:27:45,012 --> 00:27:47,432
Why have I never heard about this?

253
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:56,632
I thought we'd never cross paths again.
So it didn't seem worth mentioning.

254
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:01,352
I see.

255
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:06,892
Sorry. I didn't mean to hide it from you.

256
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:20,800
I didn't go to Yinhe Hotel today.

257
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,512
I met with Li Ling Bai.

258
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:38,720
So your relationship with your mom
isn't that terrible.

259
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:43,936
Makes sense. You're family, after all.

260
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:50,632
- Actually, I--
- I booked a flight back to Ningsui.

261
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:55,680
- What about Wang Xing Sheng?
- Forget it. It's a waste of time.

262
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:47,552
Should I get your clothes to my place?

263
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:54,496
I mean, since we're legally married,
will you move in with me?

264
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:58,232
No need. Give it to me.

265
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:03,852
- Meng, you're back.
- You're back.

266
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:10,512
Ba Dou, hurry up. Grandma made a feast for you.

267
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:12,392
Meng, come on.

268
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:17,472
Join us, in-law.

269
00:31:19,072 --> 00:31:21,888
Alright, I'll have a bite.

270
00:31:21,888 --> 00:31:23,632
- Let's see whether...
- Let's go.

271
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:28,352
my granddaughter likes the food you're making.

272
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:32,544
- A whole table.
- What are you implying?

273
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,992
Look at your grandma.

274
00:31:55,332 --> 00:32:00,092
Grannies, dig in before it gets cold.

275
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:08,552
Xu Mei Lan, enough with the fake politeness.
We're family now, right?

276
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,972
Here, Meng.

277
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:18,252
Have some meat.

278
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:21,972
- Dig in.
- I'm not being polite.

279
00:32:21,972 --> 00:32:29,012
My stomach can't handle
rich food like this anymore.

280
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:32,288
Ju Hua, no offense.

281
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:37,832
But you should fix your unhealthy eating habits.

282
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:40,832
Read newspapers and books.

283
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:48,032
They say young people nowadays get over-nourished

284
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,136
because they eat too much refined food.

285
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,432
They need more whole grains.

286
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:59,332
I haven't raised pigs for years.
Where would I get whole grains?

287
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:00,872
- Right?
- Whole grains for pigs?

288
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:03,432
Wait, listen. I raised Ba Dou.

289
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:07,552
When he first came,
he was skinny as a rail, like paper thin.

290
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,292
See how plump he is now? Right?

291
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:12,292
Stand up. Show her how tall and fair you are.

292
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:17,092
- I raised him.
- Stop flailing your arms. Sit.

293
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,052
Meng can't eat this stuff.

294
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:24,212
Grandma, it's fine. I can eat.

295
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:27,892
You can, right? You're used to it. See?

296
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:34,292
You little rascal. No wonder they say
married daughters are spilled water.

297
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:38,752
You're already siding with your in-laws.

298
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:46,212
Don't worry, Granny.
I'll take care of Ye Meng with a healthy diet.

299
00:33:46,212 --> 00:33:50,852
That's my perfect grandson-in-law.

300
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:57,232
By the way, how did it go in Jiangbei?

301
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:01,472
- Not bad.
- Not bad, huh?

302
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:06,944
Don't mind me nagging.
We should start preparing for the wedding.

303
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:13,088
I've prepared your wedding dress.
It's the mermaid-style one from TV.

304
00:34:13,088 --> 00:34:21,012
The long train will make you the prettiest bride.

305
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:24,012
It's stunning, really.

306
00:34:25,372 --> 00:34:27,168
Are you done?

307
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:28,252
What's your problem?

308
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:32,432
Why didn't you consult me about the wedding dress?

309
00:34:32,432 --> 00:34:36,632
- Why should I?
- You absolutely should.

310
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:42,292
I planned a Chinese wedding.
The qipao is already tailored.

311
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:47,672
Chinese weddings are outdated.
Western style is trendy now.

312
00:34:47,672 --> 00:34:49,972
Modern and classy.

313
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:52,592
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

314
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:53,824
Are you throwing up?

315
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,212
- You threw up?
- It's nothing.

316
00:34:56,212 --> 00:34:59,092
- Feeling nauseous?
- Just my stomach.

317
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:02,176
How long has this been happening?

318
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:10,972
It's fine. I ate too fast. My stomach got upset.

319
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:16,252
- Great news.
- Ju Hua. We must hurry the wedding.

320
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:21,152
Otherwise, her qipao might not fit anymore.

321
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,696
The mermaid dress needs enlarging, too.

322
00:35:26,528 --> 00:35:28,832
 

323
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:36,772
Welcome.

324
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:47,052
Can I help you?

325
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:52,832
- You're Fang Ya En, right?
- Yes, I am.

326
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:57,092
Chen Jian is your husband, huh? Get him out here.

327
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:00,772
I don't know him. You're mistaken.

328
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:06,252
Relax, pretty. We don't hit people.

329
00:36:06,252 --> 00:36:12,372
Your husband owes us money.
Everyone should pay their debts, right?

330
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,512
You're still married.

331
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:20,432
We looked into everything.
Bring him here to settle this.

332
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:22,624
He's gone. I can't reach him.

333
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:27,072
Stop acting. This isn't fun. Hurry up.

334
00:36:32,332 --> 00:36:37,632
 Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off. 

335
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:40,392
Fine. Whatever.

336
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:45,932
I can wait here. I have all the time in the world.

337
00:36:56,792 --> 00:37:03,052
Chen Jian, stop hiding.
The debt collectors came. Come here now.

338
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,092
And Ba Dou, don't worry about the wedding.
Just take good care of Meng.

339
00:37:12,092 --> 00:37:15,360
I will be the wedding officiant.

340
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,132
 I'm in trouble. Come quick. 

341
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:20,256
- I'm calling the shots for this wedding.
- My opinions matter.

342
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,372
Grannies. My friend's in trouble. I have to go.

343
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:25,972
- I'll go with you.
- No need.

344
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:29,752
Meng, do you prefer sour or sweet flavors?

345
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,272
Kai, Ya En is in trouble. Come quick.

346
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:41,492
Sorry, I'm late. This is a misunderstanding.

347
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:45,592
Sir, I never said I wouldn't pay you back.

348
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:48,512
It's not nice to cause trouble at her shop.

349
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:52,608
Chen Jian, I don't care
what mess you've made outside.

350
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:56,292
Get them out of here. Don't ruin my business.

351
00:37:56,292 --> 00:38:00,288
If you hadn't disappeared, we wouldn't have come.

352
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:08,224
You're right, sir. How about this?
Go back first. I'll definitely repay you.

353
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:09,792
How are you going to pay us?

354
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:12,800
My wife, kid, and store are here.
I'm not going anywhere.

355
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,736
We'll think of something.
If necessary, we'll mortgage the house.

356
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:20,864
Maybe I'll pay some interest first. Will it work?

357
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:28,132
- Hurry up. Don't make us come back.
- No problem.

358
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:30,892
Thank you. Take care, sir.

359
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:40,512
You've really redefined shamelessness.

360
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:44,632
I'm having some cash flow issues.

361
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:50,292
Honey, you need to help me.

362
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:53,932
Get the property deed.
We'll get a mortgage to pay the debt first.

363
00:38:53,932 --> 00:39:00,192
Are you insane? Why did you buy a new car?
Why did you start a business without money?

364
00:39:00,192 --> 00:39:06,052
I must appeal to the business partners
to gain trust and secure deals.

365
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:10,512
Ya En, we're married. You can't abandon me now.

366
00:39:10,512 --> 00:39:14,080
Stop right there. We are not married.

367
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:20,256
You didn't show up for the divorce paperwork.
Then you vanished.

368
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:24,160
Now you want me to pay your debts? What an animal.

369
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:32,142
Listen, Chen Jian.
We're getting divorced. Pay your own debts.

370
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:34,052
Fang Ya En.

371
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:37,012
Do you have to drive me into the corner?

372
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:44,392
Let me remind you.
Marital debt means you're liable for half.

373
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,432
What are you doing? Chen Jian.

374
00:39:50,752 --> 00:39:54,172
- Stop.
- Fang Ya En.

375
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,552
Fang Ya En, open the door.

376
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:03,616
Chen Jian, I'll kill you
if you take my property deed.

377
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:06,632
Business loans are normal. I just need some cash.

378
00:40:06,632 --> 00:40:11,592
This house is my pre-marital asset.
Don't even think about it.

379
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:16,432
Fang Ya En, open up. Let's talk this through.

380
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:22,772
Open the door. Fang Ya En.

381
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:28,212
Chen Jian, are you crazy?

382
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:29,372
- Where's the deed?
- Stop.

383
00:40:29,372 --> 00:40:31,592
- Where's the property deed?
- Get out.

384
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:40,872
- Give it back.
- Let go.

385
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,832
Give it back.

386
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:44,012
- Give it back.
- Ya En.

387
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:45,472
- Give it to me.
- Let go.

388
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:46,632
Chen Jian, what are you doing?

389
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:49,132
Ye Meng, he's taking my property deed.

390
00:40:50,132 --> 00:40:53,552
You've lost it, Chen Jian. Don't you dare!

391
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:55,832
Hitting me is assault. I'll send you to jail.

392
00:40:55,832 --> 00:40:58,052
This is my family business. What's it to you?

393
00:40:58,052 --> 00:41:01,372
She's my friend.
Wait here. I'm calling the police!

394
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:05,052
- Step aside.
- Give it back. Stop.

395
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,440
Kai.

396
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,272
Enough. Kai, stop it.

397
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:22,312
Hello? I need to report a crime.

398
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:27,132
 

399
00:41:27,132 --> 00:41:30,816
You shouldn't have stopped me from punching him.

400
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:37,440
So that you can hospitalize him
and go to jail with him?

401
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:43,432
He deserves jail time, but you don't.

402
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:49,172
I'm just glad you're fine.

403
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:58,892
Kai, pick up Jia Yu.
I'll help her clean up the mess at home.

404
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,292
Got it.

405
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:03,136
Ye Meng.

406
00:42:07,264 --> 00:42:09,120
You okay?

407
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:12,672
I'm fine.

408
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:18,592
- Let me drive you back.
- No need. We'll take a cab.

409
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:26,432
Jin Yu, please go with Kai to pick up Jia Yu.

410
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:30,712
Take him out to play or get dinner.

411
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:33,272
I don't want him to find out.

412
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:36,992
Alright, no problem.

413
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:38,912
See you.

414
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,848
Let's go.

415
00:43:14,496 --> 00:43:16,768
