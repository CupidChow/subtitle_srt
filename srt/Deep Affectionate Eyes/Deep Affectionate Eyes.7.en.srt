2
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Hello?

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,680
Anyone here?

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,280
Hello.

5
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,280
Hi.

6
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,440
Are you Jiang?

7
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,360
Yeah, that's me.

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm Ye Meng, a friend of Cheng Kairan.

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,840
Oh, Kai's friend?

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,280
Then you're family. Have a seat.

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,000
May I ask you about an old piece?

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,240
This thumb ring.

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,480
Have you seen it before?

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,000
Didn't come from me.

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,320
But it does ring a bell.

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,120
Wait, I remember now.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,920
A few years back,

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,680
a middle-aged man brought it in

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,040
for an appraisal.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,080
I thought it was a fine piece,

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,480
so I asked if he'd sell.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,480
But he wouldn't part with it.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,480
Do you know his name?

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,920
Or have a way to reach him?

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,400
Afraid not.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,360
He was on a business trip from Jiangbei.

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,640
Not local.

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,280
That's alright.

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's add each other's contact.

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,560
- Sure.
- If you remember anything else,

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
- just text me.
- Will do.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
- Alright.
- Thanks so much.

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,560
- Don't mention it.
- We'll head out then.

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,560
- Alright.
- Okay.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
- Thanks.
- Sure thing.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,800
Take care.

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,720
Do you think that seller he mentioned

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,920
might be the same man
who came to see my mom back then?

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,160
It's possible.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
Tell you what.

41
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,160
I'll ask some friends in Jiangbei
to dig around.

42
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,520
I'll ask around too.
I've got friends there.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,640
Friends in Jiangbei?

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,680
You mean that old boss?

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,680
No. Tai Mingxiao.

46
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,920
He used to be my colleague.

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,760
And what was with that tone just now?

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,720
Are you jealous?

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,840
No, I am not.

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,360
Good.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,960
After all, my mate is handsome and kind.

52
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,640
We've fought side by side for years.

53
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,720
If you were jealous,
I wouldn't know what to do.

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,920
What mate?

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
Tai Mingxiao?

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,200
We are best mates for late-night snacks.

57
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,680
Sounds like you lived it up in Jiangbei.

58
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,880
Even had a pairing mate.

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,600
If you're jealous, just admit it.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,000
Wanting someone isn't shameful.

61
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,680
I already said I'm not.

62
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
Really?

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
After the Spring Festival,

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,480
everything will come back to life.

65
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,000
Even Ping'an knows better
than to stay home.

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,440
He's out looking for a girlfriend.

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,000
You really plan on staying single?

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Maybe not chasing girls.

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
Maybe he's out finding me a job.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,240
Yeah, right.

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,640
Fine, let's bet.

72
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
He's definitely out chasing a girlfriend.

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,800
And how do we bet? Ping'an can't talk.

74
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,480
I've got a way.

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,640
There.

76
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
You'll really do anything to win, huh?

77
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,240
Even stick a dashcam on the poor dog.

78
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,360
Never underestimate a woman's will to win.

79
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
Or her will to conquer.

80
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
So, what's the bet?

81
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,920
Let's say…

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,839
If you lose, you admit you were jealous.

83
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,519
And that you want a relationship.

84
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
Fine. You're on.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,760
Still, poor Ping'an.

86
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,360
Can't even fall in love in peace.

87
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,320
At least blur his girlfriend's face
when you post it.

88
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Oh, listen to you.
Already admitting defeat, kid?

89
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,960
What if Ping'an really is out job-hunting?

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,400
Are you just trying
to get under my skin today?

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
No.

92
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,120
I just really enjoy teasing you.

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,360
Hey, look at your ear. Bright red.

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,840
That's…

95
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,240
from the cold.

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,680
Cold? I'm in shorts and I'm fine.

97
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
That's your style. Not even close.

98
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,720
So, how do you use this thing?

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
I don't know how.

100
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
What?

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
Trying to get out of the bet already?

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,920
‪HAPPY SPRING FESTIVAL

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mr. Wang, you're too kind.

104
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
We'll be relying on you again this year.

105
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,280
Happy New Year.

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm not being kind.

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,200
Oh, cut it out.

108
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Mr. Li, Happy New Year.

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,920
Did you get the health supplements I sent?

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,120
Don't forget to take them.

111
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,960
I didn't get anything.
Where'd you send it?

112
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,120
Can you stop talking?

113
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,960
I could've wrapped two pots by now.

114
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,560
Then at least finish the one in your hand.

115
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,760
Meng, what filling do you want?

116
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,240
Peanut.

117
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,440
I'm video calling Dad.

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
With your dad?

119
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,440
Let me see.

120
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,160
Brother!

121
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,040
- Brother!
- Dad, have you had <i>tangyuan</i> yet?

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,520
<i>About to.</i>

123
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
<i>I got some from the company.</i>

124
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,040
You're the only one working at that bank?

125
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
Every year, you're stuck there
for Spring Festival.

126
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,920
<i>Mom, this time, I mean it.</i>

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
<i>Once the holiday's over,</i>
<i>I'll finish the handover.</i>

128
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,760
<i>We'll finally be together again.</i>

129
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,920
Really?

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,280
You'd better keep your word.

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
We're waiting for you.

132
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,280
<i>I will.</i>

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,320
<i>Meng, I still have some work.</i>

134
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,360
<i>Take care of Grandma and your aunts.</i>

135
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,800
- I will.
- And you take care too.

136
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,360
- Happy Spring Festival.
- Happy Spring Festival.

137
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
Bye.

138
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,000
<i>Bye.</i>

139
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Your dad's funny.
Who's taking care of who here?

140
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
At least his company finally has a heart.

141
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,680
He's got family to think about.

142
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,080
Good thing he's coming home.

143
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
And you, why not move back too?

144
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,640
This place has plenty of rooms.

145
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,720
But the old house is empty.

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
If no one lives there, it'll fall apart.

147
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,680
Grandma said herself,

148
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,480
a house needs people to keep it alive.

149
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,960
Did I really say that?

150
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,640
Grandma, what filling is that?

151
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,960
I asked for peanut.

152
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,520
Right. Make her some with peanut fillings.

153
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, no.

154
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,320
We're out of peanut butter.

155
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,760
- Then…
- I'll go buy some.

156
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,680
- I'll go.
- You?

157
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,840
Go and come right back.

158
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,720
Mom, she doesn't lift a finger,
just loafs around.

159
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
I loaf around?

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,920
- Hurry it up.
- Do you even have a conscience?

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
When you're apart, you miss each other.

162
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,360
The moment you're together, you fight.

163
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,920
Excuse me. How much for a jin?

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,760
- Ten yuan.
- Give me two.

165
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,880
- Sure.
- Be generous.

166
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
What are you up to?

167
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Oh, now I know where you hide your key.

168
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,440
I'll come raid your place at midnight.

169
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,960
What are you doing here?

170
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,600
Putting up New Year couplets.

171
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,640
Your house looks so bare.

172
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,520
Not festive at all.

173
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,840
That's not necessary.

174
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
Of course it is.

175
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,440
Come on, tall guy.

176
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,600
You hang the top banner.

177
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,360
Tell me if these two sides match.

178
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
A little lower.

179
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,600
Lower?

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,600
- You sure?
- Positive.

181
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,640
FORTUNE ARRIVES AND PROSPERITY FLOWS

182
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,880
PEACE AND SAFETY WHEREVER YOU GO

183
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,040
How's mine?

184
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
Nudge it to the right.

185
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,920
- Okay.
- Now a little left.

186
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,560
I've already stuck it.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,480
Fine, fine.

188
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
Hello?

189
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,600
Just stepped out. Be there in 15 minutes.

190
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Nice tile. Hold it.

191
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
Don't bother coming.

192
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,840
We're in the middle of mahjong.

193
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,840
The place is lively.

194
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,720
- <i>One Bamboo.</i>
- Didn't you say you wanted <i>tangyuan</i>?

195
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,120
<i>I had some here at the hospital.</i>

196
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,520
<i>We even ordered takeout.</i>

197
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,679
<i>Made a celebration of it.</i>

198
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,480
<i>Oh, sweetheart.</i>

199
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,919
<i>You must be bored all alone at home.</i>

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,720
<i>Grandma's got it covered.</i>

201
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,039
What are you plotting now?

202
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
Go to Ye Meng's house.

203
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,360
<i>Celebrate New Year with her family.</i>

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,840
<i>Good boy.</i>

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,720
Here, Five Circles!

206
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,960
Enough chatter. I'm hanging up.

207
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,440
We're still playing.

208
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,080
- <i>I win!</i>
- That's not necessary, I…

209
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,120
I already took a big red envelope
from your grandma.

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
That means you're coming with me.

211
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Then at least…

212
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
let me buy something first.

213
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,880
I need to shop too.

214
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,960
Look at that.

215
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,880
Self-draw!

216
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,800
Wow.

217
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,200
You're too lucky.

218
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Bed 13, wrap it up soon.

219
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,360
I'm back.

220
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,960
Are the <i>tangyuan</i> ready?

221
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,560
Meng, what's this?
Placing an order with me?

222
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
Where's that peanut butter?

223
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,480
Don't tell me you got lost on the way.

224
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
- I got it.
- Of course!

225
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
- Coming up.
- After Spring Festival,

226
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,080
- Be quick.
- we'll set up a dinner.

227
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,080
Okay, perfect.

228
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,480
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

229
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,760
- We have a guest.
- And who's this young man?

230
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,560
You are…

231
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,040
Hello, Grandma. Hello, Aunties.

232
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,000
Hello, hello.

233
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,040
This is my friend.

234
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
He's alone tonight,

235
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,480
so I brought him here.

236
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,840
Oh, welcome!

237
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,360
A friend, huh?

238
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,160
What kind of friend?

239
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,320
A boyfriend maybe?

240
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,680
What do you do, young man?

241
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,000
No. He's just a friend.

242
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,640
Don't start scaring him off already.

243
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,680
He's Meng's friend.

244
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,040
Come inside with Grandma.

245
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,400
- Come.
- Come inside.

246
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,960
Such a tall one too.

247
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,800
- What does he do?
- Have a seat.

248
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,800
Sis.

249
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,000
Mind your own business.

250
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Go get busy.

251
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,280
- Pour him some water.
- He really looks familiar.

252
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
Exactly.

253
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
Exactly what?

254
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,720
Where'd you meet him?

255
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,640
- What's your last name?
- Li. Just call me Li.

256
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
- Li.
- Good name.

257
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Lots of my clients are Lis, all well-off.

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,560
How old are you?

259
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,720
Twenty-seven.

260
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,760
Twenty-seven.

261
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,200
So, two years younger than Meng.

262
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,320
Younger's good.

263
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,560
I like younger guys too.

264
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
Shameless.

265
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,240
What line of work are you in?

266
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,200
Nothing steady. I do a bit of everything.

267
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,160
So, you're versatile. That's good.

268
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,440
As long as you can take care of Meng,
that's what matters.

269
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,320
Money isn't the most important thing.

270
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,040
Happiness is.

271
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,840
You really do look familiar.

272
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,280
I swear I've seen you somewhere.

273
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,960
Right, Mom? I thought so too.

274
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
You have.

275
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,400
At the old house.

276
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,440
Oh, the repairman.

277
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,520
Grandma, I was kidding that time.

278
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
He's Granny Tou's grandson.

279
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Remember when the roof was leaking?

280
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,400
He came to fix it.

281
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,960
Oh, so you're Tou Juhua's grandson?

282
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,240
Yes.

283
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
No wonder you don't go home.

284
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,520
Turns out you're busy dating.

285
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,560
- Not yet.
- Li.

286
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,600
- Your parents…
- What do they do?

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,240
My dad passed away.

288
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I live with my grandma now.

289
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,240
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

290
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,720
I'm starving. Are the <i>tangyuan</i> done yet?

291
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,440
My water's boiling over!

292
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,360
- Sis,
- It's New Year time.

293
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,240
- weren’t you calling someone?
- Let me get you a red envelope.

294
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,440
- No need, Granny.
- Go eat.

295
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,640
It's Spring Festival. I must get you one.

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
What's your problem?

297
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Well… Okay then.

298
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,600
You two carry on.

299
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Have some seeds.

300
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,400
- Or peanuts.
- Did they scare you?

301
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,360
My family's like this.

302
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,240
- Not at all.
- Here, have some.

303
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,760
- Thanks.
- Here, I'll peel you an orange.

304
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,240
That's alright.

305
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
<i>Tonight is New Year's Eve.</i>

306
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,960
In the new year,

307
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,920
I wish us all a year of reunion,

308
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
smooth sailing,

309
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
- and happiness.
- Cheers!

310
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
Thank you, everyone.

311
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,280
- These <i>tangyuan</i> came out great.
- Try some crabs.

312
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
- Try it.
- Thank you.

313
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
They're delicious.

314
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
- You should eat more too.
- Careful.

315
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,720
Alright, I will.

316
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,280
- Try it.
- Give a toast to your big sister.

317
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,440
A toast from me too.

318
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,240
- Do it properly.
- And a glass for Mom too.

319
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,560
- Cheers.
- You pick good crabs.

320
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,680
That's enough.

321
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,800
My plate's already full.

322
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,520
- Have some more.
- You need to stay healthy.

323
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,240
I've got plenty here.

324
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
Now, time for red envelopes.

325
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,760
My favorite part!

326
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
What's it got to do with you, Meng?

327
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,360
I get mine first!

328
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,280
Everyone gets one.

329
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
Start with the youngest!

330
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,080
Let me see…

331
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,520
Don't mind them.
My whole family's obsessed with looks.

332
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,240
They got a little carried away.

333
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,520
But if you think about it,

334
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
their excitement is their way
of approving of you.

335
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,800
Honestly,

336
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,440
I think your family's really sweet.

337
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,480
Not at all what I expected.

338
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,720
But it makes sense.

339
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,600
It'd take a family like that

340
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,240
to raise someone like you.

341
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,640
So, you'd imagined me before?

342
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,480
It's cold. You should head back up.

343
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm going to the hospital to see Grandma.

344
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
After you visit her, want to come

345
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,400
set off fireworks with me?

346
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,080
I bought so many for your birthday,

347
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,880
they're still sitting in storage.

348
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,200
We'll see. Text you later.

349
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm going.

350
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,640
Li Jinyu!

351
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,520
Happy New Year.

352
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,920
What was that?

354
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,600
I said Happy New Year.

355
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,560
Now get inside.

356
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,240
Bye.

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Bye.

358
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,000
<i>Sure, he's handsome.</i>

359
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,560
But he doesn't even have a proper job.

360
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,840
Money's what matters most.

361
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,160
Don't say I didn't warn you.

362
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,200
That Dr. Gao is better, right?

363
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,440
Exactly.

364
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,640
And his personality?

365
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,840
Way too closed off.

366
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,440
Too guarded.

367
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,320
Meng's so simple and open-hearted.

368
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,320
Being with him will only wear her out.

369
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,760
I'm right here, you know.

370
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,200
If you keep badmouthing Li Jinyu,

371
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,440
I'll really get upset.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,720
Run!

373
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,720
Come here, sweetheart.

374
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,400
Happy New Year!

375
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,520
Not so fast.

376
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,440
This year,

377
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,040
I wish you

378
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,440
health, safety, and maybe
a few more inches.

379
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,720
- Thanks, Mom. I wish you make more money.
- I'll take that.

380
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,880
And stop nagging me.

381
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,120
Forget it.

382
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
If I don't, you'll be running wild.

383
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
Come on. Have some meat.

384
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,240
Put that envelope away.

385
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,200
Who's showing up on New Year's?

386
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,120
I'll check.

387
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,440
Coming!

388
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,000
Who is it?

389
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,040
HAPPY NEW YEAR ALL GOES WELL
WELCOME WEALTH PEACE ALL YEAR

390
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,960
Kai?

391
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,080
Ya'en, Happy New Year.

392
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,680
Happy New Year.

393
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,120
No New Year's dinner at home?

394
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,520
Why'd you come over?

395
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,400
I was delivering gifts to clients.

396
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,920
Brought one for you too.

397
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,160
- That's so thoughtful.
- It's nothing.

398
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,840
And this.

399
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,080
A red envelope for Jiayu.

400
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,000
I can't take that.

401
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
Come on. It's for the kid.
Let him have it.

402
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,160
- Here.
- Then I'll thank you on his behalf.

403
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,000
No need.

404
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,160
One more thing. I didn't know

405
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,080
what he's into, so I picked out this.

406
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,840
You really didn't have to, Kai.

407
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,440
It's New Year's time.

408
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,800
Go on. Take it up to him yourself.

409
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,200
- Alright.
- Let's go.

410
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
Jiayu.

411
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,360
Look who's here.

412
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,360
Don't bother changing shoes.

413
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,400
Just come in.

414
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,960
Happy New Year, buddy.

415
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,440
Mom, did you borrow money?

416
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,440
Is this uncle here to collect?

417
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,280
What are you saying?

418
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Wish him a Happy New Year.

419
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,680
It's for you. Take it.

420
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,640
Happy New Year, Uncle.

421
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,480
Happy New Year to you too.

422
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,160
And here.

423
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
I picked it especially for you.

424
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,880
See if you like it.

425
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,520
ELECTRIC AND MANUAL INTEGRATION

426
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Thanks, Uncle.

427
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
It…

428
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,640
really suits you.

429
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,960
I like it.

430
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,880
That's good.

431
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,680
If you ever want something else,
just tell me.

432
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,600
Until you turn 18, I'll cover every toy.

433
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,240
No need. Making money's hard.

434
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,240
Don't waste it on me.

435
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,720
- Mom, I'll put this away.
- Go ahead.

436
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,600
What a dummy.

437
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,040
Smart kid, right?

438
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,960
He takes after me.

439
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,520
Come. Eat something.

440
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,320
I should head back.

441
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Not on New Year's.

442
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,760
At least stay for a drink.

443
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,920
Perfect timing.

444
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,360
Try my cooking.

445
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,760
These are clean.

446
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,920
Beer.

447
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,440
You've really changed

448
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,680
over the years.

449
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,280
Me? You're the one who's changed.

450
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
Did you hear what my son said?

451
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,880
That you're a debt collector.

452
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,400
Do you know what kind of impression

453
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
you've made on kids now?

454
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,880
After the holiday,

455
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,280
I'm finally getting this fixed.

456
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,520
Something's up with you.

457
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,240
The other day you asked me
to fix up a suit,

458
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,600
and now you want scar removal.

459
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,560
Got a girl to impress?

460
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,200
No.

461
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,240
Really, no?

462
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,440
Really, there isn't anyone.

463
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,400
If you do, just tell me.

464
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,760
- I…
- I'll give you some advice.

465
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,560
In a town this small?
There is no one I like.

466
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,880
- No…
- Really? We got many pretty girls around.

467
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,600
- Not one of them catches your eye?
- Really.

468
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,840
I really don't. Well…

469
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,960
I… I'd better…

470
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,000
I'd better head out.

471
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,160
My dad's waiting. He's cooking <i>tangyuan</i>.

472
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,280
- After Spring Festival,
- Leaving now?

473
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,520
grab Ye Meng

474
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,040
- and come by my bar.
- Wait.

475
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,960
- At least eat something.
- I…

476
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,160
- I need to go back.
- Wait!

477
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,200
You didn't eat anything.

478
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,400
Here, this is for you.

479
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,600
<i>THE ART OF WAR STORIES</i>,
ILLUSTRATED WITH PINYIN

480
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,480
A gift in return.

481
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,600
Knowledge is power.

482
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,440
Isn't it funny?

483
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,040
I barely have any schooling,

484
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,160
yet I ended up with such a studious son.

485
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
- Right, Jiayu?
- Mom,

486
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,360
you married Dad
because you didn't know better.

487
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,800
You paid the price,
but I learned the lesson.

488
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,800
True. Can't argue with that.

489
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
Kids say whatever they think.

490
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,320
Guess I'll take it as a lesson too.
I should get going.

491
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,880
- Call me if you need anything.
- I'll walk you out.

492
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,440
I'll see him off.

493
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,440
Bye, Uncle.

494
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Bye.

495
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,480
HAPPY NEW YEAR ALL GOES WELL
WELCOME WEALTH PEACE ALL YEAR

496
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,440
I really like this kid.

497
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,880
He likes you too.

498
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,160
- Yeah?
- He does.

499
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,120
Alright. I'm off.
Go back inside. It's cold out.

500
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,680
Okay, I won't keep you.

501
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,320
What are you doing here at New Year's Eve?

502
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,840
I should ask you that.

503
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,080
Why are you here?

504
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,480
I came to see my son. What else?

505
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
We were married once.

506
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,040
Do you have to be this harsh?

507
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,680
Kai, tell them I said hi.

508
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,080
- No problem. I'll get going.
- Okay.

509
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,440
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

510
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,360
A family should be eating together
on New Year's Day.

511
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
What's for dinner?

512
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,680
It's already cooked.

513
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
Did you make <i>tangyuan</i>?

514
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
<i>And his personality? Way too closed off.</i>

515
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,400
<i>Too guarded.</i>
<i>Meng's so simple and open-hearted.</i>

516
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,240
YE MENG
INVITE YOU TO A VOICE CALL

517
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,320
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

518
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,280
You home yet?

519
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,560
Just walked in.

520
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,080
Feeding the fish?

521
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,440
Remember that black goldfish

522
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,120
you once said looked just like me?

523
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,640
Of course I remember.

524
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,720
Why?

525
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Did you finally figure it out
and decide to be like your fish,

526
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,840
go find a partner?

527
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,400
That fish wasn't always black.

528
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,640
It wasn't cool at all.

529
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
<i>It used to be bright red,</i>

530
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,120
<i>just like every other goldfish.</i>

531
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,160
The reason it's black now

532
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,680
is because it caught black spot disease.

533
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,600
Black spot disease?

534
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,760
It's contagious.

535
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,440
And I just realized

536
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,160
one of the others

537
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,520
is infected too.

538
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,560
What are you trying to say?

539
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,520
Ye Meng…

540
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,200
If you ever come across a sick goldfish,

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,400
the smartest thing you can do
is stay away.

542
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,640
Don't get close.

543
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,280
Don't try to pull it closer.

544
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,320
Because all it will do

545
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,280
is drag you into the dark with it.

546
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,200
The person standing beside you

547
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,680
shouldn't be someone like me.

548
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,720
<i>I can't even set off fireworks with you</i>

549
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,320
<i>or spend New Year's Eve with your family.</i>

550
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,440
Ye Meng…

551
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,000
Li Jinyu!

552
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,160
I really don't get you.

553
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,280
Why can't you just be brave for once?

554
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,720
I've taken 99 steps toward you!
All that's left is for you to take one!

555
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,000
Keep this up, and I really will walk away.

556
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,920
RELEASE TO CANCEL

557
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,360
YA, MIX & MATCH

558
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,000
Finally, the holiday's over. I'm wiped.

559
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,720
Chen Jian's been showing up here
every other day, making a scene.

560
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,640
I'm sick of it.

561
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,400
What does he even want now?

562
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,400
Who knows.

563
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,200
Maybe he sees my shop's doing well

564
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,040
and suddenly doesn't want
a divorce anymore.

565
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,160
Typical.

566
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,440
And you, the holiday just ended
and you're here hanging with me.

567
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,360
Why not go bother that neighbor of yours?

568
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,200
I'm done with him.

569
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
What?

570
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm tired. I don't want to chase anymore.

571
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,440
You just told me the other day

572
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,080
things were going really well.

573
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,760
He turned me down.

574
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,640
AUSPICE ENTERS AND HARMONY GROWS

575
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,160
327-3 XINGYI ROAD

576
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
PEACE AND SAFETY WHEREVER YOU GO

577
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,040
FORTUNE ARRIVES AND PROSPERITY FLOWS

578
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,160
<i>Li Jinyu.</i>

579
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,240
You troublemaker. Where's your camera?

580
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,960
He rejected you?

581
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,280
A beautiful, wealthy girl like you
makes the first move,

582
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,440
and instead of thanking
the heavens, he says no?

583
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,360
That's ridiculous.

584
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,000
He said…

585
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,960
he thinks I'm trying to save him.

586
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,240
That I'd get dragged down.

587
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,560
He told me to find someone better.

588
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,560
Tell me. Why does he
have to be so impossible?

589
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,040
He's harder to handle than a goldfish.
Nothing's ever right.

590
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,000
Care for him,
he says you're playing saint.

591
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,640
Ignore him, and he just
fades away in silence.

592
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,280
It's exhausting.

593
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,640
So, what now?

594
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,160
Are you really giving up?

595
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,320
What else can I do?

596
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,960
He's made himself clear.

597
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,080
I've got your back, girl.

598
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,800
Men with two legs?

599
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,360
The world's full of them.

600
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,560
Look, here comes one now.

601
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,280
Hey, don't look at me.
He's not here for me.

602
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,480
Has he been coming by a lot?

603
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,840
Yeah. I'm pretty sure he figured out

604
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,200
things with Li Jinyu didn't work out.

605
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,800
Doesn't know how to come after you,

606
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,400
so he uses me as the excuse.

607
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,120
Maybe he's chasing you.

608
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,640
- Are you crazy?
- I'm serious.

609
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,440
Kai!

610
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,640
Kai!

611
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,600
Come inside. Come on!

612
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,520
What a coincidence!

613
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,240
Hold on. Let me finish this call.

614
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,880
- I'll call you back.
- He's such a bad actor.

615
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,040
Total coincidence.

616
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,680
Just so happens I've got

617
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,280
a hot milk tea in the car. Sugar-free.

618
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,440
Keep your hands warm.

619
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
Thanks.

620
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Look at that. One more.

621
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,960
Thanks.

622
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Funny running into you two.

623
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,640
What are you doing here?

624
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,640
You gonna get to the point?

625
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,040
Oh, it's Ya, your shop.

626
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,440
That explains it.

627
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Oh, and Li Jinyu,

628
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,840
I told him to come back to work.

629
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,360
Why tell me?

630
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,000
The other day, you told me

631
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,240
a man should be big-hearted, not petty.

632
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,640
The past is the past.

633
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,840
- Now is now.
- Did I say that?

634
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,080
And for the record,
there's nothing going on

635
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,480
between me and Li Jinyu.

636
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,600
We're buddies.

637
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,440
Why are you telling me?

638
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,720
What's he got to do with me?

639
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,480
I never said he did.

640
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,040
You said that while looking at me.

641
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,360
What? I can't look your way?

642
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,000
- One glance and you get mad?
- Kai.

643
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,920
I…

644
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,880
I've got a nail appointment today,

645
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,520
but no one to watch the shop.

646
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,040
Ya'en.

647
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,000
And I don't have time to pick up Jiayu.

648
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,880
Kai, you're a lifesaver.

649
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,320
Ye Meng, let's go get our nails done.

650
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,239
Come on.

651
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,000
Thanks for the milk tea!

652
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,480
- Really, thanks.
- You're both leaving?

653
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,400
STYLE IN TIME

654
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
I'm telling you. He's here for you.

655
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,880
Don't start with ghost stories
in broad daylight.

656
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,880
I'm serious.

657
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,440
Here, have this.

658
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,920
How about that new place

659
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,239
at the night market tonight?

660
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,480
Yeah, perfect.

661
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,960
Dr. Gao, you're so handsome.

662
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,000
- Are you going on a date?
- He is.

663
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,880
With the girl who visited the other bed.

664
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,480
Ye Meng?

665
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,640
Yes, yes, that beauty.

666
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,200
No, no, it's not a date.

667
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,160
I just needed her help with something.

668
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,640
Granny Tou, let me check your leg.

669
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,920
- Does it hurt?
- No.

670
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,040
Granny Tou, your leg

671
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,000
is almost healed.

672
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,880
You should be able to go home soon.

673
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,800
You need to be careful.

674
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,640
- No strenuous exercise.
- Okay.

675
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,360
Thank you, Doctor.

676
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I'll continue my rounds.

677
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,440
Go on. Don't let me keep you.

678
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,960
What's going on with you and Ye Meng?

679
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,520
Why don't you know

680
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,920
how to take your chance and hold on?

681
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,000
Let it go.

682
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,960
Her family's different from ours.
Have some fruit.

683
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,680
Different how?

684
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,680
You mean that fussy old lady of theirs,

685
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,200
always nitpicking you, right?

686
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,320
So what if she does? I couldn't care less.

687
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,160
Look at my grandson.

688
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,800
Fair skin, clean-cut,

689
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
handsome as anything.

690
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,400
Grandma, seriously. Stop.

691
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,680
Every time I open my eyes

692
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,200
and see you, I feel so happy.

693
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,320
- So handsome.
- Enough.

694
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,800
Your leg's healed and now…

695
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,680
you're getting sentimental.
Like a shrink. Bye.

696
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,920
Okay, seven tonight at the restaurant.
See you there.

697
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
- Who was that?
- Dr. Gao.

698
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,720
What? You two have a date?

699
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,080
Not a date, please.

700
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,360
We're just friends.

701
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,040
His niece's looking

702
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,440
for an internship in Jiangbei.

703
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,760
I'm just helping out.

704
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,960
That's how these things start,
by helping each other.

705
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,880
Suddenly, it's something more.

706
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,440
Since you think Li Jinyu

707
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,840
is such a difficult fish to keep,

708
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,120
why not try someone easier?

709
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,440
That Dr. Gao doesn't seem bad at all.

710
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,800
I don't feel that way about him.

711
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,000
Because you still can't let go
of Li Jinyu.

712
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,760
Don't tell me you already have.

713
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,760
Here's what I think.

714
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,880
If you're not ready to give him up,

715
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,480
you'd better ask him out
and talk face-to-face.

716
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,480
Otherwise, if you two
keep missing each other,

717
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,440
you'll regret it.

718
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,800
Enough about me.

719
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,720
How about you look at your own life?

720
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,280
Nothing to look at.

721
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,720
I've already figured it out.

722
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,680
Men are far more pragmatic than women.

723
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,960
So, my rule is simple.

724
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,560
Keep them at arm's length.

725
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,680
Or I'll end up unhappy.

726
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,280
Wrong again.

727
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
What's the matter, Jiayu?

728
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,720
When are Mom and Ms. Ye coming back?

729
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,720
I need help.

730
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,200
Why wait for them?

731
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
You can ask me.

732
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,000
This one.

733
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,600
ODD AND EVEN NUMBERS

734
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,880
Wait, this… This is second-grade stuff?

735
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,320
It's for math Olympiad.

736
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,720
Uncle, if you can't do it,

737
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,960
don't force yourself.

738
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,160
Are you kidding?
I was great at math Olympiad as a kid.

739
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,120
There's no problem I can't crack.

740
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,240
This one…

741
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,080
I think…

742
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,960
Got it yet?

743
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,280
Two minutes. Just two minutes.

744
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,000
This one's a bit unconventional.

745
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,520
Uncle, if you really

746
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,960
can't do it, that's fine.

747
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,400
Nothing's too hard
if you're willing to give up.

748
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,360
Hey…

749
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,160
It's "nothing's too hard
if you're willing to climb".

750
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,680
Where are you going?

751
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,880
Bathroom.

752
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,920
Fine. By the time you're back,

753
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,440
I'll have your answer.

754
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,160
MESSAGE TO LI JINYU: HELP PLEASE

755
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,880
What a stupid problem.

756
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,480
I'll smash you to pieces.

757
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,720
THE OLD FISHERMAN'S BAY

758
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,600
Asking for a favor with flowers?

759
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,200
Come on.

760
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,120
Dr. Gao.

761
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,600
Ms. Fang, your leg's recovering well.

762
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,440
That's thanks to your team's expertise.

763
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,520
But tonight,
pretend I'm invisible, Dr. Gao.

764
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,080
I'm just here for the food.

765
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,800
You two should talk.

766
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,080
I wasn't sure what flowers you liked,

767
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,760
so I just picked these myself.

768
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,280
For flowers like these,

769
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,400
I'll do everything I can for your niece.

770
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,920
Thank you.

771
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,160
Menu's here. What'll you have?

772
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,000
Take a look. Order whatever you want.

773
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,360
Why don't you choose for us?
We've never been here before.

774
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,200
- Then I'll take the liberty.
- Go ahead.

775
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,760
- This one.
- Sure.

776
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,320
- And the lobster.
- Got it.

777
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,360
BOSTON LOBSTER

778
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,280
What are you doing
standing here like a statue?

779
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,840
BOSTON LOBSTER SPECIAL 188 YUAN

780
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,000
DELICIOUS

781
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Now I get why you agreed to meet me.

782
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,200
Well… Ye Meng's already moved on?

783
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,440
You asked me to come here.

784
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,920
Come on. Don't twist it.

785
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,840
Even Fang Ya'en's sitting in there.

786
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,280
That means she's playing best friend,

787
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,840
checking this guy out.

788
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,080
Which means

789
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,600
their relationship's about to level up.

790
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,520
You're in trouble, boy.

791
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,760
Ye Meng's always gone for the pretty boys.

792
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,880
She chases, then moves on.

793
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,360
Every ex she's ever had

794
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,600
kept her at arm's length

795
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,880
while she pursued them.

796
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,040
But the second she left? They were crying

797
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,240
and begging her back.

798
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,240
And you?

799
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,320
Too young to see it coming.

800
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,200
That still makes me better than people

801
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,400
who don't even know who they really like.

802
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,480
Me? You think I'd ever like her?

803
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,840
Come on…

804
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,240
Come on. Let's go.

805
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,000
Why is Li Jinyu here?

806
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,280
Sorry, sir.

807
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,960
What a coincidence, seeing you two here!

808
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,840
It's been ages, ages.

809
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,320
You eat.

810
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,240
- Would you like to order?
- What a coincidence.

811
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,040
Didn't expect to run
into familiar faces here.

812
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,040
We just know each other.

813
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,400
Wouldn't call us close.

814
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,600
By the way,

815
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,240
send me your niece's file,

816
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,680
so I can forward it
to someone who can help.

817
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,760
You're really putting effort
into this. Thanks.

818
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,720
Don't mention it.

819
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,080
I just hope what I said at the wedding

820
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,920
didn't make things awkward for you.

821
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,120
Don't worry about it.

822
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,920
On the way here,

823
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
- Ye Meng was just singing your praises.
- Oh?

824
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,440
What did she say?

825
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,600
She said you're gentle,

826
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,720
good-looking,

827
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,600
and financially stable.

828
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,240
Basically, an ideal catch for most women.

829
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,560
Most women, maybe, but I'm guessing

830
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,960
that doesn't include you.

831
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,960
Ms. Fang told me

832
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,880
you prefer younger men.

833
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
I used to.

834
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,280
But after this Spring Festival,

835
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,440
I've decided to be realistic.

836
