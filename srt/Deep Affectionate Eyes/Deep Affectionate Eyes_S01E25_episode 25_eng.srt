1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,904
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:15,518
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,303
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:20,832
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,984
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:31,232
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,720
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,184
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:42,816
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:49,088
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:53,824
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,904
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,904 --> 00:01:01,088
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,104
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,072
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,968
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,296
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,351
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,328
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:20,343
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:29,952
 

22
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:32,832
 

23
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,088
Where is Ye Meng?

24
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:43,040
She hasn't arrived yet.

25
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,456
 

26
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,930
Ye Meng's been kidnapped. Call the police.

27
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,930
Where's Ye Meng?

28
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,010
You came surprisingly fast.

29
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,730
Do you realize what you're doing?

30
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,730
You care about her quite a bit.

31
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,850
But I don't care anymore.

32
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,890
At worst, we all die together.

33
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,890
Are you crazy?

34
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,290
Yes, I am.

35
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,050
Driven mad by all of you.

36
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,970
Li Jin Yu, you've got some nerve.

37
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,830
Colluding with your grandfather against me?

38
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,610
You don't understand what Hanhai means to me.

39
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,490
I built it with my happiness and lifeblood.

40
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,530
You won't take it from me.

41
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,090
Don't you just want my shares?

42
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,170
I'll give them to you.

43
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,410
You already hurt Ye Meng's mother.

44
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,170
Don't harm Ye Meng anymore.

45
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,112
That woman ruined my entire life.

46
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:44,850
Who are you to judge me?

47
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,720
Calm down.

48
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,450
I'll sign right now.

49
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,130
Don't cross me again.

50
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,970
Ye Meng! Ye Meng!

51
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,650
 We only have 

52
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,490
 this one child. 

53
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,690
 We want to give her the best. 

54
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,370
 So after I had my daughter, 

55
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,930
 I focused all my energy on her. 

56
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,810
The real show is just beginning.

57
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,570
Leaving so soon?

58
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,970
Ye Meng! Wake up, Ye Meng!

59
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,850
Wake up, Ye Meng!

60
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,870
 This is the price of loyalty to Li Ling Bai. 

61
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,450
 My current state proves it. 

62
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,890
 Won't you leave yourself an escape route? 

63
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,510
 I have money. Let me go. 

64
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,810
 And I'll give it all to you. 

65
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:46,330
Remember your promise.

66
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,184
Ye Meng.

67
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,050
Ye Meng, wake up.

68
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,330
Ye Meng, wake up.

69
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,090
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,250
Blame your worthless mother.

71
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,656
Ye Meng.

72
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:20,810
Ye Meng, wake up. Ye Meng.

73
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,170
Ye Meng, don't scare me like this.

74
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,810
Ye Meng, stop frightening me.

75
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:33,152
 ♫ Every time I look at you ♫ 

76
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:34,592
 ♫ I want to get closer ♫ 

77
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:37,408
 ♫ I'm unconsciously addicted ♫ 

78
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:41,696
 ♫ To those inadvertent heartbeats ♫ 

79
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:44,032
 ♫ How could I bear to forget ♫ 

80
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:46,624
 ♫ If you understand my feelings ♫ 

81
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:48,320
 ♫ I want to escape ♫ 

82
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,880
 ♫ Because I care too much ♫ 

83
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,424
 ♫ For the courage I lost ♫ 

84
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:58,560
 ♫ How can I pick it up ♫ 

85
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,312
 ♫ Using my last bit of strength ♫ 

86
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:05,024
 ♫ I'll embrace you ♫ 

87
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,360
 ♫ Don't doubt ♫ 

88
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:38,528
 

89
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,850
Here to laugh at me?

90
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,730
I'm here to tell you,

91
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,770
don't worry about Li Zhuo Feng.

92
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,370
When he's recovered enough,

93
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,250
I'll take him back to Ningsui for Grandma.

94
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,810
I haven't endured your pain,

95
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,570
so I can't tell you to stop hating.

96
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,250
But someone told me,

97
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,890
"The world means you no harm."

98
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,010
That's true for everyone.

99
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:56,090
Pain makes the world seem dark.

100
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,810
Want to hear my story?

101
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,810
 My adoptive father took me abroad. 

102
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,610
 His business partner Chen Guo Sheng drugged me. 

103
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,370
 I was young and too scared to tell anyone. 

104
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,810
 A month later, I got pregnant. 

105
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,570
 I bravely told my adoptive father, 

106
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,808
 but he forced me
to marry Chen Guo Sheng for profit. 

107
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:09,410
So that's why you hate me.

108
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,450
Why target Ye Meng's mother then?

109
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,890
Her sin? Being too happy.

110
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,512
 Bai? 

111
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:56,256
 Years later, fate reunited us. 

112
00:12:56,256 --> 00:12:59,090
 We were best friends at the orphanage 

113
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,490
 but later lived completely different lives. 

114
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,970
 Bai, have some fruit. 

115
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,610
 Seems you've done well for yourself. 

116
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,250
 Just like that. I was just lucky. 

117
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,210
 Actually, you've always been likable. 

118
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,650
 I remember when my dad came to the orphanage, 

119
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,608
 the first one he noticed was you. 

120
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:25,824
 I like it. 

121
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:28,890
 Alright, then you wait here for me. 

122
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,610
 Shu Yi, are you leaving? 

123
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,490
 Then I'll be all alone after this. 

124
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,970
 I actually don't really want to go to Jiangbei. 

125
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,210
 Don't you want to leave here badly? 

126
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,210
 Take this. 

127
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,850
 If you hadn't rejected him,
he probably wouldn't have adopted me. 

128
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,810
 My life might have been completely different. 

129
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,530
 To be honest,
I really wanted to say yes back then. 

130
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,530
 Then why did you refuse? 

131
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,410
 Because I saw how much you loved that teddy bear. 

132
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,370
 And I promised
I wouldn't leave you alone at the orphanage. 

133
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,570
 I hated her for giving me this life, 

134
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,490
 so I began my revenge. 

135
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,272
 Wang Xing Sheng, you're a liar! A fraud! 

136
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:39,610
 I'm going to report you to the police. 

137
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,770
 Go ahead. Report me. 

138
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,210
 Then I'll tell the police you're my accomplice. 

139
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,488
 Don't forget. You're the one
who took me to the orphanage. 

140
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:50,240
 You're the reason why
those townspeople are putting their money in. 

141
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,730
 - You're an accomplice.
- No! You tricked me. 

142
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,770
 I didn't cheat them-- 

143
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,330
 Do you think they'll believe you? 

144
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,170
 Don't you care most about your family's reputation 

145
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,490
 and your precious daughter? 

146
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,650
 If this gets out, 

147
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,330
 they'll be ruined because of you. 

148
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,850
 Your daughter is still in high school. 

149
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,250
 You better keep your mouth shut. 

150
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,850
 If I ever get caught, 

151
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,610
 I'll drag you down with me. 

152
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,250
I just wanted her

153
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,930
to feel the same pain as me.

154
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,930
I never thought she'd kill herself.

155
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,530
 Give that money back to me. 

156
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:45,610
 That money is the lifelong savings
of everyone at the orphanage. 

157
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,690
 You don't know how important
this money is to my family. 

158
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,130
 Did you ever think about
how I've lived these years? 

159
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,610
 You arbitrarily swapped our lives. 

160
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,730
 You threw me into hell, you know that? 

161
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,810
 I thought I was doing what was best for you. 

162
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,810
 How nice. For my own good. 

163
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,048
 For my own good? 

164
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,250
 For my own good? You think I live a good life? 

165
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:41,024
 Don't be like this, Bai. 

166
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,450
 Shu Yi, let me tell you. 

167
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,530
 Your current happiness comes from my misery. 

168
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,890
 I want everyone to know 

169
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,210
 you're a despised fraud. 

170
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,248
 I'll make your family and child 

171
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,610
 live in shame because of you
for the rest of their lives. 

172
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,970
 Don't be like this, Bai. 

173
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,912
 I want you to feel all the pain I've endured. 

174
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:10,144
 This is what you owe me. 

175
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:13,330
 Bai, Bai. 

176
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,610
 Bai! 

177
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:11,890
 I know you hate me. 

178
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,650
 I hate you, too. 

179
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:24,770
In your most painful times,

180
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,250
Ye Meng was there to hold you back.

181
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:42,090
Actually, like you, I've had my moments of luck.

182
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:45,530
 It's kicking. Feel here. 

183
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,328
 Really? 

184
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,736
 Oh, it really is. 

185
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,970
 Let me listen. 

186
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,370
 Who's outside? 

187
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,450
 Don't you even recognize me? 

188
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,650
 Are you my annoying dad? 

189
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,610
 If not for that car accident years ago, 

190
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,690
 I wouldn't have become like this. 

191
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,610
 But it's too late for anything now. 

192
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:39,290
Go. Pretend you never had a mother.

193
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,410
Don't come see me again.

194
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,720
Take care of yourself.

195
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,720
Meng.

196
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,536
Meng.

197
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,800
Ye Meng.

198
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,050
Meng.

199
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,080
Ye Meng.

200
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,344
Meng.

201
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,210
Meng.

202
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,216
Ye Meng.

203
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,570
You're finally awake.
I was so scared these past few days.

204
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,570
Feeling better?

205
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,770
You didn't tell my grandmas, right?

206
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,664
No one's been told.

207
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,024
- Don't...
- Don't move yet.

208
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:18,410
Raise the bed first.

209
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,410
Slowly. Don't move.

210
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,450
Ask her

211
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,050
if there is any other discomfort.

212
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,170
Meng, how are you?

213
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,810
Where's Li Jin Yu?

214
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,570
I haven't been able to reach him since discharge.

215
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,370
You can't get through.

216
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,810
Hand me my phone.

217
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,792
Here.

218
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,770
Stop overthinking. Rest.

219
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,170
Rest. Don't dwell on things.

220
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,810
Kai, go call the doctor.

221
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,650
Go pick up Jia Yu?

222
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,330
I don't need you to drive me there.

223
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,250
I just came to talk with you.

224
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,240
Okay.

225
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,130
That day, I spoke too harshly.

226
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,330
I was just caught up in anger.

227
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,170
Please don't take it to heart.

228
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,730
I'd forgotten until you mentioned it.

229
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,210
He's your biological son after all. I understand.

230
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,370
Kai, I admit I did feel attracted to you.

231
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,650
But I just escaped an unhappy marriage.

232
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:19,450
I'm not very confident about love now.

233
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,930
Initially, I truly saw you as a younger brother.

234
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:32,288
But you've been so good to me and Jia Yu.

235
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,170
I'm deeply grateful.

236
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,570
But I feel confused.

237
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,536
And I don't have answers.

238
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,850
And the relationship between us three...

239
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,050
It's complicated now.

240
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,930
Our situation has nothing to do with Ye Meng.

241
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,130
I know it doesn't.

242
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,610
But I can't stop overthinking.

243
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,010
Could you give me some time?

244
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,650
Let me sort myself out first.

245
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,410
Li Jin Yu! Li Jin Yu!

246
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,352
Li Jin Yu!

247
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,810
 Ye Meng, no matter what happened
between Li Ling Bai and me, 

248
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,450
 it's an unchangeable fact that she is my mother. 

249
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,690
 Everything she did to your mother 

250
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,970
 is beyond my lifetime's atonement. 

251
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,650
 Upon reflection, 

252
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,610
 all tragedies seem rooted in my existence. 

253
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,010
 Too many suffered due to past events. 

254
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,210
 I can't pretend nothing happened. 

255
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,010
 Meeting you was my greatest fortune. 

256
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,050
 I want you to stay carefree and happy 

257
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,570
 instead of bearing these burdens with me. 

258
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,050
 Please give me time 

259
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,490
 to personally end all of this. 

260
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,370
 
Dad, once

261
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,410
you were my rock in this world.

262
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,890
I never imagined I'd cause your demise.

263
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,530
I've blamed myself relentlessly all these years.

264
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:30,090
Meeting Ye Meng gave me hope to live again.

265
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:36,930
 But now, I feel increasingly indebted to her, 

266
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,570
 more than I can ever count. 

267
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:07,328
 

268
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:42,048
 

269
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:48,832
 

270
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,290
 
 Recently, Chairman Li X Bai of Hanhai Group 

271
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,690
 was arrested for alleged illegal confinement, 

272
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,330
 kidnapping, arson, 

273
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,010
 and other criminal charges. 

274
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,064
 The case also involves... 

275
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:05,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

276
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,290
Did anyone come by here earlier?

277
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,770
A tall, thin man around 27-28 years old?

278
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,250
Yes. He headed toward the back mountain.

279
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,530
- I couldn't stop him.
-  Wang, Xu and others are caught. 

280
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:48,864
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

281
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,690
Li Jin Yu!

282
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,208
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

283
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:57,664
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

284
00:29:57,664 --> 00:30:02,720
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

285
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,744
Li Jin Yu!

286
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:11,584
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

287
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:15,170
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

288
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,970
Li Jin Yu! Li Jin Yu!

289
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,370
What's wrong with you?

290
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,930
Ignoring calls and messages.

291
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,970
Writing about "ending all of this"?

292
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,690
What are you planning to do? How?

293
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,010
I was under investigation
with no access to my phone.

294
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,210
And I couldn't find words to explain.

295
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,250
So I wrote a letter.

296
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,130
You exposed the flash drive's contents.

297
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,970
I won't let your mother bear false accusations.

298
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,770
Ye Meng, I won't run away this time.

299
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,970
Do you know? I thought...

300
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:27,076
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

301
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:30,080
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

302
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,650
Grandma was right.

303
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,170
People are like tea.

304
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:43,490
New buds grow when spring arrives.

305
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,090
So do humans.

306
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,490
Where there's life, there's hope.

307
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,810
Sorry for worrying you.

308
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,992
 ♫ Even battered, I'll keep going ♫ 

309
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:04,890
 ♫ The urge to run to you again ♫ 

310
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,690
Ye Meng, thank you.

311
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,720
And?

312
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,072
I love you.

313
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,776
I love you, too.

314
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,496
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

315
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:25,824
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

316
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,960
Let's go home.

317
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,930
I'm still angry.

318
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,850
Wait. We'll go together.

319
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,610
Do you know how long and rough this path is?

320
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,490
I searched for you endlessly.

321
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,850
Sorry. My fault.

322
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,290
What will you do about it?

323
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,010
Let me carry you down.

324
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,770
No. What if you drop me?

325
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,930
If you fall, I'll cushion your fall.

326
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,570
- You think I don't know?
- Impossible.

327
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,370
You'd toss me aside mid-fall.

328
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:03,648
 

329
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,450
 

330
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,250
Everyone, please sit.

331
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:21,450
I apologize for the negative impact
my family matters caused Hanhai.

332
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,850
I formally apologize to all here.

333
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,130
Everyone here is a veteran of our group.

334
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:40,450
Hanhai's achievements over the years
are built on your hard work and dedication.

335
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,450
I believe you've all heard

336
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:47,370
about the news related to the predecessor
of Hailan Bay, the Tianhui Garden project.

337
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:51,250
As Hanhai's largest shareholder,

338
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:56,050
I will take full personal responsibility
for the recent negative publicity.

339
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,210
So I'll allocate the net profits from my shares

340
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:05,610
to compensate victims and their families
affected by the previous financial fraud.

341
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,570
More qualified professionals
will manage the company in the future.

342
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,730
I only have one demand.

343
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,130
Phase III of the Hailan Bay

344
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,250
must preserve the original appearance
of the coastal village.

345
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,290
No more playing CEO?

346
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,130
I'm never cut out for this role.

347
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,610
I better go back to accounting certifications.

348
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,210
Let us small-town folks not make
a mess here anymore.

349
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,810
Stay another night or leave tomorrow?

350
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,290
Let's head straight home.

351
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,050
Perfect timing for Kai's restaurant opening.

352
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,050
- Let's go.
- Go.

353
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:09,344
 

354
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,290
Thank you.

355
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,912
Mr. Cheng, the time has come for ribbon-cutting.

356
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,090
Come on.

357
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,130
- Come on.
- Come on.

358
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,650
Three, two, one!

359
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,330
Grand opening!

360
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,650
Thanks to all loyal customers
for your continuous support of Jubaoshi.

361
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,730
Today marks Jubaoshi Restaurant's opening day.

362
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,170
For celebration, 20% off the entire menu.

363
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,730
All membership card holders
get free lottery entries.

364
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,610
I checked the grand prize myself.

365
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,490
Mr. Cheng really opened his wallet this time.

366
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,570
What are you waiting for?

367
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,970
Hurry up, first come, first served!

368
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,210
Come in, please.

369
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,730
Hurry inside now. Come on!

370
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,010
- Come.
- Go.

371
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,210
So crowded.

372
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,010
Booming.

373
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,890
Stop looking and waiting.

374
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,810
Ya En took Jia Yu to a city event.

375
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,968
But they sent flower baskets.

376
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,330
It's fine.

377
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,690
I'm okay. She might show up later.

378
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,650
Get in, come on!

379
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:40,864
 

380
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,570
Any feedback on the dishes?

381
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,450
- No, great.
- Everything's good?

382
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,810
Okay, promote us on social media.

383
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,010
Bring friends next time.

384
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,056
- Okay.
- Okay.

385
00:36:53,056 --> 00:36:54,090
- Bye.
- Bye.

386
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,136
Bye.

387
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:57,970
Kai, come check this.

388
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,968
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

389
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,010
I'm getting nervous.

390
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,756
No idea.

391
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:04,370
 

392
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,690
Mall shopping maybe?

393
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,810
 
Okay, let's shop for clothes.

394
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:15,410
Turning a bar into a restaurant? What a joke.

395
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,570
Tai Ming Xiao.

396
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,810
Welcome.

397
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,640
Tai Ming...

398
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,890
What? The new Three Musketeers?

399
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,330
We need to tell you something.

400
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,296
Sorry.

401
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,744
What's this about?

402
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,210
Mr. Gou, here for my opening day?

403
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,840
No.

404
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,210
True gangster style.

405
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,490
Name his price.

406
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,312
I'll double it.

407
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,050
No.

408
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,450
He's still in the dark?

409
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,090
If you're burning cash, give it to me.

410
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,610
I'll give you shares.

411
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,930
Forget money. This isn't about money.

412
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,930
The truth is that I'm Ye Meng's husband.

413
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,000
You think I'll buy that?

414
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,370
Let her go first.

415
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:45,280
What are you doing?

416
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,344
Look.

417
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:53,920
 

418
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,410
Believe it now? Convinced?

419
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,930
Did I return from abroad just now?

420
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,170
You've all truly disappointed me.

421
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,050
Let me talk to him.

422
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,944
Hurry up.

423
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,730
I think he's crying.

424
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,090
Genuinely heartbroken this time.

425
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,890
What can we do?

426
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,048
I feel bad for him.

427
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,610
Enough already.

428
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,530
Still staring at the ocean?

429
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,970
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

430
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:23,690
The situation required secrecy to protect Ye Meng.

431
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,290
You always assume you're right

432
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,210
and hide everything from me.

433
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,370
You married secretly
and quit the competition secretly.

434
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,490
That competition wasn't just about you.

435
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,490
I gave my all, too.

436
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,384
I know.

437
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,690
It was my fault
that you lost the competition back then.

438
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,810
I owe you an apology.

439
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,010
My anger wasn't about losing the competition,

440
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,890
but because you left without a word.

441
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,890
I considered you a brother.
What did you take me for?

442
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,770
Actually, my father passed away back then.

443
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,930
I kept wanting to tell you all

444
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,210
but didn't know how to bring it up.

445
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,330
You know me.

446
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,690
Always closed off,
keeping everyone at arm's length.

447
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,330
The only person
I could truly open up to was my dad.

448
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,290
But my dad died in a car accident because of me.

449
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,090
I couldn't possibly compete back then.

450
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,210
I became completely withdrawn.

451
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,770
Then I cut all ties and hid from everyone.

452
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:52,210
I thought that'd be the rest of my life

453
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,090
until Ye Meng came into my life.

454
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,730
She brought new vitality to me.

455
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:06,770
That's why I can stand here
saying this to you now.

456
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:09,610
I'm truly sorry for keeping this from you.

457
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:15,530
But in my heart, I treasure the time we shared.

458
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,490
You've always been my closest buddy in my eyes.

459
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,610
I'm sorry

460
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:31,250
for the things about Ye Meng
and what happened back then.
