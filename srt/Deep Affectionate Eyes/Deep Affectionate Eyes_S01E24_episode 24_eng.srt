1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,904
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

2
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:15,518
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

3
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,303
 ♫ With a sense of excitement ♫ 

4
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:20,832
 ♫ You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,984
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:31,232
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,720
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,184
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:42,816
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:49,088
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:53,824
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,904
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control ♫ 

13
00:00:55,904 --> 00:01:01,088
 ♫ As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

14
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,104
 ♫ All I possess is drowned ♫ 

15
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,072
 ♫ The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

16
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,968
 ♫ Has never changed ♫ 

17
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,296
 ♫ If miracles could exist ♫ 

18
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,351
 ♫ Promises would be kept ♫ 

19
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,328
 ♫ Please remember ♫ 

20
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:20,343
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

21
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:30,048
 

22
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,696
 

23
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,410
 Ms. Li, the Ningsui project is all set. 

24
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,490
 The orphanage plot is almost secured. 

25
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,490
 What else would you like me to do? 

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,610
 Find a way to get Shu Yi
to invest in this project. 

27
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,250
 Bring in all her relatives and friends. 

28
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,690
 Then you can take the money and leave. 

29
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,050
 Ms. Li, are you asking me to commit fraud? 

30
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,610
 That's inappropriate. 

31
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,930
 This is not the plan we agreed on. 

32
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,570
 I'll have to bear the consequences alone
if something goes wrong. 

33
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,730
 I won't mistreat you after all these years
you've been working with me. 

34
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,610
 If anything happens, just keep your mouth shut. 

35
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,610
 And I'll give you a substantial reward. 

36
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,890
 How about this? Keep all the funds you raise. 

37
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,090
Not cold, right?

38
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,024
No.

39
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,810
The surgery schedule is almost finalized.

40
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,450
The doctors will arrange it soon.

41
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,872
So fast?

42
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,672
Getting nervous?

43
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,570
Pfft, why would I be nervous?

44
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,090
At my age, I've seen it all.

45
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,810
What's there to fear? It's just a surgery.

46
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,690
It'll be over in the blink of an eye.

47
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,570
I'll eat and drink as usual

48
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,850
without caring about it.

49
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,010
Impressive, old lady.

50
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,090
You should learn from me.

51
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,370
Be fearless like me, that's the spirit.

52
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,690
Learn from me.

53
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,170
Don't try to hide whenever problems arise.

54
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,810
Face them bravely. Don't run away.

55
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,304
Got it.

56
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,232
Let's both make ourselves proud

57
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:06,816
by facing our own challenges.

58
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,810
Don't leave me behind.

59
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,530
It seems Li Ling Bai was behind the fraud
your mom fell victim to.

60
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,930
I don't know what dealings
Li Ling Bai had with Wang Xing Sheng.

61
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,690
But if this recording gets leaked, it'll be huge.

62
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:42,980
Wang Xing Sheng probably
blackmailed Li Ling Bai with this recording.

63
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,580
But now he's gone.

64
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,700
He left me this to bring Li Ling Bai to justice.

65
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,300
This is too risky for you.

66
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,380
Li Ling Bai isn't easy to deal with.

67
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,940
If you get on her nerves,
who knows what she'll do?

68
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,220
I have to take the risk.

69
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,100
What about Li Jin Yu? Does he know about this?

70
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,740
What's on your mind?

71
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,060
I'm thinking, if that flash drive
isn't empty but contains

72
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,820
evidence against Li Ling Bai,

73
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,672
what would you do?

74
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,980
If she's truly connected to your mom's suicide,

75
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,660
I wouldn't cover up for her.

76
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,140
What if it comes with severe consequences?

77
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,856
Would you hate me?

78
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,100
Whoever makes mistakes

79
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,820
should bear the consequences.

80
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,020
I just hope you won't hold back because of me.

81
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,260
But she is your mom after all.

82
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,740
Grandma talked to me today.

83
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,540
She told me to face my problems bravely

84
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,740
instead of hiding.

85
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,540
At her age, she still has such courage.

86
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,180
We should learn from her spirit.

87
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,300
Don't chicken out. Do what you need to do.

88
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,500
Bravely face your challenges.

89
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,576
Okay.

90
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,860
Miss Ye, you can't go in.

91
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,380
- Miss Ye.
- I need to see her.

92
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,780
You can't enter without an appointment.

93
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,416
Leave us.

94
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,500
So rude.

95
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,660
Didn't your parents teach you manners?

96
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,780
What right do you have to lecture me
when you fail to be a proper mother?

97
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,900
Why did you come?

98
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
To show you something.

99
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,420
 Ms. Li, aren't you afraid
I'll bring your friends down with me? 

100
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,020
 She deserves it. 

101
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,660
 I've suffered a lot more 

102
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,420
 than losing my reputation. 

103
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,220
 I'm already showing her mercy. 

104
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,180
What do you want?

105
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,140
I want the truth.

106
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,140
No idea what you're saying.

107
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,420
How about I give this recording to the media?

108
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,300
Such juicy gossip

109
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,540
should attract plenty of attention.

110
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,580
Li Ling Bai, you might not care about yourself,

111
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,300
but surely you care about the Hanhai Group.

112
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,780
Hello?

113
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,740
 Meng, come back to the old house. 

114
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,380
 We're all home. 

115
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,832
 Your dad's been reported 

116
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:11,540
 and taken in for investigation. 

117
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,016
I'll be right back.

118
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,912
You did this?

119
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,580
Here's the thing.

120
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,980
We asked around.

121
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,380
A contractor took on a project
developed by the Hanhai Group

122
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,860
and asked your dad for a loan.

123
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,060
Your dad approved it based on the protocols.

124
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,060
But this guy ran off with the money.

125
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,740
Now your dad's been reported for loan fraud.

126
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,660
We don't know where they've taken him.

127
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,540
If the loan isn't repaid,
he will be in serious trouble.

128
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,300
Really, sis?

129
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,460
What should we do then?

130
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,540
Don't panic yet.

131
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,780
It's still under investigation.

132
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,540
Did something happen to Dad?

133
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,672
Let's talk outside.

134
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,184
What happened?

135
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,940
That USB wasn't empty.
I deleted the contents on purpose.

136
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,420
It contained evidence of Li Ling Bai
manipulating Wang Xing Sheng to scam my mom.

137
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,580
I went to see her today.

138
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,780
I'd figured it out.

139
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,140
I know you too well.

140
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,900
You wouldn't have let it go
without getting that USB.

141
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,420
I was too careless.

142
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,780
I didn't know that Li Ling Bai
had set this trap for Dad so long ago.

143
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,540
Don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault.

144
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,820
Our top priority is to get Dad out.

145
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,580
Give me a few days. I'll find a way.

146
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,820
Are you going to see her?

147
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,620
I'm going to see someone.

148
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,660
Maybe he can help.

149
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:27,872
 

150
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,496
 Ba Dou. 

151
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,940
 There's something I've been thinking about. 

152
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,700
 It's about your grandpa. 

153
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,140
 I believe he's living a wealthy life overseas. 

154
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,700
 I'm telling you this today
because I don't want you to have regrets. 

155
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,300
 You could ask him about your biological father. 

156
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,740
 I won't regret it. 

157
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,020
 So decisive? 

158
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,100
 Are you worried I'll mind? 

159
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,740
 Don't worry. I don't mind at all. 

160
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,100
 You'll always be my precious grandson. 

161
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,460
 That's not it. I just don't want to see him. 

162
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,780
 I have only one dad, and his name is Li Mu. 

163
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,020
 Ba Dou, you can't keep
running away from certain things. 

164
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,784
 You've been avoiding it for years. 

165
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,312
 It's time to face them. 

166
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,620
 Contact him once you've come around to it. 

167
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:57,568
 

168
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,340
Li Jin Yu has been gone for two days.

169
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,500
Do you miss him too?

170
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,540
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is unavailable. 

171
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,700
 Please try again later. 

172
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,740
When are you coming back?

173
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:33,820
Hello?

174
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,060
 Meng, Jia Yu is missing. 

175
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,700
 His teacher said
he didn't go to school this afternoon. 

176
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,060
 I can't reach him either. 

177
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,900
Stay calm. I'll be right there.

178
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:49,340
Ya En.

179
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,500
Jia Yu is missing.

180
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,020
I'll check with Chen Jian to see if he's there.

181
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,340
Don't... don't panic.

182
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,780
Let's meet at

183
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,380
the school gate first.

184
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,780
That's it.

185
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,620
Car key. Phone.

186
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:11,940
Ya En.

187
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,824
Ya En.

188
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,540
Where's Jia Yu? What happened?

189
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,540
T-The teacher said
Jia Yu went missing this afternoon.

190
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,540
They thought I'd picked him up.

191
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,980
Jia Yu wouldn't skip school.

192
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,020
Did Chen Jian take him?

193
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,020
No. I called. He said no.

194
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,180
What about his classmates?

195
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,260
Maybe they went out for fun?

196
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,460
No, I asked them all.

197
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,660
Only Jia Yu is missing.

198
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,860
- So--
- Is he in trouble?

199
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,980
Calm down.

200
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,660
We'll split up to search.

201
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,620
Think of places he might go, okay?

202
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,260
If anyone finds him, call each other.

203
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,580
- Come on.
- Stay calm.

204
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,020
- Drive safely.
- I know.

205
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,140
Drive safely.

206
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,976
Okay.

207
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,020
- To the right.
- Okay.

208
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,008
- Left.
- Alright.

209
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,360
Jia Yu.

210
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,336
I'm going crazy...

211
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,300
Excuse me, what are you...?

212
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm looking for a kid.

213
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,180
Have you seen a boy about this tall

214
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,980
with straight bangs and a bowl cut?

215
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,860
No, this is a filming set.

216
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,980
Please leave the area.

217
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,340
- Filming? Sorry.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

218
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,340
My apologies, bro.

219
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:30,560
Excuse me.

220
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,512
Coming through, thanks.

221
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:34,740
Madam.

222
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Hello, Madam.

223
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
Last time my buddy and I brought a kid here,

224
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,700
about this tall with bangs and a bowl cut.

225
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,660
We sat right here. Have you seen him today?

226
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,616
No.

227
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,980
Excuse me, have you seen this child?

228
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,728
Sorry, we didn't notice.

229
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:55,540
Thanks.

230
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,780
Excuse me.

231
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,060
Have you seen this kid?

232
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,016
No, I haven't.

233
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,460
Hi, kid. Have you seen this kid?

234
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,696
No.

235
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:18,820
Take another look.

236
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,180
- Never seen him.
- No.

237
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,016
Thank you.

238
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,656
Jia Yu.

239
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,780
Jia Yu.

240
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,780
Excuse me, have you seen a boy about...

241
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,216
Jia Yu.

242
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,576
Jia Yu.

243
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,300
What happened to you?

244
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,700
You fought with someone?

245
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,900
- Where are they?
- Leave me alone.

246
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,420
Yu, aren't we brothers?

247
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,540
You fought without me?

248
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,540
We were never brothers.

249
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,900
Why did you fight?

250
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,380
They were trash-talking,

251
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,260
saying Mom divorced Dad
because she was with a bar owner.

252
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,460
I just hate that I lost.

253
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,940
Your mom and I...

254
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,420
My mom didn't cheat.

255
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,540
I know what kind of man my dad is.

256
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,980
Their foul mouths are their problem.

257
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,540
I'll punch them again when I see them.

258
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,500
I won't lose next time.

259
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,380
It's the adults' fault.

260
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,296
We got you into this.

261
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,060
Don't tell Mom the truth.

262
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,980
Don't want her to worry.

263
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,432
Rest assured.

264
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,900
Ya En, I found Jia Yu.

265
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,912
We're at the wetland park.

266
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,300
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

267
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,380
Let me see.

268
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,540
If they hit you again,

269
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,960
protect your face.

270
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,880
Got it?

271
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,740
- Jia Yu.
- Chen Jia Yu.

272
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,380
Why did you come here alone?

273
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,740
You scared me to death. Come here.

274
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,936
- Ya En, don't.
- Ya En.

275
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:08,960
Ya En. Don't.

276
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,860
- Ya En.
- Ya En.

277
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,140
Corporal punishment is outdated.

278
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,860
I already lectured him.

279
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,700
He's genuinely remorseful.

280
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,460
How else will he learn?

281
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,940
You'd regret it forever
if something happened to you today.

282
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,780
What happened to your neck?

283
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,900
It's fine.

284
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,024
- Let me see.
- How did this happen?

285
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:30,180
How did you get this?

286
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,096
How did this happen?

287
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,580
How did you get this?

288
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,060
Mom, my classmates took my stuff
and wouldn't give it back.

289
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,180
So we got into a fight.

290
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,420
Chen Jia Yu, you fought someone?

291
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
They hit you?

292
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,020
I'm going to see your teacher.

293
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,500
No, Ya En.

294
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,020
- How dare they?
- Don't.

295
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,780
It's just kids roughhousing.

296
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,380
No big deal.

297
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,700
I'll teach him some boxing moves later.

298
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,020
He'll win next time. Guaranteed.

299
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,820
What nonsense. Next time?

300
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,300
You want him to break his bones?

301
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,500
You grew up fighting, being a hooligan.

302
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,060
You want my son to be like you?

303
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,180
Jia Yu never fought before.

304
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,380
He only fought with others

305
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,640
because you taught him to box.

306
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,560
- Ya En.
- That's the truth.

307
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,900
Do you even see them?

308
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,780
They call each other brothers

309
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,744
and hang out all day.

310
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,860
We're not just hanging out.
I'm teaching him self-defense.

311
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,100
How old are you? Self-defense?

312
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Does it really require fighting?

313
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,740
He's not your son, so you don't care.

314
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
But I do.

315
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,340
I don't want him fighting others.

316
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,260
Let's go home.

317
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,740
Mom.

318
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,720
Let's go.

319
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,980
Kai, don't blame her.

320
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,300
She's just worried about Jia Yu.

321
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,760
Who are they?

322
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,384
Say something.

323
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:16,384
 

324
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,312
Come here.

325
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,352
Does it hurt, son?

326
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,780
Don't move. Does it hurt?

327
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,580
You made me search everywhere for you

328
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,660
and you fought with others.

329
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
Now you're mad at me?

330
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,940
What happened today was my fault.

331
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,380
But you shouldn't have spoken to Kai like that.

332
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,140
What's the problem?

333
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,180
You fought with other kids

334
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,500
because he taught you boxing.

335
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,060
That's not true.

336
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,140
I learned boxing to avoid being bullied.

337
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,900
Mom, you promised to respect my choices.

338
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,300
Boxing is my choice.

339
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,740
But it hurts me to see you hurt.

340
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,540
I'm worried about you.

341
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,740
Mom, I'm not everything in your life.

342
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,860
If you're always hovering around me,

343
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,140
I'll suffocate under the pressure.

344
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,100
Then promise me this, Jia Yu.

345
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,100
No matter what happens,

346
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,580
never run away from me.

347
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,800
Promise me.

348
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,060
Mom, I'm not a child anymore.

349
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,700
Does it hurt?

350
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,060
Will you fight again?

351
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,912
No.

352
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,340
Alright, go rest.

353
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,100
Keep it dry.

354
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,180
Don't move. Go on.

355
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,940
You can go home.

356
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,220
- Okay.
- I'll lock up.

357
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,056
I'm off then.

358
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,660
 He's not your son, so you don't care. 

359
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,620
 But I do. I don't want him fighting others. 

360
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,780
 You grew up fighting, being a hooligan. 

361
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,000
 You want my son to be like you? 

362
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,220
 I crossed the line today. Don't take it to heart. 

363
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,872
 It's fine. 

364
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,184
Meng.

365
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,840
Dad!

366
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:31,740
Alright.

367
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,180
You're finally back.

368
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,000
See? I'm perfectly fine.

369
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,020
You suffered, didn't you?

370
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,060
No, don't be silly.

371
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,100
Actually, I got lucky this time.

372
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,260
The loan applicant turned himself in

373
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,660
and cleared my name.

374
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,660
That project wasn't a scam, either.

375
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,780
Hanhai Group did intend to develop the project.

376
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,500
I'm glad you're fine.

377
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,540
You must've been worried sick these days.

378
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,020
Of course.

379
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,940
Grandma and my aunts were so anxious.

380
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
It's my fault.

381
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,180
My trouble made everyone anxious.

382
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,056
Let's have dinner at Grandma's tonight.

383
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:14,140
Go inside.

384
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,180
- I'll make a call.
- Alright.

385
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,416
 Hello? 

386
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:31,740
Hello. Dad's back.

387
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,980
 I know. 

388
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,420
What about you? When are you coming back?

389
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,768
 Turn around. 

390
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,860
Why didn't you tell me?

391
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
I wanted to surprise you.

392
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,780
Honey, I can't live without you anymore.

393
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,980
Sweetie, I'm home now.

394
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,792
What are you doing?

395
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,260
Tell me the truth.

396
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,300
Did you go see Li Ling Bai?

397
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,740
No, I didn't.

398
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,180
I went abroad to meet my grandpa.

399
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,980
Grandma gave me his contact
before she got hospitalized.

400
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,860
I didn't want to see him.

401
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,140
I thought I'd never
have anything to do with him in this lifetime.

402
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,860
But meeting him was just fine.

403
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,780
If it hadn't been for me,
you wouldn't have gone to him.

404
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,080
Not entirely.

405
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,700
I also wanted to know what happened.

406
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,980
I'll have to face it.

407
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,860
Besides, I'm not at a loss.

408
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,540
That old man is loaded.

409
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,140
He's even wealthier than Li Ling Bai.

410
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,620
So he paid up the debt
to get my dad out of trouble.

411
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,020
No, Li Ling Bai orchestrated all of this.

412
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,020
That old man tracked down the loan applicant

413
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,860
and got the money back.

414
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,824
Li Jin Yu.

415
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,688
Thank you.

416
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,820
A simple "thank you" is enough?

417
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,260
What do you want then?

418
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,300
Let me lean on you and rest for a bit.

419
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,500
I'll help you solve the problem.

420
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,540
Don't ask about the past anymore.

421
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,420
Look at you all with those long faces.

422
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,860
It's just a surgery. I'll be out soon.

423
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,460
You better keep your word, Grandma.

424
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,660
You promised to send me to college.

425
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,980
Do well on your exams. I'll be waiting.

426
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,420
Don't be scared, Ju Hua.

427
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,020
Just sleep through it.

428
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,060
I'll be right here waiting outside.

429
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,340
Don't worry.

430
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,500
Ba Dou, give me your hand.

431
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,888
Meng.

432
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,820
Take good care of each other.

433
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,660
You'll rest well after the surgery.

434
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,460
Then we'll visit the tea mountains, okay?

435
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,300
Hang in there.

436
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,020
Take care of yourselves.

437
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,300
Don't worry. See you.

438
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,740
- You got this.
- Go, Grandma.

439
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,300
Please wait outside

440
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,260
for the patient.

441
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:18,624
 

442
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,832
 

443
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,940
Ms. Li, we just received a call.

444
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,860
Someone got Ye Kang out of trouble.

445
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,260
How did Li Jin Yu manage to do that?

446
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,020
It wasn't Li Jin Yu. It was--

447
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,920
It was me.

448
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,504
Hello, Ling Bai.

449
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,140
Mr. Wang. Long time no see.

450
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,380
If I don't come to check,

451
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,900
who knows what trouble you'd get Hanhai into?

452
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,620
Your drama at Hailan Bay
caused our stocks to plummet.

453
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,820
The board has serious issues with you.

454
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,980
Step down if you can't manage the company.

455
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,780
You're joking, Mr. Wang.

456
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,180
I've worked diligently in this position for years.

457
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,620
Besides, I'm Hanhai's largest shareholder.

458
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,540
Who are you to take me down?

459
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,660
Mr. Li has acquired shares
from some minor shareholders.

460
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,740
Several veteran shareholders now support him.

461
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,740
Li Chang Jin holds shares and his grandson

462
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,740
Li Jin Yu holds 15% of the shares.

463
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,740
Who do you think controls Hanhai now?

464
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,820
You're ganging up against me?

465
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,940
I only care about the group's interests.

466
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,700
Who holds this position doesn't matter.

467
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,300
I came to tell you

468
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,940
that you'd better resign rather than

469
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,824
be ousted by the board later.

470
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,380
Let's keep some dignity.

471
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,860
You can't even handle your family affairs.

472
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,140
How can we entrust the group to you?

473
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,280
Do me a favor.

474
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,900
- Thirsty?
- Not really.

475
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,800
 
Have some water.

476
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,500
The doctor's coming out.

477
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,700
He's coming out.

478
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,060
- How is she, Doctor?
- How is she?

479
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,780
The surgery went well.

480
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,180
Don't worry.

481
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,112
Follow postoperative care instructions.

482
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:32,420
Thank you.

483
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Thank you, Doctor.

484
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,900
Thank you.

485
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,700
That's great.

486
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,340
Take Granny home first.

487
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,780
Grandma, let me take you home.

488
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,660
I'll get your grandma some clean clothes.

489
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,860
Alright, we'll head back first.

490
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,780
Meng will pick you up later.

491
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,460
- Get some rest, Granny.
- Okay.

492
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,472
See you.

493
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:54,660
Be careful, Meng.

494
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,900
Be careful.

495
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,980
Are you tired?

496
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,900
I'm fine.

497
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,728
See you.

498
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,820
 You should learn from me. 

499
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,940
 Be fearless like me, that's the spirit. 

500
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,340
 Don't try to hide whenever problems arise. 

501
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,620
 Face them bravely. Don't run away. 

502
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,656
What's going on?

503
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,772
 ♫ You ♫ 

504
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:02,948
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

505
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:06,163
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

506
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,964
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

507
00:41:12,964 --> 00:41:18,884
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

508
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:23,044
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

509
00:41:23,044 --> 00:41:25,508
 ♫ Go ♫ 

510
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:27,524
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

511
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:31,652
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

512
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:37,636
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

513
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:41,604
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

514
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:47,620
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

515
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:51,940
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

516
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,524
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

517
00:41:55,524 --> 00:42:01,604
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

518
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:06,365
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

519
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:11,612
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

520
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:16,449
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

521
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:19,405
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

522
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:21,572
 ♫ If love means letting go ♫ 

523
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:26,372
 ♫ Let's sever all connections ♫ 

524
00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:28,516
 ♫ But why ♫ 

525
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:32,036
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

526
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:37,089
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
