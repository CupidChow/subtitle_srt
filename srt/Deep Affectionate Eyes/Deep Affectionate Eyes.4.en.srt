2
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
The pipes are too old.
They need full replacement.

3
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,200
As for the roof,
we can still patch it up for now.

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,240
Thank you.

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,200
Be careful.

6
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,880
I thought about it last night.

7
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,840
I really did cross a line.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,840
If you want
to hold me accountable, go ahead.

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,440
Accountable for what?

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,440
Last night when Cheng Kairan was here,

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,120
I took advantage of you.
That hug wasn't appropriate.

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
In a workplace setting,

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,120
it would absolutely qualify
as sexual harassment.

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,920
Oh, so you do realize it was harassment?

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,800
I know it was harassment.

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,320
That's why I'm apologizing.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,320
Do you want compensation?

18
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,000
How?

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,560
If nothing else works, lean in.
How about a kiss? Come on.

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,960
Let's call it even.

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,640
What the hell did you just say?

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,080
A kiss is way better than a hug.
Way more worth it.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,360
This is straight-up striking a deal.

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,240
Don't act all innocent when you're
cashing in. Come on. Give me a kiss.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,120
I'm starting to think you're…

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,400
What? A kiss?

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,600
Meng, who did you kiss?

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,960
- Yeah.
- No. I mean "hired."

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,120
Hired a repairman.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,120
Look at our wall here.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
It's already leaking.

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,160
Are you in a relationship?

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
No, you seriously misheard.
It was "hired."

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,720
You're sensitive.

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,520
This young man's quite capable.

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
Master, could you leave me your number?

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,640
- We might need help too.
- No…

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,440
Let's go.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
Grandma, it's so dusty.
Don't hang around here.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,680
Why the rush?

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,680
I haven't even called you out

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,800
for lying yet.

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,920
Didn't you swear
you were staying at Fang Ya'en's?

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,920
You really got on my nerves.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
And now this blind date.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,240
Dr. Gao

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,160
was perfectly sincere,

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,880
- yet you still refuse?
- I don't like him.

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,640
So, who do you like?

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
I like good-looking guys.

51
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,200
Let's not stay here.

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,560
Listen,

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
there's nothing wrong
with liking handsome guys,

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,120
but we should prioritize someone
with a good education,

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,880
a stable job,

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,160
and a decent family background.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,640
But I just got back to Ningsui.

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,920
You can't possibly be this desperate
to marry me off, right?

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,320
Of course, I'm anxious.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
You're the only precious granddaughter

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,960
of the Ye family.

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,320
How could I not worry?

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,760
Let's worry about Little Aunt first.

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,800
- Right?
- Yes.

65
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,240
Mom, Meng gets it already. Let's just go.

66
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,760
- Lecturing is just annoying. See?
- Right.

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
- Go home.
- A new car.

68
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,360
Meng,

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,240
is this your new ride?

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,760
It's so sick!

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,680
You can't park here.

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,280
- Move it over there later.
- Alright, Mom.

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,440
Our restaurant reservation is now.

74
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Time for good food. Come on, quick!

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,240
Let's go. I'm treating you
to something delicious.

76
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,040
327-3 XINGYI ROAD

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,640
PEACE AND HAPPINESS

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,920
Sorry about earlier.
I only called you a repairman

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,760
because my family's been
relentlessly pressuring me to marry.

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,800
I was afraid they'd read
too much into things

81
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,960
and make you uncomfortable.

82
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,080
No worries.

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,120
I'm actually a repairman.

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,320
Why do you sound so salty?

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
Jealous of Dr. Gao?

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
Li Jinyu,

87
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,720
you're way more than just a repairman.

88
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,240
You've got many uses.

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,640
A gorgeous single woman like me…

90
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,760
You should be protecting me,
guarding my house and all that.

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
You're talking about me or Ping'an?

92
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
What do you mean?

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm not some stranger.

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,440
I'm your dearest neighbor.

95
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,840
Look at this place.
Just our two households,

96
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,079
lonely little souls clinging together.

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,320
Shouldn't you properly protect me?

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Fine.

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
You're packing up already?
Did you finish the repairs?

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,960
Go buy some surveillance cameras then.

101
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,560
Wasn't guarding the home part of the job?

102
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,760
I'm coming too.

103
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,200
Ugh, always with the grumpy face!

104
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
Are you deaf? Can't even hear me?

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
Meet me at the door later.

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,520
HUIZHOU ELECTRONICS

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
Boss, I need surveillance equipment.

108
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,320
Feel free to look around.

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,480
HOME CAMERA

110
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,160
Let's go with this one. It looks better.

111
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
Functionality matters more than looks.

112
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Who says good looks
mean bad functionality?

113
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,280
This one seems perfectly fine to me.

114
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,320
This one's an indoor camera.

115
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,360
Won't work outside.

116
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,080
SMART HOME CAMERA

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,080
It seems decent enough.

118
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,720
This one.

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,200
This one's bigger, with higher resolution.

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
Bestseller. Want to grab one?

121
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,440
Alright, I'll take this one.

122
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,920
Okay. Let me wrap this up for you.

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,880
Our little "gold-plated" Badou,

124
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
all worldly-wise.

125
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,040
Come on. Tell me.
What exactly were you up to abroad?

126
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,360
So nosy. What is this? An interrogation?

127
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Such a perfect face
ruined by the thing attached to it.

128
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,280
- All set?
- Yep. That'll be 620 yuan.

129
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
This expensive?

130
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
I already gave you 20% off.

131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,600
- Paid.
- Take care.

132
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Since you helped me shop,

133
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,400
the boss is treating you to a meal.

134
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,040
Pretty sure I'm officially
off the clock now.

135
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,160
What's "off-duty time"?

136
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,640
Gotta pay to eat now?

137
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
Fine.

138
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,480
Let's call it networking with the boss.

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,760
My treat.

140
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,000
You pick the place.

141
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,960
Thanks, Boss.

142
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,440
In that case,
I'm picking an expensive place.

143
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,960
SISTER ZHANG'S SATAY NOODLES

144
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,760
Welcome. Come inside.

145
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,080
No need to pinch pennies that hard for me.

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,760
Let's make this quick.

147
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,320
I've got other work tonight.

148
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,640
Workaholic much?

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
Tasty, huh?

150
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,800
Boss, one satay noodles to go, please.

151
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,040
Okay.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,920
Maimai.

153
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
Brother? Ms. Ye?

154
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,000
Why are you two together?

155
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,920
- I asked--
- Ran into each other.

156
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,360
- Ran into each other.
- She asked me out.

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,640
Actually, I'm paying him big bucks

158
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
to do a part-time gig.

159
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,120
Grabbing a free meal while he's at it.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
Ah, workplace romance. Got it.

161
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
You got itchy, huh?

162
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,080
"You got itchy, huh"?

163
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,000
Ms. Ye, tomorrow's
the Lantern Fishing Festival.

164
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,760
This year's festival is the last one.

165
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,240
You two have to go together.

166
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
I really want to go.

167
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,080
Brother.

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,440
Your noodles are ready. Go.

169
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Brother, you're 27 already.

170
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,280
- Time to find a girlfriend.
- Go!

171
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm off.

172
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,600
Sir,

173
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
any chance you'd work overtime tomorrow

174
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,800
to keep me company for the festival?

175
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,000
Not going.

176
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,440
Money doesn't grow on trees these days.

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
Think about it.

178
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
The noodles are getting soggy.
Eat up, quick!

179
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,840
Try some.

180
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
327-3 XINGYI ROAD

181
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,800
Jinyu, is your hand
all healed up from last time?

182
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,120
All good.

183
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,680
Hello, Miss. We met
at my brother's bar last time,

184
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,680
but without proper introductions.
I'm Cheng Jingjing.

185
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm Ye Meng.

186
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,840
- What brings you here?
- I've been trying to reach you for days,

187
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,440
but you just ignore me.

188
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,120
Winter break's way too short, and I really
need your help with my assignments.

189
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,080
Help with your assignments?

190
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,800
Are you in high school?

191
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,320
No, I'm in college now.

192
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,160
I just got into
Nanhu University this year.

193
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,320
That's a great school.
You're really impressive.

194
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
You're really beautiful too!

195
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,520
- Thanks.
- I've been pretty busy lately.

196
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,400
And now that you're in college,

197
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,720
there's not much left for me to teach you.

198
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,679
Tomorrow's the Lantern Fishing Festival.
I'll come find you.

199
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,159
Let's hang out and explore together.

200
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,280
It's a date!

201
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,080
Bye, Miss!

202
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,520
Mr. Li,

203
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
your schedule must be packed.

204
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,640
Super busy.

205
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,840
Gotta set up surveillance for someone too.

206
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,160
New rules.

207
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Join me at the festival first.

208
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,520
Not helpless anymore?

209
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Your eyes are more reliable
than any security cam.

210
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Having you as a neighbor,
I'm not scared of anything.

211
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
Dress sharp tomorrow.

212
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,600
Hurry up.
The Lantern Fishing Festival's starting!

213
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,720
Okay.

214
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,680
OCEAN BLUE BAY PHASE III NOW LEASING

215
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,360
Didn't expect you to actually show up.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,800
First time seeing you in white.
Looks pretty good on you.

217
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,680
Thank you.

218
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,680
What about me?
Do I look good in this outfit?

219
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,880
Yes.

220
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,880
Which looks better? This outfit or me?

221
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,800
This outfit.

222
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
You say one thing but mean another.

223
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,960
Jinyu, you're here.

224
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,360
Do I look good in this?

225
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,680
Sorry, Jingjing,

226
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,080
but I actually already have plans today.

227
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,560
After you're done playing,
head home early.

228
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
We're going now.

229
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,080
What's this, Li Jinyu?

230
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,440
Using me as your human shield?

231
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,360
Didn't you use me as a shield before too?

232
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,240
Your hand-holding is all wrong.

233
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,880
No one would believe we're a real couple.

234
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,880
Like this.

235
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,960
Hey, what are you doing? She can see us.

236
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,480
Do you know

237
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
why Ningsui celebrates
the Lantern Fishing Festival?

238
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,800
I don't know.

239
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,360
Long ago, a fisherman

240
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,280
sailed out daily,

241
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
and his wife always waited on this shore.

242
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
Until one day,

243
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,240
her husband never returned.

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,720
She became a lighthouse.

245
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,440
Every returning ship lights a lantern.

246
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,880
A husband's whisper to his wife,

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
"I'm home."

248
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,160
So, you knew all along.

249
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,440
It's deeply moving, isn't it?

250
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,600
Moving. Though it's just a legend.

251
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,120
Could you be any more clueless?

252
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Brother? Ms. Ye?

253
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
So, you two are officially dating now?

254
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,040
No.

255
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,880
I'm just here to work.

256
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,320
Right. He's just working.

257
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,840
I get it. Paid workplace romance.

258
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,800
Stop being shy already.

259
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,360
Go pick a lantern for Ms. Ye. Hurry up.

260
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,640
Your family really is hardworking.

261
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,280
You can never have too much money!

262
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
Hurry up already. Just grab one.

263
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,560
Meng, I'll pick a pink one for you.

264
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,040
- Sure. Thank you.
- And wishing plaques.

265
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,680
You grab one first. Fufu.

266
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,960
Grab one for me too.

267
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,960
Think of your deepest wish,

268
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,920
then write your name
while silently praying.

269
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Fine.

270
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,840
My dear future sister-in-law,

271
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,280
why don't we seize the night

272
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,800
to finally take down my brother?

273
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,760
Qiao Maimai!

274
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,720
Dear Lucky Koi,

275
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,880
I wish to meet
a perfect 10/10 younger guy.

276
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,600
Not too much of a player,

277
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,320
not too clingy.

278
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,160
Well, a little clingy is okay.

279
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
Just not extreme.

280
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,680
Most importantly, make him easy to catch.

281
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,920
LI

282
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,720
What are you doing? Write it down.

283
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
Say your wish out loud.

284
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
Then I'll wish

285
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,440
for all her wishes to come true.

286
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,040
Thank you.

287
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,520
- Your brother is really selfless.
- He's alright.

288
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
YE

289
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,240
LI JINYU

290
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,040
YE MENG

291
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,040
Done.

292
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,160
Here you are.

293
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,680
Anyone there?

294
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,920
Coming.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
- Sorry. All these stalls are mine.
- Get back to work.

296
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,960
Sir, buy a flower for your girlfriend.

297
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,400
She is not my girlfriend.

298
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He's not my boyfriend either.
Thanks though.

299
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
You're welcome.

300
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,320
Li Jinyu, you're really something!

301
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,320
All the acting when you need me.

302
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,720
Drawing boundaries when you don't?

303
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Fine.

304
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,320
So, I hold a grudge.

305
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm taking notes now.

306
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
Li Jinyu hates buying flowers for girls.

307
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,960
Alright,

308
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,200
let's go watch the fireworks.

309
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,600
Two,

310
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
this kid enjoys fireworks with girls.

311
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,280
You think if my little notebook gets full,

312
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,520
will my wishes come true?

313
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,960
Li Jinyu, I'm talking to you.

314
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,320
Can you at least respond?

315
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,680
Are you deaf or what?

316
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,520
Hey!

317
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm a lot to handle.

318
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,200
What if you lose interest
while taking all these notes?

319
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,360
It's fine.

320
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,720
Patience is my specialty.

321
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,640
- Fireworks!
- Beautiful!

322
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,120
So lively!

323
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,800
As lively as Jiangbei?

324
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,600
Jiangbei's liveliness

325
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,440
always felt artificial to me.

326
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,720
But here, it's real.

327
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,840
<i>I used to fight tooth and nail</i>
<i>to stay in Jiangbei.</i>

328
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
<i>Desperate to prove myself to someone,</i>

329
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,800
<i>terrified</i>

330
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,800
<i>of being exposed as "not enough."</i>

331
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,000
But coming back, I found freedom.

332
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,600
All in a single moment.

333
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,560
Which moment?

334
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,280
Why do you like watching fireworks?

335
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,440
Maybe it's because

336
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,440
I love the loneliness
when they bloom alone in the dark.

337
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,600
Let it be lonely.

338
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,840
It will be fine if I can feel
a little warmth once in a while.

339
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,000
Sir!

340
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,640
Working at my place so early.

341
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,680
Such dedication!

342
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,120
Give me your phone.

343
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,560
What?

344
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,240
Am I too gorgeous?
Want to take my picture?

345
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,600
Install this phone app.

346
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,000
Then you can view the footage.

347
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,680
You're so not funny. Fine, here.

348
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
Done.

349
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,360
Thanks.

350
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,920
Li Jinyu.

351
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,520
Ye Meng.

352
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,440
Finally noticed me, huh?

353
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,599
With those sunglasses on,

354
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,040
I thought you'd gone blind.

355
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,319
You two know each other?

356
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,760
This town's tiny.

357
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,560
Is it really that weird
we know each other?

358
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,600
So, you're the one

359
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,360
who told him
I had a boyfriend in Jiangbei?

360
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,920
Is this your way of getting back
at me over Gou Kai?

361
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,640
You seriously overestimate yourself.

362
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,080
I just think

363
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,680
you're a trashy two-timer.

364
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,800
How helpful of you.

365
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,480
We grew up together.

366
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,240
You know how I am.

367
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,480
Nobody touches what's mine.

368
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,280
Go on, kid.
Catch up with your ex properly.

369
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,160
And do make her pay
for the emotional damage. Every penny.

370
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,280
Pretty sure my losses
on your tab are higher.

371
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,160
We'll talk about this later.

372
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,720
So, you're really
not going back to Jiangbei?

373
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,560
Gou Kai asked me to tell you.

374
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,280
If you're willing to return,

375
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,240
he'll come fetch you himself
after Spring Festival.

376
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,200
You can't stay here forever.

377
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,760
Don't start studying
so early in the morning.

378
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,200
Play for a while first.

379
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,560
Hello. What's up?

380
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,040
Jiang Luzhi is back.

381
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,400
What?

382
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,520
Get to my place right now. No delays!

383
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,040
Anyway, that's what happened.

384
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,760
I never expected her
to just quit on impulse.

385
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,280
And I definitely didn't see…

386
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,560
Thank you. But what really shocked me

387
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
was her thinking

388
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,600
I stole her job through connections.

389
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,200
That night on the phone with you,
it was too messy to explain.

390
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,440
So, I figured I'd just come back
and tell you face-to-face.

391
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,040
So,

392
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,040
you two never got along

393
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,960
all because of that guy Gou Kai?

394
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,120
She told you that?

395
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,760
No wonder you thought

396
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,760
I was secretly dating someone new.

397
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,880
Not that anyone would believe me now,

398
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,480
but I've been completely framed.

399
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,360
Gou Kai and I

400
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,720
are purely professional,
boss and subordinate.

401
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Never once crossed that line.

402
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,400
The person he loves is Ye Meng.

403
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,720
After all, she's been
with him since college.

404
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,640
They built the company
from scratch together.

405
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,680
Not many people
can match that kind of bond.

406
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,320
When he hired me,

407
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,240
- it was just--
- Save the explanations.

408
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,080
We both know we were just casual dates.

409
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,080
What about Ye Meng?

410
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,040
You seemed awfully cozy with her just now.

411
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,040
What's that about?

412
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,160
That's none of your business, is it?

413
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,360
Seems like she's pretty interested in you.

414
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
Does she have a crush on you?

415
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,040
I don't know either.

416
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,320
Let me tell you something.

417
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,880
You do like him.

418
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,240
Why else are you so freaked out

419
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,680
about Jiang Luzhi's coming back?

420
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,560
"Freaked out"?
I was protecting my reputation.

421
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,960
Who knows what nonsense she'd spew.

422
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,240
Do you even realize
what she turned me into at the company?

423
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,240
What?

424
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,240
They're calling me "Sleeping Beauty."

425
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,320
What?

426
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,680
One thing really baffles me.

427
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,240
Is Gou Kai blind?

428
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,800
Sure,

429
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,400
Jiang Luzhi outplays you in scheming,

430
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,360
but looks-wise? You're light years ahead!

431
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,160
Didn't he used to be into you?

432
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,880
How the hell did he end up with her?

433
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,400
Don't flatter him.

434
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,560
What does he like about me?

435
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,200
He just wanted some grown-up flirting.

436
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,240
Guys like Gou Kai,

437
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,040
they need the whole world

438
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,440
orbiting them 24/7.

439
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
After I joined the company,

440
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,840
it was all networking dinners

441
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,680
and bullshit about career growth.

442
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
Excuses to parade me around.

443
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,200
When I said no,

444
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,240
entered Jiang Luzhi
as his shiny new toy to poke at me.

445
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,240
That's straight-up emotional manipulation.

446
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,200
So, are you going back?

447
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,720
I mean, back to Jiangbei?

448
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,080
Look at you. Back then,
you fought like hell

449
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,640
to stay in Jiangbei.

450
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,560
So, what now?

451
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,120
Are you really just giving up
and settling here?

452
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,840
She'd never stay in Ningsui.

453
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,720
Even if she likes you, it's just a fling.

454
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,840
She has three aunts,

455
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,760
plus a grandmother still basking

456
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
in their dynasty's glory.

457
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,240
Get serious with her,

458
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,200
and your future kids
will be Ye clan property.

459
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,360
You cool with that?

460
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,360
I'm fine with it.

461
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,040
Since her family's loaded,

462
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,640
it doesn't bother me one bit.

463
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,320
But do you even know?

464
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,440
Her mother killed herself
the year of her college exams.

465
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
Her father fled abroad after,

466
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,000
barely returned since.

467
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,560
You really think you can handle

468
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,800
that kind of family wreckage?

469
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,520
No problem here.

470
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,040
Not having to deal
with a father-in-law 24/7…

471
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,960
Sounds good to me.

472
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,000
Alright.

473
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,800
You're real optimistic about this.

474
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,200
We both knew the deal

475
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,760
from the very first meeting.

476
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,920
You're not into me.
I have no interest in you.

477
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,080
This was never more than a play

478
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,120
to shut our families up.

479
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,960
Man!

480
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Li Jinyu,

481
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
if Ye Meng didn't exist,

482
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,800
would you still break up with me?

483
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
Of course, he wouldn't.

484
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,680
The way he is is like a half-dead ghost.

485
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,560
If I didn't…

486
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,720
Eat.

487
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
He's absolutely going to stick
with Jiang Luzhi.

488
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,000
Maybe not that bad.

489
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
They've been talking forever. About what?

490
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,520
And they still haven't shown up.

491
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,760
Come on. It's common knowledge.

492
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,440
Like 70% of guys

493
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,440
are hung up on their exes.

494
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,800
It's totally normal.

495
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,560
An ex who literally treated him
as a backup option?

496
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
By the looks of things,

497
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,800
a set of exam papers are being done.

498
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,320
Look at yourself right now.

499
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,160
Still claiming you don't like him?

500
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,720
Even if those two

501
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,280
are up to something, what's it to you?

502
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,840
Who are you now?

503
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
Just some nosy neighbor

504
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,680
peeking through security cameras,

505
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,720
pathetically obsessed.

506
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
I'll ask for you.

507
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,400
Don't overthink it. Just be direct.
What's the big deal?

508
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,000
<i>Ya'en, let me know if you need anything.</i>

509
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,600
I don't need anything.

510
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,200
<i>It's our dear Meng</i>

511
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,600
who's worried some femme fatale
might've ensnared you.

512
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,360
<i>So, she sent me to do a "wellness check."</i>

513
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
Hurry up!

514
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,400
Happy now?

515
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,680
Why would I be happy?

516
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,440
Not me. Ya'en wants you.

517
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,120
Actually, it is me.

518
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,680
Or rather, my son Jiayu.

519
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,520
Jiayu, didn't you have that tricky

520
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,640
Olympiad math problem earlier?

521
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,320
Ask this guy. He can help.

522
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,480
No, I don't.

523
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,600
Come here.

524
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,480
I…

525
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,720
- There's this Olympiad math problem.
- Right?

526
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,440
Do me a favor then.

527
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,000
Jiayu, which problem can't you solve?

528
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,720
Which?

529
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,840
This.

530
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,480
I can't solve this one.

531
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,280
Let me read it.

532
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,000
If it's not first grade,

533
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,520
then it's second grade,
plus work from other grades.

534
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,880
<i>If it's not second grade,</i>

535
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,240
<i>then it's first grade,</i>

536
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,440
<i>combined with works from other grades.</i>

537
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,240
<i>Add them all up,</i>

538
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,600
<i>and it's first grade plus second grade,</i>

539
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,520
<i>plus twice the amount from other grades.</i>

540
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,280
<i>That's 21 plus 28,</i>

541
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,120
<i>which equals 49 pieces.</i>

542
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,200
- <i>That's double</i>
- Hey…

543
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,920
<i>the number of work from other grades.</i>

544
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,080
- You're staring at him so hard.
- <i>That is…</i>

545
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,280
<i>Minus 13 equals 36 pieces.</i>

546
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,280
- <i>So, the total</i>
- Watch it…

547
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,240
<i>for the other grades</i>

548
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,960
<i>is 36 divided by two,</i>

549
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,000
<i>which equals 18 pieces.</i>

550
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,560
<i>Now, let's double-check</i>

551
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,320
<i>if this result is right.</i>

552
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,200
<i>Let's say the number of pieces</i>
<i>in first grade is A,</i>

553
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,920
<i>second grade is B,</i>

554
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,640
<i>and other grades combined is C.</i>

555
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,000
WEDDING GIFTS

556
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,600
Take a look.

557
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,240
Oh my God, so good-looking.

558
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,280
- Isn't she?
- Absolutely.

559
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,000
So beautiful.

560
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,960
Do you want to go over?

561
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,080
Alright. This way, please.

562
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,080
You two are still together?

563
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,000
We're married and you still haven't

564
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,960
- given us a red envelope.
- Yeah.

565
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,640
- Congratulations!
- Ye Meng is here.

566
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Thank you.

567
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,640
Thank you.

568
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,480
Wow, that's some
epic high cranial top today.

569
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,760
How many hair pads did you stack?

570
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,400
Not bad.

571
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,240
About the same as you.

572
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,320
Am I seeing things?

573
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,480
You two have been rivals since childhood,

574
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,480
and now you're here together?

575
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,400
How rare!

576
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,680
Our class president
has such clout to persuade

577
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Ms. Jiang to show up.

578
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,400
I heard the South Coast project
is under your helm as well.

579
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,400
Quite impressive.

580
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,720
Mr. Chen, don't mock me.

581
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm just a small fry.

582
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
I'll be counting
on your support down the road.

583
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,160
Stop being so humble.

584
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,920
Among our old classmates,

585
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,680
aren't you two the only ones still single?

586
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,200
Ms. Jiang has a busy schedule,
but Ye Meng, what's your excuse?

587
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,640
Women can't put off having kids forever

588
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,040
once they reach a certain age.

589
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,960
Quit fooling around.

590
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,440
Seriously?

591
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,920
Luzhi, he's basically
calling you over the hill.

592
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,680
If you're so obsessed with kids,

593
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,480
why not work as a live-in nanny?

594
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,200
You'd get paid while babysitting.

595
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm the walking warning here.
Utterly revolting.

596
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,000
Marrying someone like you?

597
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,080
I'd rather adopt a dog.

598
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
What?

599
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,280
Alright.

600
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
We're all old classmates.
Let's not argue over this.

601
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I heard you used to have a boyfriend.

602
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,480
Who is he? Do we know him?

603
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,560
His relative is ill,
so he's tied up at the hospital.

604
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,400
I'll give him a call later
to check if he can make it.

605
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
Bring him around.

606
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,960
Right.

607
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,200
Stop gossiping about me.

608
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,560
Look, our class beauty
is standing all by herself.

609
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,080
Gotta go.

610
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,280
Not a single ounce of change.

611
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,000
How have you been?

612
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm doing okay.

613
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,680
You've broken up with Jiang

614
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,400
and ended the long-distance relationship,

615
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,320
so now you're single again, aren't you?

616
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,560
Look at that happy couple over there.

617
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,920
They're so blissful.

618
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,960
Then there's you,

619
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,600
and then there's me.

620
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,360
Just a pair of lonely souls
with no one to talk to.

621
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
I'm not human, am I?

622
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,040
I'm a dog. I'm Ping'an.

623
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,040
I wish you were a dog.

624
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,440
You'd obey my every word.

625
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,040
Why not try dating Ye?

626
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
She's wonderful.

627
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,640
Gracious, vivacious,

628
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,000
and socially adept.

629
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,560
For someone

630
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,040
as tight-lipped as you,
she'd be the ideal match.

631
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Enough is enough.

632
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,880
JIANG LUZHI

633
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,600
What does she want?

634
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,320
Still not over it?

635
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,800
Here.

636
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,240
What's up?

637
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,560
<i>Didn't you used to perform at bars?</i>

638
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,480
<i>My classmate's</i>

639
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,400
wedding performer
just canceled last minute.

640
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,320
Interested?

641
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,320
No time.

642
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,560
You have time.

643
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,040
<i>Hi, Dr. Gao.</i>

644
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,440
- Hi.
- They're all over there.

645
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,760
Go ahead. I need a quick call.

646
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Okay, you go ahead.

647
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,120
<i>Don't think about it. Hurry up.</i>

648
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Listen carefully.

649
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,000
You must sever all connections

650
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,600
with Jiang completely. Understand?

651
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,880
Don't worry so much.

652
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,080
I'm off.

653
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,280
Hey, you?

654
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,200
<i>Distinguished guests,</i>
<i>dear friends, and loved ones.</i>

655
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,480
Our groom, Zhou Yuefei,

656
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,640
and bride, Dai Lin, have now
entered the wedding venue.

657
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
At this joyous moment, let's all give them

658
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
a heartfelt round of applause

659
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,560
as we invite the groom

660
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,160
to share his love for his beautiful bride.

661
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,400
How about that, everyone?

662
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,680
Good.

663
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,400
Kiss!

664
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,640
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

665
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,440
- Who do you think
- We are here today for…

666
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,640
will get married first? You or me?

667
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,920
…such a sweet couple…

668
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,480
- Seriously? That's not a competition.
- Now,

669
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,320
- What are you acting for?
- Let's have

670
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,480
- Back in the day, we'd even compete
- our groomsmen say

671
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,840
- on how long we can hold our wee.
- a few words.

672
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,160
- That was back in kindergarten.
- Let's welcome them on the stage.

673
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,640
Yeah,

674
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,640
our rivalry is even more solid
than a best friendship.

675
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,920
- I understand your little schemes
- Of course,

676
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
- better than Fang Ya'en.
- I wish them to have babies soon.

677
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,040
- You took a liking to Li Jinyu
- Lovely.

678
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,280
- only because he was with me back then.
- How many kids should they have?

679
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,120
Eight kids, of course, right?

680
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,800
- That'd be great.
- Aren't you with Gou Kai already?

681
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,640
- Are you trying double-dipping?
- Let's wish them

682
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,840
- Some good time management.
- a happy family.

683
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,120
I said that deliberately earlier.

684
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,240
- Gou Kai and I were never
- If I really

685
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,520
- actually together.
- had to say,

686
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,520
- At most, it was just a vague flirtation.
- find a new girlfriend.

687
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,720
Not exactly appropriate

688
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,400
- But when it comes to scheming,
- to say it now.

689
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,520
- I'm still no match for you.
- Right?

690
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,320
- In Jiangbei, you had Gou Kai.
- Anyway…

691
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,640
The moment you got back here,

692
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,960
you latched onto Li Jinyu.

693
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,480
Today, at this wedding,

694
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
- Not to mention Dr. Gao.
- we thank you

695
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,360
for your blessings. Thank you.

696
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,640
- He does fit
- Now it's time

697
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,920
- the Ye family's criteria
- for our bridesmaids

698
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,760
- for a son-in-law.
- to say a few words.

699
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,880
He's utterly devoted to you.

700
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,440
So, from now on,

701
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,400
- keep your distance from my boyfriend.
- Now, let's welcome Jiang Luzhi

702
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,000
- Your boyfriend?
- as maid of honor

703
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,320
- Did he agree?
- to the stage for her speech.

704
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,720
- You may guess.
- Let's give it up for her.

705
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,520
As the bride's dearest friend,

706
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,000
I want to tell the groom.

707
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,360
Congratulations on discovering
this precious gem.

708
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,400
From this day forward,
please treasure her, protect her,

709
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
and be her lifelong sanctuary.

710
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,240
No amount of wealth,
social standing, or years

711
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,480
can compare to having someone

712
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,280
who will always stand behind you,

713
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,800
ready to welcome you

714
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
whenever you turn around.

715
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,880
Now, let's invite

716
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,800
the bride and groom to exchange rings.

717
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,720
Please welcome
our adorable flower girls and boys.

718
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,680
Would all our guests please rise
and join us in offering your blessings?

719
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,360
Ye Meng.

720
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,720
- What a coincidence.
- What a coincidence.

721
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,240
- You are…
- I'm the groom's college friend.

722
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,400
That's quite a coincidence.

723
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,000
- I really enjoyed our last meeting…
- Let's

724
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
wish them full happiness!

725
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
…and felt a good connection.

726
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,560
I understand

727
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,040
arranged dates aren't your preference.

728
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,080
May your love

729
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,680
- last forever!
- Maybe we could

730
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,200
- Lifetime happiness.
- start as friends?

731
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,840
We are friends now.

732
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,640
Have lovely babies.

733
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,280
Congratulations!

734
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,920
Hurry up.

735
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,560
Come on.

736
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,280
You actually came.

737
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,360
Why drink alone and drown your sorrows?

738
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,720
None of your business.

739
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,000
Do you want to go out for some fresh air?

740
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,600
Class reunions keep getting duller.

741
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,040
We've all drifted apart.

742
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,280
Now we just force awkward small talk,

743
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,239
scraping the bottom of the barrel
with gossip and prying questions.

744
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,320
The shared connections are long gone.

745
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,760
It seems

746
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,680
you have a strong dislike for Ningsui,

747
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,120
so why bother coming back at all?

748
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,400
An age-old lament.

749
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,920
The Jiangbei we cannot hold onto,
the homeland we can never reclaim.

750
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,120
I'll take your word as sincere,

751
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,120
but I don't buy
that this is the real reason.

752
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,240
What about you?

753
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,080
Why did you choose to settle in Ningsui?

754
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,360
You don't seem to belong here at all.

755
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,080
Faking it must be draining.

756
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,200
But then again,

757
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,880
you showed up today

758
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,800
because of me?

759
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,840
I'm just here for a side gig
to earn some cash.

760
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,840
But you, you ditched your blind date

761
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,840
and came out with me instead.

762
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,680
How's that even okay?

763
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,360
Isn't it the same for you?

764
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,400
Your ex is there as well.

765
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Hello.

766
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,520
<i>Jinyu, it's me.</i>

767
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,360
<i>I tried calling you earlier,</i>
<i>but you didn't pick up,</i>

768
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,080
<i>so Mom used</i>
<i>a different number to reach you.</i>

769
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,040
<i>I'm sick, gravely ill.</i>

770
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,000
<i>I need you to come to Jiangbei.</i>

771
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,720
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>Jinyu, you're still my son.</i>

772
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,040
Son?

773
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,240
Are you okay?

774
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,320
Is that your mom?

775
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,880
You'd better mind your own business.

776
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,160
You're such a weird one.

777
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
Flipping out at the drop of a hat.

778
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,560
Ye Meng.

779
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,600
I know you're only after me for some fun,

780
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,000
but if your saintly compassion
is acting up,

781
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,680
I'd say go save someone else.

782
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,120
For fun? Alright. Let's do this now.

783
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,680
Come to my room.

784
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,920
Hi there. Can I get a beer?

785
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,840
Okay.

786
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,440
Didn't you say
we were heading back to your room?

787
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,600
What brought you here instead?

788
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,600
Chicken out?
Need a drink to steel your nerves?

789
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
What's on your mind?

790
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm just creating vibes here.

791
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,200
You don't understand a thing.

792
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,600
Having beer alone is no fun at all.

793
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,520
Hi.

794
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,120
- Could I get one of those?
- Sure.

795
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,000
Thank you.

796
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,240
What's this?

797
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,240
The bar's signature cocktail…

798
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,560
is also known as the "Dazed Drink."

799
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,520
Afraid to drink?

800
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
What's there to be afraid of?

801
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,400
It tastes pretty good.

802
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,360
Please give me that whole row. Thank you.

803
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,680
Enjoy.

804
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,760
Please give us that row as well.

805
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,640
Hey, take it easy.

806
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,040
This stuff's pretty strong.

807
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,080
Switch to water.

808
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,880
- Get me a glass of water.
- Sure.

809
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,640
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

810
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,960
I'm sorry.

811
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,680
I lost control of my emotions earlier.

812
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,880
But

813
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,360
I know you were just looking out for me.

814
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,320
Li Jinyu,

815
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,440
why do you always
control your emotions so tightly?

816
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,560
I wish

817
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,280
you'd stop boxing yourself in

818
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,960
with all these rules.

819
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,000
Sometimes, you should
let yourself go wild.

820
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,600
Not everyone is qualified for that.

821
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,800
Li Jinyu,

822
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,560
if anyone ever tells you

823
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,200
you're not qualified,

824
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,320
send them to me.

825
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,920
From now on,

826
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,520
let me conquer the world for you.

827
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,400
<i>Your eyes</i>

828
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:57,240
<i>Like shooting stars in the night</i>

829
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:05,520
<i>Streaking across frozen borders</i>

830
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,680
<i>To pierce my heart's defenses</i>

831
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,760
<i>Just like that, conquered</i>

832
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,960
<i>A black goldfish</i>

833
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,120
<i>Stranded in desert sands</i>

834
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,320
<i>Even if all memories fade</i>

835
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,720
<i>Your silhouette lingers</i>

836
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,880
<i>Etched in my mind</i>

837
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,320
<i>Every time I gaze at you, longing to near</i>

838
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,840
<i>I drown, unasked, in reverie</i>

839
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,040
<i>Those accidental heartbeats</i>

840
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,120
<i>How could I ever discard them?</i>

841
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,600
<i>If you sensed my turmoil, my retreat</i>

842
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,360
<i>Know it's only because I care too deeply</i>

843
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,360
<i>The courage I threw away</i>

844
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,960
<i>Where does it hide now?</i>

845
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,680
<i>With the last of my strength</i>
<i>I'd reach to hold you</i>

846
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,040
<i>Don't you dare doubt it</i>

847
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,080
