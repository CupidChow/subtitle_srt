 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:11,804
♫  I still remember it clearly  ♫

3
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:15,418
♫  Your eyes sparkled back then  ♫

4
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:20,603
♫  The way you lit up when telling me you loved me  ♫

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:25,784
♫  But over time, you've forgotten  ♫

6
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:31,132
♫  Promises left behind at every twist in life  ♫

7
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:34,620
♫  Only memories remain like scattered fireworks  ♫

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,084
♫  When I turned to walk away  ♫

9
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:42,816
♫  If I could go back to the day we said goodbye  ♫

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:48,788
♫  I'd never let go of your hand  ♫

11
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:53,924
♫  I can't hide the flutters in my heart  ♫

12
00:00:53,924 --> 00:01:01,150
♫  I'm about to be out of control as breathing turns weightless  ♫

13
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,904
♫  All I possess is drowned by the me who still loves you deeply  ♫

14
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:11,268
♫  I'll never changed even if miracles exist  ♫

15
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:15,451
♫  Don't forget, our promises will be kept  ♫

16
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:20,240
♫  And the dream where I'm with you  ♫

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,930
   

18
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,930
   

19
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,520



20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,680
The pipes have aged and can only be replaced with new ones.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,180
The roof can be repaired for now.

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,260
Thanks. Please be careful.

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,260
Last night I reflected on my actions. I did cross the line.

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,100
If you want to hold me accountable for it, that's fine.

25
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,460
Accountable for what?

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,560
When Cheng Kai Ran was here last night, I used you by hugging you.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,080
This would count as sexual harassment in workplace standards.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,220
So, you do know it as sexual harassment.

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,220
I know it's sexual harassment. That's why I'm apologizing to you now.

30
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,720
Should I compensate you?

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,620
How would you compensate me?

32
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:19,020
If that's not enough, why don't you just kiss me? Come on.

33
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,680
Let's consider us even now.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,000
- What did you say? 
 - A kiss is way better than a hug.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,300
You're taking advantage. Don't push your luck any further.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,488
Come on, kiss me.

37
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:30,820
- I'm starting to think you— 
 - What do you mean, "kiss"?

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,800
- Meng Meng, who did you kiss? 
 - Yeah?

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,180
No, I'm talking about hiring. I hired a repairman.

40
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,360
Look at our walls here. They're already leaking.

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,160
Are you in a relationship?

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,360
No, you misheard. What I said was "hiring."

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,460
You're being rather sensitive.

44
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,180
This young man is quite handsome.

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,440
Sir, could you leave me your contact info?

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,668
- My home needs repairs too. 
 - Just go.

47
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:55,540
Grandma, there's too much dust here. You shouldn't stay.

48
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,440
Why are you in such a hurry?

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,700
I haven't confronted you yet. You lied to me, didn't you?

50
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,160
Didn't you tell me you were staying at Fang Ya En's place?

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,908
I can't believe you.

52
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:09,000
And about the blind date dinner,

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,224
Dr. Gao made such a sincere declaration.

54
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:15,060
- Why wouldn't you accept him? 
 - I don't like him.

55
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,240
Then, who do you like?

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,900
I like someone handsome.

57
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,500
- Let's not stay here. 
 - Listen.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,764
There's nothing wrong with wanting someone handsome. But...

59
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:32,440
you should look for someone with a good education and a stable career

60
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,080
and from a decent family background, too.

61
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,560
But I just returned to Ningsui.

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,780
You don't need to rush me into marriage right away, right?

63
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,660
Of course, I'm in a rush.

64
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,880
You're the Ye family's only precious granddaughter.

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,940
- How could I not be in a rush? 
 - Aren't you going to urge Auntie?

66
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,168
All right. Mom, stop it. Meng Meng already knows it.

67
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:52,280
Let's go. She'll get annoyed if we talk too much.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
This new car...

69
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,160
Meng Meng, this is your new car, right?

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,920
So cool!

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,600
You can't park it here. Move it over there later.

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,380
Mom, it's almost our restaurant reservation time.

73
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,620
Let's go eat. Hurry up.

74
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,520
Come on, let's go to the restaurant.

75
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,920
Sorry about calling you a repairman earlier.

76
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,740
My family keeps pushing me to get married.

77
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,880
I didn't want them to overact and bother you.

78
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,820
It's fine. I am a repairman after all.

79
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,840
Why do you sound so sarcastic?

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,780
Are you jealous of Dr. Gao?

81
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,600
Li Jin Yu, you're more than just a repairman. You're useful in many ways.

82
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,660
For a stunning single woman like me,

83
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,760
shouldn't you protect me and guard my home?

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,560
Are you talking about me or Ping An?

85
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,580
What do you mean? I'm not an outsider.

86
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm your dearest neighbor.

87
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,760
Look around. Only our two families live here.

88
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,040
We lonely souls depend on each other.

89
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,420
Shouldn't you protect me properly?

90
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,180
Fine.

91
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,840
Why pack up before finishing repairs?

92
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,070
I'm buying surveillance cameras for someone's home security.

93
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,528
I'm coming too.

94
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,260
Always keeping a straight face.

95
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,760
Are you deaf? Can't you hear me?

96
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,860
Let's meet at the entrance later.

97
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:27,720
   

98
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,020
Sir, we'd like to see the cameras.

99
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,860
Take your time.

100
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,840
Let's pick this one. It looks nice.

101
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,300
Functionality matters more than appearance.

102
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
Who says good-looking ones lack functions?

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,720
This seems perfectly fine.

104
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,380
It's an indoor camera. It won't work outside.

105
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,480
This one might work.

106
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,188
This one? It's big with high resolution.

107
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:55,240
It's our bestseller. Want one?

108
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,060
- Okay, we'll take this. 
 - Great, I'll wrap it up.

109
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,600
Little Ba Dou with overseas experience knows tech?

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,240
Can you tell me what you did abroad?

111
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,360
So nosy. Doing a background check?

112
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,000
Why'd such a handsome guy have to get a mouth?

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,280
- Are you done? 
 - Done. 620 yuan.

114
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,660
- That's so expensive. 
 - I gave you a 20 percent discount.

115
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,280
- Payment's done. 
 - Take care.

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,720
Since you helped me shop, I will treat you to dinner.

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,680
I should be off duty now.

118
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,920
What about off-duty hours?

119
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,260
Do I need to pay you for treating you to a meal?

120
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,380
Fine. Consider this a business dinner with me.

121
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,920
I'll pay as usual. You pick the restaurant, okay?

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,080
Thanks, boss. I'll choose an expensive one then.

123
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,540
   

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,380
No need to save money for me like this.

125
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,260
Let's make it quick. I have other work tonight.

126
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,380
You're such a workaholic.

127
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,700
Tasty, right?

128
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,820
- Sir, one satay noodles to go. 
 - Coming right up.

129
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,380
Mai Mai?

130
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,020
Brother, Sister Ye Meng? Why are you two together?

131
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,920
- I invited— 
 - Coincidence.

132
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,420
- Coincidence. 
 - She invited me.

133
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,700
Actually, I hired your brother part-time with good pay.

134
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,820
We're having a working dinner.

135
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Office romance on company funds? Got it.

136
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,700
- Looking for a spanking? 
 - Blah, blah, blah.

137
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,924
Sister, tomorrow's the Fishing Lantern Festival.

138
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:44,200
This year is the final year. You two should go together.

139
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,260
- I want to go. 
 - Brother?

140
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,580
Your noodles are ready. Hurry up and leave.

141
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,000
Brother, you're 27. Time to have a girlfriend.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,340
Just go. Go, go, go.

143
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,600
- I'm leaving. 
 - Bye.

144
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Mr. Li, how about you work overtime tomorrow and spend the festival with me?

145
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,020
I'm not going.

146
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,240
Money's hard to earn nowadays. Think about it.

147
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,844
The noodles will get soggy. Eat up.

148
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,432
Try some.

149
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,780
   

150
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,000
Brother Jin Yu, did your hand heal okay last time?

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,900
It's fine.

152
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,580
Hi, Sister. We met at my brother's bar last time.

153
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,080
I haven't officially greeted you yet. I'm Cheng Jing Jing.

154
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,900
I'm Ye Meng.

155
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,320
- What brings you here? 
 - I've been looking for you. Why ignore me?

156
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,680
Winter break's short. I need your tutoring.

157
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,820
Tutoring?

158
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,020
You're in high school?

159
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,120
No, I'm in college now. I just got admitted to Nanhu University this year.

160
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,980
- That's a great university. You're really outstanding. 
 - You're very pretty.

161
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,560
- Thank you. 
 - I've been quite busy lately.

162
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,360
Besides, you’re already accepted into university. I’ve nothing left to tutor you.

163
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,100
Then, let's meet up for tomorrow's Fishing Lantern Festival. We can take a stroll together.

164
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,040
It's settled then.

165
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,340
- Bye-bye, Sister. 
 - Bye.

166
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,400
Mr. Li, your schedule is packed, huh?

167
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,800
True. I also need to install surveillance for you.

168
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,500
The rules changed. You have to stay through the festival with me.

169
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,600
Not afraid of being a vulnerable woman anymore?

170
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
Your eyes are more reliable than cameras.

171
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,800
With you as my neighbor, I fear nothing.

172
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,788
Dress handsomely tomorrow.

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,600
Hurry up. The Fishing Lantern Festival has started.

174
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,484
- Okay. 
 - Hurry.

175
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,120
   

176
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,740
I didn't expect you to actually come.

177
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,600
It's my first time seeing you in white. You look good.

178
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,480
Thanks.

179
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,380
- What about me? How do I look? 
 - Good.

180
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,840
Do the clothes look good or do I?

181
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:25,736
The clothes look good.

182
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:28,520
So stubborn, huh? 
    

183
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,240
Brother Jin Yu, you're here.

184
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,140
Do I look good in this?

185
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,040
Sorry Jing Jing, I already have plans today.

186
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,020
Go home early to rest after you're done.

187
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,140
We'll take our leave first.

188
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,740
What's this, Li Jin Yu? Using me as an excuse?

189
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,020
Didn't you use me as an excuse, too?

190
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,200
Your hand-holding posture is wrong.

191
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,620
We don't look like a real couple. It should be like this.

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,620
What are you doing? She can see us.

193
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,940
Do you know why Ningsui has the Fishing Lantern Festival?

194
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,360
No.

195
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,768
There was a fisherman long ago.

196
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:34,920
His wife waited here every day when he went fishing.

197
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,960
One day, the fisherman never returned.

198
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,700
So, she transformed into a lighthouse.

199
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,020
And every returning ship lights a lantern

200
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,900
to tell their wives, "I'm back."

201
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,180
So, you know the story.

202
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,360
It's very moving, right?

203
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes, but it's just a legend.

204
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
Why are you so emotionally dense?

205
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,480
Brother and Sister Ye Meng, you're officially dating?

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,276
- No. 
 - Just work duties.

207
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:14,328
- Right, he's on duty. 
 - Got it. So it's a publicly funded romance?

208
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:15,820
All right, stop being shy.

209
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,920
Hurry up and pick a fishing lantern for Sister Ye Meng.

210
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
Your family truly values hard work.

211
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,000
You can never earn too much money.

212
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,640
Hurry up. All right, take one.

213
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,480
Sister Ye Meng, I'll pick a pink one for you.

214
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,220
Okay, thanks.

215
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,220
Take a wishing plaque too.

216
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,880
Fu, grab another one for me.

217
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,460
Think about your wishes.

218
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,360
Silently repeat your wishes while writing your names on these.

219
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,980
- Okay. 
 - My dear future sister-in-law,

220
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,600
how about making your move on my brother tonight?

221
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,720
Qiao Mai Mai.

222
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,900
Dear koi fish,

223
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,980
I wish to meet a perfectly handsome younger guy.

224
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,860
Not too flirtatious and not overly clingy.

225
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,960
A little clinginess is okay, just not excessive.

226
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,880
Most importantly, he should be easy to pursue.

227
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:08,960
   

228
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,820
What are you doing? Write it down.

229
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,120
Say your wish out loud.

230
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,660
Then, I'll wish for all your dreams to come true.

231
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,580
Thank you.

232
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,300
- Your brother's so selfless. 
 - Yeah.

233
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:27,012
   

234
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,216
   

235
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:31,060
   

236
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,840
Done.

237
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,620
Here you are.

238
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,740
- Excuse me? 
 - Coming.

239
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,320
Sorry, these are all my stalls.

240
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,420
Go ahead.

241
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,740
Sir, buy a flower for your girlfriend.

242
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,840
She's not my girlfriend.

243
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,600
- He's not my boyfriend either. Thanks. 
 - No problem.

244
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,880
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

245
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,240
Li Jin Yu, you're really something.

246
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Cold to me now because you don't need me anymore?

247
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,080
So quick to draw boundaries with me?

248
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,240
Fine, I'll hold a grudge.

249
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,200
I'll start noting down your habits now.

250
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,596
Li Jin Yu doesn't like buying flowers for girls.

251
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,576
Enough. Let's go watch fireworks.

252
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:13,260
Secondly, you love watching fireworks with girls.

253
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,200
When my notebook gets filled up,

254
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,520
will my wishes come true?

255
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,240
Li Jin Yu, could you at least respond when I'm talking to you?

256
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,720
Have you gone deaf? Hey!

257
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,820
I'm quite a handful.

258
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,220
I'm afraid you'll lose interest while taking notes.

259
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,360
It's fine. I'm very patient.

260
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,160
It's so lively here.

261
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,620
Is it livelier than Jiangbei?

262
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,460
The liveliness in Jiangbei felt fake to me.

263
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,420
But here it's different. It feels genuine.

264
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:26,276
 I used to desperately want to stay in Jiangbei. 

265
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,116
 I didn't know who I needed to prove myself to 

266
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:35,336
 and was afraid others would find me inadequate. 

267
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:40,200
But after coming back, I found freedom.

268
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,100
It happened in an instant.

269
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,960
Which instant?

270
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,880
Why do you like watching fireworks?

271
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,020
Maybe I like the loneliness they radiate when blooming.

272
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,580
Even if it's loneliness, feeling occasional warmth is enough.

273
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,860
Mr. Li, coming to work at my place so early?

274
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,700
You're really overachieving.

275
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,420
- Give me your phone. 
 - What for?

276
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,840
Want to take my photo because I'm too pretty?

277
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,656
To install an app to check surveillance footage.

278
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:22,060
You're so lacking in humor.

279
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,836
Okay, here you go.

280
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,268
Okay.

281
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,480
- All set. 
 - Thanks.

282
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,808
Li Jin Yu.

283
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,200
Ye Meng?

284
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,100
Finally noticed me?

285
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,560
Thought your sunglasses made you blind.

286
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,370
You two know each other?

287
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,128
This town's small. Is us knowing each other strange?

288
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,100
So, it was you who told him I had a boyfriend in Jiangbei?

289
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,340
Did you get back at me because of Gou Kai?

290
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,360
You overestimated yourself.

291
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,840
I simply thought two-timing made you trashy.

292
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
How considerate of you.

293
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,040
We grew up together. Don't you know me?

294
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,740
My people can't get bullied.

295
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,520
Kid, enjoy catching up with your ex.

296
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,400
Don't hold back on claiming emotional damages.

297
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,300
I think I lost more from you.

298
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,100
We'll talk about it later.

299
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,160
You're really not going back to Jiangbei?

300
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,280
Gou Kai asked me to tell you that if you want to return,

301
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,740
he'll personally fetch you after the New Year.

302
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,520
You can't stay here forever.

303
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,860
Don't start studying yet. Play for a while.

304
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,760
Hello, what's up?

305
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,160
Jiang Lu Zhi is back.

306
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,000
What?

307
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,460
Come to my place right now.

308
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,060
Anyway, that's what happened.

309
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,640
I never expected her to impulsively quit.

310
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,620
I also didn't expect... Thanks.

311
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,880
I also didn't expect she'd misinterpret that I used connections to steal her job.

312
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,160
I couldn't properly explain things over the phone that night.

313
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,980
So, I decided to come back and talk face-to-face.

314
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,160
So, you two never really got along

315
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,560
all because of that Gou Kai guy?

316
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,700
Did she tell you that?

317
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,400
No wonder you mistakenly thought I was secretly dating someone new.

318
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,640
This might sound unbelievable, but I'm completely innocent here.

319
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,600
Gou Kai and I have always maintained a strictly professional relationship.

320
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,300
There's never been anything between us.

321
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,360
The one he likes is Ye Meng.

322
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
After all, Ye Meng's been working with him since graduation.

323
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,600
They've built the company together from scratch.

324
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,880
Their bond is beyond ordinary understanding.

325
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,220
- When he first recruited me— 
 - You don't need to explain this to me.

326
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,260
Our relationship was just temporary acting anyway.

327
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,500
What about Ye Meng? You seem close with her.

328
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,440
What's your relationship with her?

329
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,780
That's none of your business.

330
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,160
She seems rather interested in you.

331
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,960
Does she like you?

332
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,940
I'm not sure.

333
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,860
Let me tell you. You do like him.

334
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,140
Why else would you get so nervous when Jiang Lu Zhi returned?

335
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,896
I wasn't nervous. I was worried she'd spread rumors and ruin my reputation.

336
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:29,280
Do you know what they've started calling me since she joined the company?

337
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,980
What?

338
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,440
They nicknamed me "Sleeping Beauty."

339
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:39,220
What?

340
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,320
One thing puzzles me.

341
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,576
Is Gou Kai blind or something?

342
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,800
When it comes to tactics, Jiang Lu Zhi outdoes you completely.

343
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,620
But looks-wise? You're 18 times better than her.

344
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,020
Didn't he use to like you before?

345
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,880
How did he end up with Jiang Lu Zhi then?

346
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,400
Stop glorifying him. He didn't like me.

347
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,020
He just wanted some adult-style ambiguity.

348
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,380
Guys like Gou Kai need constant attention from everyone.

349
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,540
After I joined the company, he kept dragging me to social events every day,

350
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,220
saying it would broaden my horizons and keep up with the company's growth.

351
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,400
When I refused, he brought in Jiang Lu Zhi to provoke me.

352
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,940
That's pure emotional manipulation.

353
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:21,220
So, will you go back?

354
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,700
I mean, do you plan to return to Jiangbei?

355
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,540
You worked so hard to stay in Jiangbei before.

356
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,020
What are you thinking now?

357
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,780
Are you really giving up and staying here?

358
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,780
There's no way she'll stay in Ningsui.

359
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,820
Even if she likes you, it's just a fling.

360
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,780
She has three aunts in her family

361
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,980
and an old-fashioned grandmother still clinging to their glorious past.

362
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,100
If you marry her, even your children will carry the Ye surname.

363
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,100
- Are you really okay with that? 
 - Yes, I am.

364
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,520
Her family has good social standing. That's not necessarily a bad thing.

365
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,800
Do you know her mother committed suicide during her college entrance exam year?

366
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,080
Her father moved abroad after that.

367
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,600
He's barely returned in all these years.

368
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,940
Are you sure you can fit into such a complicated family?

369
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
No problem.

370
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,940
Not having to live with a father-in-law sounds great.

371
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,600
Fine, you're so optimistic.

372
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,780
When we were first introduced, we already had an understanding.

373
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,280
You are not interested in me, and I don't like you.

374
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,960
We just cooperated to satisfy our parents. It's a mutual arrangement.

375
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,468
Men.

376
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,260
Li Jin Yu, would you still break up with me if Ye Meng didn't show up?

377
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,880
Of course, he wouldn't.

378
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,700
With his zombie-like attitude, if I don't push him...

379
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,496
Eat.

380
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,880
He'd still be hung up on Jiang Lu Zhi.

381
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,844
It's not that bad.

382
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,880
What are they talking about for so long?

383
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,040
They haven't come out yet.

384
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,740
You know what they say.

385
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,640
70% of men have lingering feelings for ex-girlfriends.

386
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,500
That's normal.

387
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,560
What's there to miss about an ex who kept him as backup?

388
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,180
At this rate, I could finish an exam paper waiting for them.

389
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,600
Look at your expression now.

390
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,460
You claim you don't like him?

391
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,720
Even if they're doing something now,

392
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,800
what's that to you? Who are you to him now?

393
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,200
You're just a neighbor peeping through your security camera to spy on others.

394
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,320
I'll ask for you.

395
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,580
Just be direct. No big deal. I'll help.

396
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,600
 Sister Ya En, do you need something? 

397
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,940
I don't need anything.

398
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,520
It's just that Meng Meng worries some femme fatale might entrap you.

399
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,080
 So, she asked me to check on you. 

400
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,736
Hurry.

401
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,360
Satisfied now?

402
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:26,600
What do I have to be satisfied with? It's not me looking for you.

403
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,460
It's Ya En looking for you.

404
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,360
It's me looking for you. Or rather, my son is looking for you.

405
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,600
Jia Yu, didn't you just struggle with that Olympic math problem?

406
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,360
Ask this young man here. He can help.

407
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,220
- I didn't. 
 - Come here.

408
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,040
- There's an Olympic math problem I'm struggling with. 
 - Right? See?

409
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,044
Come on, help him.

410
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,700
Which problem can't you solve, Jia Yu?

411
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,140
- Which one? 
 - This one.

412
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,220
I can't figure out this problem.

413
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,600
Let me take a look.

414
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,328
If they're not first grade, they're works from second grade and other grades.

415
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:21,840
 And if they're not second grade's, they're works from first grade and other grades. 

416
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,120
 By adding them together, 

417
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,360
 you'll get twice the first-grade works plus second-grade works plus other grades' works. 

418
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,740
 21 plus 28 equals 49 pieces. 

419
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,180
 Twice the number of other grades' works. 

420
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,280
You're staring so hard your eyes might fall in.

421
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,520
 Subtract 13 to get 36 pieces. 

422
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,320
 So, the total for other grades' works is 

423
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,600
 36 divided by 2, which equals 18 pieces. 

424
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,840
 Now let's verify if this result is accurate. 

425
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,280
 Let's assume the number of first-grade works is A, 

426
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,540
 the number of second-grade works is B, and the number of other grades' works is C... 

427
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,980
   

428
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:09,460
Take a look. 
    

429
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,320
Wow, she's super beautiful, isn't she?

430
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,880
- Absolutely beautiful. 
 - Why don't you all head over first?

431
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,580
- Okay. 
 - This way, please.

432
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,980
You two are still together?

433
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,872
We actually got married. Didn't you know?

434
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:24,940
- You haven't given us a red packet yet. 
 - Right.

435
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,280
- Congratulations. 
 - Ye Meng's here.

436
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,520
- Thanks. 
 - Thank you.

437
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,180
Look at your voluminous crown. How many clip-ins did it take?

438
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,320
Not too many. About as many as yours.

439
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,360
Am I seeing right? You've been competing since childhood.

440
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,600
- Now you're appearing together today. 
 - How rare.

441
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,700
That's why they say our class president has great influence.

442
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
Even Mr. Jiang is here.

443
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,880
I heard the South Coast project is yours too. That's impressive.

444
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,180
Mr. Chen, stop teasing me.

445
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,060
I'm just a regular office worker.

446
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,140
I'll need to cling to your coattails in the future.

447
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,260
You're too modest.

448
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,960
Among our old classmates, are you two the only ones still unmarried?

449
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,428
Mr. Jiang is busy. It's understandable.

450
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:08,980
What about you, Ye Meng?

451
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,140
Women should have babies before getting too old, right?

452
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,080
- Don't just keep fooling around. 
 - Is that so?

453
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,260
Lu Zhi, he says you're too old.

454
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,360
If you love kids so much, why not become a postpartum nanny?

455
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
You'll earn money and have care for children.

456
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,180
Those failed relationships around me make me sick.

457
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,340
I'd rather get a dog than marry someone like you.

458
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,460
Enough. We're all old classmates.

459
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,560
Let's all calm down a bit.

460
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,700
I heard you had a boyfriend before.

461
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,400
Who? Do we know him?

462
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,740
His family member is hospitalized. He's busy at the hospital.

463
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,560
I'll call him later to see if he can come.

464
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,400
- Bring him over to meet us. 
 - Yeah.

465
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,360
Stop crowding around gossiping about me.

466
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,520
Look, our class beauty is standing alone.

467
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,672
I'm leaving.

468
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,940
She's still the same.

469
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,660
- How have you been? 
 - I'm doing all right.

470
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,280
Now that you broke up with Xiao Jiang and ended the long-distance relationship,

471
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,220
doesn't that mean you're single now?

472
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,780
Look how happy that couple is.

473
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,080
Now look at you. And look at me.

474
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,940
This old woman has no one to chat with.

475
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,360
Am I not human to you?

476
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,940
I'm a dog. I'm Ping An.

477
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,060
I wish you were a dog.

478
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,540
Then, you'd obey every word I say.

479
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,460
Why don't you try dating Xiao Ye?

480
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,080
She seems nice.

481
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,520
She's generous, cheerful, and socially savvy.

482
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,120
Perfect match for someone as tight-lipped as you.

483
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,100
That's enough.

484
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:55,740
   

485
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,764
What is she calling you? I thought you two broke up already.

486
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,020
Here.

487
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,020
What do you need?

488
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,640
 Didn't you perform at that bar before? 

489
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,280
My classmate's wedding performer canceled last minute.

490
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,700
Are you interested?

491
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,340
- I don't have time. 
 - You do.

492
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,360
Dr. Gao, they're all over there.

493
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,060
- Go ahead. I'm talking on the phone. 
 - Okay, take your time.

494
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,780
Stop overthinking. Hurry up.

495
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,752
Listen, you need to cut all ties with Xiao Jiang.

496
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,840
- Do you hear me? 
 - Stop worrying so much.

497
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,500
I'm leaving.

498
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,360
Honored guests, dear friends and family, now the groom, Zhou Yue Fei,

499
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,700
and bride, Dai Lin, has entered the wedding venue.

500
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,260
I want to ask everyone with the warmest applause

501
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,160
to invite the groom to express his love for the bride.

502
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,040
- How does that sound? 
 - Yes!

503
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,128
Kiss! Kiss!

504
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,840
Who do you think will get married first, you or me?

505
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,600
Seriously? You want to compete over this, too?

506
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,280
Stop pretending.

507
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,040
We used to compete over who could hold their pee longer.

508
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,500
That was kindergarten stuff.

509
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,620
Exactly. Our rivalry has lasted longer than any friendship.

510
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,160
I know your little schemes better than Fang Ya En does.

511
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,240
The only reason you liked Li Jin Yu was that he was my boyfriend.

512
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,120
They had eight kids, right?

513
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,780
Don't you have Gou Kai?

514
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,160
Trying to be a master of management with two men in both the north and the south?

515
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,120
I said those things on purpose before.

516
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,920
Gou Kai and I were never actually together.

517
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,700
At most, we had some ambiguous tension.

518
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,740
But when it comes to tactics, I still can't match you.

519
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,300
You kept Gou Kai in Jiangbei,

520
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,420
then hooked up with Li Jin Yu immediately after returning to your hometown here.

521
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,400
And this Dr. Gao, too.

522
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,840
Dr. Gao meets your Ye family's standards for a son-in-law.

523
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,080
And he's completely devoted to you.

524
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,380
So, please stay away from my boyfriend from now on.

525
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,800
Your boyfriend? Has he agreed to that?

526
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,500
Let's send our blessings to the newlyweds.

527
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,300
You can guess.

528
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,980
As the bride's best friend, I must tell the groom.

529
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,888
Congratulations on finding this treasure.

530
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:31,380
Please cherish and protect her from now on.

531
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,400
Become her eternal safe harbor.

532
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,260
None of wealth, status, and age

533
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,260
can compare to someone who'll always wait behind you,

534
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,540
ready whenever you turn around.

535
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,860
Now, let's have the bride and groom exchange rings.

536
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,600
Let's welcome the adorable flower children.

537
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,200
Please all stand and offer your blessings.

538
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,090
Ye Meng.

539
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,020
- What a coincidence. 
 - What a coincidence.

540
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,660
You are...

541
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,880
I'm the groom's university classmate.

542
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,000
It is quite a coincidence.

543
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:16,260
I liked you when we met last time.

544
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,140
I know you don't like arranged meetings.

545
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,400
Let's start as friends.

546
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,624
We're already friends.

547
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,020
Hurry up.

548
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,660
Hurry up.

549
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,000
You actually came.

550
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,460
Why are you drinking alone?

551
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,404
None of your business.

552
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,400
Want to get some fresh air?

553
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,400
These reunions get more boring every year.

554
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,520
We're drifting apart, and gathering now is just forced conversation,

555
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,180
trying to gossip about privacy or scandals.

556
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,540
We literally have nothing in common anymore.

557
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,100
You sound like you particularly dislike Ningsui.

558
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,560
Then, why force yourself to come back?

559
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,400
It's an old topic.

560
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,100
It's hard to stay in Jiangbei or return to my hometown.

561
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll take that as genuine.

562
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,780
But I don't believe it's the real reason.

563
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,400
What about you? Why choose to live in Ningsui?

564
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,760
Seems like you don't fit in here at all.

565
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,900
Faking it must be exhausting.

566
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,564
But speaking of which,

567
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:13,580
did you come here today because of me?

568
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,840
I'm just here for part-time cash.

569
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,740
Meanwhile, you left your blind date there all alone and ran out with me.

570
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,280
- Is this appropriate? 
 - Aren't you the same?

571
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,440
Your ex-girlfriend is right there.

572
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,340
Hello?

573
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,320
 Jin Yu, it's me. 

574
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,340
 You didn't answer my previous calls. 

575
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,420
 So, I'm calling from a different number. 

576
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,200
 I'm sick. Seriously ill. 

577
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,740
 I need you to come to Jiangbei. 

578
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,170
 No matter what, Jin Yu, you're my son. 

579
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,732
Son?

580
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,880
Are you okay?

581
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,980
Was that your mom?

582
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,680
You should stop meddling.

583
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,040
You're really strange.

584
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,320
You switch moods so abruptly.

585
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,980
Ye Meng, I know you're just playing with me.

586
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,540
But if your savior complex is acting up, go find someone else to save.

587
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,480
You want to play? Fine.

588
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,360
Let's play now. Come to my room.

589
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,480
- Excuse me. I'd like a beer. 
 - Okay.

590
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,040
Weren't we going to your room? Why are we here?

591
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,900
You're crazy? And you need liquid courage?

592
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,060
What are you thinking? I'm setting the mood.

593
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,980
You don't get it at all.

594
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,500
Beer's so boring.

595
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,860
- Excuse me. Can I have a cup of that? 
 - Sure.

596
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,388
Thank you.

597
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,800
What's this?

598
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,964
It's the bar's specialty.

599
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:34,371
It's called the "Absent-Minded" cocktail.

600
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,000
Scared to try it?

601
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,976
What's there to be scared of?

602
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,512
Not bad actually.

603
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,060
Bring me that whole row, please. Thanks.

604
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,336
Enjoy.

605
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,360
We'll take that row too, please.

606
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,900
You should drink less.

607
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,540
This is pretty strong. Have some water.

608
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,060
- Get me some water. 
 - Okay.

609
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,260
- Thanks. 
 - You're welcome.

610
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,500
I'm sorry about earlier.

611
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,620
I didn't control my emotions well.

612
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,960
I know you meant well.

613
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:23,320
Li Jin Yu, why do you control your feelings?

614
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,440
I wish you'd stop limiting yourself with rules.

615
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,960
Sometimes you should let loose.

616
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,340
Not everyone has that privilege.

617
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,380
Li Jin Yu.

618
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,980
If anyone ever says you don't have that privilege,

619
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,840
send them to me!

620
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:10,220

 'You' - Xia Heng 

647
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,812
♫  You  ♫

648
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:05,288
♫  The moment I see you  ♫

649
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:08,303
♫  The moment I think of you  ♫

650
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:15,004
♫  The moment I hear any news of you  ♫

651
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:20,924
♫  My heart is touched  ♫

652
00:45:20,924 --> 00:45:25,084
♫  My mind is occupied  ♫

653
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:27,548
♫  Go  ♫

654
00:45:27,548 --> 00:45:29,664
♫  Where to go?  ♫

655
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:33,592
♫  How to escape?  ♫

656
00:45:33,592 --> 00:45:39,676
♫  Those memories of you  ♫

657
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:43,644
♫  They have drowned me  ♫

658
00:45:43,644 --> 00:45:49,660
♫  I can't let go  ♫

659
00:45:51,008 --> 00:45:54,080
♫  I remain silent  ♫

660
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,464
♫  My words stuck in my throat  ♫

661
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:03,644
♫  Maybe this will end the sorrow  ♫

662
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:07,828
♫  Pretending to be determined  ♫

663
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:13,752
♫  I'm still trapped at the starting point  ♫

664
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:18,689
♫  The most perfect lie  ♫

665
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:21,645
♫  I even deceived myself  ♫

666
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:28,312
♫  If love means letting go, let's sever all connections  ♫

667
00:46:28,312 --> 00:46:30,956
♫  But why...  ♫

668
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:34,076
♫  The moment tears fall  ♫

669
00:46:34,076 --> 00:46:38,929
♫  I don't want you to leave  ♫
