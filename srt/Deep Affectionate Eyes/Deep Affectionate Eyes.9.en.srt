2
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Come on. Let's go.

3
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,080
Can we wait a little?

4
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,080
- Why?
- Mom asked Ms. Ye to pick me up.

5
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,080
It's because Dad came home.

6
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
She doesn't want me to see them fighting.

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,120
You're unbelievable.

8
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,640
Fine, you mess around with Ye Meng.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,440
But you let her look after Jiayu?

10
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,040
You're not worried she'll ruin him?

11
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,520
I'm warning you.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Stop criticizing Ye Meng.

13
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,040
Can't you see she's not normal?

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,560
I don't want my kid growing up wrong.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
She's not normal? Look at yourself.

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,160
And stop using my son to threaten me.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm not threatening you.

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,880
I just think the only way left
is for us to get back together.

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,560
Give Jiayu a complete family.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
That's what's best for him, right?

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,760
You're ridiculous.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,880
That's your idea of talking nicely?

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm talking to you! Are you deaf?

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,000
Chen Jian,

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
do you really not remember what you did?

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,640
Do you not remember

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,600
why I divorced you?

28
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,120
You laid hands on me!

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
The moment you raised your hand,

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,800
our marriage was finished.

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,880
I was wrong, but I've changed.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,120
If you hadn't pushed me just now,
I wouldn't have reacted.

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Don't you dare touch me!

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm used to it.

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,800
Every time they meet, they fight.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
Enough already.

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,080
Even if we're divorced,

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,960
custody of my son will still be mine.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,800
- In your dreams!
- Who are you pointing at?

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,200
Go on. Point again!

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm talking to you. Can't you answer?

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,480
Try laying a finger on her again!

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,080
What…

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,840
You again.

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,280
Fang Ya'en, we're not even divorced yet,

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,600
and you're already fooling around
with this punk?

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,040
You're asking for a beating
with that mouth of yours.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,160
What? I ask for a beating?

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm here to see my wife and my son.

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,720
- I ask for a beating?
- What?

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,880
- You see with your hands now?
- None of your business.

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,200
- Seeing with your hands, huh?
- Don't…

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,160
Dad.

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Don't fight.

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,920
Son, you're back.

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
Dad, if you want to see me,

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
just call me.

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,440
Mom bought me a phone watch.

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
I can call or video chat.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
- Alright.
- Then it's settled.

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,600
Next time, call me directly.

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,040
I'll come back again.

63
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,560
You okay?

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,000
OPEN, WELCOME

65
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,560
- Did that scare you, sweetheart?
- Not at all.

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,960
You've been fighting for years.
I'm used to it.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Why are you here?

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,160
Ye Meng and Li Jinyu went out on a date,

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,800
so I brought Jiayu back first.

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,360
She said you hadn't eaten.
He hadn't either.

71
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,120
So, we picked up your favorites.

72
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
I'll get going.

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,440
Stay and eat with us.

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,880
Yes, stay.

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,839
Come on.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,440
Let's see what goodies we've got.

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,520
He said it's all your favorites.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,320
Really? Thanks.

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
Come on.

80
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,000
327-3 XINGYI ROAD
OCEAN BLUE BAY PHASE III NOW LEASING

81
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,560
I am home now.

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,040
Get some rest.

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,000
You're not coming in?

84
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,280
We just hung out at my place.

85
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,240
Now what? Hang out at yours too
when it's only 50 meters away?

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm starting to think

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,240
you've got another motive here.

88
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,480
Li Jinyu, what are you talking about?

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,280
You think that's all I ever think about?

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
Isn't it?

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,440
Sure. You know me so well, babe.

92
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,480
Come on.

93
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,080
- Go to bed early.
- Cold-blooded.

94
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,000
- Get back in.
- Heartless.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,080
- Three.
- Irrational.

96
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,560
- Two.
- This is our very first day together!

97
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,560
One.

98
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,360
Fine, I'm leaving now. Bye.

99
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,520
Alright, stop pouting.

100
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,840
Goodnight.

101
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,480
Goodnight.

102
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,600
327-4 XINGYI ROAD

103
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,320
Goodnight.

104
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
Goodnight.

105
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
And no staying up late.

106
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,760
Goodnight.

107
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Goodnight.

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,360
NINGSUI SEAFOOD

109
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,520
Time for bed.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,080
Long day, huh? You must be exhausted.

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,960
Jiayu…

112
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,160
Your dad and I

113
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,680
had some disagreements today.

114
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,520
It got a little rough.

115
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,240
But that doesn't change how much
we both love you. You understand?

116
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,960
So, don't let it make you unhappy, okay?

117
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,840
Mom, if you're happy, I'm happy.

118
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,680
With you around, I'm always happy.

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,200
Mom, I'm sleepy.

120
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,560
I want to go to bed.

121
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
Then close your eyes.

122
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
- He's asleep?
- Out like a light.

123
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,160
You heading home now?

124
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,840
NINGSUI SEAFOOD

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,880
Cheers.

126
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,880
Slow down, Ya'en.
You've already finished a whole bottle.

127
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,159
I can hold my liquor.

128
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,840
Besides,

129
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,799
mothers don't really get drunk.

130
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,960
Because the second
you think of your child,

131
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,840
you can't.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,040
Go on. Pour me another.

133
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
What's with you?

134
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,840
It's Ye Meng, isn't it?

135
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,320
I know her better than anyone.

136
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
Back then…

137
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
it wasn't that she didn't
want to save you…

138
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
It's not about Ye Meng.

139
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,600
I only

140
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,280
see her as a friend now.

141
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,520
That's good then.

142
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,520
Friends are good to have.

143
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,240
Here.

144
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,640
To leaving the past

145
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,960
where it belongs.

146
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,200
And what about you?

147
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Have you left yours behind?

148
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,920
Do you…

149
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,240
look down on me too?

150
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,640
I used to be the strong one
everyone looked up to.

151
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Now I've ended up like this.

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't even know how it happened.

153
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,760
How does someone start out whole

154
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
and end up so small inside a marriage?

155
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
You're not small.

156
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,760
You're just worn out.

157
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,880
What are you going to do

158
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,680
from here?

159
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,800
I don't know.

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,800
We have a child. I can't
keep Jiayu from seeing his father.

161
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
That's why marriage
has to be chosen carefully.

162
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,440
There's a saying I really believe in.

163
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,160
When you meet the right person,

164
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,520
even in hell,

165
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,240
he'll pull you back to life.

166
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,160
When it's the wrong person,

167
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,200
even in heaven, he'll torment you

168
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,120
and drag you into hell.

169
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,680
I just wasn't that lucky.

170
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,720
The day I dropped out of school,
I'd already taken the wrong turn.

171
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,400
So, running into the wrong man…

172
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,640
was only a matter of time.

173
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,640
<i>Ya'en!</i>

174
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,280
Kai.

175
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Ya'en,

176
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,160
why leave without a word?

177
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,600
School's pointless.

178
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm going out on my own.

179
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,120
What do you mean, just leaving?

180
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,680
What about the college entrance exam?

181
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,680
I quit school.

182
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,040
My grades were terrible anyway.

183
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
Instead of wasting time in Ningsui,

184
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,960
I'd rather get a job early,

185
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
build up some experience.

186
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Just finish the exam.
It's only one more semester.

187
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,760
With my grades, I won't get in anywhere.

188
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,280
I'm not like Ye Meng.

189
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
My family doesn't expect anything of me.

190
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,240
Might as well start working early

191
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,600
and take some pressure off them.

192
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
But if you leave,

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,400
what happens to the three of us?

194
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,720
If Ye Meng finds out,

195
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,520
- she'll try to stop you--
- She knows.

196
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,320
So, I'm the last to find out?

197
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,440
Am I even your friend?

198
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Kai.

199
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
You need to stop messing around.

200
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,200
Study hard. Don't waste your life.

201
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,480
Promise me.

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,320
Alright. I'm leaving.

203
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,360
What are you doing?

204
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,280
Uh… your mom.…

205
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,160
She just had too much to drink.

206
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,720
- I should go.
- Stop.

207
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,640
You like my mom, don't you?

208
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,160
Hey, don't talk nonsense.
How could I possibly like your mom?

209
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,560
I don't dislike you,

210
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,160
but my parents aren't divorced.

211
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,600
And I'm not ready for a new dad so soon.

212
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,880
You should think this through.
Don't rush it.

213
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,680
I'm not trying to be your new dad.

214
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,520
What's there to think about? I'm leaving.

215
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,680
Cover her with a blanket,

216
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,840
take off her shoes, and look after her.

217
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,000
- Wait.
- What now?

218
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Turn off the lights and lock the door.

219
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,240
Got it. Bossy kid.

220
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
Your light's busted.

221
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,040
That little brat…

222
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,840
Me, like his mom? Please.

223
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,000
Cheng Kairan

224
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
in love with Fang Ya'en?

225
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,680
Cheng Kairan in love with Fang Ya'en?

226
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,720
Could that even happen?

227
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,680
Ran,

228
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,280
could you really fall for Fang Ya'en?

229
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,000
After all these years?
Seriously? What a joke…

230
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,200
- Phone number ending in 1490?
- Right.

231
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,760
I'm your designated driver.

232
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
Put that in the back.

233
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,160
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

234
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,760
Lay a cloth down first.

235
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,200
- Maimai, over here.
- Sure.

236
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,200
Li, did Amy get her 50 grand?

237
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,680
Sent it first thing.

238
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,599
We're about to go live. Stay sharp.

239
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,680
- Looking good.
- Sit here, Maimai.

240
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,800
Try another pose.

241
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,600
‪Perfect.

242
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,280
- Get her a coffee.
- On it.

243
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,800
Sir, influencers really make this much?

244
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,040
You mean Amy?

245
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,600
She just went viral.
That was one ad split.

246
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,920
One ad pays that much?

247
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,800
It's not that much. She's got more coming.

248
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,600
By year's end,
she'll have several lined up.

249
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,200
Easily a few hundred thousand, guaranteed.

250
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,960
Thanks.

251
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,880
Sir, I don't want anything crazy.

252
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,320
I just want out of this small town.

253
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,080
I want to sing, be seen,

254
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,360
and have a stage of my own.

255
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
That's doable.

256
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,000
Training first.
Once you debut, the stage is yours.

257
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,360
Really?

258
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,800
How long will training take?

259
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,360
Depends on you,

260
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,680
but usually under two months.

261
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,640
Of course, there's a training fee.

262
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
- How much?
- A hundred thousand.

263
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,880
- That's huge.
- It's not.

264
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,800
You'll need training in posture, styling,

265
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,680
and voice.

266
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,000
Instructors cost money.

267
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,640
Then there's coaching
on brand deals and partnerships.

268
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,160
That's money too.

269
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,920
But once you hit
tens of millions of followers,

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,160
you'll earn it back in a couple of days.

271
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
So?

272
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,960
But I already borrowed 50,000.

273
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,200
I see. Think about it.

274
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,200
I've got work to do.

275
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,600
- Sir…
- During the livestream…

276
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,240
I'll do it.

277
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,040
Just help me get brand deals later.

278
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,840
Easy. But you have to work hard.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,520
I'll give it my all.

280
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,360
- Li, draft Maimai's contract.
- On it.

281
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,080
- Sit tight.
- Thank you.

282
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,400
I'll be busy for a bit.

283
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,800
During the livestream,
make sure the vibe is right.

284
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,960
- Okay?
- Got it.

285
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,320
For these two models,

286
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,160
watch the angles while they pose.

287
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,120
Should I check on your grandma?

288
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,320
Do you want to see my grandma,

289
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,280
or are you just dying to see your Dr. Gao?

290
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,480
Exactly.

291
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,320
I want to see

292
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,360
if he's doing alright without me.

293
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,120
Maybe he needs some comfort.

294
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,080
Go ahead.

295
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,920
Comfort him all you want.

296
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,320
And while you're at it, figure out
how you're going to comfort me tonight.

297
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,240
Well, well, look at you.

298
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,440
Learning how to fight back.

299
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,160
Ye Meng!

300
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,200
Maimai.

301
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,680
Wait. You two are together?

302
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,240
- What are you doing here?
- Came to see Grandma.

303
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,760
Hello, hello.

304
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,920
And you are?

305
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,360
My agent, Mr. Wang.

306
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,600
Mr. Wang, this is my cousin
and his girlfriend.

307
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,360
- No wonder. Good looks run in the family.
- Told you.

308
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,760
You on social media? I'll look you up.

309
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,040
We can collect half the slot fee now.

310
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,000
- Livestream revenue…
- We run an MCN.

311
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,760
We turn people into influencers.

312
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,040
With your looks,

313
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,640
you'd do great. Guaranteed money.
Ever thought about it?

314
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,040
Not interested.

315
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,400
Don't be so quick to shoot it down. Here.

316
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,960
Take my card.

317
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,840
Thank you.

318
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,640
Look us up. Our streamers
are pulling huge numbers.

319
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,120
We're not kids anymore.
Think we can still be influencers?

320
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,160
Wang, the brand representative
wants a word.

321
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,480
I've gotta take this.

322
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,200
If you need anything, call me.

323
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,840
- Maimai, I won't keep you.
- Alright, sir.

324
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,520
Amy? Yeah, yeah, Amy.

325
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,360
- Of course.
- Focus on your job.

326
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
Stop chasing pipe dreams.

327
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,360
Not your problem.

328
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,120
Okay, it's settled. Alright.

329
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,240
Perfect.

330
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,120
Grandma, how are you feeling?

331
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,640
You can come visit anytime.

332
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,160
You don't have to bring me gifts.

333
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,200
You don't even earn money yet.

334
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,920
- No gifts next time.
- It's fine.

335
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,040
I'm about to start
making money, you'll see.

336
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,520
Doing what?

337
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
Give me your phone. I need a slash.

338
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,400
Okay, okay, I'll do it.

339
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Hurry. Check how much is left.

340
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,480
- Got it.
- Grandma.

341
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,600
Yeah?

342
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,440
Granny.

343
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,120
Hi.

344
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,600
My granddaughter-in-law is here!

345
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,640
I'm not dreaming, am I?

346
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,800
You two are together now?

347
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,960
Li Badou suggested it.

348
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,320
Finally. Took you long enough.

349
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,520
Seeing you two together

350
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,480
makes me so happy.

351
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,880
Don't move. Let me take a picture.

352
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,520
- Grandma…
- Here.

353
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,440
Turn this way.

354
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,400
Perfect.

355
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,920
So pretty.

356
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,680
Doesn't even need Photoshop.

357
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,080
I love it.

358
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,520
A match made in heaven.
Thick as thieves, the two of you.

359
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,520
Just perfect together.

360
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,160
Lucky she didn't say

361
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
we're partners in crime.

362
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,400
Oh, right. My flower garden…

363
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,240
Someone wants to rent it.

364
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,000
Go home and grab my business license

365
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
from the nightstand.

366
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,400
Bring it to me.

367
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,160
I thought you wanted to grow it yourself.
Why rent it out now?

368
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,200
Someone made me an offer
The price was good.

369
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,200
Fifty grand a year.

370
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,000
Two hundred grand over four years.

371
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,960
Weddings cost money.

372
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Having kids costs money.

373
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,480
Right?

374
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,680
Kids? Not happening.

375
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,760
Don't be silly.

376
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,120
It's fine.

377
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,920
If your body struggles,

378
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,720
just take some medicine.

379
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,720
You'll be fine.

380
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,240
What nonsense. I'm not having kids
because I don't plan to.

381
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,400
Stop laughing.

382
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,600
- Honestly…
- Worst case,

383
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,200
if you really want kids,

384
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,600
I'll find you a job at the kindergarten.

385
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,560
Look at Ye Meng. She's such a catch.

386
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,960
You'd better treat her right.

387
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,080
Granny,

388
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,560
we only just started dating.

389
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,040
We haven't even thought

390
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,680
about marriage or kids.

391
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,480
Exactly. A girl
shouldn't rush into marriage.

392
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,080
Having kids takes serious thought,
so you'd better be sure.

393
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,840
- Madam Tou Juhua,
- I'm here.

394
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,560
more like Madam Double Standard.

395
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,080
Hey, watch your mouth.

396
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,520
Maimai, go home

397
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,240
and bring me more clothes.

398
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,720
Sure.

399
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,080
Jinyu will wash the fruit for you.

400
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
- Don't forget to slash that deal.
- I won't.

401
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Eat before it gets cold.

402
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,440
That's not yours.

403
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,080
Put it back.

404
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,800
The agency says

405
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,200
if I want to debut, I need training.

406
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,400
But I don't have enough money.

407
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
So, I thought

408
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,560
I could use Grandma's garden
as collateral for a loan.

409
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,680
It's just borrowing.

410
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,680
Once I make money, I'll pay her back.

411
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,360
Please, Jinyu.
Just this once. I'm begging you.

412
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,880
Put it down right now.

413
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,320
I'll pretend this never happened.

414
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,200
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

415
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,280
Why are you so selfish?

416
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,080
You've got a girlfriend now.
She spoils you,

417
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,640
makes sure you don't worry about a thing.

418
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,960
But what about me?

419
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,400
You know how much I love singing.

420
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,120
Yet all I do is run errands in a bar.

421
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,760
I can't even get a chance to perform.

422
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
That doesn't make it okay
to steal from Grandma.

423
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,560
I'm not like you.

424
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,400
You're content to rot
in this small town forever. I'm not.

425
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,240
I want to be somebody.

426
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,080
I want to be like Ye Meng. Go to the city,

427
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,640
earn real money, see the bigger world.

428
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,360
No one's stopping you from chasing that.

429
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,760
Don't trade Grandma's stuff for it.

430
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,800
Stop throwing Grandma in my face.

431
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,280
You're not her real grandson.

432
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,280
- What are you doing?
- Put it down!

433
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,440
What are you doing?

434
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,320
Maimai.

435
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,040
327-4 XINGYI ROAD

436
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,160
Working on a puzzle?

437
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,880
I bought Ping'an some dog food.

438
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,480
Salmon flavor. Smells so good
I almost want to eat it myself.

439
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,440
Look.

440
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,280
Ping'an says thanks.

441
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,600
I just saw Maimai storm out.

442
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,400
What happened? Another fight?

443
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,040
Anyway, I've been craving seafood.

444
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,800
Let's go to your uncle's restaurant
for crab. Sounds good?

445
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm not hungry.

446
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,200
You go.

447
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,920
You're not hungry at all?

448
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,480
No appetite today.

449
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,480
Fine. I'll head out.

450
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,520
Enjoy your puzzle.

451
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Just don't regret it later.

452
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,240
Puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.

453
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,960
Spend your life with puzzles.

454
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,800
Where's my puzzle piece?

455
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,240
What puzzle piece?

456
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,920
Don't play dumb.

457
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Kiss me and I'll give it back.

458
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,280
That was so stiff.

459
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,760
Like a machine. Doesn't count.

460
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,080
Don't push your luck.

461
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,840
You were so cold to me just now.
It really hurt.

462
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,480
Can't you at least make it up to me?

463
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,120
Fine. I'm sorry.

464
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,840
Here. Happy now?

465
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,040
I'm leaving.

466
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,040
I really am sorry.

467
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,040
I shouldn't have treated you that way.

468
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,280
Let me take you to dinner.

469
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,000
Really? You mean it?

470
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,440
Because if you change your mind,

471
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,760
that puzzle will always be
missing a piece.

472
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,160
Got it. Let's go.

473
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,880
Then grab my bag.

474
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,080
Okay.

475
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,840
And the keys.

476
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,760
We've got to lock up.

477
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,320
Let's go.

478
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,760
Here you go.

479
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Careful, it's hot.

480
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,640
NOW SERVING PEAK-SEASON HAIRY CRABS

481
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,080
Meng, eat up.

482
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,040
NANTANG CRAB POT

483
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,080
Make sure she gets plenty.

484
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,920
What's wrong? Still upset?

485
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,160
Is this about Maimai?

486
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,760
Come on. At least eat something.

487
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,080
Eat more.

488
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,600
That'll make your grandma happy.

489
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,880
Actually, I'm not really her grandson.

490
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,360
Her son was my stepdad.

491
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
My little brother is.

492
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,560
Li Zhuofeng, the one
I donated bone marrow to.

493
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,360
He's the real grandson.

494
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,200
After my dad died,

495
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,160
I was a mess.

496
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,000
Grandma worried if I kept going like that,

497
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,160
I'd end up ruined.

498
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,640
So, she dragged me back from Jiangbei.

499
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,400
Blood or not, in her heart,

500
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,160
you're her grandson.

501
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
Maimai loves you too. You're family.

502
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,560
Family? With her?

503
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,880
She just sticks to me all the time,

504
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,680
calling me cousin until my head spins.

505
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,800
I can't shake her off.

506
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Cousin, did you eat lunch?

507
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,360
Knew it. You're still in bed.

508
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,240
I brought you seafood noodles
from Uncle's shop.

509
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,920
- Get up and eat.
- I don't want it.

510
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,760
You can't just hole up here all day.

511
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,160
Come with me to the new escape room.

512
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,400
My friend just opened it. It's free.

513
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,560
Not interested.

514
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,080
Do you hate me or something?

515
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,560
Every time I ask you out,

516
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,440
you're either too busy or not interested.

517
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,360
Please, just once.

518
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,680
Come with me, cousin.

519
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,880
What are you doing?

520
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,560
Just get up first, then we'll talk.

521
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
Come on. Up, up.

522
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,480
On your feet. Let's go.

523
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,680
Come on. Shoes on.

524
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,160
That's better. Come on.

525
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,720
This must be the prison cell
from the clue.

526
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,760
- Is it?
- Everyone split up.

527
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Look for hints. Hurry.

528
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,040
- Did you find anything?
- What are you doing?

529
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,320
- What?
- Did you just touch me?

530
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,200
So what if I did? Stop acting innocent.

531
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,080
Say that again!

532
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,080
- You dare hit me?
- What are you doing?

533
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,280
What are you doing?

534
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,840
Open the door!

535
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,400
- Go on. Scream.
- Just wait!

536
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Cousin! Li Jinyu!

537
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,600
He's harassing me! Help!

538
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,480
- What happened?
- They're messing with me.

539
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,520
He just groped me!

540
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,640
You're her cousin? Don't make trouble.

541
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,720
Did you just grope her?

542
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,400
Yeah. So what?

543
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,600
No wonder Kai said you were crazy,
that you beat a guy into the hospital.

544
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,120
It was that time, wasn't it?

545
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,280
Must've been.

546
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,240
You talk like you can't stand her,

547
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,680
but you do care about her.

548
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,160
And she clearly cares about you.

549
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,000
Come on. Give me a smile.

550
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,560
You've been sulking all night.

551
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,440
Maybe

552
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,160
if you called me babe,

553
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,120
I'd cheer up.

554
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,680
Okay, babe.

555
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,800
Babe, open your mouth.

556
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,560
I'll feed you.

557
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,560
Babe, open your mouth.

558
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,480
Babe, is it yummy?

559
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,320
You're so much better when you smile.

560
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,520
See?

561
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,560
- Just eat.
- Only if you do too.

562
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,120
Li Jinyu.

563
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,200
Li Jinyu. Li Jinyu.

564
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,280
- Li Jinyu.
- What is it?

565
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,800
Let me ask you something.

566
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,080
- Go ahead.
- Why do dolphins

567
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,400
always look like they're smiling?

568
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,400
Dolphins don't actually smile.

569
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,080
That's the biggest lie out there.

570
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,240
I was trying to tell a joke.

571
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,240
Can't you play along?

572
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,960
Fine, fine.

573
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,200
So, why do dolphins smile?

574
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,600
Because all the jokes they hear
are a little fishy.

575
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,199
- That's so lame.
- Come on. It's funny.

576
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,679
What's wrong?

577
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I have night blindness.

578
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,880
Turn on your phone light.

579
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,880
Are you serious,

580
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,320
Ye Meng?

581
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No. But still, turn it on.

582
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,280
I can't see the road.

583
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,080
No.

584
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,760
Because I just realized,

585
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,080
having you fall into my arms
feels pretty good.

586
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,320
So, that's your thing, huh?

587
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,600
If I'd known,
I would've thrown myself at you

588
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,000
the first time we met.

589
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
That wouldn't have worked.

590
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,600
Look at that light flashing.

591
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,199
Does it remind you
of that day in the escape room?

592
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,600
So, how did you get out in the end?

593
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,040
<i>The blinking pattern…</i>

594
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,840
It's Morse code.

595
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,520
Want to try it?

596
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
Do we use this?

597
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,680
What does that mean?

598
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,400
You sure you want to know?

599
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,120
Baby, hold on. Promise,

600
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,880
gonna get through.

601
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,840
Your joke's way lamer than mine.

602
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,960
- Let's go.
- Baby, where are you going?

603
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,640
Home. Where else?

604
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,200
Even the way you walk looks cool.

605
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,600
Thanks.

606
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,840
Baby…

607
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,640
Our Li Jinyu is finally
somebody else's big baby.

608
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,280
YA READY-TO-WEAR, VINTAGE, HANDMADE

609
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,080
Feel free to look around.

610
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,160
Ya'en.

611
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Kai? What brings you here?

612
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,560
Uh… I, uh,

613
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,720
brought you something to eat.

614
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,840
- Thanks.
- And… actually…

615
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,320
I bought a suit the other day.
It's a little loose.

616
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,160
Could you take it in for me?

617
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,440
Sure.

618
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,000
Leave it here. I'll check later.

619
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,920
Anything else?

620
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
Just…

621
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,200
Yesterday,

622
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,480
when we drank too much…

623
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,880
Then you…

624
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,120
You…

625
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,920
What's going on?

626
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,440
Great.

627
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,760
It's broken.

628
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,560
- Go on.
- Uh… But it doesn't bother me at all.

629
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,840
I just… don't want Jiayu making things up.

630
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,440
And I don't want you misunderstanding.

631
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,760
Let's just forget it ever happened.

632
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,480
You're still my big sister.
I'm still your little brother.

633
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Oh God.

634
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,200
Kai…

635
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,400
Well…

636
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,400
I really did drink too much last night.

637
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,640
Totally blacked out.

638
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,480
If I really did take advantage of you,

639
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,840
there's no way I can take responsibility.
You get that, right?

640
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,440
No, no, Ya'en, that's not what I meant.

641
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,240
You've got me wrong.

642
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,320
- I was saying we could still…
- I understand.

643
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,440
Mom,

644
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,520
you really need to stop drinking so much.

645
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,400
Last night, Uncle Cheng Kairan

646
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,160
carried you to the sofa.

647
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,080
Then,

648
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,000
he…

649
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,240
He turned off the lights.

650
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,600
And…

651
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,800
He left.

652
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,840
- Thank you, Kai.
- Of course.

653
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,080
Anyway, if, uh… nothing else,

654
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,960
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

655
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,560
- I'll fix your suit another day.
- Wait!

656
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,520
About the question I asked you last night.

657
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,320
You still haven't given me an answer.

658
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,360
What question?

659
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,040
Well, yesterday, Jiayu asked
if I could teach him boxing.

660
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,760
He doesn't like boxing.

661
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,600
He will. One day.

662
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,760
I…

663
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,560
This trash is to go out, right?
I'll take it.

664
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,800
Thanks.

665
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,160
Mom, I'll go ask him for his answer.

666
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,760
- What--
- Hey! Stop!

667
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,200
Feeling guilty, huh?

668
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,840
Me? Guilty about what?

669
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,400
Then why can't you tell my mom

670
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,800
what really happened--

671
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,040
Shut it.

672
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,880
What your mom and I have
is pure friendship, you hear?

673
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,480
If you say anything,

674
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,640
you'll ruin
our ten-plus years of friendship

675
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,840
over nothing.

676
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,720
I don't know

677
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
about my mom,

678
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,440
but you sure look embarrassed.

679
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,640
Keep it down.

680
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,320
Please, Yu, my dearest comrade.

681
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,480
I'm begging you.

682
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,000
Don't bring it up again.

683
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,520
Whatever you need,

684
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,640
just call me.

685
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
I'll be there.

686
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,960
Fine.

687
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,280
I'll let it slide.

688
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,080
This stays between us. Our secret.

689
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,680
But calling me comrade
messes up the family seniority.

690
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,080
Let's try to be on the same page?

691
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,920
Fine.

692
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,320
Settled then.

693
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,240
You call me Yu, I'll call you Kai.

694
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,200
Okay. Yu.

695
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,000
Think about the boxing thing, will you?

696
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,680
I could turn you into a real fighter.

697
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,240
Then you'd be able to protect yourself
and your mom.

698
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,680
No. Solving things with fists
only works for a moment.

699
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,080
Arming yourself with knowledge
lasts a lifetime.

700
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,000
Alright. I can already protect my mom.

701
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,360
Go home.

702
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,840
This rehab's pointless.

703
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,800
I don't want to do it.

704
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,440
Come on. You've still got 20 minutes left.

705
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,880
I said I'm done.

706
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,160
Just leave me alone.

707
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,200
Having you here only makes me feel worse.

708
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,600
Look at them.

709
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,560
Such a warm, happy family.

710
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,720
Look at that.

711
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,400
Encouraging each other,
cheering each other on.

712
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,040
That kind of spirit

713
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,360
helps you heal faster, doesn't it?

714
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,160
Anyone watching us would think
you're guarding a prisoner.

715
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,840
A prisoner would listen better than you.

716
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,680
Now keep moving. I'm timing you.

717
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,160
I feel dizzy. Must be low blood sugar.

718
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,280
Get me something to eat.

719
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,080
Not until you finish.

720
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,120
What's going on here? Guarding an inmate?

721
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,400
Exactly.

722
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,600
See? Girls understand each other.

723
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,960
Come sit with me.

724
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,840
Granny, I'll do rehab with you.

725
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,600
Let me put on some music

726
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,560
to keep us in the mood.

727
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,480
- Yes, play something.
- I'll pick one.

728
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,640
- That one. That's good.
- Yes. Louder!

729
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,640
See? Now I feel alive again.
