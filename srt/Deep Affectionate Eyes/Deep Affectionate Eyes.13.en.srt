ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>DEEP AFFECTION EYES</i>
BY ER DONG TU ZI ON JJWXC.NET

2
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,120
<i>One month.</i>

3
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,880
<i>I'll give you one month.</i>

4
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,640
<i>If you don't come back,</i>

5
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,280
<i>I won't wait anymore.</i>

6
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,480
<i>Li Jinyu…</i>

7
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,640
Don't tell me you can't live without me.

8
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,600
I don't know.

9
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,040
Don't know?

10
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,600
So, is that a yes or a no?

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,800
Don't start.

12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,800
Wait for me to come back.

13
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,800
DESTINATION JIANGBEI

14
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,520
Ye Meng!

15
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,440
Ye Meng!

16
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,000
- Could you be any louder?
- Ms. Ye, the great beauty herself.

17
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,480
Did Gou Kai send you to pick me up?

18
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,080
Him? No way.

19
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,440
With our friendship?

20
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,040
Picking up a beauty is my honor.

21
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,840
Sharper.

22
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
More striking.

23
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,160
What, was the weather over there better?

24
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,520
You're glowing even more now.

25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,760
And you've only gotten greasier.

26
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
The car's right there.

27
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,960
Just landed. A friend's picking me up.

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,680
Did you get out of bed yet?
Don't skip breakfast.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
"Did you get out of bed yet"?

30
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,560
What is wrong with you?

31
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,280
Reporting in to the boyfriend, huh?

32
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,120
Look at you, honeymoon phase and all.
If Gou Kai saw this,

33
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,640
he'd be crushed.

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,000
Correction.

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,880
It's not the honeymoon "phase".

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,200
It's the honeymoon. We're married.

37
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,720
Already ate.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,360
Everyone's doing fine.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,600
MESSAGE TO YE MENG

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You only made it official a few days ago,
and I'm supposed to believe it?

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,920
So, how'd you two even meet?

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,920
Not telling you.

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,520
Come on. Spill.

44
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,960
Introduce us.

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,519
YE MENG'S MEETING GOU KAI LATER
MAKE SURE YOU'RE THERE

46
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,400
Ping'an,

47
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,080
what's the most important thing
in a marriage?

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
Tell me.

49
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,320
That's right. Trust.

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,560
Ms. Ye Meng.

51
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,080
- You're back, Ms. Ye Meng.
- Hi.

52
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,520
GEOMETRY FIELD

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,480
Ms. Ye.

54
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
How's everything going?

55
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,400
Same as always.

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,360
Ms. Ye, ever since you left,

57
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,040
our workload doubled.

58
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,720
We're exhausted.

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,680
Ms. Ye, you're coming back
this time, right?

60
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
No, just here to handle some things.

61
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,840
You guys make it sound like

62
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,760
Gou Kai and I treat you so badly.

63
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,200
Coffee. Your Ms. Meng brought it.

64
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,360
Thanks, Ms. Ye.

65
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
- Thanks, Ms. Ye.
- Thanks.

66
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,360
- Love you!
- Okay,

67
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
I've got a meeting.

68
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,000
We'll talk after.

69
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,520
- Get back to work.
- Coffee's on Ms. Ye today!

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,440
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

71
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,800
Ye Meng, welcome home.

72
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
What's wrong with you?

73
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,320
Sit down.

74
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
Look at you, back from Jiangbei, glowing.

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,880
Must be the weather.

76
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,800
Yeah, weather's nice.

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,280
And it sounded lively outside.

78
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,480
Buying coffee for the team?

79
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,920
Nice.

80
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,960
So, how long are you staying this time?

81
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,920
For good?

82
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,080
Here's that file you wanted.

83
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,160
Take a look.

84
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,360
You think I'd lie to you?

85
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,040
WANG XINGSHENG, MALE

86
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
AUGUST 25, 1979, BACHELOR'S DEGREE

87
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,480
HEALTHY, NOT OVERSEAS CHINESE

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,520
When can I meet him?

89
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,080
What's the rush?

90
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,880
If you're too busy,
just give me his contact.

91
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,800
I'll meet him myself.

92
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,760
I said don't rush.

93
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,760
Have some water.

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,360
The problem is…

95
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,120
you're not a company employee.

96
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,640
I can't just hand out client details,

97
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,600
- right?
- Really?

98
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
Don't worry, I've already arranged it.

99
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,760
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.,

100
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,960
I'll take you to meet him.

101
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,760
- Alright?
- Thanks.

102
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,560
The Three Musketeers,
finally together again.

103
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,440
Come on. No more long faces.

104
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,480
Let's take a photo.

105
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,760
Here. Three, two, one,

106
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,480
cherries!

107
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,480
I'll post it on Moments.

108
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,000
No plans to come back?

109
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,720
Isn't that Ye Meng's old boss?

110
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,080
You really let her run back to Jiangbei
and have coffee with him?

111
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm not trying to scare you,

112
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,200
but you two just got married.

113
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,320
And you let her walk straight back
onto her ex's turf?

114
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,360
You trust her that much?

115
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,640
I do.

116
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not trying to stir things up,
but come on,

117
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,120
compared to that guy?
Sure, you've got the looks

118
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,280
and the charm.

119
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,240
But look at that big office.

120
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,760
The man's got serious money.

121
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,680
On that front, you can't compete.

122
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,240
And don't forget. They've got history.

123
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
That's dangerous.

124
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,360
- You're insane.
- Don't brush it off.

125
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,800
I've seen this before.

126
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,520
Look at Fang Ya'en.

127
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,840
She said she hated her ex,

128
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,680
swore she'd divorce him.
And now? Still stuck.

129
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,080
You'd better be careful.

130
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,680
I'm not like you.

131
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,600
We've registered.

132
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,040
Yeah, yeah. You've got the certificate.

133
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,720
But you're here drinking with me,
while she's out with her ex.

134
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
I've got a move.

135
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Guaranteed to pull

136
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,840
Ye Meng's attention
back to you in no time.

137
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,080
What move?

138
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,640
See those two?

139
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,080
Old friends of mine.

140
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,200
I'll say hi,

141
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,880
snap a couple of close shots.

142
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,200
Fake it so it looks intimate.

143
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,680
She can post, so can you.

144
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,680
- Let her stew a little.
- That's childish.

145
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,880
Come on. Try it.

146
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,840
- Might work.
- No, thanks.

147
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,120
Come on.

148
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,680
- Go. I'm trying to save your marriage.
- Not happening.

149
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,080
Mr. Cheng.

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,760
Jiang Luzhi?

151
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,800
What are you doing here?

152
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Bringing you business.

153
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Some new Hailan Port merchants

154
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,480
need a place for team building.

155
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,480
I recommended your bar.

156
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,040
Appreciate it, Ms. Jiang.

157
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm always in for business.

158
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,400
Funny though,

159
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,400
you and Ye Meng aren't exactly friends.

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
And considering you two

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,560
shared…

162
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,840
the same man…

163
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,320
Since when do you
throw me a bone like this?

164
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,600
And you think women are the ones
who obsess over love?

165
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
Men are worse.

166
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,360
Can't you stop being so narrow-minded?

167
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,960
I recommended your place
because it's good.

168
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,960
I get to build favors on both sides.

169
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Why cut off business
just to hold a grudge?

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,240
Smart woman. Drink's on me.

171
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,720
I drove. No alcohol.

172
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,360
Then a mocktail.

173
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,520
Sit, relax.

174
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,120
Stop being so narrow-minded.

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,080
How long are you planning to pretend

176
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,520
we're strangers?

177
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,040
We were never close.

178
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,520
I thought you two were done ages ago.

179
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
Then, the other day,

180
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,840
I saw her make it official on Moments.

181
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,240
Didn't expect her
to take someone so seriously.

182
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,000
So, let me wish you well.

183
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,920
Hope it lasts.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And

185
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,840
that you've got enough charm
to keep her here in Ningsui.

186
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,120
You're that worried
she'll go back to Jiangbei?

187
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,160
And you're not?

188
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,080
Here, take a look at the drinks list.

189
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,520
- I need to take this.
- Go ahead.

190
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
Hi, Mom.

191
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,800
I'm working late.

192
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,080
Jiang Luzhi's parents are teachers,

193
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,520
known for being strict.

194
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Her family's just like Ye Meng's.

195
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,720
- They both want marriages with local boys.
- No, I am not at a bar. I…

196
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
That's why she was set up with you.

197
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,840
What's on your phone?

198
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,280
This picture?

199
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
Look at that.

200
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,840
Imagine Ye seeing it,

201
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,960
with Jiang Luzhi in the shot.

202
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,760
Double the effect, right?

203
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,040
Look how close you two are.

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
More like double the disaster. Delete it.

205
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Sent.

206
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,760
You had to touch my phone.

207
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,920
Look what you did, making such a…

208
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,320
huge deal out of it.

209
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,680
Ye Meng will be back any minute.
You're welcome.

210
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,080
Rest assured.

211
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,440
Look at your faces. Priceless.

212
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,320
Check it out. So many likes.
Everyone's hoping you'll come back.

213
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,880
It's not just me.

214
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,880
Even Tai Mingxiao

215
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
keeps saying new clients are impossible.

216
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,600
Without you, PR's a mess.

217
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,720
And projects are piling up this year.

218
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,000
Didn't you once say you wanted
to buy a place in Jiangbei?

219
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,480
This could be the perfect chance.

220
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,720
Think about it.

221
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,160
I'm happy the company's doing well.

222
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,440
But I'm fine where I am.

223
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,320
I like the pace of life back home.

224
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,240
Anyway, I should go.

225
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,280
Hold on.

226
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,600
After everything I've done for you,

227
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,520
how about dinner?

228
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,160
Not tonight. I'm really not in the mood.

229
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,120
Another time.

230
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,320
Is this about Wang Xingsheng?

231
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,840
Or that so-called boyfriend of yours?

232
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,600
Come on. Just let him know.

233
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,800
He won't mind.

234
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
He's a grown man, isn't he?

235
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,480
Sorry.

236
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,240
I don't want to risk making him jealous.

237
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,720
And he's not my boyfriend.

238
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,880
He's my husband.

239
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,120
We've already registered.

240
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,720
When we hold the wedding,

241
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
you'll get an invitation.
Now, I'm leaving.

242
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,520
- Bye.
- Bye.

243
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,680
Bye? What the hell just happened?

244
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
It's real.

245
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,760
I double-checked. Genuine.

246
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,200
You double-checked?

247
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,840
Oh no, no, no.

248
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,280
<i>This is suicide.</i>

249
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,280
<i>Delete it before it explodes.</i>

250
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,520
<i>Got a death wish?</i>

251
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,360
CHENG KAIRAN'S POST
OLD FRIENDS CATCHING UP OVER BUSINESS

252
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll head out. Taking this with me.

253
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,400
<i>Drinking's bad for your health.</i>

254
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,440
<i>Keep it in moderation.</i>

255
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,080
<i>PS. Jinyu looks good.</i>

JIAYU'S COMMENT

257
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,240
CHENG KAIRAN REPLIED

258
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,680
<i>Sorry, forgot to set the groups.</i>

259
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,640
Kai,

260
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,960
you trying to get yourself killed?

261
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,760
Killed? Please.

262
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,360
This is what we call a love test.

263
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,400
If a woman really loves you,

264
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,120
the second another girl
comes within 16 feet,

265
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,080
she'll tense up.

266
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,080
If that girl happens to be your type,

267
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,400
she'll zoom in with a sniper scope

268
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,680
and take her out instantly.

269
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,800
Oh, so now you're an expert?

270
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
Of course.

271
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,600
Jealousy turns women superhuman
on the spot,

272
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,200
from single-cell organisms
to 180-IQ Sherlock Holmes.

273
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,760
If she doesn't get jealous…

274
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,200
either she's too lazy

275
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,240
or she just doesn't care about you.

276
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,240
Some people

277
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,200
really ought to think about that.

278
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,320
Mr. Li.

279
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,120
Heading upstairs.

280
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
One second.

281
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,360
Granny, what brings you here?

282
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,280
Oh, Jinyu.

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,400
I heard your grandma's
out of the hospital,

284
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
so I came to see her.

285
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,720
She's inside. Come on in.

286
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,080
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

287
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,960
Come on.

288
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,960
Grandma.

289
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,200
‪327-3 XINGYI ROAD

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,119
This place is just the same.

291
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
It hasn't changed at all.

292
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,920
Look who it is.

293
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,480
Didn't expect to see you.

294
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,360
Heard you fell, hurt your leg,

295
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,520
and just got discharged.

296
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I came to check on you.

297
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,200
Two months stuck in the hospital.

298
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,440
Finally home.

299
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,560
Word sure travels fast with you.

300
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,680
Grandma…

301
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,840
Badou.

302
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,760
Look at you.

303
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,480
Clinging to her
like she's Empress Dowager Cixi.

304
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,920
And you? Did you hurt your leg too?

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,160
You sure you're fine?

306
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,160
Granny, sit. I'll get you some tea.

307
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,080
Thanks.

308
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,480
Does the madam of the Ye family

309
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,280
drink the same tea as us common folk?

310
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,720
She was a proper lady back in the day.

311
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,040
One sip of our tea,

312
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,760
and if something happened, paralysis.

313
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,000
Who could afford that?

314
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
Her life is priceless.

315
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,200
Jinyu, just pour me some plain water.

316
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,320
And Juhua,

317
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,680
your teeth were yellow

318
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,320
even when you were young.

319
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,720
You should smoke and drink less.

320
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,480
That lipstick…

321
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,400
What brand is it?

322
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,480
It clashes with your skin tone,

323
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,440
makes you look sallow and tired.

324
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,680
Not flattering at all.

325
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,320
At our age,

326
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,120
we need to learn
how to love ourselves better.

327
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,240
Xu Meilan, did you come here
just to pick a fight?

328
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,520
If you've got something to say,
spit it out. I'm busy!

329
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,280
Now, now.

330
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,720
Do I look like the unreasonable type?

331
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Let me tell you,

332
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,800
if these two kids hadn't secretly gone off

333
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,400
and gotten a marriage certificate
behind my back,

334
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,720
I wouldn't have bothered coming.

335
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,560
But I'll tell you this.

336
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,520
The moment I met Jinyu,

337
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,200
I liked him.

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,320
Doesn't seem at all
like he was raised by you.

339
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680
And your granddaughter Meng

340
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,920
doesn't seem like she was raised
by you either. She's not spoiled at all!

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,760
So, Jinyu,

342
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,800
what are your plans?

343
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,320
I…

344
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
She's asking about the wedding. Hurry up.

345
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,080
Yes.

346
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,320
Ye Meng's not home.

347
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,440
I don't think there's any rush.

348
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,240
How can you not be in a rush?

349
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,520
That's exactly the problem
with young people.

350
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,760
Let me tell you,
the Ye family is a big family.

351
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,200
Our wedding traditions are complicated.

352
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,040
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean…

353
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,160
- Let me finish.
- Don't start with me.

354
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,160
- Right?
- Explain it.

355
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,680
- I wasn't even finished.
- You came here yourself.

356
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,920
- Not that I am begging you.
- Why are you yelling?

357
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,080
- I haven't finished.
- Finished what?

358
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
What do you mean I'm yelling?

359
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Was I yelling?

360
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
- Of course you were.
- You came to visit me.

361
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,160
- Right?
- You just scared the kid off.

362
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,200
- Did you raise your voice?
- I didn't scare him off.

363
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,320
- Then where is he now?
- I don't care.

364
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,480
You're going on about big family.
Explain what that means.

365
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,040
- You're the one who said it.
- What did I say?

366
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,840
You said we're a big family.

367
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,240
- You said it.
- You said it.

368
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
Explain what that means.

369
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
- Forget it. I can't argue with you.
- What's wrong with us?

370
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,120
- I shouldn't come.
- You showed up here.

371
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,240
- I never invited you.
- Fine.

372
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,160
No point

373
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
- wasting my breath.
- Exactly.

374
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
- Loudmouth!
- I didn't want to talk to you anyway.

375
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,440
Loudmouth.

376
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Loudmouth?

377
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,720
And take that cheap box with you.

378
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,040
- Look at you.
- You…

379
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,920
- Can't even defend yourself.
- You think

380
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,880
- Calling me loudmouth?
- I wanted to bring it?

381
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,800
You don't deserve it.

382
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,760
- You walked in here.
- Loudmouth.

383
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,680
- You're the loudmouth.
- I'm done.

384
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,920
- with you.
- Then leave.

385
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,960
Get out of here.

386
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,400
I'm sick of looking at you.

387
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,520
See you never.

388
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,760
Ugh, infuriating…

389
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,680
WYNDHAM GRAND PLAZA ROYALE HOTEL

390
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,640
What are you doing?

391
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,520
<i>Oh, you finally remembered me?</i>

392
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
<i>Reading.</i>

393
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,640
I didn't dare to call all afternoon.

394
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,520
Didn't want to interrupt
your business meeting

395
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,120
with your ex.

396
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,680
<i>I was thinking the same.</i>

397
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,320
Didn't want to interrupt you
and your old buddies

398
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,680
reminiscing.

399
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,880
<i>Those are just colleagues.</i>

400
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,040
<i>Your case is different.</i>

401
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
<i>Jiang Luzhi is your ex.</i>

402
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,120
<i>That's on record.</i>

403
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,160
Jealous?

404
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,600
Looks like Cheng Kairan's trick worked.

405
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
So, you're playing games now

406
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,120
just to make me jealous?

407
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,280
Honey.

408
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,920
It's only been a day apart,

409
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,320
but I miss you like crazy.

410
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,240
Do you miss me?

411
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
I… haven't had time.

412
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
<i>Your grandma came over.</i>

413
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,720
<i>The two grannies</i>

414
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,560
spent some time

415
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,760
planning our wedding.

416
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,360
Were they enemies

417
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,360
back in the day?

418
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,800
<i>What, love rivals?</i>

419
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Not that far.

420
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,680
Just…

421
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,880
different tastes, I guess.

422
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,480
<i>Well, the wedding</i>
<i>needs to move up the list.</i>

423
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,880
As the bride-to-be,

424
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,200
I really should start preparing.

425
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Then,

426
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,880
when are you coming back to take charge?

427
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,960
I want to, but I still
haven't met Wang Xingsheng.

428
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,000
If you don't come back soon,

429
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,240
Grandma's going to finish your lipstick.

430
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,800
She can use it. I've got plenty.

431
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,160
<i>She put it on Ping'an.</i>

432
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,680
Then let her. Whatever makes her happy.

433
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,000
Coming.

434
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,440
Food delivery. You keep reading.

435
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,400
<i>Okay.</i>

436
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,200
MIC ON

437
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,560
Coming!

438
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,080
Your line's been busy.
Who have you been talking to?

439
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,840
<i>What are you, my landlord? Stay out of it.</i>

440
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,320
<i>Tai Mingxiao says you married for love.</i>

441
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,080
I've known you since graduation.

442
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,840
I know you better than anyone.

443
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,520
Even if you wanted

444
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
to spite me, you wouldn't go
as far as marriage.

445
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,160
You really think I'd believe that?

446
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,160
Gou Kai, are you out of your mind?

447
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,360
You think the world revolves around you?

448
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,120
<i>You think I'd marry</i>
<i>just to get back at you?</i>

449
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,240
And you barge in at night
just to say this?

450
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,960
- Let's talk inside.
- What are you doing?

451
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,760
<i>I'm married.</i>

452
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,760
<i>Show some respect.</i>

453
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,880
Married, huh?

454
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,400
Fine. Then tell me,
who is he, what does he do,

455
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,520
what's his family like,
and how does he treat you?

456
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,080
None of your business.

457
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,760
Can't even make it up,

458
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,760
can you?

459
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,240
Because he doesn't exist.

460
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,760
You think a WeChat post

461
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,280
and a few words to Tai Mingxiao

462
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,840
are enough to rattle me?

463
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,600
Well,

464
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,680
they did.

465
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,320
Hold on. Let me see.

466
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,840
Is Jiang Luzhi here with you or something?

467
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,200
Who's this show for?

468
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,880
Ye Meng,

469
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,800
the only person I've ever wanted is you.

470
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,120
You really never noticed?

471
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,880
<i>I never noticed a thing.</i>

472
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,640
<i>Is this your idea of love?</i>

473
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,440
I didn't say anything before

474
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,960
because the gap between us was too big.

475
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,640
So, I tried to help you rise,

476
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,120
to get you closer to my level.

477
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,920
I wanted my parents to accept you.

478
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,680
If we'd been together, it'd go nowhere.

479
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,920
That'd be playing with you.

480
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,120
Trying to gaslight me?

481
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,200
Sorry, I don't fall for that.

482
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,360
This is the key to Jing Villa.

483
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,080
<i>Remember that place you liked?</i>
<i>I bought it.</i>

484
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,520
Stay, and everything you want
will be yours.

485
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,080
Oh, come on.
What is this, a knock-off CEO drama?

486
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,080
Me as the Cinderella, you as the prince?

487
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
If you've got nothing else to say, leave.

488
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
I have to meet Wang Xingsheng tomorrow.

489
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,400
Oh, so you do remember that.

490
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,920
Think you'd get that meeting without me?

491
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,120
Think your husband
can make that happen? He can't.

492
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,680
Listen to me, Gou Kai.

493
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
I'll find Wang Xingsheng myself.

494
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,880
I'll uncover the truth
about my mother myself.

495
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,840
And unless you want

496
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,000
that security footage

497
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,520
circulating at your company tomorrow,

498
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,560
you'd better leave now.

499
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,360
- It's fake, isn't it?
- Fake, my ass.

500
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,880
Fake.

501
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,200
All fake.

502
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,240
Cancel tomorrow's meeting with Mr. Wang.

503
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,000
4:56 A.M. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20

504
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
<i>This is the key to Jing Villa.</i>

505
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,640
<i>Stay, and everything you want</i>
<i>will be yours.</i>

506
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,840
<i>Ye Meng,</i>

507
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,080
<i>the only person I've ever wanted is you.</i>

508
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,760
<i>You really never noticed?</i>

509
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,200
WIFE: BABY, VIDEO CALL?

510
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,320
CALL DURATION 11:24

511
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,360
HOLD TO TALK

512
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
<i>Baby,</i>

513
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,120
<i>send me your birth date and time.</i>

514
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,160
<i>I'll have your big aunt help you</i>

515
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,880
<i>pick a lucky date.</i>

516
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,360
<i>It's time we start planning the wedding.</i>

517
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,560
So, this "baby" thing must be

518
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,880
a family hand-me-down.

519
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
It's not that special after all.

520
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,280
Eat up.

521
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,720
Ping'an.

522
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,360
Ping'an.

523
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,760
Finish the crepe. It's all yours.

524
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,120
Guess this is my last decent breakfast.

525
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,520
Want more?

526
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,360
Look at you, still happy enough to eat.

527
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,080
You really are just a dog.

528
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,560
- Hello?
- So?

529
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
How'd it go with Wang Xingsheng?

530
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,600
Didn't even see him.

531
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,800
Pretty sure Gou Kai canceled.

532
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,440
I'll have to figure out another way.

533
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,640
That bastard… Always pulling stunts.

534
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,400
<i>Don't stress. Leave this to me.</i>

535
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,520
I'll take care of it.

536
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Hey, Li.

537
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,680
I need to ask you something.

538
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,000
<i>Wang Xingsheng's hotel.</i>

539
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,840
<i>Got it out of Gou Kai's driver.</i>

540
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,080
Thanks. Dinner's on me next time.

541
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,120
Take it easy, Grandma.

542
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,560
Here, let me record you.

543
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,960
Grandma,

544
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,960
now that you've got
a granddaughter-in-law on the way,

545
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,200
you've got extra energy, huh?

546
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,880
Of course. A happy heart
keeps the body moving!

547
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,240
Jinyu, you've been staring
at that same page forever.

548
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,440
You zoned out.

549
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
You don't know it.

550
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,440
This is called the memory palace method.

551
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,560
Memory palace, my foot.

552
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,600
You just miss Ye Meng.

553
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,680
I've already decided.

554
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,880
When Badou gets married,

555
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,280
I'm wearing red high heels.

556
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,560
Okay, Grandma, sit down and rest.

557
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,960
I'll get you some water.

558
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,320
- Hello.
- Hi.

559
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,720
I'm looking for a guest
named Wang Xingsheng.

560
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,880
I'm sorry, we can't share

561
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,600
- guest information.
- Please,

562
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,120
I was supposed to meet him at two.

563
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,920
I can't get him on the phone.

564
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,920
He has a heart condition. I'm worried.

565
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Do you know his room number?

566
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,360
I don't.

567
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,560
- I just need you to help me reach him.
- One moment.

568
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,600
Could you confirm the name again?

569
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,520
Wang Xingsheng.

570
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,440
Xing as in "prosper", Sheng as in "life".

571
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,560
Your friend checked out this morning.

573
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,040
He checked out?

574
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,560
Maybe try calling again?

575
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,920
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

576
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,800
<i>You had him leave, didn't you?</i>

577
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,400
It's one thing not to help me,

578
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,520
but sabotaging me?
Isn't that going too far?

579
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,240
I did cancel the meeting.

580
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,520
But weren't you the one who said

581
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,160
you'd track him down yourself?

582
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,440
Ye Meng,

583
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
it's not too late to change your mind.

584
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,320
I'll help you find Wang Xingsheng.

585
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,520
But my terms haven't changed.

586
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,320
VIDEO CALL

587
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,440
AWAITING RESPONSE

588
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,880
<i>Hello?</i>

589
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,280
I'm in a terrible mood.

590
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,639
Can you cheer me up?

591
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,120
<i>I don't really feel like it.</i>

592
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,480
What do you mean?

593
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,520
<i>Nothing.</i>

594
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,360
Li Jinyu, what now?

595
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,199
Ready to trade me in for a new wife?

596
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,760
Why won't you comfort me?

597
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,520
In about two seconds,
I'm going to hold my wife.

598
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,720
So, I don't have time
to comfort her over the phone.

599
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,440
What are you doing?

600
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,160
Why did you come here?

601
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,400
I missed you so much, I was going crazy.

602
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,920
There's something I need to explain first.

603
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
What is it?

604
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,680
I'll tell you, but…

605
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,200
promise me you won't get mad.

606
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,720
And promise you won't get jealous.

607
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,520
I can probably manage not to get mad.

608
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,840
But not jealous?
I'll have to think about that one.

609
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,920
After our video call last night,

610
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,200
Gou Kai came over.

611
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,920
I know.

612
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
The call never disconnected.

613
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,920
I heard every word.

614
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,600
Then you know I kicked him out, right?

615
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,600
Do you regret it?

616
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,840
He wasn't wrong about one thing.

617
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,400
I don't have much to give you.

618
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,480
What you give me…

619
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,400
no one else can.

620
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,800
Like what exactly?

621
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,240
Like the way you just said,

622
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,920
"I missed you so much, I was going crazy."

623
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,920
That's incredibly sexy.

624
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,520
Sexier than me playing the guitar?

625
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,280
Playing is still number one.
That line comes in third.

626
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,800
What's second?

627
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,960
Second was on our wedding night,

628
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,240
when you called me honey.

629
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,560
Actually, why don't you
put the two together?

630
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
That might move it up to number one.

631
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,960
Honey…

632
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,520
I missed you so much, I was going crazy.

633
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,400
GOU KAI

634
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,360
What is it?

635
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,840
<i>Still at the hotel?</i>

636
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,160
- <i>I'm coming by.</i>
- Don't bother.

637
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,320
I don't want to see you.

638
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,120
<i>Don't take it the wrong way.</i>

639
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,280
<i>I just want to apologize.</i>

640
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,160
Had a few drinks last night,

641
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,480
talked nonsense. Forget it.

642
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,720
I'll keep helping you with Wang Xingsheng.

643
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,480
That won't be necessary.

644
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,840
My husband came to see me.
He'll help me find him.

645
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,280
<i>Her husband's here?</i>

646
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,920
Tell her to bring him along.

647
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,440
We'll have dinner at the usual spot.

648
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,600
We're busy. I'm hanging up.

649
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,160
You three… even have a usual spot?

650
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,840
Didn't I make myself clear just now?

651
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,760
I don't tolerate anyone
trying to interfere in my marriage.

652
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I swear it.

653
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,520
- Where are you going?
- Taking a shower.

654
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,520
She hung up.

655
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,600
Here's my advice.

656
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,760
You need to face the truth.

657
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,240
You didn't believe she was married.

658
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,440
But now her husband's
right there with her.

659
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,120
It's not like

660
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,000
she hired an actor, right?

661
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,080
Don't rule it out.

662
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,520
Think about it.
Neither of us has actually seen him.

663
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
Have you seen him?

664
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,280
Exactly. I haven't either.

665
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,080
So, maybe it's all an act.

666
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,240
I've got to hand it to you.

667
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,600
I'm seriously impressed. Respect.

668
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,040
I didn't think

669
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,760
you liked Ye Meng that much.
You go to Ningsui once and come back

670
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,760
head over heels?

671
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,880
I can admit defeat
to someone better than me.

672
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,800
But what decent guy
could she find in Ningsui?

673
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,040
I can't accept it.

674
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,680
All an act.

675
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,880
CHENG KAIRAN

676
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
Yeah?

677
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,360
<i>I dug something up on him.</i>

678
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,120
Go on.

679
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,280
<i>Fat Buddha's back in Jiangbei.</i>

680
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,800
You're sure?

681
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,360
<i>Positive. Chen told me.</i>

682
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,920
<i>Turns out the guy was just</i>
<i>peddling fake antiques.</i>

683
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,840
<i>Never handled the real deal.</i>

684
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,760
<i>He just got out after being locked up</i>

685
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>for driving a fake-plate car</i>

686
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,640
<i>and getting into a gang fight.</i>

687
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,200
<i>Oh, and he runs a teahouse in Jiangbei.</i>

688
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,720
<i>I've sent you the address.</i>

689
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
Got it. Thanks.

690
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,040
So, you both decided to step in?

691
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,840
I asked him for a favor.

692
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
Can we really count on Fat Buddha?

693
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,040
We basically put him in jail not long ago.

694
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,560
Doesn't matter.
We'll never know if we don't try.

695
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,800
