 'Can't Hide My Heart Flutters' - Lu Zhuo 

2
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:11,826
 ♫ I still remember ♫ 

3
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:15,440
 ♫ Your flickering gaze ♫ 

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,625
 ♫ With a sense of excitement You vowed eternal love ♫ 

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:25,806
 ♫ But over time, you've forgotten ♫ 

6
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:31,154
 ♫ Promises drowned in life's twists ♫ 

7
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:34,642
 ♫ Only memories remain like scattered fireworks ♫ 

8
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,106
 ♫ When I turned to walk away ♫ 

9
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:42,738
 ♫ If I could go back to the day we parted ♫ 

10
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:48,810
 ♫ I'd never let go of your hand ♫ 

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,946
 ♫ I cannot hide my feelings ♫ 

12
00:00:53,946 --> 00:01:01,126
 ♫ I'm about to be out of control As breathing turns weightless ♫ 

13
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:06,026
 ♫ All I possess is drowned The me who still loves you deeply ♫ 

14
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:11,290
 ♫ Has never changed If miracles could exist ♫ 

15
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,273
 ♫ Promises would be kept Please remember ♫ 

16
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:20,250
 ♫ The dream where you see me ♫ 

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,060
Deep Affectionate Eyes

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,882
 

19
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:33,260
 

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,620
Grandma, make your expression look more pained.

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,520
- Got it.
- One, two, three.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,860
- Does it look real?
- Perfect.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,460
Alright.

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,720
 Grandma's rehabilitation. Love, love, love. 

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,550
 Love. 

26
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,680



27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,100
 Grandma taking a walk. Love, love, love. 

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,360
 Mhm. Love. 

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,820
 Grandma using the restroom. Love, love, love. 

30
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,100
 No photos needed. 

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,440
 Grandma eating a banana. Love, love, love. 

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,340
 Love. 

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,580
 Grandma playing a puzzle game. Love, love, love. 

34
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,300
 Mhm. Love. 

35
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,120
 Where are you? Send me your location. 

36
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,760
 
 Come here for a reward. 

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,760
 Be right there. 

38
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,260
 

39
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,420
You scared me. How did you get here so fast?

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,340
Gotta be quick when there's a reward.

41
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,780
Alright, go pick something.

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,140
Buy three and get one free. Great deal.

43
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,820
Appetite and lust are human nature. Don't be shy.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,800
I forgot eggs. I'll go get some.

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Li Jin Yu, what do you mean by that?

46
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,160
Thought you were content with love
and didn't need friends.

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,540
I'm a carnivore. Water won't satisfy me.

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,720
Who's been starving you?

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,620
Is my face not pretty enough? Or my figure?

50
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,700
Even with the mood right, he slammed the brakes.

51
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,600
Right.

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,800
With your figure, why wear sports bras?

53
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
They're comfortable.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,820
Come here. Let me teach you some tricks.

55
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,500
- What are you doing?
- Listen to me.

56
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,760
You're practically divorced,
yet you still know these things?

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,900
How long has it been since you... you know?

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,720
None of your business.

59
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,080
Follow my advice.
Li Jin Yu will turn wolf tonight.

60
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,600
And I hate your outfit today.
Let me find you something.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,980
It's not so convincing given what you're wearing.

62
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,260
Why care about my clothes?
I don't have a young boyfriend.

63
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,080
You're dressed like Scottish royalty,
yet you criticize me?

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,140
- I'm working.
- Working in that floral shirt?

65
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:04,310
 

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
Checkout, please.

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,300
Okay. One moment.

68
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,380
That'll be 399. Thank you.

69
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,880
Okay.

70
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
 Hello there. 

71
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,760
 And this is? 

72
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,680
 My agent, Wang. 

73
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,260
- Payment sent. 
 - Thank you. Have a nice day.

74
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,120
Let me package that for you.

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,360
- How much?
- 299, please. Thank you.

76
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,560
- Everyone ready? 
- Got everything.

77
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,340
- Tripod set.
- Supplies bought.

78
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,920
- Nervous?
- A little.

79
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,900
- No worries.
- It's okay.

80
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,140
- Just relax. Let's go.
- Let's go.

81
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,120
- Is it nearby?
- Right around here.

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,680
- Just five minutes away. 
 - Got it.

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Hello? I'm sending you a location. Come here now.

84
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,660
What took you so long?

85
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,860
- Aren't you cold wearing so little? 
 - I'm fine.

86
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,720
Why'd you call me here?

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,430
I just saw Qiao Mai Mai go inside.

88
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,840
With two guys. One of them
was her agent from the other day.

89
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,800
They were carrying photography equipment.
They must be here to film.

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,180
You waited here just to tell me that?

91
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,200
She's probably chasing
her celebrity fantasy again. Don't mind her.

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,220
I thought you were taking me
to see Mr. Yang again.

93
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,380
No. It's those bags they were carrying.
They contained lingerie.

94
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,680
Mai, these are today's shooting costumes.

95
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,480
Thanks.

96
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,860
Aren't we shooting a commercial?

97
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,100
We're shooting a commercial.

98
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,080
I'm sorry, but I might not be comfortable
doing this kind of shoot.

99
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Aren't you wasting everyone's time?

100
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,480
Li, it's her first time shooting this.
Of course she'd feel awkward.

101
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,580
Come, sit down.

102
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,520
Look, you've already paid the training fees.

103
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,120
Some came from your high-interest online loans.

104
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,460
The company covered some
because we see potential in you.

105
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,640
And the rest was supposed to be paid
through this commercial shoot, right?

106
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,340
Besides, commercial photoshoots
are everywhere nowadays.

107
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,560
Even big celebrities do them.

108
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:56,240
If you want to work in this industry,
you need professional dedication.

109
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,820
To put it elegantly,
this is about artistic expression.

110
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,960
Mai, if you really don't want to do the shoot, we won't force you.

111
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,800
But think about it.

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,800
You've already invested so much money
and even taken out loans.

113
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,860
And the training fees are non-refundable.

114
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,120
After coming this far towards your dream,

115
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,360
are you willing to give up now?

116
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,820
 Jin Yu, do you really want to stay here forever? 

117
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,240
 Yeah, what's wrong with that? 

118
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,120
 What's good about it?
There's no future staying in this small place. 

119
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,220
 I'm not like you. I want to explore the big city. 

120
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,460
 The world outside is so vibrant. There must be
something out there that I'm searching for. 

121
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,070
 

122
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,580
Mai!

123
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,885
 My business card. 

124
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:16,070
 

125
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,440
- Hello? Who is this? 
 - Hello? Your food delivery is here.

126
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
I didn't order any takeout.
You must have the wrong number.

127
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,460
No food ordered.

128
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,100
Takeout!

129
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,640
- I didn't order any takeout. 
 - Open the door!

130
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,780
I didn't order anything. What are you doing?

131
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,220
- Mai!
- What are you doing?

132
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,800
- What are you doing?
- What's your problem?

133
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,260
What are you doing? Let go!

134
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,100
Are you okay?

135
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,720
 I'm going to the big city. 

136
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,440
 The world outside is so vibrant. There must be
something out there that I'm searching for. 

137
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,600
 I've already seen it for you.
It's nothing special. 

138
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,340
 That's because you never wanted
to see it in the first place. 

139
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,160
 You were born with everything handed to you. 

140
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,460
 Of course you wouldn't care. 

141
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,060
 Why don't we go together?
We can look out for each other. 

142
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,660
 No. 

143
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,580
 Fine. I'll go by myself someday. 

144
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,200
Mai, have some water.

145
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,660
I've talked to your brother.
Stay at my place tonight, okay?

146
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,240
Alright, stop crying.

147
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,460
Your brother got your money back.
Those scammers are arrested.

148
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,380
He also took care of those photos.

149
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,080
Want to hear about my time in Jiangbei?

150
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,760
I've never even told your brother this.

151
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:30,760
It was embarrassing. I was worse than you are now.

152
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,920
My family thought I was doing well there.

153
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,480
But everyone struggling in Jiangbei
has similar stories.

154
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,140
I worked day and night
just to afford an apartment,

155
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,880
enduring overtime work
and late-night drinking sessions,

156
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,600
and sometimes even putting up with harassment.

157
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,240
But I couldn't quit despite all that.
I needed the bonuses.

158
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
I was saving for a down payment.

159
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,400
I thought I was close to success
until Jiang Lu Zhi showed up.

160
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,000
She's your brother's ex-girlfriend.

161
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,100
She hooked up with my boss and stole my projects.

162
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,160
I finally quit when I couldn't take it anymore.

163
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,720
And you just let it go?

164
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,120
Of course not. I sabotaged
their projects before leaving.

165
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,100
Jiang Lu Zhi waited
outside the boss's office to mock me.

166
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,360
She slapped me, so I fought back.

167
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,120
I slapped her back, pulled off her clip-ins,

168
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,300
and kicked her. It felt good to get revenge.

169
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,120
Ye Meng, you're so cool.

170
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:56,260
You didn't see me crying my eyes out
on the way back to Ningsui.

171
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,000
Years of dreams shattered. Years of work wasted.

172
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,400
I ended up back where I started.

173
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,220
I felt exactly how you feel now.

174
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,720
But look at me now.
I'm doing fine and met your brother.

175
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,480
Do you think what I did was stupid?

176
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,300
Of course not.

177
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,060
Then that's it.

178
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,940
Wanting to leave this town
and chase our dreams isn't wrong.

179
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,480
The wrong ones are the predators who exploit us.

180
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,960
In a way, what happened today
might be good for you.

181
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,520
The world is teaching you to grow.

182
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Now stop crying over those worthless people.

183
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,640
Actually, I'm crying for myself.

184
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,400
You've both been to Jiangbei
and chased your dreams.

185
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,100
Even if you quit, you can start over anytime.

186
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:18,200
But I'm different.
I've been stuck here in Ningsui since birth.

187
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,720
I thought this was finally my chance
to get closer to my dreams.

188
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,550
Now...

189
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,560
I just feel foolish.

190
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,700
But I don't want to end up
like my brother, hiding here forever.

191
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:48,140
Maybe ordinary people like me
don't deserve dreams.

192
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,700
Who is it?

193
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,360
 It's me. 

194
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,040
Who?

195
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,780
Finally calling me?
I've missed you like crazy.

196
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,340
Who's that? So excited this late.

197
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,120
The naive sweetheart.

198
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,540
What's so exciting about someone who betrayed you?

199
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,680
Hello, where are you? I want to go to see you.

200
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm still in Ningsui.

201
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,340
 I need your help with something. 

202
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,552
 Do you know any good music schools? 

203
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:53,780
My cousin wants to enroll.

204
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,360
Sure, that's easy. I'll handle it.

205
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,600
When are you coming back?

206
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm not coming back.

207
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,920
Why aren't you coming back?
Did you find a girlfriend there?

208
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,260
You actually got a girlfriend?
Who? Where's she from?

209
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,120
None of your business.

210
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,480
You-- Hello?

211
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,540
This naive guy actually has a girlfriend?

212
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,750
Who left the AC on all night?
It's the company's money.

213
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,100
What a waste.

214
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,480
Keep pretending.

215
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,400
So stingy.

216
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:02,340
 

217
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,120
How is she?

218
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,500
She's doing much better.
She said not to worry about her.

219
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,900
Thanks for today.

220
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,000
How will you thank me?

221
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,920
How do you want me to thank you?

222
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,740
What are you doing?

223
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,220
Morse code. Focus.

224
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,820
Okay.

225
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:12,740
W X M L B.

226
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,200
W X... 'I want to curse the boss'?

227
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Fair. Your boss is awful. I'm listening.

228
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,580
Not cursing the boss. I meant us. Us!

229
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,160
- About us?
- Right.

230
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,580
Then I'll have to guess carefully.

231
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:37,800
W... 'I bought a new bag'?

232
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
Not a bag. It's underwear.

233
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,060
Didn't you grow up overseas?

234
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,300
I noticed this afternoon.
Thought there was no rush.

235
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,240
I was afraid you'd disappear
after getting what you wanted.

236
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,240
Did you prepare the necessary items?

237
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,680
When did you prepare them?

238
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,980
After that time we stopped halfway.

239
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,240
I really thought you were celibate.

240
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,100
My mistake for giving you that impression.

241
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,590
Wait.

242
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,270
Hold on.

243
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,740
Oh no.

244
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,100
What's wrong?

245
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,680
Drink some brown sugar water.

246
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,580
Thanks.

247
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,540
Here. Warm your stomach.

248
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,120
Why do you have this?

249
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,300
Qiao Mai Mai bought it.
She doesn't get along with her family.

250
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,340
Sometimes she comes here to hide.

251
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,100
She hides here? Where does she sleep? With you?

252
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,460
What are you thinking?
She shares Grandma's room, of course.

253
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,600
- Here.
- If she's with Grandma, why's this with you?

254
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,880
She leaves things everywhere.
I just collected them.

255
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,160
Really?

256
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,260
I swear I'm not lying.

257
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,300
How about I throw all these away later?

258
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,060
No. Keep them for me.

259
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,440
Still hurts?

260
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,020
My feet are cold.

261
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,980
Better now?

262
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,580
No. It hurts.

263
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,030
What to do?

264
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Let me check online.

265
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,580
What is it?

266
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,640
Stop searching. My heart aches.

267
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,440
Heartache?

268
00:24:52,600 --> 00:25:00,340
Why always one step short?
Missing something each time.

269
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,120
No worries. We've got
plenty of time ahead. So no rush.

270
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,260
I'm in a rush. Compensate me.

271
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,060
How to compensate?

272
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
A kiss.

273
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
Feeling better?

274
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,360
60% better.

275
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,960
Why so distracted?

276
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,960
Cheer up.

277
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,060
Go sweep the floor trash.

278
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,640
Then clear the melon seed shells on the table.
Guests are coming.

279
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,020
Why are you here?

280
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,336
Mai, stop hiding. Get up.

281
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,440
Come out.

282
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,640
I need to work.

283
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,540
Come here.

284
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,260
Young man, help me up.

285
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,360
Mrs. Tou. You can stand! It's a medical miracle.

286
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,240
Stand still.

287
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,240
Take this.

288
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,960
Grandma...

289
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,960
You silly girl.

290
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,900
Wanting to be a star isn't shameful, right?

291
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,600
This card is my investment in you.
Now I'm your investor.

292
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:19,300
What you need now is professional vocal training.

293
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,040
Come here.

294
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,160
If the card's not enough,
I'll sell my place to invest more.

295
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,440
No need, Grandma.

296
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,200
Listen. I'll support you
even if I have to sell everything.

297
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,400
Mai, your brother
found a music school in Jiangbei.

298
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,080
Once confirmed, you can enroll.

299
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,320
- Quick, say thank you. 
 - Jin Yu...

300
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,640
You always wanted my guitar.
Take it when we return.

301
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,440
Practice hard. Don't embarrass me at school.

302
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,140
Really?

303
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,940
Grandma, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

304
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,540
Stop crying. So pathetic.

305
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,460
- Enough.
- Don't mention rights or wrongs.

306
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,120
Don't you want to be a singer?
Keep crying like this and you'll ruin your voice.

307
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,720
Right.

308
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,540
I've decided. I'll never give up on my dreams.

309
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,580
But I won't pursue it immediately.

310
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,680
First I'll achieve small goals step by step.

311
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,150
Exactly.

312
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,710
What small goals?

313
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,860
First, I'll establish myself at Jubaoshi's stage
and replace top performer Li Jin Yu.

314
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,020
Is that all? I'll make it happen for you.

315
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,060
Tonight we'll host your solo show.

316
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,360
Do you mean it?

317
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,440
Really?

318
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,460
Come on, say thanks.

319
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,960
Grandma.

320
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,640
Go for it!

321
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,340
Go for it!

322
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,600
 
Don't miss this!

323
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,840
Qiao Mai Mai's solo show.
Bring a friend, get a free beer.

324
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,200
Bring two friends, get two beers.

325
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,120
Welcome!

326
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,900
She's not a waitress anymore.
She's a singer at Jubaoshi now.

327
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,860
Share photos.

328
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,820
Qiao Mai Mai has big dreams.

329
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,740
She'll tour nationwide someday.

330
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,600
As her support team,
we hope you'll all cheer for Qiao Mai Mai.

331
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,020
- Give every dream a stage.
- Exactly.

332
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,220
- Holding onto dreams isn't easy these days.
- Right?

333
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,720
We're locals. We need to support her.

334
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,360
- Thanks.
- I'll go gather more people.

335
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,900
Great. Thanks.

336
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,800
Appreciate it.

337
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,120
Buy one, get one free!

338
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,680
Welcome!

339
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,260
Why look at me? I won't drink a drop tonight.

340
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,300
Actually, I wanted to ask you
why Jia Yu didn't come.

341
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,960
This is a bar. He couldn't come
even if he wanted to.

342
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,260
I should've made it a restaurant instead.

343
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,740
Change it now.

344
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,740
- Changed already. 
 - Welcome. Support Qiao Mai Mai!

345
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,160
Come on in.

346
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,300
Don't miss out!

347
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,840
The solo show of Qiao Mai Mai,
Ningsui's brightest star, is tonight!

348
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,360
Does it feel like watching
our village's pride make her debut?

349
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,480
Good metaphor.

350
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:22,420
So? Earlier you felt out of place here.
Now fitting in better?

351
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,920
Come drink beer.

352
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,700
It's not just tolerable.
I'm starting to like it here.

353
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,060
Welcome!

354
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,600
I haven't felt this way in ages.

355
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,020
Grab some beers.

356
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,460
It's warm.

357
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,640
Come on inside.

358
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,960
You over there, come here.

359
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,440
Keep the music playing.

360
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,340
Young man, come here.

361
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,820
Qiao Mai Mai.

362
00:30:45,788 --> 00:30:47,940
 

363
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,820
Where to sit?

364
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,880
- Sit here.
- Thanks.

365
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,680
Slow down.

366
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,200
With this crowd, Mai's going to be famous.

367
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Later you need to hype up the crowd.

368
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,220
- Relax, leave it to me.
- Cameras are all set.

369
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,020
Let's get wild!

370
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,360
Can I drink?

371
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,600
You can, but you should drink less.

372
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,700
It's free.

373
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,340
Auntie? Why are you here?

374
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,440
Cool, huh?

375
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,780
- Not bad.
- They're specially made.

376
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,060
- Grandma.
- Hello, Grandma.

377
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,340
- This is my aunt.
- Yes, I'm her aunt.

378
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,040
Hello.

379
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,240
- Mai!
- Mai!

380
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,640
Qiao Mai Mai!

381
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,920
Mai! Mai!

382
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,160
Go for it!

383
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,300
Fly bravely, Mai. Your fans will follow!

384
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,120
Where'd you get that slogan?

385
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,640
I made it up. It's fan support lingo.

386
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,740
Go, Mai!

387
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,000
Mai!

388
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,600
First, thank you all for coming to my show.

389
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,020
Next I'll sing a love song.

390
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,820
Thank you.

391
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,180
Mai!

392
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,920
It looks great. She's cool.

393
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,440
 ♪ Rage ♪ 

394
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,860

399
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,740
So noisy.

400
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,120
I can't hear you.

401
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,260
Don't make Mai feel awkward. Pump up the energy.

402
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,060
Just yell. Mai!

403
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,120
Mai's so cool!

404
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,560
Is this her normal level?

405
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,260
I planned to send her to music school,
but clearly that's unnecessary now.

406
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,480
Let's go. Let's go.

407
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,460
Mai!

408
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,140
Don't leave! Everyone, stay!

409
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,920
Don't leave! Stay!

410
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,360
It's amazing.

411
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,820
This is considered good?

412
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,240
Mai!

413
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,940
- So sorry. I'm truly sorry. Come back again.

414
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,700
- Sorry about that. She just learned it.
- Mai's actually something else.

415
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,020
- Our bad.
- That qualifies for a debut?

416
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,980
That was awful. Worst singing I've ever heard.

417
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,800
She just learned it.

418
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,700
- Grandma. 
- What are you saying, young man? You didn't understand?

419
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,660
Shut it. That's rock music!

420
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,760
- Stay calm, Grandma.
- Have some decency.

421
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,500
Our apologies. So sorry.

422
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,200
- Don't stop me. I'm not done.
- I'll perform next time.

423
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,160
They're not wrong. Let it go.

424
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,400
Don't be angry, Grandma.

425
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,860
Mai.

426
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,250
Your singing's passable.

427
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,460
We'll reconsider the school thing.

428
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,200
Give your card back to me
for safekeeping. Let's go.

429
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,620
- Let's go.
- Go home with Grandma before you catch a cold.

430
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,960
Remember to give me the card later.

431
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,220
I'm leaving too. It's fine, Mai. You did great.

432
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,960
Mai, you're awesome. So rock'n'roll!

433
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,380
I need a photo with you. Come on.

434
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,080
Sir, you've got great taste.
Call me if there are future shows.

435
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,780
Absolutely.

436
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,420
I'm sorry.

437
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,170
I'm exhausted.

438
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,700
Let the world burn.

439
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,500
Mai was happy today. Grandma was happy too.

440
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,380
Ye Meng, thank you.

441
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,020
- Were you happy today? 
 - Of course.

442
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,720
It's been ages since I felt this happy.

443
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,420
Me too.

444
00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:39,830
 

445
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,080
What are you doing?

446
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,340
Morning, boyfriend.
Nice weather today. What are you doing?

447
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,520
I'm doing nothing.

448
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,660
If you're free, take a photo of me.

449
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,260
Sure.

450
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,780
Walk faster.

451
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,020
Coming.

452
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,200
So lethargic this early? Take a photo of me.

453
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,360
Come on.

454
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,520
No, get that candid shot of me walking naturally.

455
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,040
Alright, got it.

456
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,490
- One, two, three. 
- One, two, three.

457
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,520
One, two, three.

458
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,920
Done.

459
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,480
- Move your hand.
- What's wrong?

460
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,940
Look at this photo. Is this how you see me?

461
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,040
My head's huge and my body's tiny.

462
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,520
- Looks fine to me. 
 - Fine?

463
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,860
Let me show you how it's done.

464
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,420
See? Do you feel the love in this shot?

465
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,680
Do you notice the atmosphere? The angle?

466
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,440
You're tall as a guy,

467
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,740
but I'm a girl. I'm slightly shorter.

468
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,860
When taking photos of me, you need to crouch

469
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,960
and tilt your phone upward to make my legs look longer.

470
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,720
It's an essential skill for boyfriends
when traveling with their girlfriends.

471
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,760
You're not single anymore.

472
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,340
That doctor's pretty capable, huh?

473
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,720
What doctor?

474
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,360
Old Dr. Gao. Didn't he take these photos?

475
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,880
Old Dr. Gao? I actually feel bad
for him sometimes.

476
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,940
He not only got rejected
but also became a target for your jealousy.

477
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,100
What's that supposed to mean?

478
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,620
 Ye Meng, 

479
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,660
 let me take you home. 

480
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,780
 No need. I'll go back alone. 

481
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,240
 I know you don't like me now. 

482
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,940
 But I believe feelings change.
Do I still have a chance? 

483
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:02,640
 Dr. Gao, thanks for liking me.
But my heart's taken. 

484
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,420
So you rejected him that day? Because of me?

485
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,780
Stop grinning. You can't even hide it.
So pleased with yourself, huh?

486
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,200
Who's grinning? Not me.

487
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,660
What a male temptress, acting all innocent.

488
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,080
- Who's that about?
- You.

489
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,940
Speaking of which,
don't you think this yard's too bare?

490
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,940
Let me show you
my saved garden designs from Jiangbei.

491
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,420
Look. Beautiful, right?

492
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,940
Gardener Li, since I'm bad at gardening,

493
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,080
the yard's your responsibility now.

494
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,220
Gardener Li thinks your designs
are mediocre and too challenging.

495
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,040
Please. You're the only
all-rounder man in this family.

496
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,220
I truly believe you excel at everything.

497
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,660
- The yard will be stunning under your care. 
 - Stop.

498
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,360
I'll do it, but what's my compensation?

499
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,520
Force-feeding me couple stuff this early?

500
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,640
- What are you two doing? 
 - What couple stuff? Let me see.

501
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,300
I didn't do anything.

502
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,040
What are you guys doing here?

503
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,340
I invited everyone.

504
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:25,300
The weather's lovely today.
I want the whole village to know our good news.

505
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,440
Do you have an oven at home?

506
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:40,480



507
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:55,346
 'You' - Xia Heng 

508
00:42:55,346 --> 00:42:57,518
 ♫ You ♫ 

509
00:42:57,518 --> 00:42:59,894
 ♫ The moment I see you ♫ 

510
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,109
 ♫ The moment I think of you ♫ 

511
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:09,710
 ♫ The moment I hear any news of you ♫ 

512
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:15,630
 ♫ My heart is touched ♫ 

513
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,790
 ♫ My mind is occupied ♫ 

514
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:22,254
 ♫ Go ♫ 

515
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:24,370
 ♫ Where to go ♫ 

516
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:28,298
 ♫ How to escape ♫ 

517
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:34,382
 ♫ Those memories of you ♫ 

518
00:43:34,382 --> 00:43:38,350
 ♫ Have drowned me ♫ 

519
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:44,466
 ♫ I can't let go ♫ 

520
00:43:45,714 --> 00:43:48,786
 ♫ I remain silent ♫ 

521
00:43:48,786 --> 00:43:52,270
 ♫ My words stuck in my throat ♫ 

522
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:58,350
 ♫ Maybe this'll end the sorrow ♫ 

523
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:02,511
 ♫ Pretending to be determined ♫ 

524
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:08,358
 ♫ I'm still trapped at the starting point ♫ 

525
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,395
 ♫ The most perfect lie ♫ 

526
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:16,451
 ♫ I even deceive myself ♫ 

527
00:44:16,451 --> 00:44:23,018
 ♫ If love means letting go Let's sever all connections ♫ 

528
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:25,662
 ♫ But why ♫ 

529
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:28,782
 ♫ The moment tears fall ♫ 

530
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:33,635
 ♫ I don't want you to leave ♫
