No, not helping is helping.

Why are you wearing a curtain?

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,320
- Does it look like a curtain? 
 - A pretty curtain.

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,290
Sister-in-Law, you look so pretty! Why haven't you worn that before?

Hyungnim, why do you smell like flowers!

46
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,040
Hyungnim...

47
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,600
Eun Ha.

48
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,990
Did you sleep well?

49
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,340
- He's so sweet. 
 - Wow, so handsome.

50
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,680
I slept well, too.

51
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,550
Have a seat.

52
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,540
What are you doing, Hyungnim?

53
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,760
Sit down.

54
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,140
What's going on?

55
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,490
Let's have some breakfast together.

56
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,370
We haven't said grace yet, Hyungnim.

57
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,190
Oh, really? Good. Go ahead.

58
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,490
Oh, okay.

59
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,510
Here we go.

60
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,800
Thank you for letting us all be together to share this meal...

61
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,780
Huh?

62
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,710
We will enjoy this meal...

63
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,340
and gain the strength to live another day...

64
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,070
Wow, having so much fun...

65
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,740
Yes, I am having a lot of fun.

66
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,270
The strength...

67
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,710
They are strong... yes, they have been—

68
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,300
Stop being strong! Why is grace taking so long?

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,980
Yes. I'm happy that they're happy.

70
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,890
They look good. I mean the food. Let's wrap it up here. Amen.

71
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,650
- Amen. 
 - Let's eat.

72
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,800
- Why was that so wordy? 
 - What is this?

73
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,440
It's dripping with honey!

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,260
Did a bee poop here?

75
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,610
- It's a miracle. 
 - Where's Il Yeong?

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,930
 Two lines mean pregnant, for sure. 

77
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,120
Have a good day.

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,440
Okay. I'm leaving now.

79
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,460
You've been saying that forever.

80
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,790
I'm actually leaving now.

81
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,650
You're going to be late. Go on! What if someone sees us?

82
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,390
It's just me. No one else is here.

83
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,840
- Go. 
 - Hyungnim!

84
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,610
Hyungnim! The car is waiting. Why aren't you coming down?

85
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,430
What's the rush? It's only been a few minutes.

86
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,530
It's been an hour, Hyungnim!

87
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,650
Oh, really? All right. Let's go.

88
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,590
- Wait a second, Hyungnim. 
 - W-W-What?

89
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,020
- Little Rat. 
 - Yes?

90
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,050
Why is your face so red?

91
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,810
I'm feeling under the weather. Maybe it's the flu.

92
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,150
- I'll get some rest. 
 - Really? Go get some rest.

93
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,360
Go, go.

94
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,610
Go! Hyungnim, let's go—

95
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,250
What?

96
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,340
I feel like I interrupted something.

97
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,400
 I'll be home early. 

98
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,230
He's impossible.

99
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,760

 Rejected. Rejected. Rejected! 

102

Should we catch a turtle? Wow...

103
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,290
Wow! We got it!

104

 Your previous subscriber numbers are too low.

I'm an octopus monster!

106
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,990
 It'll be hard to gain subscribers with this type of play. 

107
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,430
 Rejected. 

108

 Let's go, baby! 

112
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,420
 Let's go, baby! 

113
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,540
Aigoo, my baby, have you eaten?

114
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,270
Okay? Daddy will be home tonight before the baby goes to sleep.

115
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,560
It's okay if I come home after the baby is asleep?

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't wake up the baby. That might be hard, but I'll try.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,050
Okay, see you tonight, tomorrow, and the day after that.

118
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,890
Thank you for seeing me every day.

119
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,030
I love you!

120
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,910
Why are you looking at me like that?

121
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,090
Nothing.

122
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,730
Do you still have the data on the Thirsty Deer employees?

123
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,600
I do, but why do you need it at this point?

124
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,430
 I'll call it a night, Prosecutor. 

125
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,330
 I decided to keep living here. 

126
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,140
I think I'll feel a little better...

127
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,790
if I know what kind of people they are.

128
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,140
Also, during work hours, please keep personal calls brief.

129
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,780
That was very brief.

130
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,050
   

131
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,170
- What are you doing? 
 - You scared me!

132
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,300
Hey, Hyungnim is acting strange.

133
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,360
Hyungnim keeps smiling to himself.

134
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,940
   

135
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,530
He was looking at his phone the entire commute.

136
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,740
Even at the office, he's doing that.

137
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,930
Chuckling like a balloon deflating.

138
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,120
- Dong Hee. 
 - Yes?

139
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,350
Have you ever seen him smile like that?

140
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,180
No.

141
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,550
Do you think he's sick?

142
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,830
Go to work. Dong Hee, you, too.

143
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,330
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

144
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,020
   

145
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,580
Are you that happy?

146
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,350
What?

147
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,130
Hey, you!

148
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,580
- You... 
 - It's a matter of time until you get caught.

149
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,560
Why did you leave the house so early this morning?

150
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,450
It makes me look like I abuse my employees.

151
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,790
I had some things to take care of.

152
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,740
What things?

153
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,730
Is something bothering you?

154
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,860
Want anything?

155
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,370
It's okay.

156
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,970
How old are you?

157
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,620
Five.

158
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,770
Five...

159
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,080
Your mom will be here soon.

160
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,770
- Noona! 
 - Oh, Hong Gi!

161
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,810
I had a meeting nearby...

162
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,730
and thought I might straighten my hair. Wow, it's nice here.

163
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,230
Is that your secret son?

164
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,630
He's a client's son! Are you crazy?

165
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,040
Oh, a client's son. A little guest.

166
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,880
You're so cute! What are you doing?

167
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,000
Looking at your phone up close is bad for your eyes.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,160
You have to work out your eyes like me. Look.

169
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,090
Wow. You're so good with kids. I didn't think you guys would be good at that.

170
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,340
Kids are scared of us, but the guys at my house all love kids.

171
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,080
Oh, except for Il Yeong.

172
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,170
He doesn't like kids?

173
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,490
It's not that he doesn't like them. He's just not interested in those kinds of relationships.

174
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,480
He's staunchly anti-family.

175
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,420
- Staunchly anti-family? 
 - Yeah.

176
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,120
Maybe because he never had one.

177
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,810
You must know from meeting him, but he's a very clear person.

178
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,600
He doesn't like having strings attached or complicated relationships.

179
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,030
What do you mean, he's never had a family?

180
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,600
Well...

181
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,520
It's personal.

182
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,640
I need to check with someone whether something is true.

183
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,470
- But I'm not qualified to ask. 
 - Why not?

184
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,130
Because I...

185
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,200
hurt her feelings.

186
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,390
Is this something that you just need to check,

187
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,550
or does the issue begin from there?

188
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,270
It begins from there.

189
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,940
Then go apologize and change her mind.

190
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,500
You can't scratch your own back, huh?

191
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,180
You're so good at giving advice, but you don't know what you need to do?

192
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,710
You told me, "Be honest."

193
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,700
You can think about whether you qualify after that.

194
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,880
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

195
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,140
This must be new.

196
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,710
Do you have another box of this? 
 - Yes, we do.

197
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,300
I'll take this.

198
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,000
- Sir. 
 - Aigoo...

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,410
Hello!

200
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,210
- Long time no see. 
 - We have lots of new things.

201
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,150
Really? It's been too long.

202
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,640
You have new stickers.

203
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,230
Yes, we have lots. Look around.

204
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,000
This comes in two colors?

205
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,560
- Ma'am. 
 - Yes?

206
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,650
How much is this?

207
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,310
 Where are you? 

208
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,740
 I'm shopping for materials to film with. 

209
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,140
 Filming? 

210
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,950
 I was going to tell you later. 

211
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,150
 I'm going to start a channel on my own. 

212
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,140
 That's good news. 

213
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,660
 Are you at work, Ji Hwan? 

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,840
Give them to me.

215
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,220
How did you know I was here?

216
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,530
I figured it out because I wanted to see you.

217
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,570
What in the world? You know how to pull off a surprise, too?

218
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm okay.

219
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,950
Don't worry about me. Keep doing your thing.

220
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,490
I'll just buy a couple more things then.

221
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,330
Okay, I'll carry your bags.

222
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,100
No, give it back. I got it.

223
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,550
They're very light.

224
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,350
You surprised me.

225
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,000
I haven't been here in so long.

226
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,610
You must be a regular here.

227
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,650
Yes. Wow! Cute, right?

228
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,790
Yes, cute.

229
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,740
Ta-da!

230
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,720
Cute, right?

231
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,620
That looks so good on you! Looks like you'll start speaking Japanese.

232
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,170
Like that guy from "The Age of Shadows"!

233
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,460
With the mustache!

234
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,360
- Oh, wow... not that. 
 - What did you say?

235
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,900
♫  Do I seem strange to you  ♫

236
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,780
Should we do couple headbands? 
 ♫  or do you feel the same as I do?  ♫

237
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,980
So cute! 
 ♫  or do you feel the same as I do?  ♫

238
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,610
♫  Or are you just shy?  ♫

239
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,210
- Isn't this pretty? 
 - Yes.

240
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,070
- It looks exactly like a real sky! 
 - Can't believe that...

241
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,020
Are you okay?

242
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,830
Hey, kid!

243
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,260
- I'm sorry. 
 - Were you scared?

244
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,180
W-Where's your mom?

245
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,750
Ho-ho-ho! I'm a bearded grandpa!

246
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,730
My beard is so long that it makes me sneeze easily!

247
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,560
Aigoo, my beard fell off!

248
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,040
What happened?

249
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,470
What's wrong?

250
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,820
Mom.

251
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,150
Don't cry.

252
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,990
Why did the lights go out? It's okay, it's okay.

253
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,820
Where's your mom?

254
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,590
- It's okay, it's okay. 
 - Where's the flashlight?

255
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,800
Where's your mom? Where did your mom go?

256
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,730
Where's your mom?

257
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,800
Where's your mom?

258
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,560
It's a dog!

259
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,580
What's that?

260
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,650
Should we go see what that is?

261
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,480
Thank you.

262
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,880
Nothing to be scared of.

263
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,630
Let's go.

264
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,730
Careful. Be careful.

265
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,610
What's that?

266
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,940
♫  Faint stars in the night sky  ♫

267
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,290
♫  You, who always seemed out of reach,  ♫

268
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,430
♫  Your gaze approached me  ♫

269
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:16,960
♫  As if time had stopped, I’ll remember this moment  ♫

270
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:26,790
♫  To my heart that was once shaken  ♫

271
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,760
 Woof! 

272
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,580
 Woof! 

273
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,190
♫  In my dream every day  ♫

274
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,800
 Oppa! 

275
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,640
♫  I want to be with you in every moment  ♫

276
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,400
 Guess what this is. 

277
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,940
 - A crab? 
 - Ding dong! 

278
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,740
♫  Every day, no matter where you are  ♫

279
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,100
♫  I’ll be by your side, I'll always be there for you  ♫

280
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:07,900
♫  I always be with you, forever  ♫

281
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,020
   

282
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,300
The shop's closed.

283
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,370
I came to see you, Mi Ho.

284
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,270
Me?

285
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,930
This must be the field you were talking about.

286
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,670
Where you play with kids sometimes.

287
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,790
Oh, yes.

288
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,300
Usually, no one is here at this hour.

289
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,210
I thought about what you said about being friends.

290
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,350
I don't think I can do that.

291
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,020
We don't have to.

292
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,280
I wasn't trying to force you.

293
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,830
Let's go then.

294
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,580
Do you want to go out with me?

295
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,100
I'm interested in you, Mi Ho.

296
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,230
 He's staunchly anti-family. 

297
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,060
 He doesn't like having strings attached... 

298
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,710
 or complicated relationships. 

299
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,260
What should I do...

300
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm not interested in you anymore.

301
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,800
What?

302
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,060
I told you I'm not into you.

303
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,010
I'm not interested in you anymore.

304
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,530
I don't want to go out with you.

305
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,620
By the way, where did you learn that thing?

306
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,500
The shadows. You were so good at it.

307
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,920
When I was little, I used to do it when I was bored.

308
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,350
Kids are so scared of the dark.

309
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,650
But no one cried. You were amazing.

310
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,600
I had an oppa who used to play with me when I was young.

311
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,760
Whenever I was sad or lonely, he played with me.

312
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,710
Thanks to him, those days weren't always so lonely.

313
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,200
So I wanted to be someone like that for kids.

314
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:34,200
Eun Ha, is he the reason you started this work?

315
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,130
That's right.

316
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,460
Just like how my oppa gave me the strength to live,

317
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,550
I wanted to make memories like that for kids.

318
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,830
Though I have a long way to go.

319
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,540
Let's go.

320
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,800
I think he must feel the same way.

321
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,450
Those memories must have...

322
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,100
kept him going,

323
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,780
made him strong,

324
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,370
and helped him survive.

325
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,500
Thanks for saying that.

326
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,240
Let's go.

327
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,840
Let's go!

328
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,100
Okay.

329
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,600
What else can you make with shadows?

330
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,110
Quite a few.

331
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,500
- What about a deer? 
 - Yeah, a deer...

332
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,400
Hi! I'm a caterpillar!

333
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,410
I love fresh leaves!

334
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,870
So yummy!

335
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,530
Okay. I'm going to shed my skin now.

336
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,290
Threads are coming out of my mouth!

337
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,660
Wow! I turned into a butterfly when I woke up from my sleep!

338
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,370
Friends, the caterpillar that used to crawl on the ground...

339
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,670
became a butterfly with pretty wings.

340
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,730
That's why you shouldn't judge another friend by their first impression.

341
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,770
I hope you can be the kind of friend...

342
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:37,560
 who patiently watches their friends grow and change. Bye! 

343
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,800
Wow, that was so moving.

344
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm going to leave the first comment.

345
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,530
What should I use for my username?

346
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,550
It's already so late. Let's get ready to go home.

347
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,860
Yes.

348
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,970
 Eun Ha Unni is back! 

349
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,800
 Friends, Mini Unni opened a new channel! 

350
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,100
 Come visit "Eun Ha and Friends." 

351
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,600
"Eun Ha and Friends"?

352
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,850
   

353
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,670
   

354
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:31,300
That was a moving video.

355
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,380
   

356
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,840
   

357
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,460
Very.

358
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,020
   

359
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,820
Good.

360
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,000
   

361
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,470
Why am I second?

362
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,580
 Congratulations on opening "Eun Ha and Friends." 

363
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,010
 That was a great video, worth the wait. 

364
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,100
"Justice"?

365
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,400
   

366
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,960
Emperor Penguin?

367
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,740
I also waited.

368
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,720
 You portrayed the journey of a caterpillar becoming a butterfly in your unique way. 

369
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,960
What?

370
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,650
I waited for you more...

371
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,700
 I think this is a fun and positive video for both kids and adults. 

372
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Who is this "Justice" person?

373
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,200
 Ji Hwan, I opened my channel. 

374
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,840
 You don't watch kids' content? 

375
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,440
 Then what do you watch? Do you subscribe to anything? 

376
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,840
 No, not anymore. 

377
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,400
Right, he doesn't watch this kind of stuff.

378
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,840
I'll tell him in person.

379
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,190
Oh, that's the Prosecutor!

380
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,180
 Thank you for your kind words. 

381
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,540
 You gave me the courage to start over. 

382
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,840
 I'm always grateful for you. 

383
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,400
"Thank you for your kind words."

384
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,690
Congratulations.

385
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,460
 Your generous and beautiful heart comes through in this video. 

386
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,300
 I hope many caterpillars gain courage through this video. 

387
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,000
"Eun Ha"?

388
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,250
"Emperor Penguin"?

389
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,950
Seo Ji Hwan...

390
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,420
Seo Ji Hwan?

391
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,860
- Prosecutor, the meeting— 
 - Hold on.

392
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,800
Seo Ji Hwan...

393
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,300
Hello.

394
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,070
Hey.

395
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,440
Wow, nice in purple. How are you feeling?

396
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,610
Where's the CEO?

397
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,600
He'll be here.

398
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,980
He knows the contractual terms, so don't worry. Should we get ready?

399
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,110
Sure.

400
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,430
Get ready.

401
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,650
Justice...

402
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,670
 Prosecutor? 

403
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,040
 I'm Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. 

404
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,670
 Prosecutor! 

405
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,500
 I like you. 

406
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,570
   

407
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,210
Justice...

408
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,290
Take a cookie. Thank you!

409
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,540
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

410
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,150
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

411
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,260
   

412
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,760
Hey, I'm working. Let's talk later.

413
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,500
Hey! This is not the time to be working.

414
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,490
A war has broken out on your quiet channel!

415
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,050
What?

416
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,730
A war? What are you talking about?

417
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,260
I won't say much. Look with your own eyes. Bye.

418
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,300
What is she talking about?

419
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,200
   

420
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,160
Why are there so many comments?

421
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,340
 I think your video editing skills have improved quite a bit. I love it. 

422
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,280
 Eun Ha, you're more beautiful than a butterfly. I really love it. 

423
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,570
What? You want to go at it, huh?

424
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,940
 I hope "Eun Ha and Friends" sheds its old clothes beautifully, just like this video. 

425
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,260
 "Sheds its clothes"? I don't know who you are, but that's inappropriate. 

426
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,870
 I'm talking about the process of metamorphosis 

427
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,220
 where an insect sheds its skin to transform. 

428
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,180
 I think you misunderstood. 

429
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,520
 Do you think I don't know that? 

430
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,200
 I don't think you do. 

431
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,350
 This is a space with kids. You should choose your words carefully. 

432
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,020
 It shows up in a children's insect encyclopedia. 

433
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,620
 I think you misunderstood. 

434
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,160
What? "Emperor Penguin"?

435
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,100
    
 Seo Ji Hwan?

436
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,580
Is Seo Ji Hwan "Emperor Penguin"?

437
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,900
Prosecutor.

438
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,100
- Yes? 
 - Would you like a fan?

439
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,220
If you're too hot, would you like some ice water or a cold pack before we start?

440
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,420
Hot?

441
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,320
I'm totally fine. Actually, I feel very refreshed.

442
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,720
Okay. It's late. Let's start the meeting.

443
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,730
Why aren't you getting ready? Let's go.

444
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,910
- Got it. 
 - I don't think so.

445
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,200
 Great work today. Thank you! 

446
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,600
We finished faster than expected.

447
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,200
Kang Ye Na really is a professional.

448
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,420
I prepared a lot of these for bad takes, but we didn't need them.

449
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,170
- Give them to me. I'll put them back. 
 - No, I'll go with you.

450
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,140
Great work.

451
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,330
Good work.

452
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,080
Don't just say that. Buy dinner tonight.

453
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,000
- I... 
 - If you don't want to, I will.

454
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,520
Everyone worked so hard.

455
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,860
- Should we all have a company dinner? 
 - Huh?

456
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,760
- I'm a little busy tonight... 
 - A company dinner?

457
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,550
Is that true?

458
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,710
Yes.

459
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,280
Kang Ye Na!

460
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,110
 Kang Ye Na! 

461
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,460
I'll find a good place real quick— Wait, no.

462
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,400
- Hong Gi. 
 - Yes?

463
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,160
Take her upstairs immediately.

464
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,690
We need to clean up around here. Okay.

465
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,050
We need to clean up fast. Let's all do this.

466
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,340
Sure. Let's go.

467
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,010
Let's clean up quick so we can eat!

468
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,670
 Kang Ye Na! 

469
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,790
Just stay through dinner.

470
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,760
Hyungnim, as the CEO, you have to stay.

471
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,870
Come on.

472
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,720
Il Yeong, we're having a company dinner—

473
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,530
What are you doing in the dark?

474
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,440
You scared me!

475
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,950
Scared the shit out of me!

476
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,670
What are you doing, dude? What?

477
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,200
What's wrong with your eyes? Did someone hit you?

478
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,770
Am I that untrustworthy?

479
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,200
- What are you talking about, dude? 
 - Or...

480
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,120
am I unattractive as a man?

481
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,890
Il Yeong.

482
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,510
I...

483
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,680
like men. No...

484
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,300
I like women.

485
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm sorry.

486
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,100
   

487
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,310
- Ji Hwan— 
 - It's red.

488
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,260
- Is something in my eye? 
 - What?

489
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,920
Unni?

490
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,720
- Sister-in-Law! 
 - What, Little Rat?

491
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,620
What are you doing at the office? Did you have plans?

492
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,440
No, I was just passing by. Are you all going somewhere?

493
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,280
We...

494
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,890
We're going for a company dinner with Seo Ji Hwan.

495
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,310
Want to come?

496
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,290
Me, too?

497
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,190
That's okay, isn't it, Seo Ji Hwan?

498
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,350
 - Prosecutor. 
 - Justice... 

499
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,190
 Thank you for your kind words. 

500
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,130
 You gave me the courage to start over. 

501
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,880
 I'm always grateful for you. 

502
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,550
 Hi, new friend. Hope to see you around often. 

503
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,510
   

504
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,540
   

505
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,440
   

506
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,450
   

507
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,760
   

508
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,730
   

509
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,600
   

510
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,560
   

511
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Seo Ji Hwan?

512
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,560
He malfunctions sometimes. Don't worry about it.

513
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,420
Little Rat, come on. Hurry up.

514
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,640
Sister-in-Law, let's go. I'm in a good mood.

515
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,100
Do you know the two-step you taught us?

516
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,760
Let me escort you while doing the two-step.

517
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,090
Dong Hee?

518
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,580
Yes.

519
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,140
Let's go, Hyungnim.

520
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,670
The two-step helps us travel fast.

521
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,820
Like this.

522
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,570
Anything else?

523
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,300
So...

524
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,100
as you can see, Club Cat's annual gross reported to the National Tax Service...

525
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,040
is significantly higher than the other top three clubs in Seoul.

526
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,520
   

527
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,720
The admission fees are not that different,

528
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,130
but isn't it strange that their monthly and yearly grosses are almost triple?

529
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,930
Did the Club Cat customers only drink and nothing else?

530
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,090
So a lot more money came in without the people spending there.

531
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,400
Not just the money coming in, but the money going out is also suspicious.

532
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,500
According to this, they're spending more than half of their revenue on liquor purchases.

533
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,040
I see.

534
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,120
Even if everyone, including the employees, got wasted every night,

535
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,860
this is just too...

536
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,400
   

537
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,020
It's a typical money laundering scheme.

538
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,710
You could say I'm the top in the country for money laundering.

539
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,940
Prosecutor's Office.

540
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,080
Got it.

541
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,770
Prosecutor.

542
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,680
The Chief Prosecutor wants to see you.

543
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,010
 Come in. 

544
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,420
Have a seat.

545
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,290
Busy these days?

546
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,910
I'm okay.

547
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,290
About the drug case.

548
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,340
I thought there was no more to it. Why aren't you wrapping it up?

549
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,750
While investigating the drug money,

550
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,500
we discovered suspicious cash flow from Club Cat.

551
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,140
I think we need to investigate further.

552
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,390
- Money? 
 - Yes.

553
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,980
I think the money we couldn't retrieve from Seo Tae Pyung...

554
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,410
is flowing into Club Cat.

555
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,700
Got it. You can go.

556
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,670
Okay.

557
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,740
It's me.

558
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,330
I have something to tell you.

559
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,100
Wow, this is so nice.

560
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,790
Thanks, Dong Hee.

561
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,500
Sister-in-Law, I can't believe we ran into you—

562
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,670
Man Ho, enjoy dinner.

563
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,840
You too, Sister-in-Law. Next to Hyungnim. Oh!

564
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,150
Thank you.

565
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,370
Kang Ye Na, have a seat.

566
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,900
Wow, I'm eating next to Kang Ye Na today.

567
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,580
Here. Have a seat.

568
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,750
I'm her manager.

569
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,410
Hyung, come over here.

570
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,220
Oh, okay.

571
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,810
Did you change?

572
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,240
Oh, you did!

573
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,840
I guess you change three times a day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

574
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,660
We recommend the course menu.

575
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,930
This course starts with a salmon crepe,

576
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,500
di mare tomato, followed by sangria and steak.

577
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,210
This course has shrimp arancini...

578
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,280
That's course A?

579
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,810
Yes. It's a good combination.

580
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,010
Wait, do you like salmon?

581
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,860
If you like salmon, the salmon crepe...

582
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,130
As for ordering food, he's the expert. Take our orders from him.

583
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,590
- Yes, over here. 
 - I'm sorry.

584
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,540
That scared me.

585
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,890
Since the placemat is here, I'll move over slightly...

586
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,400
I'll take my time looking over before ordering.

587
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,930
Seo Ji Hwan, how did I do today?

588
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,230
You were watching the whole shoot.

589
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,070
You were great.

590
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,300
She wasn't just great!

591
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,450
Because you're such a shining star, our sausages were glowing!

592
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,230
You were dazzling.

593
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,170
Now that we have proper ads, our profits will go up, right?

594
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,090
If I may say so myself, but when this video hits?

595
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:35,000
It's going to cause a riot. Thanks to Kang Ye Na!

596
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,300
She hasn't changed at all.

597
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,250
It's fantastic.

598
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,050
Oh, I noticed you started a new channel.

599
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,040
Huh?

600
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,730
- Little Rat started something? 
 - Noona, you started a channel?

601
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,580
Well...

602
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,610
Yes. I started one on my own.

603
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,840
I only posted one video. I was going to tell you when I had more.

604
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,280
Why didn't you tell us? What's it called?

605
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,920
"Eun Ha and Friends."

606
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,540
"Eun Ha and Friends"?

607
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,590
- That's good! 
 - What is it?

608
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,140
- Let me look it up. 
 - Oh, I see it.

609
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,820
But you were part of Macaron.

610
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,930
You got a good number of subscribers, right?

611
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,930
Of course, at least 10,000!

612
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,520
   

613
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,330
Eighty-seven people.

614
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,790
Eighty-seven people?

615
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,210
Eighty-seven people in a day is amazing! That's not far off from hers.

616
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,630
How many do you have?

617
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,980
8.7 million.

618
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,040
That's just a difference of one decimal place!

619
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,200
There's a million at the end. Come on, be quiet.

620
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,640
As I post more content, I'll promote it, too. Working hard.

621
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,260
Do you have a studio to film in?

622
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,040
Market research, analysis of competing channels, positioning, and promotion strategy.

623
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,390
You thought of all that before starting, right?

624
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,490
You don't think this work is so easy that you'd jump in without doing any prep.

625
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,060
Excuse me.

626
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,630
If she thought it was easy, she wouldn't be rolling on the ground until her hands were scraped.

627
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,770
Seo Ji Hwan is...

628
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,730
- a lifesaver to me. 
 - What?

629
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,620
You've only known him for three months, right?

630
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,960
I've known him for eight years.

631
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,340
- Eight years? 
 - Since the day he saved me eight years ago,

632
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,230
there hasn't been a day where I haven't thought of him.

633
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,230
Every time things were hard, and I wanted to give up,

634
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,730
I thought of him and kept going.

635
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,930
Being happy is good enough for you, in work or in love, right?

636
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,360
I'm different.

637
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,760
CEO Ma was so against it,

638
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,640
but I insisted on working for Thirsty Deer.

639
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,780
I'm ready to risk everything.

640
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,110
I didn't know about your story.

641
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,490
But Ye Na.

642
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,170
I don't think my feelings for Seo Ji Hwan...

643
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,970
are less than yours.

644
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,490
Rather than be jealous that you're modeling for his company,

645
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:40,460
since you're a great model and a great content creator,

646
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,370
I'm glad for Seo Ji Hwan.

647
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,890
I like him so much that I'm genuinely happy for him.

648
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,150
Thank you.

649
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,620
Why did you do that? You're already so successful.

650
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,700
Are you mocking me, too?

651
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,840
Why would I mock you? It's just facts.

652
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,260
You're a success, so stop wasting your energy on torture.

653
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,440
When did I torture her?

654
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,940
No, yourself.

655
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,740
Stop torturing yourself.

656
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,100
Your heels are scraped.

657
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,160
You filmed all day long wearing high heels.

658
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,200
But why would you change for someone who doesn't even notice?

659
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,700
Why did you change your shoes? Your feet must hurt.

660
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,530
10,000 won.

661
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,370
I'm kidding. Take it.

662
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,590
No thanks.

663
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:54,110
Oh, good. I only had one. I was going to sell it for 50,000. Good.

664
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,540
I'll use it later.

665
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,660
Stop looking.

666
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,380
I might get attached. What if we get attached or something?

667
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,810
I don't want that.

668
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,650
Me neither!

669
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,380
Okay.

670
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,580
   

671
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,720
 Your name is Mi Ho, right? Mi Ho Hair. 

672
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,610
 Your shoelaces were untied. 

673
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,400
 So all three times you've been here, Hyungnim has sent you. 

674
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,800
 Just saying. 

675
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,530
 - Mi Ho, are you okay? 
 - Have you... 

676
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,280
 eaten? 

677
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,790
 Did I eat? 

678
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,240
 Grab the tail and lift it up. 

679
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,960
 Here. 

680
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,510
 Thanks. 

681
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,300
 My mom used to do it for me every day. 

682
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:44,080
   

683
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,510
 That night wasn't a mistake for me. 

684
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,470
 I liked you from the moment we met. 

685
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,740
 I slept with you because I liked you. 

686
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,400
 But that's how I feel. 

687
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,230
 If you don't feel the same way, I won't push it. 

688
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,250
 A guy who calls it a "mistake" like a coward? 

689
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,530
 I'm not into it, either. 

690
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:35,050
There are so many comments.

691
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,590
"Very moving." What?

692
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,980
 "That was a very moving video." 

693
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,270
"Your generous and beautiful heart comes through in this video, Eun Ha."

694
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,400
 "I hope many caterpillars gain... 

695
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,430
- courage." Courage? 
 - Stop it.

696
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,880
- Courage! 
 - Stop reading.

697
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,380
Okay, okay. Why not?

698
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,460
I like that you thought it was moving, Ji Hwan.

699
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,260
- Are you mad? 
 - If you liked it, why was your response so short?

700
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,230
You wrote 38 words for him.

701
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,990
If I had known it was you, I would have made it way longer.

702
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,660
We commented within a second of each other, but it took you a difference of 42 minutes to respond.

703
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,360
I didn't want to be late to work.

704
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:23,250
Okay, I won't respond late, and I'll make it long moving forward.

705
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,440
You gave him a smiley face.

706
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,220
Smiley face? Oh, like this?

707
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,940
- Blinking? 
 - What is that?

708
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,850
Smiley face! What else do you like? Finger hearts?

709
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,860
Finger hearts?

710
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,590
Cheek heart?

711
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,360
Big heart?

712
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,390
Okay. From now on, you're first, Seo Ji Hwan.

713
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,550
Promise.

714
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,910
- Just don't get hurt. 
 - Your fingers are so long.

715
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,320
Maybe because you're a penguin.

716
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,450
You're not just an average penguin. You're an emperor penguin.

717
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:57,530
Royal family.

718
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:00,190
If you're the emperor,

719
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,860
am I the empress?

720
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,400
Stop it. You're too cute.

721
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,970
   

722
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,030
Wow, seriously.

723
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,450
Give me a break.

724
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,290
I should congratulate her, right?

725
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:30,180
   

726
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,660
Eun Ha Unni! I want to meet you so badly!

727
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,980
I'll see you soon!

728
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,910
Heart.

729
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,210
I gave them a friendly warning, so...

730
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:49,550
I should head out soon.

731
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,600
I checked the security camera footage that you requested.

732
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,280
You were right, CEO.

733
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,900
A suspicious person wearing a hat circled the neighborhood for two hours,

734
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,410
took photos, then disappeared.

735
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,240
- Anything besides that day? 
 - No.

736
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,160
I checked a month's worth of footage.

737
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,830
This is the only day he showed up.

738
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,110
   

739
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,950
Content...

740
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:26,000
Content, content, my own content.

741
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,860
A unique concept.

742
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,960
Ye Na's right. I used to have Macaron Soft's structure,

743
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,200
but now I need to make my own.

744
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,740
What would be good?

745
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,090
   

746
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,910
How cute.

747
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,860
He means he can't wait for the next video.

748
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:06,850
Unni likes Meow's heart!

749
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,860
   

750
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,590
Yes, Ji Hwan.

751
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,090
Today?

752
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,950
Nothing much except going out to buy materials.

753
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,780
Go with Dong Hee?

754
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:46,600
Dong Hee, CEO must not have outside meetings today.

755
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,810
He does, but he's going by himself. He asked me to help you.

756
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,310
I can take the bus.

757
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,590
Want to stop by a good bakery on the way?

758
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,090
- My treat. 
 - Okay.

759
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,650
I'll do it.

760
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,550
Thank you.

761
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:21,560
   

762
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,610
Dong Hee.

763
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,830
   

764
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,460
One to go, please.

765
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,590
The Madeleine set and the chocolate roll cake.

766
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,160
Prosecutor!

767
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,550
- Eun Ha! 
 - My gosh.

768
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,690
Why are...

769
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,530
Dong Hee!

770
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,360
What? Do you know each other?

771
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,360
Well...

772
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:14,050
I never imagined you and Dong Hee knew each other.

773
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,580
I actually found out about this bakery from Dong Hee.

774
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,180
- I'm going to use the restroom. 
 - Go ahead.

775
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,130
What a small world.

776
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,490
- Try it! 
 - It's okay.

777
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:34,810
 Why did you pick this one? 

778
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,550
    
 - The sausage bread is the best here.

779
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,800
It's too much.

780
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,380
The sausage bread is the best.

781
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,710
Oh, I enjoyed your video.

782
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,960
I enjoyed your comments.

783
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,920
I was just going to congratulate you, but...

784
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,320
that would be childish, wouldn't it?

785
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,050
No. Thanks to you, the comment section was quite rich.

786
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,880
It looked like I have die-hard fans.

787
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,580
I've been a die-hard fan since I followed you when you were Mini Unni.

788
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,320
If you hadn't given me the courage,

789
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,660
it would have taken me longer.

790
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,250
I'm really grateful.

791
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,900
It's nothing.

792
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:29,280
You would have made it happen, even after some time.

793
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,530
Congratulations.

794
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:32,660
Thank you.

795
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:42,110
I wasn't sure, but it is you.

796
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,810
How dare you show your face here!

797
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:46,860
How dare you come here, bastard!

798
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,760
After what you did to my sister, how dare you come back?

799
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,510
- Dong Hee! 
 - Dong Hee...

800
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,920
What are you going to do about my sister?

801
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,970
Dong Hee!

802
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,570
   

803
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,370
 What are you going to do about my sister? 

804
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,950
 Your call cannot be connected. After the tone... 

805
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,030
 Your call cannot be connected. After the tone... 

806
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,770
- Prosecutor. 
 - Eun Ha.

807
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,650
I can't find him. He's not answering his phone, either.

808
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,700
Don't worry too much. I'm sure it's not too serious.

809
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,550
His car is still here.

810
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:25,530
Do you know anything, Prosecutor?

811
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,440
That neighborhood...

812
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,620
is where Dong Hee used to live.

813
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,800
Even though he had to leave.

814
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,330
When was that?

815
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:41,680
When he was in high school, so about four or five years ago.

816
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,030
Did something happen back then?

817
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,050
Dong Hee.

818
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,090
- Dong Hee! 
 - Teacher.

819
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:11,200
- Prosecutor. 
 - Are you all right?

820
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,650
What happened? You weren't answering your phone.

821
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:18,160
I was talking to a friend.

822
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,670
It got late, and I couldn't call you back.

823
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,400
If nothing happened, it's okay.

824
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,480
It's good that nothing happened.

825
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,790
Hey, Little Rat.

826
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:33,070
Dong Hee. What are you doing here?

827
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,670
Who's this?

828
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:37,510
- Oh, he... 
 - What?

829
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,630
From the park!

830
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,850
All right.

831
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,810
What's your relationship with Little Rat?

832
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,950
If you drove her home, there's something there.

833
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,910
Who's Little Rat? Is that you, Eun Ha?

834
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:09,370
It's my nickname.

835
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,880
Wow, Man Ho!

836
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,570
- What's this? 
 - A hedgehog.

837
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,260
Try it.

838
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,610
I'm okay.

839
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,750
It's good, try it.

840
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:27,100
He says he's fine. Give it to me. Little Rat, eat.

841
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,300
- Me? 
 - Eat.

842
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,280
Thanks.

843
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:35,530
Come on. Come on now.

844
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,980
- I'll clean up. 
 - Don't eat off the floor.

845
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,240
- Dong Hee. 
 - You shouldn't.

846
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,830
Get a new one, Man Ho.

847
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,960
Eat a new one.

848
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,050
You two seem very close.

849
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:51,570
Us? We're super tight.

850
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,430
- We stick together. 
 - We're inseparable.

851
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,270
- We can't. 
 - They're tight.

852
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:59,040
How long have you all lived together?

853
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,000
Hyungnim took us in one by one.

854
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,100
Hey, hey, hey.

855
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,370
Close that mouth.

856
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:09,310
We ask the questions.

857
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,370
What do you do? Do you have a job?

858
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,700
Yes. I'm a prosecutor.

859
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,960
A prosecutor*? Like you examine bad car parts? 
  (T/N: sounds like "examine" or "check") 

860
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,960
A prosecutor?

861
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,240
Hyungnim...

862
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,690
This is very uncomfortable.

863
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,100
I mean, it's not uncomfortable. Didn't we have stuff to do?

864
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,080
- Are you talking about a prosecutor? 
 - Prosecutor.

865
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,190
You're talking about the prosecutor.

866
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,050
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

867
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:38,650
I was rude. My tongue is also shorter than other people's.

868
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,410
The Prosecutor must be tired. Should we let him go?

869
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,900
 Sure, sure. 

870
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,000
- Should we go? 
 - Yes. Let's go.

871
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:53,440
You were home, Hyungnim? We didn't see you earlier.

872
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,140
What are you doing in this house, Prosecutor?

873
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,320
What happened was...

874
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,450
I was in the neighborhood to take care of something.

875
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,900
I happened to come inside.

876
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,900
What business do you have in someone else's neighborhood that you keep showing up?

877
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:11,200
In South Korea, one has the right to choose their actions freely.

878
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,100
It's called the Right of Free Will.

879
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,230
- He speaks so elegantly since he's a prosecutor. 
 - Hyungnim.

880
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:22,710
You must know it's not polite to come inside someone else's house late at night.

881
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:26,670
I thought it was impolite to keep saying no.

882
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,990
I'm sorry if it made you uncomfortable.

883
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:32,800
Wow, he's got such a great character since he's a prosecutor.

884
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,530
You all must be tired. I'll leave, then.

885
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,500
Eun Ha, it was good to see you today.

886
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,100
Thank you, Prosecutor.

887
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,930
Good night.

888
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,450
Get home safe!

889
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,190
- I'll make you tasty food next time. 
 - Eun Ha.

890
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,330
- Get the door for him! 
 - It's okay.

891
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:08,770
I thought you might report me for trespassing, but you're so kindly walking me out.

892
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,730
Just making sure the door's locked.

893
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:18,250
Just so you know, I haven't given up on Eun Ha yet.

894
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,180
I'll assume she's staying here temporarily.

895
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,730
Think whatever you want, but don't concern yourself over someone else's business.

896
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:28,210
It's up to me whether I'm concerned or not.

897
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,850
Anyway,

898
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,930
if something happens to Eun Ha,

899
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:36,420
I'll take her away at any time.

900
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,110
From what I can see,

901
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:56,430
he seems like a good guy the more I see him.

902
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:59,240
Do you think...

903
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,400
do you think, by any chance,

904
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,810
if things work out between him and Sister-in-Law,

905
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:06,960
we'll get a prosecutor in our family, right?

906
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,980
Hey, damn it.

907
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,310
It feels reassuring.

908
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:16,950
Reassuring? Noona and Ji Hwan are...

909
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:20,300
Geez, seriously.

910
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,940
Why was Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo here?

911
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:34,430
I was with Dong Hee when we ran into him.

912
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:38,590
Turns out Dong Hee and the Prosecutor know each other.

913
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:42,070
One thing led to another, and we got home...

914
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:46,560
One thing led to another, and we came inside...

915
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,450
Did you get all the materials you needed?

916
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,810
No. I didn't.

917
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:04,150
I think I need to go again with Emperor Penguin.

918
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,840
Okay. Let's go together tomorrow.

919
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,660
Okay.

920
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,000
Mi Ho.

921
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,930
I was about to call you.

922
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,440
I guess I just did.

923
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,600
Have you been drinking?

924
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,010
Yes.

925
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,440
I took a cab. That was good, right?

926
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,080
If you're drunk, you should go home. Why are you here?

927
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,410
Oh, that's...

928
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:28,540
I got some stuff for you. I didn't know what you like, so...

929
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,910
I got fruit, and...

930
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:33,790
some nuts...

931
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,800
- Supplements. 
 - What's all this?

932
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,500
I forgot to apologize.

933
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,120
I'm sorry.

934
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,880
But...

935
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,120
do you really not like me?

936
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,940
Is that why...

937
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:09,480
you don't want to go out with me?

938
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,730
I like you, Mi Ho.

939
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,590
Stop right there.

940
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,430
Dad.

941
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,300
You.

942
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,980
 We have to go. 

943
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,590
 - Hyungnim isn't out yet? 
 - No. 

944
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:10,640
Did Il Yeong come home and leave, or didn't he come home?

945
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,460
I don't know. I never see him at home these days.

946
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,380
Dong Hee!

947
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:20,570
Have some while you work.

948
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:23,510
Why just for him? Where's ours?

949
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:27,470
Sister-in-Law, this makes us sad. You have some for us, right?

950
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:30,770
- I got everyone the same thing. 
 - Right?

951
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,550
Man Ho, Jae Soo...

952
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,190
That's right.

953
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,570
- Hong Gi. 
 - Thank you!

954
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:39,450
- "Have a great day." 
 - Let's eat them here.

955
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,210
- What? 
 - We'll spill crumbs all over the car.

956
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,070
- They don't clean. 
 - Hyungnim, we'll wait outside.

957
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,480
- Fighting! 
 - We'll spill crumbs in the car...

958
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,180
Go, go, go.

959
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,320
I can't eat this. It's too precious.

960
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,610
- Fighting! 
 - Thank you for this. Fighting!

961
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,380
Go turn on the car!

962
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:02,990
This is yours, Ji Hwan.

963
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:07,070
You get a special heart.

964
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,940
Thank you, Eun Ha.

965
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,750
When did you prepare all these?

966
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:15,770
I'll come pick you up when we're done.

967
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,500
If anything happens, call me right away.

968
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,700
I'll call you first.

969
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,650
- Okay, then. 
 - Fighting!

970
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:25,580
Yes, fighting.

971
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,960
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

972
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,080
Get some rest. Have a good day at work.

973
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,960
Okay, have a good day!

974
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:36,600
- Why is my hand stuck? 
 - Is there glue on it?

975
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,560
- Bye. 
 - Okay.

976
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,300
- Okay. 
 - Bye.

977
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:45,160
Did you forget something?

978
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,390
I did.

979
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:48,360
What is it?

980
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:53,260
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

981
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,940
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

982
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:01,000
Our café just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

983
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,100
   

984
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:13,390
- Have you eaten? 
 - Yes.

985
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:18,270
- How's work going these days? 
 - It's going well.

986
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:24,060
I heard you and Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo know each other.

987
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,550
How do you know him?

988
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:29,220
He helped me a long time ago.

989
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,710
Helped you?

990
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,420
Yes.

991
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:38,460
He was looking after me yesterday.

992
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,600
It was my fault.

993
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,050
It wasn't your fault.

994
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:46,440
You're doing just fine, so don't worry about it.

995
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,450
Okay.

996
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,250
Bye.

997
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:52,220
See you later.

998
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:57,590
Prosecutor.

999
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:01,210
Prosecutor, have you heard?

1000
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,500
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

1001
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,700
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

1002
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,480
We just opened. Take a cookie.

1003
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,650
   

1004
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,590
Who are you?

1005
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,570
Eun Ha.

1006
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,420
Unni?

1007
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:21,990


1008
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:34,580
Ji Hwan!

1009
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:47,640
♫  In my dream every day  ♫

1010
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,300
♫  I want to be with you in every moment  ♫

1011
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:03,200
♫  In my way every day, no matter where you are  ♫

1012
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,400
   

1013
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,500
 We're not participating in the orphanage sponsorship event, are we? 

1014
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:12,400
 Play with the kids while you're here! 

1015
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,000
 You want to apologize, right? 

1016
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,500
 You mean it's just him and Sister-in-Law alone at home. 

1017
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,020
 Everyone, go home late today. 

1018
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:25,050
 - What? 
 - Eun Ha! 

1019
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,890
 Why are you watching that right now? 

1020
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,200
 Let's stop the child's play. 

1021
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,100
 Who are you? 

1022
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,800
♫  In my dream every day  ♫
