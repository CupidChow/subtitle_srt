1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,030
   

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,040
   

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,320
   

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,960
   

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,420
♫  Baby, baby, let me come along  ♫

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,460
♫  Every single day I belong  ♫

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,440
♫  Baby, baby, let me come along  ♫

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,630
♫  Keep you happy all day long  ♫

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,360
   

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:55,980


11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,960
   

12
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,410
 The phone is turned off. After the tone... 

13
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,560
   

14
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,080
- Yes, Chief Oh. 
 - Prosecutor.

15
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,890
Go Yang Hui stopped by the company and is going somewhere.

16
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,850
He's headed to Sangnam Liquor.

17
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:51,080
   

18
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,100
As long as you make up your mind,

19
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,360
you can leave.

20
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,590
Your mistake is that you were so busy watching Seo Ji Hwan...

21
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,460
that you never saw me.

22
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,660
- Chairman! 
 - Who is this?

23
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,350
What the hell, you bastards!

24
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,500
This is why you said a real son is different.

25
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,680
Everyone stop!

26
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,950
S-Seo Ji Hwan...

27
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,560
- Hyungnim! 
 - Seo Ji Hwan!

28
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,480
You bastard!

29
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,110
Hey!

30
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,020
Everyone freeze!

31
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,110
Put down your weapons!

32
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,420
Seo Ji Hwan!

33
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,440
Cuff him.

34
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,830
Seo Ji Hwan!

35
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,160
Seo Ji Hwan!

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,380
Seo Ji Hwan!

37
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,210
Seo Ji Hwan...

38
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,660
You have the right to remain silent...

39
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,710
Let's go.

40
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,560
Officer, call an ambulance!

41
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,590
- Call an ambulance! 
 - Seo Ji Hwan!

42
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,360
- Go! 
 - Hyungnim!

43
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
Ji Hwan!

44
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,990
Ji Hwan!

45
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,030
Seo Ji Hwan!

46
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,490
Seo Ji Hwan!

47
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,690
Hyungnim!

48
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,380
Hurry up, hurry up!

49
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,890
Hurry up!

50
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,880
Hyungnim!

51
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,760
Seo Ji Hwan, please open your eyes!

52
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,230
Hyung!

53
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,380
Oppa!

54
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,770
Hurry up! Go!

55
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,260
Go!

56
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,390
Hyungnim!

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,100
Hyungnim!

58
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,050
Hyungnim!

59
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,980
   

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,350
   

61
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,790
   

62
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,170
Thankfully, he's alive. However, due to brain damage from the bleeding,

63
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,130
he's in a coma.

64
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,210
We're keeping him alive through medication, but I can't guarantee when he'll wake up.

65
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,210
What does that mean?

66
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,150
You don't know when he's going to wake up?

67
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,900
He should wake up once the anesthesia wears off.

68
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,060
Doctor, you said his surgery went well.

69
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,810
If you need blood, take mine.

70
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,850
- We have the same blood type A. 
 - Hyung.

71
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,680
- Do it. 
 - Let's see how he does.

72
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,970
Hey! Take my blood!

73
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,080
Please?

74
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,830
What if he dies?

75
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,590
Why won't they take it?

76
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,320
Hyungnim...

77
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,580
Wake up soon.

78
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,380
Your brothers are waiting for you.

79
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,460
Please get up soon, aigoo...

80
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,380
Hyungnim.

81
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,760
Yes, Chief Oh.

82
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,920
How's it going?

83
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,790
One is talking too much, and one has his mouth shut.

84
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,170
 Go Yang Hui denies everything, 

85
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,590
and Seo Tae Pyung is silent.

86
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,340
 Lee Gang Gil is the only one talking. 

87
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,540
Got it.

88
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,510
I'll be there right now.

89
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,620
Everyone, go to work.

90
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,690
I'll stay here. Don't worry, go on.

91
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,220
Hyungnim is unconscious. How can we go to work?

92
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,720
Think of what the CEO would want.

93
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,760
Would he want us to worry endlessly by his side?

94
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,850
Or bravely go out there and do our jobs?

95
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,090
Do what he would want.

96
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,990
This is crazy.

97
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,460
   

98
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,130
   

99
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,180
You didn't say anything to the police.

100
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,850
Kidnapping, imprisonment, assault, profiting through criminal activities, violating legal protocols.

101
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,010
Violating aggravated crime laws.

102
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,670
So you're denying everything?

103
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,720
If Seo Ji Hwan doesn't wake up,

104
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,390
accomplice to murder will be added to that list.

105
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,190
He hasn't...

106
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,530
woken up yet?

107
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,880
You were scared, right?

108
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,660
It's okay now. I'll be by your side.

109
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,660
   

110
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,060
   

111
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,460
This room won't stay empty, will it?

112
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,340
Hyung...

113
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,500
You're not crying, are you?

114
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,430
No.

115
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,570
You said Hyung was really strong.

116
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,670
They say you can speak something into existence.

117
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,120
I need to hear it, like a spell.

118
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,850
Can you tell me again? That he's strong?

119
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,520
I just want to hear it from someone else.

120
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,760
Go to the Catholic church nearby and pray.

121
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,390
I'm not Catholic. I'm Protestant.

122
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm leaving.

123
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,100
Hey! Just say something!

124
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,390
Hey, just this once!

125
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,100
Seo Ji Hwan, Seo Ji Hwan! If that bastard wasn't there,

126
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,620
I would have killed that old man!

127
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,400
What?

128
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,600
Are you scared Seo Ji Hwan is going to die?

129
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,850
Look down. How dare you stare at me like that, you asshole.

130
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,920
You need to stop.

131
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,270
What did you say, bastard?

132
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,330
Can I get a new cell?

133
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,460
Please be quiet.

134
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,000
Can we switch cells?

135
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,790
Thanks. I'll call you. Okay.

136
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,020
- Who's that? 
 - Ye Na.

137
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,470
Are you guys best friends now that you did the challenge together?

138
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,680
So many people are worried about him and checking in. He'll wake up soon.

139
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,850
You're right.

140
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,690
He's a light sleeper. He won't stay like this long.

141
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,380
Hey, should I try to scare him?

142
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,150
What?

143
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,900
Hey...

144
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,500
Right. He needs to sleep in order to recover.

145
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,770
I was so rude. He's sleeping deeply.

146
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,690
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,560
He's not even frowning. He must be at peace right now.

148
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,940
I'm heading out.

149
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,420
Right...

150
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,010
Here.

151
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,540
You left it at home. I fixed it.

152
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,540
Thanks.

153
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,270
Eun Ha.

154
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,940
If you want to cry, cry.

155
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,300
Don't hold it in.

156
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,470
Don't hold it in. Just cry.

157
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,670
He won't stay asleep, right? He'll wake up, right?

158
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,050
Of course. It'll be like nothing happened.

159
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,680
He'll wake up soon.

160
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,870
He would never leave you behind.

161
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,040
 I was going to stop by, but I'm still at work. 

162
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,080
It's okay. You must be busy.

163
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,120
Still, I'll be there soon to get a victim statement from Seo Ji Hwan.

164
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,770
 Seo Ji Hwan said he would cooperate. 

165
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,690
And he always keeps his word.

166
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,120
Seo Ji Hwan.

167
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,620
Yes.

168
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,560
I'll be bothering Seo Ji Hwan for a while.

169
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,910
 It might be a competition between you and me over Seo Ji Hwan. 

170
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,430
I'll let you win.

171
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,410
 I don't want to keep him for myself that badly. 

172
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,400
 Let me just borrow him for a bit, 

173
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,000
then I'll...

174
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,450
let him go back to you.

175
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,520
I'm just getting your permission in advance.

176
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,190
Thank you, Prosecutor.

177
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,770
Thanks to you, Eun Ha.

178
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,570
   

179
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,350
   

180
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,570
   

181
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,120
I brought everything you asked for.

182
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,160
Oh, really?

183
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,950
Do you need anything else?

184
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,400
No. I can buy the other stuff downstairs.

185
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,360
No, I'll go.

186
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,230
I'll go. I need exercise.

187
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,570
Please stay by Ji Hwan.

188
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,350
Really?

189
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,780
She can't even take a shower...

190
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,700
Hyungnim.

191
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,770
Stop making Little Rat suffer here. Let's get up now.

192
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,400
Okay?

193
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,700
He's been through so much that his hair has turned gray.

194
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,400
Geez, I didn't mean to pick that one.

195
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,990
Wrong one again.

196
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,110
Are there tweezers anywhere? Right, I packed a pair...

197
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,030
Geez, I picked the wrong one again.

198
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,320
Not again...

199
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,840
It hurts.

200
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,300
Stop pulling my hair.

201
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,000
Hyungnim.

202
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,660
Hyungnim...

203
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,780
Doctor!

204
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,660
Doctor!

205
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,700
Doctor!

206
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,040
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

207
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,800
Hyungnim, you're awake, right?

208
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,490
Are you awake? Doctor! Doctor!

209
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,150
Hyungnim!

210
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,580
Thank you! Thank you!

211
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,960
Doctor! Thank you...

212
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,410
Thank you... thank you...

213
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,840
Jae Soo.

214
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,300
Yes, Hyungnim.

215
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,800
Quiet down.

216
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,850
   

217
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,450
♫  I’ve waited  ♫

218
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,780
♫  For your expressions  ♫

219

♫  On sleepless nights  ♫

223
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,220
I knew you would wake up.

224
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,550
I knew you would wake up...

225
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,990
I'm so late. I'm sorry.

226
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,180
No, it's okay.

227
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,620
It's okay...

228
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,990

234
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,340
- Really? 
 - What?

235
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,020
- Hyungnim is awake! 
 - Really?

236
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,170
- He's awake? 
 - Really?

237
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,460
Hurray!

238
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,390
Hurray!

239
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,450
See? I told you!

240
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,250
Eun Ha, thank goodness!

241
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,040
Got it, Hyungnim. I'll be right there.

242
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,400
Got it. I'll call you.

243
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,430
I'm so happy!

244
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,350
Oh, my gosh!

245
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,940
♫  My everything  ♫

246
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,710

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,640
♫  My everything  ♫

248
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,490
Whatever. 
    

249
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,190
 - Hell—  
 - Hi.

250
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,520
I-It's me.

251
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,020
Hyung is awake.

252
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,320
Thank goodness.

253
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,620
She's so icy.

254
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,590
It's charming.

255
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,550
   

256
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,850
As for being an accomplice to murder...

257
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,760
you won't worry about it anymore.

258
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,640
Let's start the interrogation.

259
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,520
Right. This necklace broke.

260
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,390
- It broke? 
 - Yes.

261
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,400
The day it happened, I was making dinner, and it just broke.

262
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,010
Why did it break out of nowhere?

263
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,540
But the weirder thing is,

264
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,960
you woke up when I put it back on. Isn't that weird?

265
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,940
Really?

266
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,250
Prosecutor!

267
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,990
Congratulations.

268
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,820
I'm here as number one on the wait list.

269
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,420
Are you here to get his statement?

270
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,800
I had a reservation.

271
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,790
I promised, so I'll let you have him.

272
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,310
What? What did you promise?

273
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,790
- You two can chat. 
 - Thanks.

274
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,610
Eun Ha, you don't have to leave.

275
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,330
Seo Ji Hwan, you're lucky.

276
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,370
If you had woken up a little later,

277
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,350
I was going to snatch Eun Ha away.

278
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,540
Who says you can?

279
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,830
Well...

280
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,220
Seo Tae Pyung...

281
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,010
admitted to all his crimes.

282
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,280
He was completely silent.

283
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,050
But when he heard you woke up,

284
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,420
he started talking.

285
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,640
He'll get at least five years or more.

286
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,210
I know it's been tumultuous, but in any case,

287
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,560
you can relax now.

288
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,830
How do you feel?

289
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,490
Do you feel a little better?

290
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,710
Where is my father?

291
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,070
In custody.

292
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,370
How can I feel any better?

293
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,060
I have the life I've lived.

294
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,150
I have the things I did that were wrong.

295
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,750
I know there's no end to this.

296
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,250
All I can do is...

297
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,570
work harder and live each day.

298
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,580
I'm here to say I'm sorry as your child.

299
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,600
Just as I'm not the child you wanted,

300
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,110
you're not the father I wanted, either.

301
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,780
I know the link between father and son can't be cut easily.

302
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,520
But if I ever see you again as someone different,

303
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,330
I want to fulfill my duty as a son.

304
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,800
I won't be seeing you again.

305
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,760
I don't expect anything from you.

306
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,800
Don't expect anything from me, either.

307
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,640
You are...

308
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,350
no longer my son.

309
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,600
Officer!

310
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,780
When you were gone, Hong Gi was great at something. 
    

311
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,740
That something? What could it be?

312
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,540
- Does he need to know? 
 - He can beat you, Hyungnim.

313
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,290
Hey, everybody. It's late.

314
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,640
Let's get some rest. You guys have work tomorrow.

315
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,970
Yes, got it.

316
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,490
But before we go! Karaoke!

317
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,400
Let's go!

318
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,940
- Are you in pain, Hyungnim? 
 - What's wrong?

319
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,600
My stitches feel tight. Maybe because I'm tired.

320
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,010
- Oh, no. Not your stitches! 
 - Take this to him.

321
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,180
Let's clean this up tomorrow. Go rest. I'm going upstairs.

322
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,540
- Got it, Hyungnim. 
 - Wait.

323
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,090
But before you go, sing a song even if your stitches are tight!

324
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,850
- Let him go, man! 
 - Sing a song!

325
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,940
Let him go!

326
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,300
♪  My heart  ♪

327
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,200
♪  My heart is touched  ♪

328
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,250
- ♪  My heart is touched  ♪ 
 - Drop the beat!

329
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,170
Drop the beat!

330
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,920
Done.

331
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,220
It hurts, right?

332
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,450
It's okay.

333
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,120
Done.

334
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,040
Get some rest.

335
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,270
Where did you go this afternoon?

336
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,390
To see my father.

337
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,150
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

338
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,480
♫  Faint stars in the night sky  ♫

339
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,150
You went through so much.

340
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,710
You must be tired. Go to bed.

341
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,990
Let's stay together tonight.

342
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:36,500
♫  As if time had stopped, I’ll remember this moment  ♫

343
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:46,770
♫  To my heart that was once shaken, you came back again  ♫

344
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:50,620
Eun Ha, I love you.

345
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,340
I love you, too.

346
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,870
♫  In my dream every day  ♫

347
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,790
♫  I want to be with you in every moment  ♫

348
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,730
- Subscribe... 
 - and like...

349
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,430
Please!

350
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,520
   

351
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,210
   

352
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,520
   

353
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,870
   

354
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,910
Do you want one of these?

355
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,300
He's the best.

356
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,100
Wow, look at Il Yeong. Was he always that smiley?

357
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,880
He's been all smiles ever since he met Mi Ho.

358
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,430
He's a totally different person.

359
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,820
I can't live like that, even if that means I don't get married.

360
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,690
Not "don't." Can't.

361
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,800
No, it's "don't."

362
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,920
- Hey, stop being jealous. 
 - I'm not jealous.

363
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,390
Who are you...

364
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,750
 even looking at? 

365
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,750
Aigoo, Yoon Byul!

366
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,440
- Miss Korea is here. 
 - Aigoo...

367
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,090
Hello, Miss Korea!

368
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,190
Aigoo, so pretty.

369
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,270
Aigoo, you don't like Uncle Man Ho.

370
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,730
You don't like Uncle Man Ho.

371
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,790
You like Uncle Jae Soo better. Aigoo...

372
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,500
This is who you're looking for.

373
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,060
We have to take photos.

374
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,960
She likes me.

375
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,470
We have to take photos.

376
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,430
I think she likes me.

377
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,380
Hold her so she doesn't cry.

378
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,160
What an angel. Aigoo!

379
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,800
- So pretty. 
 - You made her cry.

380
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,710
No, you did.

381
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,380
Here. One...

382
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,910
Hey, come here.

383
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,420
- No, no. 
 - Hyungnim, aren't you going to get married?

384
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,270
- Married? 
 - Right!

385
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,150
That noodle incident was already 10 months ago.

386
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,780
If he gets married, we all have to move out. Do you have a plan?

387
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,420
- Do we have to move? 
 - Yes.

388
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,440
Do we have to move?

389
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,300
We can't live in a house with newlyweds. We'd have to move.

390
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,600
What's mommy doing?

391
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,530
But we already live with them.

392
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,030
Then there's no need to rush a wedding.

393
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,520
That's right, Hyungnim.

394
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,100
I've always heard that it's better to date for a long time.

395
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,300
Yes—

396
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,730
Hyungnim.

397
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,190
- Hyungnim. 
 - He's doing that thing again.

398
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,740
Hey, let's go get ready.

399
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,110
Man Ho, go.

400
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,290
Excuse us.

401
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,630
One, two, three!

402
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,700
Eun Ha.

403
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,820
Aigoo, so pretty.

404
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,560
Let's take a photo.

405
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,230
One more.

406
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,620
Okay, okay. Look over here!

407
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,250
All right. One, two, three!

408
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,840
   

409
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,800
- Congratulations! 
 - Thanks.

410
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,500
All right. Here are the red bean and honey cakes you've been waiting for.

411
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,350
Thank you.

412
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,000
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

413
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,400
Would you like any japchae or jokbal?

414
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,870
Aigoo. It's fine.

415
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,670
- Thank you. 
 - I'm so glad.

416
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,690
Thank you.

417
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,150
- Sit down. 
 - My goodness...

418
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,350
Uncle Dong Hee is so handsome!

419
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,480
She fell asleep!

420
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,540
She fell asleep?

421
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,530
Eun Ha, why are you so busy these days? We haven't seen you around.

422
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,690
She needs to clone herself these days.

423
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,900
Her play study project is a hit. Everyone wants to work with her.

424
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,990
It's not like that.

425
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,070
She has more than a million followers.

426
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,610
Really?

427
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,330
When our baby is a little older, she'll play watching her aunt.

428
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,840
Aigoo, if you're so busy, when are you going to get married?

429
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,720
Me? Married? No.

430
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,830
I'm happy to just have a niece.

431
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,840
Try having your own child.

432
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,330
- Of course. 
 - You won't even look at our baby.

433
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,800
What are you doing standing here?

434
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,980
N-Nothing.

435
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,800
Yes, right.

436
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,200
- You got it? 
 - Aigoo.

437
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,220
- Our son-in-law! 
 - This looks so good.

438
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,170
You're a big guy. This is it?

439
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,400
- Join us. 
 - Great work.

440
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,370
- Not at all. 
 - Thank you.

441
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,640
Father and Mother, bottoms up, please.

442
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,950
Bottoms up?

443
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,200
Father, it's a special day for Yoon Byul.

444
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,600
Could you make a toast?

445
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,990
Oh, sure.

446
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,870
- Eun Ha. 
 - Yeah!

447
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,910
Are you ready for the event tomorrow?

448
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,310
- Almost there. 
 - Oh, really?

449
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,510
Eun Ha, Il Yeong and Mi Ho earlier...

450
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,500
Don't they look so happy?

451
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,150
They do. Il Yeong is a lot more relaxed now.

452
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,320
Right.

453
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,400
Maybe it's because they're parents. Mi Ho is different, too.

454
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,690
Speaking of...

455
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,660
Oppa, can you put those over here?

456
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,200
Of course.

457
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,900
These...

458
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,210
- Can I help with anything else? 
 - No, it's okay.

459
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,030
Okay.

460
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:48,770
Eun Ha, there was something...

461
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,140
you asked me before.

462
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,090
Huh? Asked you what?

463
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,510
Well...

464
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,420
One second.

465
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,920
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,140
I'll bring the materials. You can just get the kids ready.

467
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,050
We'll have the snacks that we discussed, right?

468
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,760
How many? One second.

469
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,290
One, two, three, four, five...

470
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,600
   

471
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,800
The refrigerated bulgogi that we developed this time is fresh.

472
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,860
The freshness is the core of this! Just like me.

473
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,030
 Oppa, have you ever thought about getting married? 

474
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,810
- Marriage? 
 - Yeah.

475
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,360
You're not that young, Oppa.

476
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,150
Right.

477
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,670
- Right, I'm not that young. 
 - No.

478
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,870
- Should we get married tomorrow? 
 - Sure!

479
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,310
Should I have done that?

480
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay.

481
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,300
The sauce, in particular, will perfectly suit the customers' taste...

482
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,800
through our collaboration with a big company.

483
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,910
Welcome.

484
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,960
Hello.

485
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,300
Looking for something in particular?

486
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,400
I'm looking for a small, twinkling engagement ring. I'm going to propose to my girlfriend.

487
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,700
I had an opportunity.

488
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,900
And...

489
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:22,370
this refrigerated bulgogi is made with pigs we raised ourselves.

490
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,390
I'm confident, Hyungnim!

491
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,600
That concludes my presentation...

492
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,600
for our new product, the refrigerated bulgogi.

493
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,880
Great work.

494
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,400
He's zoning out again.

495
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,700
I know how to wake him up at a time like this.

496
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,440
Good.

497
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,610
The refrigerated bulgogi...

498
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,810
Good. Great work, everyone.

499
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,600
Hey! The time!

500
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,870
Where are you going?

501
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,300
Well, Marketing Team Leader, write up the proposal and report it.

502
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,830
That was good. Move forward.

503
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,130
Hyungnim!

504
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,840
W-W-What?

505
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,600
Not frozen and suitable for customers’ tastes! From pigs we raised ourselves.

506
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,410
- I'm so confident, Hyungnim. 
 - Good, good. Great job.

507
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,520
It'll be an excellent product. Good work!

508
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,990
Hyungnim...

509
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,230
Hyungnim!

510
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,960
See you later.

511
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,230
Hyungnim gave us the okay, right?

512
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,760
Yes.

513
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,740
Was it Hongcheon today?

514
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,740
Chuncheon.

515
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,540
How come he works harder to be her manager than his actual job?

516
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,050
Tell him to be her full-time manager!

517
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,700
Sister-in-law is so busy.

518
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,890
   

519
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,700
   

520
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,590
   

521
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,970
Now, each team will be four people...

522
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,370
and total to make 20!

523
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,210
 Okay! 

524
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,620
Ready, begin!

525
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,190
Take a good look at the numbers!

526
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,340
We got it, too!

527
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,390
Each team is four people, right?

528
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,500
 Yes! 

529
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,260
Then the team that throws the most balls in that basket wins!

530
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,380
 Okay! 

531
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,550
Start!

532
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,160
Do your best to throw the ball into the basket!

533
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,430
   

534
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:53,040
♫  A story from long ago comes back to my mind  ♫

535
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:02,700
♫  See the moon, moon, moon, we were like that back then  ♫

536
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:10,790
♫  Your voice that I missed so much, will I hear it again?  ♫

537
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,950
 Isn't this fun? 

538
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,270
 - That was fun. 
 - That was fun. 

539
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,110
 Seo Ji Hwan. 

540
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,510
 Mini, why are you... 

541
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,310
 Having nowhere to go reminded me. 

542
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,320
 I have a lot of memories of this place. 

543
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,400
 Are they good memories? 

544
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,530
 Yes. They're good memories. 

545
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,930
 With a good person. 

546
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,110
 Eun Ha, don't fall asleep. 

547
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,180
 Eun Ha, wake up. 

548
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,950
 Out of everyone I knew, 

549
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,690
 he was the best person. 

550
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,500
♫  I'm finally almost near you  ♫

551
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,500
 Blinking? Finger hearts? Cheek heart? Big heart? 

552
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,090
 Not because of what happened to me. 

553
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:02,040
 Because you're not by my side when I'm scared. 

554
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,310
 I'm scared you'll never be by my side again. 

555
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,270
 I don't want to be somewhere safe alone. Why don't you get that? 

556
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:12,450
 I want to be with you wherever it is. Why don't you get that? 

557
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:16,110
♫  May it become love  ♫

558
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,890
♫  You  ♫

559
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,540
♫  You  ♫

560
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,870
Good job.

561
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,080
When I was playing with the kids earlier, I remembered things from the past.

562
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,440
When I first went to your house, I was so lost.

563
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,130
Thanks to you, I got to know good people.

564
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,830
So many joyful days piled up.

565
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:15,500
Now I'm doing what I want to do.

566
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,300
Oppa, you led me down a good path.

567
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,090
Thank you.

568
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,000
Eun Ha.

569
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,460
Oppa, you're getting a call.

570
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,160
What?

571
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
   

572
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,900
- It's okay. Take it. 
 - I'm sorry. One second.

573
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,510
W-What? I'm busy.

574
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,950
Should I call you back, then?

575
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,190
Yes, call back later. I was about to say something important.

576
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,160
By chance...

577
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,520
that important thing isn't a proposal, is it?

578
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,100
You're not going to do that empty-handed, are you?

579
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,320
Get out of there.

580
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,500
Get out?

581
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,610
- It's okay. 
 - You'll remember this moment for life.

582
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,970
You should do it after you're fully prepared.

583
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,620
Prepared?

584
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,510
Wow, Mini Unni.

585
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,310
I mean, Eun Ha Unni is dominating kids' events these days.

586
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:25,150
She's solidified her spot in the play study field.

587
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,570
Her content is good.

588
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,630
You're still watching?

589
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,100
I mean, I'm a subscriber.

590
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,260
Instead, how about you go on the blind date you blew off ten months ago?

591
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,860
My cousin's friend's in-laws' second cousin is now divorced.

592
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,480
She got married right after, and it was over in six months.

593
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,650
That's in the past. I don't think I can go back on it.

594
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,600
Then how about my cousin's friend's niece's daycare teacher's daughter's work colleague?

595
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,930
In terms of phrenology, MBTI, astrology, and even your blood type, you're a match.

596
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,370
But she's basically a stranger.

597
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:06,760
Six degrees of separation means you know everyone. Maybe you know her, too.

598
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,060
Meet her this time. I won't send anyone else your way.

599
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,500
I don't know.

600
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,850
Right now, I'm not interested at all.

601
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:15,660
You need to date for us to be happy.

602
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,490
Take your punishment for breaking your promise last time.

603
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,030
Right now.

604
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,180
- What promise? 
 - Write your name with your butt.

605
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,120
What are you talking about?

606
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,800
Since you enforce the law, you should keep your promise.

607
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,650
Officer, should he do it or not?

608
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,150
He must.

609
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,820
Please write your name with your butt.

610
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,260
- Get up. 
 - Seriously?

611
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,060
Get up!

612
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,240
That's how we abide by justice. Turn around.

613
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,130
Is this related to justice?

614
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:43,220
Of course, it's about keeping your word. Start with "Jang."

615
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,030
- Write it! 
 - Like this?

616
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,680
"Hyun."

617
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,310
- She's asleep. 
 - She's asleep?

618
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,090
Good job.

619
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,400
It's been so long since we did something special like this.

620
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,860
Your parents are coming tomorrow, right?

621
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,170
Of course.

622
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:18,570
They're probably soaking in the hot springs right now.

623
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,570
Then...

624
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,440
since it's been too long...

625
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,790
Gosh, too long?

626
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,940
It was yesterday.

627
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,120
What's that?

628
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,910
What? Dad?

629
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,140
Mom?

630
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,910
If you say that there, what do I become?

631
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:56,940
Was it so bad that we didn't even dip our feet in the hot springs? After we paid?

632
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,970
If you're that upset about money,

633
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,390
you should've soaked it until your skin got wrinkled. Why follow me home?

634
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,310
You took the bag with my clothes and left yours!

635
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,940
What happened? I thought you were coming back tomorrow. Why are you here?

636
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,060
I'm coming back to my own home. Do you have a problem?

637
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,990
Should we move out now?

638
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,230
Are you threatening me?

639
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,110
I like living with you, Father.

640
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:24,840
See! Our son-in-law likes it!

641
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,820
Right. I forgot something I needed to buy.

642
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,350
Come with me.

643
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,380
It's late. Let's get it tomorrow.

644
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,950
Hurry up and follow me.

645
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,470
Wait.

646
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,780
Is that wine?

647
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,450
Wow. How did you know I like wine?

648
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:49,490
No, this isn't yours! This is expensive. Very old!

649
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,420
It's expensive?

650
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,840
Really?

651
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,500
No. You don't know anything about wine.

652
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,100
Mother, I'll get it for you tomorrow. Have a drink.

653
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,880
Wow! Sit.

654
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,410
This is really expensive! It's 7— I mean, it's so expensive.

655
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,670
Read the room!

656
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,660
Aigoo, when did you even notice?

657
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,730
- Wow! 
 - Sorry.

658
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:13,350
To our family!

659
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:43,040
   

660
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,920
Do you want help?

661
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,010
I don't need help. I have a plan.

662
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:06,260
Dong Hee passed his GED and needs to prepare for his college entrance exam.

663
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,530
What should we do about his job?

664
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,250
I already told him that this week is his last.

665
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,450
You and Eun Ha have helped him so far,

666
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,910
but he needs to go to the academy and focus.

667
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,250
Let me talk to Dong Hee.

668
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:22,140
I think we could restructure the company's education support system while we're at it.

669
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,930
On top of tuition, we should provide living expenses.

670
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:29,650
See if there's a way to benefit those who want more education.

671
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,260
Work on it.

672
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,990
Got it. We'll work on it.

673
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,960
Hey, Man Ho.

674
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,720
It was 4 p.m., right?

675
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,850
I think so, but we've been here since noon.

676
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,800
We finished our teas.

677
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,800
Hey, Man Ho. I can't see out of my right eye.

678
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,950
I can't see out of my left eye.

679
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,880
The hairdresser said this looked good.

680
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,000
But do we have to do this to get married?

681
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,770
Right, Il Yeong said Hyungnim is proposing, so we should get mentally ready.

682
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,220
It's not them, is it?

683
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,500
- Can't be. 
 - No.

684
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,340
Don't look at them.

685
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,640
What is this?

686
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,100
I don't have one. I'll use this.

687
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,890
How's this?

688
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,540
Looks good.

689
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,870
They're here. Hello, Ma'am.

690
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,730
Hello. Ma'am.

691
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,300
Sisters, sit here.

692
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,120
Right here!

693
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,380
- Right here. Have a seat. 
 - So pretty.

694
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,550
Have a seat.

695
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,120
You're early.

696
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,120
Thanks for coming all the way here.

697
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,400
Let me introduce myself. I'm a man full of affection.

698
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,480
Jung* Man... Ho-ho-ho-ho. 
  (T/N: Jung means "affection") 

699
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,750
I'm quack, quack, Kwak Jae Soo.

700
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,700
Your names?

701
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,800
I'm Choi Cham Sarang.

702
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,470
Miss Choi Cham Sarang.

703
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,600
- How about you? 
 - Kim Shen.

704
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,670
- Pardon? 
 - Kim Shen.

705
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,850
You're Chinese. Kim Shen.

706
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,590
Oh, yes.

707
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,270
We love Chinese people.

708
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:04,050
Now that we've met, let's be frightened... no, no...

709
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,350
let's get frisky.

710
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,150
I mean, let's be friendly.

711
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,980
I prepared some jokes that ladies like.

712
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,090
Chinese people are working on knives.

713
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,620
Guess what another Chinese person said to them?

714
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,650
Oh, I know this one.

715
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,580
Hey, she's Chinese! Of course, she knows!

716
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,480
But we don't know. Tell us.

717
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,920
The person next to them goes...

718
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,580
Slice-zhuan!

719
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,710
What do French people say to make laundry dry faster?

720
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,790
- What? 
 - Dry Jour!

721
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,180
That'll make it dry!

722
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,800
- You know the actor Nam Do Gu, right? 
 - Yes.

723
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,920
He can't get on an elevator. You know why?

724
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,380
Do-ors are Gu-losing.

725
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:59,170
We're out of time. We need to go.

726
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,320
You haven't eaten yet.

727
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,810
It's okay. Something came up at work.

728
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,020
- Bye. 
 - Wait, wait.

729
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,310
We'll take you.

730
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,300
Have some coffee.

731
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,390
Excuse me! Cham Sarang!

732
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,890
You left this behind.

733
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,490
Keep it. Such schmucks.

734
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,480
Schmuck?

735
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,240
Man Ho!

736
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,400
They called you a schmuck. Hong Gi said that's a good thing!

737
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,260
Wow! Congratulations. You became a schmuck on your first meeting. Congrats.

738
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,550
She called me a schmuck as soon as she met me.

739
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,610
I even got a gift.

740
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,440
If she gave you her lipstick, she's giving you her lips.

741
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,440
The data you requested.

742
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,750
Yes, thank you.

743
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,800
Prosecutor.

744
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,100
Can I ask why you're still watching that channel?

745
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,180
The channel?

746
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,570
I thought you were over her.

747
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:57,980
I thought you gave up.

748
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,660
I'm rooting for her.

749
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,690
Still.

750
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,910
It's separate from letting go of her.

751
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,640
I genuinely want her to be happy.

752
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:20,400
Plus, I don't think I could develop such feelings for anyone else right now.

753
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:22,580
Okay.

754
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,580
Get home safe.

755
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,880
   

756
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,590
Oppa.

757
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:00,610
It's so nice out. Should we go on a date later?

758
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,670
You're busy?

759
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,350
It's okay. Next time.

760
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,750
   

761
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,290
Thank you.

762
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:19,480
Thank you so much.

763
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,690
No problem.

764
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,510
I'll see you at the event next Friday.

765
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,570
Sounds good. Great work today.

766
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,200
Your boyfriend isn't picking you up today?

767
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,660
He's busy with work today.

768
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,780
- I'll see you next week. 
 - Great work.

769
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,120
 I'm done with work. On my way home. 

770
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,850
He must be really busy.

771
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,680
Why is this here?

772
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:34,160
 Eun Ha, thank you for always playing with me. 

773
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,610
 - Play with me always from now on.  
 - What in the world...

774
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,620
Eun Ha.

775
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,320
Hey, Oppa.

776
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,800
You said before that I led you down a good path, right?

777
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,700
It's the other way around.

778
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:15,200
You always make me want to become a better person.

779
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,550
From now on, no matter what happens,

780
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,550

They went ahead to wait.

On the train to hell, I see.

810
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:34,170
Hello, Hyungnim.

811
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,700
Everyone ready?

812
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,620
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

813
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,210
Let's go!

814

Let's go.

815
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,160
Let's go.

816
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,020
Who parked in front of our house?

817
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,460
What rude bastard parked here?

818
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,490
It's a shiny car, though.

819
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,100
- Very shiny. 
 - What do we do?

820
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,720
I don't know. What should we do?

821
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,160
Eun Ha.

822
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,940
This is your car. A gift.

823
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,560
   

824
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,880
What's all this?

825
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,910
We took a lot of time picking it out.

826
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,570
Hyungnim paid for it already.

827
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:35,680
We just picked it out.

828
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,840
What a huge gift all of a sudden...

829
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,960
To congratulate you on your marriage.

830
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,740
Sister-in-Law, take good care of Hyungnim.

831
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,520
Just be honest. You're grateful you're not getting kicked out.

832
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,060
Yeah, right, right.

833
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:53,330
If Little Rat didn't say we could stay, we'd be on the streets now.

834
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,870
I mean...

835
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,510
we're genuinely thankful.

836
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:02,300
No one else has accepted us before.

837
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,770
Thanks to you, we know what it's like to be welcomed.

838
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,110
We got to be decent human beings.

839
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:11,700
We couldn't have imagined any of that. So, thank you.

840
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,000
Just take it.

841
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,830
Thank you for everything, Sister-in-Law.

842
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:21,930
What is this? Making me cry even before we take off.

843
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,700
If you're crying, use the wife.

844
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,700
Not wife, the wiper.

845
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,900
Anyway, come here.

846
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,620
Take a look at your car.

847
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,220
- Look, look. 
 - We should adjust the seats and mirrors.

848
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,590
I've never gotten a gift like this.

849
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:36,240
We picked the color.

850
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,500
Get in. Where's the key?

851
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,110
- Get in! 
 - Are you sure I can accept this?

852
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,670
We got a big car for a Little Rat.

853
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,640
Okay. Should we go?

854
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,370
Let's go!
