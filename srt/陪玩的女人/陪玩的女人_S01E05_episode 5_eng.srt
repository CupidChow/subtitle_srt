11
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,370
Prosecutor?

12
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,310
Eun Ha.

13
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,760
What are you doing here, Eun Ha?

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,720
What are you doing here, Prosecutor?

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,500
If I told you I was in the neighborhood to get some fresh air,

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,640
you wouldn't believe me. Right, Mr. Seo Ji Hwan?

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,930
Oh, this is

18
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,310
I'm Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,420
- Yes, I'm... 
 - There's no prosecutor

20
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,310
who doesn't know Seo Ji Hwan from Bulldog Gang.

21
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,930
I'm Seo Ji Hwan, and I run a meat processing company.

22
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,610
   

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,410
In the DNA database of former prisoners at the Prosecutor's Office,

24
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,500
we can search for your name, resident ID number,

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,490
and even your DNA. Yet you give me your business card?

26
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,410
How funny.

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,170
Prosecutor...

28
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,780
Did you get home okay last night?

29
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,220
Yes, I did.

30
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,320
That's good.

31
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,060
Wow. That's a pretty kite.

32
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,360
I think I can guess your name, little lady.

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,240
Pretty Yun. Right?

34
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,450
I was worried bad guys might be bothering you,

35
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,350
but thankfully, you were with a pretty unni.

36
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,240
Mr. Seo's employee is missing. We're looking for him.

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,610
Did he tell you what kind of employee he is?

38
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,170
Maybe you don't know this, Eun Ha.

39
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,770
But Mr. Seo definitely does.

40
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,630
How dangerous it is for you to come here.

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,090
The odds that Eun Ha would get hurt are...

42
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,490
I can think of at least three ways.

43
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:45,030
First, someone from a different group steps out of that car.

44
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,510
Second,

45
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,070
a different prosecutor or cop steps out of that car.

46
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,230
Third,

47
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,490
if you had a different intention or goal,

48
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,580
Eun Ha could have been an accomplice...

49
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,370
or a victim.

50
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,900
You have it all wrong.

51
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,840
Mr. Prosecutor.

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,000
She has nothing to do with me.

53
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,420
She owes me a small favor. That's why I brought her here.

54
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,790
This is good. You can go back together.

55
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,470
- You want me to leave? 
 - Yes. We're good here.

56
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,370
But Mr. Seo Ji Hwan—

57
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,320
Come with me.

58
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:54,200
Excuse me. Please like and subscribe! Pew, pew, pew!

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,570
   

60
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,000
While I was on my way there today,

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,500
I didn't expect to run into you at all, Eun Ha.

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,600
Honestly...

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,900
I was taken aback.

64
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,440
How did you end up following him?

65
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,130
What do you owe him?

66
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,530
You didn't know who his employee was?

67
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,330
Or...

68
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,410
are you being threatened?

69
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,060
No. It's not like that.

70
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,390
Aren't you...

71
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,550
afraid of him?

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,320
I know I should be.

73
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,320
I thought I would be.

74
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,380
But I'm not.

75
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,230
He was looking for his missing employee.

76
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,700
It may not be that simple.

77
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,550
You might be right, but...

78
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,580
to me, he just looked like an average boss concerned about his employee.

79
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,810
Seo Ji Hwan is not an average boss.

80
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,190
Why do you hate him so much?

81
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,100
It's not that I hate him.

82
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,430
It's because of what I've seen and experienced as a prosecutor.

83
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,890
People like that don't change easily.

84
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,890
So what kind of person do you think Seo Ji Hwan is?

85
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,800
The most dangerous person I know.

86
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,290
 Someone you should never get close to. 

87
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,660
Oh, by the way,

88
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,470
I called you yesterday, but you didn't pick up.

89
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,580
I was so busy yesterday that I didn't check my phone. I'm sorry.

90
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,390
You can ask me questions now if you'd like.

91
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,370
Can I ask you another day?

92
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,050
I want to meet with you properly and ask those questions, not like this.

93
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,810
Oh, really?

94
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,090
I have some other stuff going on tomorrow.

95
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,440
How about the day after tomorrow? Around 6 o'clock would work.

96
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,260
- Sounds good. 
 - See you then. I'll text you the location.

97
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

98
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,400
Hey, Eun Ha?

99
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,920
They like you.

100
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,570
What?

101
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,710
The kids who come to my office...

102
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,110
They like Mini Unni.

103
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,130
You should have some confidence.

104
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,710
It's not an easy thing to win people over.

105
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,320
I will. Thank you, Prosecutor.

106
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,030
Have a good night.

107
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,140
   

108
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,060
 Get out! 

109
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,580
 Ma'am, wake up! Ma'am! 

110
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,460
 Grandma! 

111
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,360
 Grandma! It's Mi Jin. 

112
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,000
 Grandma, wake up! 

113
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,770
   

114
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,640
It's me.

115
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,930
Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo.

116
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,020
Yes.

117
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,190
Got it.

118
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,600
 This is good. You can go back together. 

119
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,100
 - You want me to leave? 
 - Yes. We're good here. 

120
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,200
That's what you think. I have unfinished business.

121
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,150
My arm! My arm!

122
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,350
My goodness, Jae Soo!

123
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,200
What? Was that you, little rat?

124
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,400
Who said you could call me by my first name?

125
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm sorry. I thought you were a creep.

126
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,600
You're the creep! Why are you peeping in our gate?

127
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,300
My backpack. I'm here to get my backpack.

128
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,000
Then ring the bell and ask for it!

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,710
- Right. There's a bell! 
 - Damn it!

130
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,600
Oh, no...

131
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,740
Close the gate.

132
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,210
Who are you to order me around?

133
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,200
Don't underestimate Gwak Jae Soo.

134
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,120
Follow me.

135
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,750
Thank you.

136
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,500
I met him when I gave my witness statement.

137
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I went in yesterday because he needed a witness for the club incident.

138
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,430
You don't need to explain it to me.

139
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,100
You don't need to explain how you know a prosecutor,

140
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,050
but how you know an ex-con,

141
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,050
you do need to explain that.

142
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,800
You can save the explanation for the prosecutor.

143
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Today was my mistake, but from now on,

144
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,700
don't just trust and follow someone like me.

145
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,600
That prosecutor was right. Nobody knows what might have happened there.

146
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,190
Do you mean making a kite and playing with Yun?

147
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,360
I don't just trust and follow anyone.

148
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,090
Just say you're sorry. No need to be so stern about it.

149
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,440
Thank you.

150
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,280
Excuse me.

151
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,700
Your name.

152
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,510
- Is it Eun Ha? 
 - Yes.

153
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,760
It's Go Eun Ha.

154
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,780
   

155
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,300
- One rice drink, please. 
 - What's your number?

156
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,500
- Number eight. 
 - Got it, number eight.

157
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,560
One rice drink.

158
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,000
Do you know the company CEO whose video you posted?

159
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,670
 He was an ex-mobster. The boss of Bulldog Gang or something. 

160
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
How dangerous can he be? 
    

161
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,800
   

162
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,280
Miss, your rice drink.

163
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,680
- Thank you. 
 - Of course. Thank you.

164
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,770
I'm sorry! Are you okay? I'm sorry!

165
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,440
 Huh? 

166
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,440
 Maybe you don't know this, Eun Ha. 

167
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,900
 But Mr. Seo definitely does. 

168
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,300
 How dangerous it is for you to come here. 

169
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,950
- Did your visit to Yun's house go okay? 
 - Yeah.

170
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,370
The room was empty.

171
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,100
It was always empty.

172
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,310
You don't need to keep it empty at this hour. It's late, too.

173
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,620
The streets are safer than here.

174
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,390
- Did something happen down there? 
 - A prosecutor followed us.

175
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,400
Did Taek already get into trouble?

176
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,630
He wouldn't have followed us otherwise.

177
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,230
Don't worry about Go Yang Hui, and put people in Thailand...

178
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,730
Where's my seal?

179
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,400
- You stole his seal? 
 - I didn't steal it, I borrowed it.

180
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,100
And I put it right back.

181
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,400
 It's been forever since we got out early! Chicken and beer? 

182
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,580
 Chicken and beer? Wow! That sounds amazing. 

183
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,480
 Let's order it from that famous place. 

184
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,050
That's a crime.

185
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,890
That's why I escaped here.

186
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,760
By chance, was your crime fraud?

187
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,320
How about you, Mini Unni?

188
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,520
We left in the morning together. Why are you here alone?

189
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,460
Did you get kicked out?

190
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,250
Kicked out? I walked out on my own two feet.

191
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,180
Geez. But you have nowhere to go!

192
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,530
My friend just isn't picking up. I do have a place to go.

193
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,920
- She's not picking up? 
 - No.

194
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,070
That means you have nowhere to go.

195
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,100
Hyungnim is so mean!

196
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,000
He put in a bunch of rooms for people with nowhere to go.

197
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
And what's this?

198
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,550
- Why discriminate? 
 - I said I didn't get kicked out.

199
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,520
How about you, Hong Gi?

200
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,120
How did you end up living there?

201
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,890
It's a long story.

202
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,700
Look.

203
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,080
Cute.

204
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,810
You thought I was cute just now, right?

205
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,260
Look. I'm cute now. How much cuter do you think I was as a kid?

206
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,210
When I was little, the ladies in my neighborhood fought to smack my butt.

207
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,430
My father had a keen eye for business.

208
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,630
 Okay! Take your pick, take your pick! 

209
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,460
 You can't get these every day! Hurry up and take your pick! 

210
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,730
 Take your pick! 

211
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,810
He took me around to sell jade mats, honey, and maple sap.

212
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,390
He sold all kinds of things.

213
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,800
That's how I learned to make money at a young age.

214
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,320
You were an aspiring scammer.

215
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,320
The problem was, he didn't stop at maple sap.

216
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,330
He had to scale it up to investment fraud.

217
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,300
Then mobsters got involved.

218
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,100
Wow! Then what should he do?

219
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,610
He gets dragged around by mobsters,

220
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,600
and he's about to die...

221
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
And?

222
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,300
He ends up selling off his son.

223
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,680
He told them that I was not his son.

224
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,300
That his girlfriend had brought me along.

225
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,680
Funny, huh?

226
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,500
I called him "dad" all my life,

227
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,200
and he scammed his own son.

228
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,920
After learning the truth about my birth,

229
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,340
what did it matter?

230
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,060
I didn't want to live anymore, then.

231
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,600
So I begged the mobsters to kill me.

232
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,040
Right then, Ji Hwan appeared and paid off all my debts.

233
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,200
He told me to stay alive and got me out of there.

234
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,720
He saved your life.

235
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,870
Rather, he's more like a bank.

236
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,960
He put me on probation for life with my life as collateral.

237
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,470
Wow, what a metaphor.

238
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,560
Hello?

239
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,700
You're here? No, I'll come out.

240
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,500
Stay there.

241
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,460
   

242
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,000
Geez, watch where you're going—

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
That's what I should have done.

244
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,010
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

245
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,590
I'm okay. Are you all right? You are, right?

246
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,520
That's a nice phone. I've been needing one.

247
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,410
Aigoo, then you should take it. Take it.

248
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,380
Take care.

249
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,950
I knew you looked familiar. You work for Seo Ji Hwan.

250
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,240
Who's that? I don't know who that is.

251
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,670
You don't know who Seo Ji Hwan is?

252
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,020
Then say, "Seo Ji Hwan, that crazy f*cker."

253
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Seo Ji Hwan, that crazy f*cker.

254
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,650
Son of a bitch! Idiot! Asshole!

255
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,140
Hey, hey, hey!

256
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,050
Hyungnim is calling.

257
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,710
   

258
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,400
 Yang Hong Gi, where are you right now? 

259
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,500
What were you saying? F*cker? Bastard?

260
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,300
- Say it. 
 - Asshole? Idiot?

261
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,100
What are you doing to my little brother?

262
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,300
I said get me another rice drink. What are you doing?

263
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,200
Noona! I tried, but these guys keep asking me about some guy.

264
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,900
Really?

265
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,530
Is that Pikachu?

266
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,840
He's missing his electric pocket! The red dots on his cheeks!

267
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,520
That's his electric pocket.

268
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,680
That's the only way he can use electricity.

269
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,280
His ears should be longer. His mouth is the other way.

270
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,190
It's not a W, it's an upside-down M. Missing the tail, too.

271
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,750
That fraud! I told him to—

272
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,750
That's not important, damn it.

273
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,700
Are you two trying to scam us?

274
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,100
Mr. Seo Ji Hwan!

275
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,510
Hey, hey.

276
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,400
Mr. Seo Ji Hwan...

277
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,580
Do you think you'll fool me again?

278
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,340
I'm serious. Seriously.

279
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,390
- The phone is ours. 
 - It's mine.

280
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,260
Give them back their stuff.

281
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,810
   

282
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,360
Where are you? I'm waiting by the entrance.

283
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,810
I'm at the entrance.

284
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,600
He's coming. He's coming! Hurry up!

285
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,930
It's so hot in there, so I came out to get some air...

286
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,310
- Are you... 
 - Are you looking for lamb gopchang?

287
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,020
The lamb gopchang place. The famous place down the street, right?

288
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,910
- Let me show you the way. 
 - I'm here for...

289
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,700
Excuse me. Sir, just give it to me.

290
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,590
It was a guy on the phone.

291
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,870
Give it to me.

292
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,100
This is for Mr. Yang Hong Gi.

293
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,330
Yang Hong Gi!

294
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,270
Come out right now!

295
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,270
Oh, wow!

296
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,960
Hyungnim, the rumors are true.

297
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,780
You have eyes on the back of your head. So, you don't have to look...

298
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,850
Are you really Yang Hong Gi?

299
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,660
Yes. I wish you'd gotten here sooner.

300
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,300
   

301
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,750
I was going to mention it, but it was urgent.

302
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,170
It'd have been humiliating to lose the deal to King Meats!

303
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,920
Do you value your pride more than your conscience?

304
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,200
I don't keep guys who sell their conscience instead of meat.

305
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,700
Hyungnim, I didn't just do this for myself.

306
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,110
I know the order was wrong, but it's going to be good for us.

307
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,150
The order is the most important thing to you, Yang Hong Gi.

308
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,030
A promise once made is a debt unpaid.

309
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,300
Yang Hong Gi.

310
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,620
As of today, you're in default on your loan.

311
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,320
Hyungnim.

312
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,990
One.

313
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,150
Two.

314
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,430
Hurry up and take it.

315
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,810
Follow me.

316
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,480
Me? I...

317
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,200
I...

318
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,680
   

319
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,040
You said you were going on a trip. You were headed to this spa?

320
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,890
I can't go to the actual Mt. Baekdu, so...

321
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,110
They use real hot spring water.

322
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,120
Are you really that fearless? Or did you decide not to care?

323
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,100
You're not a child.

324
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,440
You know what kind of people those guys are.

325
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,430
I'm a total scaredy cat. I'm super afraid of you right now.

326
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,750
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

327
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,180
I was wrong to think the streets would be safe.

328
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,880
Our place might be better.

329
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,360
- Your place? 
 - Yes.

330
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,580
Stay there until you find a place to go.

331
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,950
What's the rent? Under 200,000 won, right?

332
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,800
- You don't need to— 
 - I can't stay for free!

333
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,510
I'll clean, at least. I'm good at cleaning.

334
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,910
- We do our own chores... 
 - The dishes?

335
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,550
With all those people, you must have lots of dishes to do.

336
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,890
I have a lot of certificates.

337
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,820
Art Therapy, Folktale Performance, Anger Management Counseling.

338
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,170
There are many with anger management issues, right?

339
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,930
By chance, can you also tutor us?

340
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,390
You came to the right person.

341
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,130
- What? 
 - What did you just say?

342
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,780
Are you serious, Hyungnim?

343
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,080
She'll be with us for a while,

344
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,890
so be considerate even though you may be inconvenienced.

345
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,240
Hyungnim, by any chance...

346
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,400
is she also an ex-con?

347
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,060
Introduce yourself.

348
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,970
I will be your live-in tutor.

349
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,660
Not a live-in maid but a live-in tutor?

350
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,330
Why do we need a live-in tutor at our age, Hyungnim?

351
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,240
You'll have to take a test to be promoted.

352
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,530
Other guys are going to college and getting their Ph.D.s.

353
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,530
How much longer will you be a middle school or high school grad?

354
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,100
Hyungnim, I really...

355
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,980
don't need to be promoted.

356
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,660
Not just for promotions. You can also be demoted.

357
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,420
Anyway, if you want to work again, get it together.

358
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,130
This is not right, Hyungnim!

359
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,040
Looking forward to working with you.

360
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:35,140
♫  Blue skies, blue skies fill my dreams that live in this green garden  ♫

361
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:43,080
♫  Cows munch on meat with sunny smiles  ♫

362
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,250
♫  Teacher rings the bell to start class, ding ding ding  ♫

363
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,620
What's the answer?

364
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:58,460
♫  I don't like ABCD, I don't like 1234, we're frowning  ♫

365
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:06,190
♫  Ding ding ding, it's the lunchtime we've been waiting for  ♫

366
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:13,850
♫  We play with sticks, we play the squid game, happy calves  ♫

367
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,900
I won't do it!

368
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:22,190
Why do we have to decorate that little rat's room?

369
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,170
He wants us to pass the GED in one month, no matter what. 
  (T/N: General Educational Development test) 

370
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,160
One month? I won't do it, not for a day. No, I won't do it!

371
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,950
I don't know what spell she's cast on him, but I won't take this.

372
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,320
- I'm Gwak Jae Soo! 
 - I'm kind of excited to study.

373
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,450
Tutor? She was basically a babysitter.

374
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,230
It's just an excuse to stay here for free!

375
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,880
And where is Hong Gi right now? This is urgent!

376
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,510
 - A successful man enters the room.  
 - Welcome, sir!

377
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,160
 A man's life is about taking care of himself. 

378
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,200
 What I need right now is recognition. 

379
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,420
 What I need right now is... 

380
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,230
freedom!

381
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,590
You're getting a call.

382
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,000
   

383
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,700
If you press this button...

384
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,470
Try it.

385
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,340
   

386
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,760
That feels good.

387
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,220
Nice...

388
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,390
 What I need right now is... 

389
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,350
 rest. 

390
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,920
Why do they keep calling?

391
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,700
Yes! This is it!

392
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,040
Why does he get to ride in a nice car? I can, too!

393
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,910
Seriously? Stop calling me!

394
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,120
Stop calling! Leave me alone!

395
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,130
- You're living there? 
 - You weren't picking up.

396
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,460
I couldn't stay at the spa.

397
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,790
A job with housing and meals doesn't come along often.

398
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:27,500
 How can you trust all those men? 

399
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,550
Actually, Hyun Woo used to live in this house.

400
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,580
What?

401
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,890
Hyun Woo lived in the basement a long time ago.

402
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,450
What are you saying?

403
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,790
You just said it belongs to the meat company CEO.

404
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,950
It does now.

405
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,030
Also, I met someone else named Hyun Woo.

406
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,190
So you ran into Hyun Woo at that house?

407
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,780
No. That's not what I'm saying.

408
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,690
 Gosh, I'm so frustrated. 

409
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,610
I'm hanging up. Come over and let's talk.

410
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,690
- Welcome— 
  - Oh, right. 

411
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,230
 Il Yeong will drop by the salon to get my stuff. 

412
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,910
Hey, thanks for letting me know so soon.

413
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,300
Hello.

414
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,360
Hello.

415
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:17,240
- That's all. 
 - She might need some stuff...

416
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,110
so we'll hold onto them.

417
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,410
I got it.

418
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,140
It's heavy.

419
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,750
Isn't it heavy for everybody? No, thanks.

420
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,800
Wow, they are heavy.

421
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,500
Give me the address.

422
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,620
- What? 
 - I sort of know where it is.

423
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,090
But I need the exact address. She's my friend.

424
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,990
The address.

425
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,930
When you came to get your hair done the other day,

426
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,520
was it because of Eun Ha?

427
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,760
You were looking for Eun Ha the day it rained.

428
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,340
Your "Hyungnim."

429
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,650
Does he like Eun Ha?

430
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,160
Well, that's...

431
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,200
I used to play sports.

432
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,440
If something happens, I'm coming to get her right away.

433
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,940
Just letting you know.

434
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,610
Okay.

435
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,310
So, all three times you've been here, Hyungnim has asked you to come.

436
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,500
Just saying.

437
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,820
He took a day off yesterday to go there. He should say something.

438
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,890
All he said all day was, "I saw Seo Ji Hwan."

439
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,420
Does he want us to go insane or die of curiosity?

440
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,000
So that's all that happened? Did you just see him?

441
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,980
He's good-looking. Quite manly.

442
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,280
- That's it? 
 - Yes.

443
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,000
- Why didn't you pick a date while you were at it? 
 - We should, right?

444
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,020
- Excuse me? 
 - When should it be?

445
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,300
I think he's gone cuckoo.

446
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,400
Officer Song, please share data with Officer Yang...

447
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,800
on how the Thailand investigation is going.

448
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,700
Chief Oh, keep looking around Jung Yoon Taek and his grandmother's house.

449
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,050
If not Jung himself, we may get clues from Go Yang Hui and Seo Ji Hwan.

450
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:54,130
- Keep an eye on their movements. 
 - What about the antenna?

451
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,800
We'll hear from them soon.

452
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,860
Where are you going?

453
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,310
Do you even have somewhere to be?

454
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,000
Is this another room?

455
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:37,100
♫  My steps have paused briefly  ♫

456
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,800
So many rooms.

457
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,670
♫  For so long  ♫

458
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:54,420
Is that a deer?

459
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,900
♫  Are slipping farther away  ♫

460
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:12,900
♫  Was I heading towards dreams I couldn’t reach?  ♫

461
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:21,300
♫  In my long, endless nights  ♫

462
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,100
♫  will morning ever come?  ♫

463
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:35,860
♫  If I could turn back time  ♫

464
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:43,290
♫  I’d erase the dark times  ♫

465
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:49,620
♫  At the end of a fading day  ♫

466
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,400
This used to be only a way to come in from outside.

467
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,000
They built stairs.

468
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,540
Hyungnim!

469
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,010
You let the little rat move in, tell us to study with her...

470
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:09,200
Don't you think this is a bit much? You're being cruel!

471
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,400
Also, Kang Ye Na the Christmas, cream, or whatever, is number one in the industry.

472
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,820
You should be praising Hong Gi for getting her!

473
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,800
- Praise? 
 - King Meats is number one in our industry.

474
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
They've always looked down on us.

475
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,090
Hong Gi was trying his best, and he made a mistake.

476
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,420
A mistake?

477
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,740
It's a "mistake" for us. Will it look that way to everyone else?

478
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,050
And since when was our goal to be number one in the industry?

479
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,400
Are we going to scam people to be number one?

480
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,600
Sell our conscience? Go back to our old ways?

481
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,400
Guys.

482
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,940
After what happened, do you still not get it?

483
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,190
Other people see us differently.

484
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,750
A mistake by us is not the same as a mistake by others.

485
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:51,320
 Honestly, people won't feed their kids the food we make. 

486
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,100
 If we wait for the door to open, we'll never get inside. 

487
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,040
 The order is the most important thing to you, Yang Hong Gi. 

488
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,300
 A promise once made is a debt unpaid. 

489
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,400
 As of today, you're in default on your loan. 

490
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,160
You scared me!

491
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,500
W-W-What are you doing here?

492
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,370
This is my room.

493
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,310
Oh, I see. That's your room.

494
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,180
It's very close to mine.

495
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,100
It's a shame that the guys don't understand you.

496
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,500
It's not like you don't care.

497
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,100
I mean, you're kind of intimidating,

498
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,700
but you're not a petty dude, you know?

499
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,500
You know how to scold someone,

500
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,940
but you're also generous about forgiving them.

501
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,850
I've heard I'm generous,

502
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,800
but I've never been called petty.

503
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,600
Right?

504
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,300
Right?

505
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,400
Right...

506
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,000
What? What? Is there something on my face?

507
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,630
- Yes. 
 - Aigoo.

508
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,800
You know how to joke, too.

509
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
- There's a bug on your face. 
 - Where?

510
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,440
Where? Where?

511
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,170
- There... 
 - Here?

512
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,510
No, the other side. Not that eye, the other eye.

513
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,680
- Where? 
 - L-Let me do it.

514
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,290
One second.

515
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
It's gone.

516
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm oily.

517
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,040
Not my scalp. Just below my forehead.

518
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,250
Let me wash my face before more bugs slide down.

519
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,640
He told me I had a bug on my face. Why is my heart racing?

520
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,010
Maybe because I'm super embarrassed?

521
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,540
How's it going?

522
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,820
Fine. It's going smoothly.

523
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,360
What's this about Seo Ji Hwan and a woman?

524
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,900
Remember Thirsty Deer's video scandal recently?

525
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,600
I think he has the kids' creator who was involved.

526
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,010
Why does he have her?

527
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,060
Is she a hostage?

528
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,740
We're still looking into it.

529
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,790
That dork has a girl?

530
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,610
Is he going through puberty or something?

531
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,960
Halfway to 70...

532
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,720
and he's discovered the opposite sex.

533
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,710
   

534
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,600
She lived in Chansang-dong until she was 12.

535
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,800
The address is...

536
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,450
   

537
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,140
It's nearby.

538
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,300
 Did you know her when you were little? 

539
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,700
That's good enough.

540
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,720
It was definitely here.

541
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,700
Is that it?

542
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,300
Hey.

543
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,200
Eun Ha!

544
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,450
- CEO! 
 - I'm sorry. Are you okay?

545
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,990
Yeah. I couldn't sleep, so I came out for a walk.

546
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,570
I guess I could look like a burglar.

547
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,800
I'm sorry. I thought you were breaking in.

548
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Is your back okay?

549
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,840
Yes.

550
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,410
Here...

551
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:34,040
I'm sorry...

552
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,340
So do you have break-ins every once in a while?

553
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,800
No, that's not it. I'm just used to being alert.

554
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,700
I was scared to death.

555
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,100
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

556
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,770
Excuse me.

557
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,410
That day...

558
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,260
 - Wait, Mini?  
  - CEO, why are you here? 

559
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,560
Was there a reason why you came to this house?

560
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,990
I lived around here when I was young.

561
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,260
Having nowhere to go reminded me.

562
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,220
I have a lot of memories of this place.

563
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,550
Are they good memories?

564
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,130
Yes.

565
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,860
They're good memories.

566
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,400
With a good person.

567
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,190
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

568
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,600
I win!

569
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,690
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

570
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,760
Red light, green light!

571
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,460
I think you moved!

572
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,040
 Out of everyone I knew, 

573
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,450
he was the best person.

574
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,990
And after that...

575
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,860
After that, my parents got divorced, and we moved.

576
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,120
♫  The image I dreamed of in my heart  ♫

577
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,710
Thank you.

578
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,400
- For what? 
 - That day.

579
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,640
The day it rained.

580
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,060
I was glad it was you who came out the door.

581
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,230
♫  Now that we’ve met again  ♫

582
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:22,290
♫  A fateful miracle that recognized each other, may it become love  ♫

583
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,680
♫  You  ♫

584
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,990
   

585
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,660
♫  You  ♫

586
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,670
   

587
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,310
Good morning, CEO.

588
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,580
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Yes. Are you heading out?

589
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,360
Yes. Oh, right...

590
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,680
By the way, it's not a big deal, but...

591
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,070
if you don't have plans tonight,

592
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:03,920
we were thinking we could officially introduce you to the house.

593
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,100
- Like a presentation? 
 - No, not really.

594
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,060
More like a welcome party.

595
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,810
Great! Sounds fun. Should I prepare anything?

596
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,790
You don't need to prepare anything...

597
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,030
CEO, your hand is on my head.

598
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,120
I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.

599
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,720
- Anyway, I'll see you tonight. 
 - Okay.

600
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,110
- Fighting. 
 - Okay.

601
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,610
   

602
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,500
Our sales dropped 17% last month.

603
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,730
Compared to this time last year, 20% drop.

604
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:58,310
We were exposed to customers who didn't know what kind of company we are.

605
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:01,320
Now there's a negative association.

606
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,110
Focus on product quality at times like this.

607
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,110
We'll solve the rest on its own time.

608
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,370
Bring in the Marketing Team Leader—

609
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,810
- How's Hong Gi doing? 
 - You know.

610
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,050
He's probably having the time of his life since you let him loose.

611
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,700
The presentation is crazy.

612
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,230
Let's have a bite.

613
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,380
How can I help you?

614
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,140
- Where do you get your meat? 
 - Sorry?

615
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:51,060
Bone-in sirloin...

616
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,700
needs the harmony of crispy fat and tender meat,

617
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,950
along with the rich scent of charcoal to be delicious.

618
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,190
This is dry and tough.

619
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,530
- This is from King Meats, isn't it? 
 - Let me check.

620
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:10,270
You need quality meat. So go with my company, Thirsty Deer—

621
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,930
There's this Thirsty Deer. Look into it. They have good stuff.

622
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,980
I'm sorry.

623
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,450
What?

624
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,930
Unless this is a coincidence, my intel is leaking. How did you know I was here?

625
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:31,600
It's hard not to know where you are when you post 24/7.

626
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,470
Could I get a selfie with you?

627
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,690
- Get closer. 
 - Got it.

628
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,290
Wow. I was wondering how Mr. Seo knew about the spa.

629
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:49,880
I can't neglect my followers' right to know. Why are you here?

630
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,790
To get my money. 15,000 won for the courier.

631
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,400
You're very persistent.

632
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:04,230
I don't have any cash on me.

633
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,950
Write down your account number. I'll send it to you later.

634
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,780
- I hear you moved in. 
 - Where?

635
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,480
Right. Wow, the place is so nice.

636
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,060
A feast every morning, spacious rooms, an amazing garden...

637
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:28,650
The bedding is so comfortable I sleep like a baby.

638
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,480
But it's not as nice as a hotel, I bet.

639
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,800
I mean...

640
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,480
does Hyungnim talk about me?

641
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,840
About what?

642
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,570
Right.

643
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:45,010
He would never worry about me.

644
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:49,760
I think he did mention that the house feels empty without you.

645
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,010
Something like, "It felt like a home when he lived here."

646
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,390
Well...

647
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,410
does he say that kind of stuff?

648
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,290
Honestly, from his perspective, he had to be harsh on you.

649
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,700
You know how he feels, and that's why you were trying to do your best.

650
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,980
I was.

651
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,210
I was trying, really trying.

652
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,490
But "defaulted on your loan"? He sounds like a debt collector.

653
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:19,760
A collector only cares about the money, not the person.

654
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,720
But all Mr. Seo cares about is you.

655
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,630
As you know, this contract...

656
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,870
The cancellation will cost three times the fee.

657
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:36,540
I can sue Team Leader Yang for document fraud, right?

658
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,080
Please hear me out to the end.

659
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,630
Regardless of how it happened, the deal is signed,

660
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,500
and I take responsibility for my employees.

661
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:49,010
Let's move forward with the contract.

662
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,880
I look forward to working with you as the kids' product model.

663
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,560
We'll be seeing each other often. No need to be a stranger.

664
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,070
I don't think I'll see you that often.

665
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,650
Didn't you read the special clause in the contract?

666
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:11,950
- A special clause? 
 - "Seo Ji Hwan shall be present at every shoot."

667
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,130
The CEO doesn't really...

668
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:17,390
"After each shoot, Seo Ji Hwan shall escort the model home safely."

669
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:21,940
Do you want Hyungnim to be your chauffeur?

670
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,560
If you include these two things, I'll do it for free.

671
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,820
   

672
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,130
I'll put out a press release on my end.

673
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,030
That will help with the declining sales.

674
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:42,110
How come you're doing all this for just 20 million won?

675
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,890
How did you know it was 20 million?

676
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,810
- It was in the contract back then. 
 - The loan contract...

677
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,890
said 80 million.

678
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,780
What you paid eight years ago was the principal, 20 million.

679
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,830
So you did remember me?

680
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:12,980
Prosecutor, all these papers on my desk are begging me to do something.

681
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,350
Where are you going?

682
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,990
I'm done with everything for today. I'll get to them tomorrow.

683
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,370
These papers are mean. They'll go totally crazy.

684
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,790
These are for the day after tomorrow. See you tomorrow.

685
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,490
Prosecutor!

686
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:28,480
Officer Yang is on his way.

687
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,160
Right now?

688
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,800
Yes.

689
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,850
Yes, Prosecutor.

690
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,620
I'm sorry. I'll be a little late. What should we do?

691
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,120
Oh, that's okay. Take your time.

692
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,680
I'll let you know as soon as I'm done.

693
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,610
- Okay. 
 -  I'm sorry. 

694
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,460
   

695
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:14,380
♫  Faint stars in the night sky  ♫

696
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:21,270
♫  You, who always seemed out of reach  ♫

697
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:28,390
♫  Your gaze approached me  ♫

698
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:35,960
♫  As if time had stopped, I’ll remember this moment  ♫

699
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:45,750
♫  To my heart that was once shaken  ♫ 
 ♫  You came back again  ♫

700
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,700
♫  I don’t want to let you go  ♫

701
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,640
   

702
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,850
 What's a prosecutor? 

703
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,510
 Someone who scolds bad people. 

704
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:05,000
♫  I want to be with you in every moment  ♫

705
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:14,770
♫  In my way every day  ♫ 
 ♫  No matter where you are  ♫

706
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:22,940
♫  I’ll be by your side, I'll always be there for you  ♫ 
 ♫  I always be with you  ♫

707
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,760
♫  Forever  ♫

708
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,230
Eun Ha.

709
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,600
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

710
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,660
No worries, I just got here.

711
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,890
It's really nice here in the evening.

712
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,100
Yes. It is.

713
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,350
Are these pebbles?

714
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:58,780
I used to do this a lot a long time ago. Even or odd?

715
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,360
Want to guess?

716
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,190
Even or odd? Guess.

717
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,200
Odd?

718
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,730
One, two, three, four, five. Whoa!

719
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,110
That was awesome. Want to try again?

720
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,130
Am I being too old-fashioned?

721
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,800
Eun Ha.

722
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,540
What's on your mind?

723
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,290
N-Nothing.

724
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,250
Nothing.

725
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:39,460
What did you want to ask me?

726
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,900
There's someone

727
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,770
I've been looking for a long time.

728
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,900
It's an older boy that I lost touch with as a child.

729
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,900
I haven't heard what happened to him since.

730
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,100
How old were you?

731
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,590
I was seven.

732
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,020
His name was Hyun Woo, too.

733
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,400
Seven is pretty young.

734
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,890
Can I ask you why you're still looking for him?

735
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,170
It was my fault...

736
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,240
that we had to say bye. So...

737
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,480
I...

738
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,250
really want to see him at least once.

739
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:53,790
Aigoo, where is Hong Gi? We need more hands.

740
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:56,220
- He's not answering his phone, either. 
 - Hey.

741
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,820
Leave him alone. If he's hungry, he'll come home.

742
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,900
But why is that freeloading parasite not here helping?

743
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:07,400
Does she think she's really the star tonight or something?

744
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,410
I thought this was her welcome party, not an initiation.

745
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,260
It does feel like we have a new family member.

746
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,030
Family, my foot.

747
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,520
   

748
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,900
Hey, you'd better hurry up and come.

749
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,200
You're a trainee, and the 3-star and 4-star are already sitting down.

750
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,360
Showing up last? What a brat.

751
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,330
I brought someone.

752
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,300
Come out.

753
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,500
- Who is it? 
 - Ta-da!

754
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,700
Hey! Where have you been?

755
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:03,340
I said we were having an initiation, and he wanted to do the same.

756
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,470
- Go ahead. 
 - Sure.

757
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:09,600
I'd like to report myself.

758
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,900
With my cheap tricks, I deceived Hyungnim, Jae Soo, Il Yeong, Man Ho,

759
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,240
Dong Hee, and the whole company. I won't try to make excuses.

760
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,100
Please just...

761
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,700
know that I regret it deeply.

762
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,450
Hey, man.

763
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:32,700
Report yourself? I could just...

764
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,100
- Hey! Stop it! 
 - Seriously!

765
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,380
Hyungnim.

766
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,300
He turned himself in.

767
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,100
Couldn't we take extenuating circumstances into account?

768
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,400
You can't turn yourself in after you've already been caught.

769
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,700
What about a letter of apology?

770
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,030
Could a letter of apology count?

771
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,900
A letter of apology?

772
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,180
A letter of apology...

773
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,760
A letter of apology?

774
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:16,370
Write it on a piece of paper and submit it.

775
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,820
Hyungnim.

776
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,900
Huh?

777
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,600
You'll forgive me if I write a letter of apology?

778
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,260
I'll do my best and turn it in.

779
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:32,750
Then may I join you, Hyungnim?

780
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,170
Thank you, Hyungnim.

781
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:44,140
Is it my turn now?

782
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,400
Hello, you may know me as Mini Unni.

783
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,500
But I'm not Mini Unni anymore. I'm Go Eun Ha.

784
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:58,530
I'm 30 years old, and I like kids, folktales, and snacks.

785
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,940
Just keep it simple. Nobody wants to know that stuff.

786
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,820
Hey, let her talk.

787
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,960
Why?

788
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,500
I want to know.

789
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,500
What do you dislike?

790
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,700
I don't like...

791
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,200
fighting.

792
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,510
Lying. The powerful threatening and bullying the weak.

793
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:19,580
 - Who did you get the stuff from? 
 - What? What stuff? 

794
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,020
 The stuff at the club! Red, yellow, blue! 

795
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,500
 Red, yellow, at the club? 

796
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:28,600
 You think someone who beats up people like that won't hit a woman? 

797
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,510
Being inconsiderate of others, raising one's voice, cursing.

798
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,180
 50 meters! 

799
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,410
 He's crazy! 

800
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:40,300
I don't like tattoos, either.

801
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,700
Dragon tattoos are scary and gross.

802
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,400
Honestly, I don't like the title "Hyungnim."

803
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,000
It's a bit authoritarian...

804
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,650
Why do you hate so many things? Just say you hate this!

805
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:55,900
No, no, no. Let her say what she has to say.

806
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,400
We live in a democracy.

807
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,600
Then should I...

808
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,840
also write them down on a piece of paper?

809
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,800
Yes, yes. Write them down, and we'll pass it around.

810
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,500
- Okay. 
 - Hyungnim!

811
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,630
Welcome!

812
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:15,200
Sit down. Let's start with part two.

813
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,800
Here. 
    

814
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,900
Alcohol I brewed myself. Cheongju, soju, takju.

815
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:27,600
Pour yourself whatever you like and drink.

816
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,850
I hope you enjoy it. Thank you.

817
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:35,660
Hey, hey, hey.

818
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:39,800
It's 2024. Don't force her to drink. Everyone, get your own.

819
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,400
We all did it! Hong Gi, Dong Hee!

820
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,780
Doesn't democracy mean the sexes are equal?

821
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,700
That's right, we all did it! How do you know what a democracy is?

822
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,290
- Hey! 
 - No, no. I'll drink.

823
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:55,750
I forgot to say it, but I like alcohol.

824
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,700
I used to drink a lot.

825
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:03,600
But it's no fun if we just drink. Should we play a game?

826
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,400
Three words! Three words!

827
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,820
- In the morning! 
 - We eat meat!

828
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,950
- But then we! 
 - Found a bone!

829
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,100
- Who was it? 
 - It wasn't me!

830
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,540
- It wasn't you? 
 - I said it wasn't me!

831
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,060
I. Said. It. Wasn't. Me! Five words!

832
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:23,820
Drink! Drink! Chug! Chug!

833
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,810
I love drinking! I love this game!

834
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:30,870
I love it! Love it! Love it! Love it!

835
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:34,380
♫  Once or twice  ♫

836
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,950
You! 
 ♫  You have such a unique charm  ♫

837
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,360
Why is it always me? 
 ♫  I try to forget you  ♫

838
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:51,000
♫  But I just miss you more and more  ♫

839
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,730
Hyungnim, why do you hate me? 
 ♫  Baby baby let me come along  ♫

840
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,810
♫  Every single day I belong  ♫

841
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:03,700
Why don't you understand me?

842
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:09,280
Why do you like the little rat more than me?

843
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,020
Eun Ha.

844
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,160
It's Seo Ji Hwan!

845
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,990
Why are you out here?

846
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:35,670
I'm just feeling good. I wanted to get some air.

847
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:40,500
You had a lot to drink. You should go rest.

848
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,740
What are you talking about? I'm not drunk at all.

849
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,800
Come here. There's more. Have a drink.

850
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,600
Wait, no.

851
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,760
You can't drink, right?

852
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,580
Then should we just play?

853
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,850
Let's just play! Let's just play! What should we do?

854
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:01,370
- Eun Ha, it's the middle of the night... 
 - Let's play, let's play.

855
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,900
Not like last time, though.

856
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,500
Eun Ha. It's really late...

857
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,760
Let's play! Let's play.

858
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,020
- It's the middle of the night. 
 - Let's play, let's play.

859
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:14,180
You should go get some sleep...

860
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,300
Your eyeballs...

861
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:32,400
are twinkling and sparkling.

862
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:37,690
Your eyeballs...

863
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:43,830
are twinkling...

01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,230
 He doesn't even let the milk delivery lady in 

874
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:03,590
 and he moves a girl in? I knew it was weird. 

875
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:07,200
 So do we start calling her sister-in-law? 

876
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,300
 Hey, little rat! What are you looking at? 

877
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,510
 - So sneaky! 
 - I wasn't looking! 

878
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:14,900
 Did you check? The one you think is Hyun Woo? 

879
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,600
 Describe Hyungnim in two words. 

880
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,360
   

881
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,470
 Shoulder thug? 

882
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,470
 Thug? 

883
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:23,190
 Yun's missing? 

884
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:26,860
 Is Go Eun Ha really okay? 

885
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,000
 - The door is locked! 
 - Eun Ha! Wake up! 

886
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,100
 Help!
