10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,590
It's here.

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,280
Miss! You need to pay!

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,130
Hyungnim.

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,490
Hyungnim!

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,790
Hyungnim!

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,170
Your bags are in the car.

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,130
You can get in.

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:13,970


18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,360
Dong Hee, stop the car.

19
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,560
What?

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,870
What's going on with him?

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,930
 This is a picture of the organic kids' milk posted online. 

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,220
 After drinking the organic milk 

23
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,590
 that a kids' creator recently promoted at a Kids Food Festival, 

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,600
 many posts of kids appeared showing symptoms of food poisoning, 

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,620
 such as diarrhea, fever, and stomach pain. 

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,940
 The creator in question promoted the milk as "safe and good." 

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,410
You said it was okay for kids!

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,860
What are you going to do about this?

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,190
If something happens to my kid, it's on you!

30
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,030
- I'm sorry. 
 - Shit!

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,420
If it's that good, why don't you have some?

32
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,180
♫  I’ve waited  ♫

33
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,490
♫  For your expressions  ♫

34
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:34,560
♫  Perhaps our comfortable smiles hold our time  ♫

35
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:44,530
♫  We, who were awkward, suddenly realized  ♫

36
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:52,860
♫  Ways to express our hearts bit by bit  ♫

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:02,890
♫  On sleepless nights, I’ll be your comfort  ♫

38
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,510
Close your eyes and count to ten.

39
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,420
♫  I’ll always be with you  ♫

40
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,970
♫  My everything  ♫

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,750
- What are you doing? 
 - Who are you?

42
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,110
Hold onto those cartons and throw them at the milk company.

43
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,190
♫  More than I deserve  ♫ 
 ♫  You became my everything  ♫

44
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,560
Let me down!

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,100
Let me down right now, or I'll call the cops.

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,280
♫  I've ever dreamed of  ♫

47
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,660
Are you kidnapping* me? 
  (T/N: sounds like "bossam," boiled pork) 

48
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,880
That's boiled pork.

49
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,390
I got you out of there before they burned you alive.

50
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,750
Why did you get me out?

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,980
It seemed like you were up for a milk bath.

52
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,700
That's why.

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,330
That's my business. What does it have to do with—

54
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,780
Looks like you're on your way home. Get home safe.

55
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,330
What are you planning to do inside?

56
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,710
Do you want to take the blame all by yourself?

57
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,530
The people responsible aren't here. Why is it your responsibility?

58
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,970
They drank the milk because of my video.

59
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,370
It's my fault, too.

60
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,030
If you can take the blame, go right in.

61
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,200
There you are, you two.

62
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,570
I thought they were a good company.

63
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,170
The people were polite, and the product looked clean.

64
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,200
I trusted them based on how they came across.

65
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,640
I feel so stupid for making the same mistake twice.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,980
And now, I'm running away.

67
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,640
Well... uhm... running is the best strategy in a fight.

68
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,560
They weren't trying to fight. They're just upset about what happened to their kids.

69
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,110
They heard it was organic milk,

70
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,950
and that they fed clean water and good food to the cows.

71
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,530
They thought it was safe to give it to their kids.

72
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,150
But now, their kids are in pain.

73
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,860
So they're upset.

74
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,930
You're in pain, too.

75
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,980
Don't underestimate an ankle sprain. Put this on it.

76
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,860
Thank you.

77
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,800
Eun Ha!

78
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,510
Thank you for the ride.

79
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,530
Let me know whenever you need a lift. I'll take you on a drive.

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,350
- All right, then. 
 - Oh, okay.

81
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,850
So, that's what it looks like.

82
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,810
It looks like a map. Maybe America?

83
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,490
Or is it Europe?

84
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,020
Excuse me.

85
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,930
Thank you for your help earlier. Your clothes got dirty because of me.

86
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,760
It's nothing. I was just curious. Go on in.

87
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,340
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes, it's fine. I just wanted to look. Go in.

88
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,290
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,690
No!

90
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,660
What was it?

91
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,550
Oh! Australia!

92
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,430
I'll dry-clean it for you.

93
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,020
Oh, don't worry about it. Was I too loud? Sorry.

94
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,800
This is Australia. Go on in.

95
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,180
Hey! It does look like Europe or Asia!

96
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,740
Hey, Il Yeong. What do you think this looks like?

97
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,120
India, right? Or Indonesia?

98
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,690
Please like and subscribe!

99
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,580
   

100
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,260
You can tell me.

101
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,250
- When a girl... 
 - How do you comfort a girl when she's upset?

102
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,220
Are you learning how to mind-read?

103
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,130
No need to read your mind. It's written all over your face.

104
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,890
- On my face? 
 - If I may say one thing,

105
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,900
people don't obsess over relief patches when they're in pain.

106
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,340
They sympathize and try to understand.

107
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,750
"Does it hurt?" It hurts me, too.

108
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,050
"Are you upset?" I'm upset, too.

109
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,030
I just repeat whatever they say?

110
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,450
Get some rest.

111
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,930
 After reports that the organic milk launched 

112
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,750
 by Company X last month caused food poisoning, 

113
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,520
 the Food Health Ministry conducted tests on the products. 

114
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
 In a number of products... 

115
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,140
- It's not done. 
 - Will you watch all the related news?

116
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,330
This is covering something different.

117
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,920
Why do you need to know? Are you writing an article?

118
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,850
You've beat yourself up enough all day.

119
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,610
Stop watching and go home.

120
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,070
Never mind.

121
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,560
Hey.

122
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,980
Talk to me about those Deer guys earlier.

123
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,360
What happened? Did you make up and become besties?

124
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,280
Why did they drive you all the way here? Oh, and...

125
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,530
Did they rob an entire pharmacy?

126
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,470
That guy went way overboard.

127
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,060
That guy?

128
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,940
Is something going on between you two?

129
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,140
It's not like that.

130
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,520
Hey...

131
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,630
- Show me. 
 - It's okay. It's just a little sprain.

132
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,660
Show me.

133
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,940
- I said I'm fine. 
 - Just stay still.

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,860
Hey, if it's a little sprain,

135
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,300
why do you look like you have a broken leg?

136
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
You...

137
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,540
didn't break your leg. It's just a little sprain.

138
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,670
   

139
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,140
Mi Ho, you know...

140
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,820
I never had anyone play with me until I was seven.

141
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,180
My mom was always busy, tired, and exhausted.

142
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,260
And there were more days when I didn't get to see Dad

143
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,550
than when I actually did.

144
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,430
 Tell me where your husband is! 

145
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,200
 I don't know where he is, either! I don't know! 

146
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
 Stop it! 

147
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,330
 I don't know where he is, either! I don't! 

148
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,000
To a seven-year-old kid,

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,800
a day felt so long.

150
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,850
I would climb step after step

151
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,000
and come down step after step,

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,800
but time passed so slowly.

153
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,800
Then I met Hyun Woo.

154
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,330
I wanted to be someone like that for kids.

155
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,410
Someone who tells them, "A torn pocket is no big deal."

156
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,370
That I can pick up coins

157
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,970
- from the ground and save them up. 
  - Odd or even? 

158
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,560
Someone who tells me I can make earmuffs with holey socks.

159
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,500
 - You can't hear anything, right? 
 - Yeah. 

160
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 If the scary guys come again, 

161
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,200
 put this on. You won't hear a thing. 

162
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,570
That's why my work used to make me happy.

163
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,310
I was so happy I could fly.

164
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,640
But I shouldn't have taken it so lightly.

165
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,500
I had a much bigger responsibility...

166
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,870
than I had imagined.

167
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,670
I didn't know that.

168
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,410
 Does it hurt? 

169
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,330
It hurts me, too.

170
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,330
Are you upset? I'm upset, too.

171
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,590
Does it hurt?

172
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,020
It hurts me, too.

173
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,290
Are you upset? I'm upset, too.

174
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,560
Doctor.

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,100
- Yes. 
 - What happened to the kids from yesterday?

176
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,340
I don't see them.

177
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,770
They all went home except one.

178
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,260
- They went home? 
 - Thankfully, it wasn't too serious.

179
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,590
   

180
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,260
Here you go.

181
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,700
Is this safe?

182
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,960
It's from a hospital.

183
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,480
So is it going to be safe?

184
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,780
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

185
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,230
My daughter was a fan of you.

186
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,370
I don't have a husband.

187
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,930
Raising a child by myself is so hard.

188
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,010
 This coin helps flying saucers spin... 

189
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,610
Thankfully, I can work from home.

190
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,800
But sometimes my daughter gets in the way.

191
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
So I had her watch videos.

192
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,620
I put another channel on at first,

193
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,440
but she kept asking me to buy things.

194
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,080
 Odd or even? 

195
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,160
 - Even? 
 - Ta-da! 

196
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
 You got it right! 

197
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,120
 Wow! It's spinning! Round and round! 

198
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,270
 It's spinning, round and round! 

199
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,200
 One, two, three! 

200
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,090
 Ta-da! 

201
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,850
 It's spinning round and round! 

202
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,360
 Round and round! All done! 

203
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,900
After turning on your channel,

204
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,100
she started to play by herself.

205
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,440
I was thankful for you.

206
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,670
What that guy said is true.

207
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,090
It was my job to play with my kid.

208
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,220
But I pushed it onto you.

209
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,310
I blamed you...

210
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,500
for my child getting sick.

211
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,300
It's my child.

212
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,130
Why did I want to do that?

213
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,160
You must have trusted me. I'm sorry.

214
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,300
I should have done better.

215
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,200
I should have looked into it more.

216
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,050
I should have done better.

217
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,170
I should have looked into it more.

218
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,960
I want to say those exact things to myself.

219
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,810
Thank you...

220
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,060
for playing with my child...

221
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,240
all this time.

222
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,550
   

223
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,700
It wasn't us. It was an individual decision.

224
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,800
It was an individual decision unrelated to our company.

225
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,380
How are you...

226
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,500
going to fix this?

227
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,080
An apology video?

228
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,500
- Producer Lee. 
 - Yes?

229
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,000
Do you think an apology video will fix this?

230
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,080
Our company's name was in the papers.

231
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,300
The festival hasn't said anything. Why should we?

232
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,390
- We were just there as press. 
 - Hey.

233
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,200
Listen to me. Step on shit once, and you can blame the shitter.

234
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,600
Step on shit twice, that's on the stepper!

235
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,830
- You got the sponsorship... 
 - Hey.

236
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,080
I'll take a leave of absence.

237
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,690
I know this is serious, so I'll apologize plenty.

238
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,160
I'll shut down my channel for a while.

239
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,600
Good work.

240
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,000
- Should I take you home right away? 
 - Yes.

241
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,610
- Are you done filming already? 
 - We started early in the morning.

242
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,300
You're taking a leave?

243
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:53,400
- How did you— 
 - Anything said in CEO Ma's office spreads quickly.

244
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,190
Why are you doing this? You should stick it out, and it'll pass.

245
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,190
I don't think I can just let it pass.

246
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,940
It's not because you don't want it that badly?

247
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,380
Unni, you'll be free for a while.

248
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,110
Want to clean my house or something?

249
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,960
Clean?

250
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,940
I'm joking. Wasn't it obvious?

251
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,100
No. You sounded dead serious.

252
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,800
Do you know CEO Seo Ji Hwan well?

253
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,700
- CEO Seo Ji Hwan? 
 - Yeah.

254
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,910
The CEO of Thirsty Deer.

255
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,870
What about him?

256
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,030
The CEO of a company full of ex-cons. Never appears in public.

257
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,950
No photos on his website, let alone in articles.

258
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,970
Refuses every medal from the government.

259
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,150
Do you know anything else?

260
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,650
No.

261
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,830
No worries, then.

262
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,020
   

263
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,500
   

264
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,800
We moved all the children into available hospital rooms and VIP rooms.

265
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,980
They've all been treated and discharged.

266
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,980
We also provided legal support to pursue a class action

267
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,900
against the milk company.

268
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,420
Good work, Dong Hee.

269
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,170
I'm here to see Mr. Seo Ji Hwan.

270
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,490
Hello?

271
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
Who? The Prosecutor's Office?

272
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,140
 Yes, this is Seoul Central District Violent Crimes Unit— 

273
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,420
Hello? Go Eun Ha? Go Eun Ha?

274
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,080
Did the call drop, or did she drop it?

275
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,150
What's going on?

276
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,130
You wanted to meet the witness from Club Cat.

277
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,810
I wanted to ask for a statement, but she hung up.

278
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,630
Go Eun Ha? 
    

279
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,030
I'll take care of it.

280
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,950
-  Hello.  
 - Hello, Ms. Go Eun Ha. This is Seoul Central—

281
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,450
Seoul Central Violent Crimes Unit, right?

282
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,710
 I heard voice phishing was a thing of the past, but apparently not. 

283
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,130
What year is it? Why are you still doing this?

284
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,490
Voice phishing?

285
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,350
I don't have any money in the bank that you can take.

286
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,080
I freelance, so I can't even get a loan.

287
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,400
Plus as of today, I'm unemployed and need to look for work.

288
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,720
I doubt anything could cheer me up right now. Why are you doing this to me?

289
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,650
You stopped working?

290
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,160
 I didn't stop. It's tentative. 

291
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,260
 Maybe you don't know what that means. 

292
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,140
 Indefinite? Do you know what that means? What else... 

293
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,770
- For a while? 
 - Yes, for a while!

294
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,570
You speak good Korean!

295
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,580
   

296
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,060
You must be upset.

297
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,860
Could I ask why you're not working for a while?

298
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,580
I lost my confidence.

299
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:53,110
Even well-intentioned actions sometimes lead to bad results.

300
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,500
Yes, that's true, but...

301
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,430
if the results are bad, it all feels bad.

302
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,170
If the results are good, the hard stuff in the middle would feel good, too.

303
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,970
But Mini Unni values more than just the results.

304
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,960
Do you study counseling, too? I almost fell for it.

305
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,710
 You figured out that I'm Mini Unni? 

306
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,570
Why use that knowledge to scam people? You'll be punished!

307
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,010
Well, I actually don't want to start lying to you.

308
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,580
Go Eun Ha, you know about the assault case that occurred in Club Cat, right?

309
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,310
How do you know about that?

310
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,950
I called you as a witness to that case.

311
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,840
   

312
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,090
I'll get it.

313
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,050
Yes, this is the Prosecutor's Office.

314
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,190
 Who are you? 

315
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,190
Don't you know me?

316
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,720
- Do you know me? 
 - You don't watch TV?

317
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,060
Sure.

318
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,150
I watch it sometimes.

319
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,670
- But you don't know me. 
 - Should I know you?

320
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,740
You probably should. I'm always on TV.

321
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,900
I'm here to pay off my debt.

322
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,240
   

323
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,480
   

324
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,460
This isn't our company's.

325
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,540
Go to the Kitty Money office across the street.

326
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,380
Pay there if you want to pay it off.

327
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,000
You really don't remember me? Eight years ago—

328
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,410
So many people borrowed money from me.

329
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,160
I have plans.

330
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,680
Excuse me, Seo Ji Hwan!

331
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,560
Dong Hee, see her out.

332
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,380
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you, come again.

333
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,880
The chicken place?

334
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, the chicken doll...

335
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,860
I'm sorry, but do you have anything that's not food-related?

336
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,460
I guess most mascots are for eating places.

337
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,730
I can't really do foodstuff.

338
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,720
I can do anything else. Any day of the week.

339
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,800
Yes.

340
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,770
Thank you, bye.

341
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,090
There isn't much I can do besides food promotions.

342
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,350
I can't look for something else since I might be going back soon.

343
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,110
 It's not because you don't want it that badly? 

344
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,230
 Unni, you'll be free for a while. 

345
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,250
 Want to clean my house or something? 

346
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,610
No, no, no...

347
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,030
Yes...

348
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,850
Pride doesn't pay the bills.

349
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:12,900
Eun Ha, you've got to let go of your pride to pay your bills, right?

350
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:21,130
   

351
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,520
   

352
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,020
Seo Ji Hwan! It's Seo Ji Hwan!

353
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,370
Seo Ji Hwan!

354
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,960
S-Seo Ji Hwan.

355
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,690
Seo Ji Hwan is here! Shit!

356
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,870
Hey, hey, hey! Get over here! Hurry over! Run!

357
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,480
Everybody ran over here?

358
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,950
Don't go over the top.

359
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,950
Go Yang Hui is inside, right? Tell him I'm here.

360
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,300
I'm back.

361
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:17,080
Is it true? The Club Cat witness is that lady?

362
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,710
I see the whole picture now. That's why she uploaded that video.

363
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,680
She was our guardian angel.

364
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,660
If she and Seo Ji Hwan got involved twice, maybe they're fated.

365
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,000
They usually say "ill-fated."

366
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,540
Not "meant to be."

367
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,930
Why didn't you say he was here?

368
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,620
- I didn't say he wasn't here. 
 - How could you!

369
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,720
Did you look into what I asked about?

370
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,170
There's a reason why I'm late. Take a look at this.

371
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,550
What is it?

372
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,330
The Thirsty Deer employee who vanished is Jung Yoon Taek.

373
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,400
Turns out he has two past convictions for drug use.

374
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,350
He was part of a drug cartel in Thailand.

375
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,020
He gave up all his buddies to get a lighter sentence.

376
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,660
So?

377
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,980
You've seen this, right?

378
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,500
The candy drug. 
    

379
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,740
Inspector Yang has been looking into this since last year.

380
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,840
A new Thai cartel is behind distributing it.

381
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,450
This Ta Wan is their leader.

382
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,620
And look at the corner of this picture.

383
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,640
The corner?

384
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,800
It's Jung Yoon Taek.

385
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,620
The only one Jung Yoon Taek didn't give away is Ta Wan.

386
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,350
Did you come empty-handed to see Hyungnim for the first time in a while?

387
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,300
Can't you see this?

388
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,510
I brought 100, plus 20 extras. Empty-handed?

389
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,190
Man, you should have gotten something of higher quality.

390
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,750
You and I both like instant coffee.

391
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,770
I don't hide that I have cheap taste.

392
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,780
A thug who pretends his hands aren't dirty?

393
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,440
You don't wash your hands?

394
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,700
Hygiene is important these days.

395
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,430
Don't dirty a guy who's washed his hands. Just let him go.

396
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,300
If he's washed his hands, why are you looking for him here?

397
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,600
This is your usual strategy, Hyungnim.

398
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,720
I know you've looked for routes in Thailand.

399
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,690
Ji Hwan.

400
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,450
Ji Hwan?

401
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,370
Ji Hwan.

402
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,990
You think

403
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,550
you know it all, don't you?

404
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,960
I only need to know what I want to know.

405
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,690
Jung Yoon Taek.

406
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,390
I'll take him soon.

407
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,800
I just came to let you know.

408
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,910
There you are. You weren't picking up your phone.

409
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,700
Have you been to Taek's house?

410
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,900
The kid was alone while her grandma was at work.

411
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,020
She's cautious. She doesn't talk easily.

412
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,070
- Seven years old, right? 
 - Yes.

413
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,800
I think Taek stopped by often, though.

414
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,300
Their house is stocked, and repairs have been done.

415
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,950
He washed his hands clean after he learned he had a sister.

416
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,400
He must have taken good care of them.

417
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,900
Do you think Taek went to them of his own accord?

418
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,130
We don't know.

419
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,540
Temptation is always there.

420
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,040
It's easy to change your mind.

421
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,990
Everyone would be a saint if you could live the way you hoped.

422
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,400
It's not possible. That's why we're human.

423
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,200
Our minds always change.

424
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:04,030
♫  A story from long ago  ♫

425
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,350
 Close your eyes and count to ten.

♫  See the moon, moon, moon  ♫

427
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,690
Am I a bag of rice? Picking me up like that...

428
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,260
Is the stain gone?

429

♫  You  ♫

436
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,930
Wide shoulders.

437
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,410
Long arms.

438
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,110
Is there a draft?

439
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,400
 Come to my place by 10 a.m. tomorrow. 

440
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,280
Where are the videos?

441
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,920
What's going on?

442
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,610
   

443
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Is it here?

444
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,500
She really came.

445
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,780
Wow. Your place is so nice.

446
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,230
Just come in.

447
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,240
- Just come in? 
 - Yeah. Just come in.

448
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,190
American style. 
  (T/N: without leaving shoes at the door) 

449
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,090
Wow, your place is so nice.

450
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,210
Look at your photo. So cool.

451
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,740
There's a second floor?

452
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,580
Wow, your place is so cool. Oh, a gift for you.

453
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,400
Feels like a housewarming gift.

454
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,010
The pot's a little small, right?

455
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,000
I have to go right now.

456
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
That's the bedroom, and that's the bathroom.

457
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,300
That's the walk-in closet, and that's the office.

458
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,850
- Office. Okay. 
 - I have a lot of clothes in the walk-in closet.

459
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,300
- Can you get some stuff dry-cleaned? 
 - Yeah, no worries.

460
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,700
So the walk-in closet is over there?

461
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,470
I get why you're still at the company.

462
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,180
You take my jokes so seriously.

463
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,100
I told you. You sounded dead serious.

464
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,870
Aren't you late?

465
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,050
Bye.

466
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,180
Good luck filming.

467
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,060
See you later!

468
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,740
   

469
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,240
   

470
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,320
   

471
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,230
Yeah...

472
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,100
- Aren't you going to eat? 
 - No.

473
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,300
- Are you going out? 
 - Just for a bit. Do you need anything?

474
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,890
What do I need?

475
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,290
   

476
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,470
Nothing.

477
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,470
I'll be back, then.

478
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,430
Hey.

479
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:20,490
Did I get a call or anything?

480
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,100
I want to go out, but I don't have my coat.

481
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,520
I need my coat so I can go out. You know I like my coat.

482
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,500
It's still cold outside. She hasn't brought back my dry cleaning?

483
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,300
She hasn't called? She's not bringing it back?

484
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,270

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Is she asleep?

498
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,820
Welco—

499
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,890
- You're... 
 - Hello.

500
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,950
Yes, hel—

501
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,580
   

502
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,000
What brings you here?

503
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,800
I came to get a haircut.

504
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,900
You don't look like you need one.

505
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,400
I thought you might wash it for me.

506
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,480
Your name is Mi Ho, right? Mi Ho Hair.

507
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,400
Take it off.

508
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,300
- Pardon? 
 - What?

509
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,810
Your jacket.

510
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,780
Nothing else. Just your jacket. Take it off.

511
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,240
Your shoelaces were untied.

512
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,760
- For my first visit. 
 - I don't know what it is, but thank you.

513
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,100
Our company's new product. It's a gift set. You'll like it.

514
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,700
Thank you.

515
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,610
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

516
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,940
Take your time.

517
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,120
One second.

518
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,730
Hey, Eun Ha.

519
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,820
I called to see what you were doing. I have a client now.

520
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,340
What?

521
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,800
Kang Ye Na's house?

522
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,500
Why are you there?

523
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,410
 This is the location of the jacket you need. 

524
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:07,180
 Something came up. Could you retrieve it yourself? 

525
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,100
It's already so late.

526
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,200
Ye Na?

527
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,080
You're back.

528
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,480
Eun Ha?

529
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,120
What are you doing here?

530
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,050
 Aigoo, good work. 

531
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,000
 I need to change. 

532
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,320
 Are you guys free? 

533
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,300
Did you invite Eun Ha, too?

534
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,340
It's a creators' bonding session, so I invited her.

535
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,010
Are those...

536
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,350
trash bags?

537
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,380
Were you cleaning, Eun Ha?

538
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,200
Yes. I cleaned up.

539
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,300
She said she was having guests over.

540
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,940
I took special care, so enjoy.

541
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,970
Bye.

542
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,150
How bad is her situation for her to be cleaning here?

543
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,630
- Make yourself at home. 
 - Okay.

544
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,170
It's here.

545
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,470
Hey, calm down.

546
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,580
I'm here to get my coat. No ulterior motive.

547
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,790
I'm here to get my coat.

548
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,610
How have you been? I'm here to get my coat.

549
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,640
Here's your pay.

550
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,560
Right, I almost forgot.

551
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,060
Thanks.

552
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,180
This is one million won.

553
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,850
It seemed like you needed the money. So I prepared enough.

554
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,320
I mean...

555
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,500
I do need the money, ...

556
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,140
but this is too much.

557
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,610
I don't have change. Can I send it to you once I get home?

558
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,990
You know I brought people over on purpose. Why are you playing dumb?

559
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,260
- What? 
 - So I know it got to you,

560
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,940
shouldn't you at least argue with me?

561
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,720
It's so awkward to even argue with you since you make it so obvious.

562
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,680
Ye Na, I haven't done anything to make you hate me.

563
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,190
I'm just annoyed.

564
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,080
People like you make our line of work look easy.

565
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:15,990
I started because I wanted it to look easy.

566
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:20,020
I wanted to make it easy for kids to follow along.

567
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,060
Have I succeeded?

568
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,490
I'll be sure to send you the change.

569
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,820
Bye.

570
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,580
Seo Ji Hwan?

571
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,790
What?

572
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,190
- Are you here to see me? 
 - No...

573
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,150
How did you know where I lived? Did you call the company?

574
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,650
Are things weird between you two?

575
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,620
I'll get going.

576
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,180
Where are you going? You just got here.

577
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,410
- Go on home. 
 - Ji Hwan.

578
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,430
I...

579
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,840
I'm here.

580
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,450
Hey, there.

581
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,630
Hi.

582
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,910
What should I have today?

583
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,200
Rolled egg omelet?

584
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,670
- For two? 
 - No, just me today.

585
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,210
Why are you here?

586
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,930
Weren't you just at Ye Na's?

587
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,630
Then...

588
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,890
I'll have a Sprite.

589
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,650
Sprite? At a street pub?

590
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,260
I can't... No, I don't drink.

591
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,870
Oh, you can't drink.

592
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:09,910
I thought you were holding a beer can last time.

593
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,320
You're going to sit here?

594
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,560
We don't have any other tables.

595
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,010
Here.

596
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,380
It's late. What are you doing out?

597
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,760
It's only 8 o'clock. The night is just starting.

598
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,870
I'll pour one for you.

599
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,650
Thanks.

600
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,650
Ji Hwan, do you like Ye Na?

601
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,630
Oh, no.

602
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,880
Are you okay?

603
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:00,990
I mean, I'd like her, too.

604
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,360
She's pretty, smart, popular, and gets at least 10K likes.

605
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,730
She doesn't get a like from me.

606
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,820
You don't watch kids' content?

607
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,630
Then what do you watch? Do you subscribe to anything?

608
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:25,210
- Just one. 
 - Which one? MMA, stuff like that?

609
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,150
No, but...

610
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,670
the channel shut down.

611
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:48,070
   

612
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,070
Being a prosecutor must keep you busy.

613
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,260
Oh, yes. I just came from work, and I'll need to go back.

614
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,470
I know prosecutors don't make much money.

615
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,700
It's an honorable job. Not much bang for your buck.

616
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,170
- But you have a house, right? 
 - Yes. I have to sleep and live.

617
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,960
Do you own?

618
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,000
Which neighborhood? Gangnam?

619
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,080
I'm sorry, but since my job involves interrogating,

620
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,410
I'd like to converse outside the office.

621
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:48,850
I don't want to interrogate or be interrogated.

622
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,490
We're not here as defendants.

623
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,250
It's raining?

624
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,650
You didn't bring your car?

625
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,490
Oh, no. I'm close, so...

626
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,650
I'll be going, then.

627
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,620
To be clear, I'm the one rejecting you.

628
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,250
- Take this. 
 - No, it's okay.

629
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,340
Take it. You'll catch a cold. I have another.

630
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,080
Then...

631
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,320
Thank you.

632
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,910
   

633
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,120
I guess I'll see her tomorrow.

634
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,780
You know...

635
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,610
can I tell you a secret?

636
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:01,590
I hate mobsters.

637
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,890
Whenever they came by...

638
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:08,320
something always got broken.

639
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,950
Broken glass, a piggy bank...

640
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,600
You know what?

641
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,100
Something once broken never comes back.

642
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,840
You can't do anything but clean it up.

643
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,060
I'm sorry about that.

644
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:38,620
Why are you sorry? Did you come to my house when I was little?

645
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,390
Were you really a mobster?

646
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:45,220
Why do you want to know?

647
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:50,580
I just wish you weren't.

648
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,310
I wish I wasn't...

649
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,060
either.

650
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,160
I can't walk. I'm too drunk.

651
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,130
Why did I drink so much? I feel like puking.

652
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,060
Where do you live?

653
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,280
My house is really far.

654
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,970
It's way over there.

655
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,860
Right there...

656
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,310
I'm so tired...

657
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,140
Let's go.

658
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,080
 Isn't this the way it's supposed to happen? 

659
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,780
Wait. Try standing up.

660
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:09,100
You got drunk after one drink? Try walking straight.

661
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,660
What a lightweight!

662
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,730
 I just wish you weren't. 

663
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,650
Hold on. Try to walk...

664
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,750
Hold on.

665
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,530
Wait.

666
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,830
You're twice my size!

667
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,190
Wait. I should call a cab, right?

668
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,570
Where are we?

669
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:40,000
This is not good. This is dangerous.

670
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,500
What? Where did he go?

671
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:00,320
Seo Ji Hwan! Where did he go? Seo Ji Hwan!

672
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,430
Where did he...

673
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,850
Seo Ji Hwan!

674
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:10,730
Seo Ji Hwan! Where are you?

675
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,940
Can you hear me?

676
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:17,120
Seo Ji Hwan! Where did he go?

677
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,900
 Ready to go! 

678
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,230

679
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,260
Jump!

680
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,640
Hey, Seo Ji Hwan!

681
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,180
What the heck?

682
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,250
You're Mini Unni!

683
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,600
What are you doing here?

684
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,000
Why did you take off your shoes?

685
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,500
What...

686
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,800
I'm actually really good at spinning this thing.

687
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,590
Oh, sure. Sure.

688
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,890
It's meant to spin around, so I'm sure it does.

689
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:07,340
- I called a cab. It's late. Let's get you home. 
 - Wait.

690
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,940
- Let's go. Take a ride. 
 - What?

691
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,140
It's safe on here.

692
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,530
I'll make sure you're safe.

693
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,420
Seo Ji Hwan!

694
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,640
How about it, Mini? Are you having fun?

695
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,900
I need to get down. I think I'm going to throw up.

696
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,410
- All right! 
 - I'm going to throw up.

697
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,970
- Mini. 
 - Yes.

698
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,880
Are you all right?

699
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,720
- Let's go. Go home now. 
 - No, Mini.

700
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,990
- Hold back your vomit. 
 - I'm going to puke.

701
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,910
Mini, there's so much to do.

702
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,620
Should we try the slide? Follow me!

703
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,300
One second.

704
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,710

 - Yes.

726
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,020
Have a seat.

727
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,720
- Be careful. 
 - I haven't done this in a while.

728

- Are you having fun? 
 - I'll do it myself.

- Yeah? 
 - Yes.

730
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,470
Then...

731
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,490
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

732
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,940
I need to take a break.

733
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,420
Seriously...

734
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,570
 Oppa, can you do this? 

735
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,900
 I can do it standing up! 

736
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:36,500
 Hey, hey! It's dangerous! 

737
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,480
Seo Ji Hwan.

738
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,210
Yes?

739
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,200
Can you do this?

740
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,270
One, two, three! I can do it standing up.

741
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:00,100
Look!

742
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,040
I haven't done this in forever.

743
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,240
It's a little scary.

744
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,810
Be careful.

745
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,640
Wow, I'm up so high!

746
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,550
You're good at that.

747
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,460
You finished it up nicely.

748
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,980
I'm good at it.

749
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,140
I really am.

750
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,240
That was the first time I heard I was good at something.

751
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,100
I'm not good at using chopsticks.

752
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,820
I'm a horrible cook.

753
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,070
I didn't get good grades, either.

754
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:05,570
If I'm not good at anything, I might as well do something I like. That's how I started.

755
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,480
But turns out I need to be good at what I love to keep doing it.

756
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,950
That's not true.

757
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:19,020
Mini, you're good at a lot of stuff.

758
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,260
You're good at making bubbles.

759
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,170
You're good at drinking.

01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,960
 - Are you firing me?  
  - She was fired today. 

817
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,800
 Mini, if it's okay with you, 

818
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,900
 - ramen... 
 - What? 

819
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,260
 You slept together? 

820
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,940
 What, the little rat? 

821
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,400
 Aren't you scared of Seo Ji Hwan? 

822
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,300
 Aren't you scared of him? 

823
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,250
 Why don't we get help from someone who knows kids? 

824
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,160
 Can I help you?
