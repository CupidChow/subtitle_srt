2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,090
   

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,290
   

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,900
   

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,490
â™«  Baby, baby, let me come along  â™«

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,560
â™«  Every single day I belong  â™«

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,540
â™«  Baby, baby, let me come along  â™«

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,180
â™«  Keep you happy all day long  â™«

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,190
   

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,060
Isn't it nice? 
    

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,570
I know it's an old house, but it's nice for a family.

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,200
A big yard, too. We just put down a new lawn.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,910
- Look around. 
 - Thanks.

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,950
Hello? Okay, okay. Yes.

 ðŸ’ž Barbie Girl in a Mobster World ðŸ”« Team @Viki.com 

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,680
It's an old tree.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,010
Why do you want to move into this house?

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,350
A long time ago...

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,380
I lived here for a bit.

20
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,880
When I wasn't Seo Ji Hwan

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,690
but Yoon Hyun Woo.

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,740
 Oppa, thanks for always playing with me. 

23
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,180
Is this what you're looking for?

24
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,330
How do you know that?

25
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,470
It looked like the whole tree might get pulled out.

26
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,510
I got the guys to dig it up.

27
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,600
Right. I'm sorry.

28
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,300
Thank you for finding it.

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,830
That box...

30
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,370
Is it one of the memories you were talking about?

31
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,280
Why are you putting it back?

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,400
You're not going to take it?

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,560
Yoon Hyun Woo is dead.

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,540
Eun Ha.

35
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,420
There are memories better left buried.

36
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,350
Next time, don't go looking for them.

37
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,080
You could write a thesis and even get a PhD on Seo Ji Hwan.

38
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,540
How did you miss something like this?

39
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,810
I didn't think of his personal history.

40
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,450
Seo Ji Hwan is Seo Tae Pyung's son, but he was put on the family registry at age 16.

41
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,410
The mother was never legally his wife.

42
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,910
He may or may not have known that he had a son when they broke up.

43
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,630
Maybe he ran off knowing he had a kid, or he ran off but found out he had a kid.

44
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,500
There could be other scenarios, but seeing he moved every six months,

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,120
he probably was running from something.

46
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,450
So, when Seo Tae Pyung was imprisoned, and Seo Ji Hwan started Thirsty Deer,

47
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,750
he moved into the house he used to live in.

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,440
Life is strange. I know it's a small world, but...

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,640
the person you're looking for is Seo Ji Hwan?

50
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,760
Seo Ji Hwan was...

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,560
the same person I was looking for and wanted to catch.

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,110
We are ill-fated, I suppose.

53
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,550
 Excuse me. 

54
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,580
 Your name. 

55
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,860
 Is it Eun Ha? 

56
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,470
 Yes. It's Go Eun Ha. 

57
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,650
 Hey. 

58
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,670
 What's your name? 

59
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,800
 Go Eun Ha. 

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,300
â™«  Soothe my weary day  â™«

61
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:21,170
â™«  Reflect on my uneasy heart  â™«

62
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:27,420
â™«  I wish it was all a dream  â™«

63
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,440
 If scary guys come again, 
   â™«  When I feel alone  â™«

64
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,730
 put this on. You won't hear a thing. 

65
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,770
â™«  Lights of the past  â™«

66
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,120
â™«  Warmly embrace me again  â™«

67
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:53,150
â™«  I want to see the light, wake me up from my tiredness  â™«

68
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,340
    
 â™«  Push away the time  â™«

69
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,000
â™«  ...like a lie  â™«

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,340
â™«  Oh, shine on me at the end of this road  â™«

71
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,610
â™«  May the thick darkness be lifted  â™«

72
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:20,310
â™«  and the bright light come to me  â™«

73
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,910
Yes, Eun Ha?

74
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,990
Prosecutor.

75
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,150
 Do you have time tomorrow evening? 

76
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,520
Tomorrow? I don't have plans. It should work.

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,200
What's going on?

78
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,060
I found something precious to me today.

79
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,430
 I really want to show it to you. 

80
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,800
I want you to see it.

81
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,630
 I'm Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. 

82
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,700
 Hyun Woo... 

83
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,350
Hyun Woo...

84
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,770
This is Ta Wan's hideout.

85
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,770
There will be at least seven men in Ta Wan's camp.

86
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,280
More from Go Yang Hui's side. 
    

87
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,200
It might be best to call the police.

88
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,850
If we make a mistake, Taek will get hurt.

89
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,820
If something goes wrong, the hostage is the first to die.

90
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,810
It's a big drug deal.

91
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,330
If you go and get involved,

92
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,620
just the fact that you were there will be inescapable.

93
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,290
Il Yeong.

94
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,310
Do you know Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo?

95
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,610
From Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office?

96
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,130
Yeah. He went to your school. What's he like?

97
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,440
He has conviction. He doesn't compromise.

98
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,860
He's especially harsh on assault convicts.

99
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,270
Why do you ask?

100
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,960
I met him recently.

101
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,610
The prosecutor who followed you last time?

102
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,090
I think he saw me 10 years ago at the hotel.

103
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,290
- The hotel? 
 - Yes.

104
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,930
If Prosecutor Jang takes that into account,

105
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,220
- he may be more sensitive about this. 
 - Right.

106
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,840
From his point of view, it's understandable.

107
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,760
But still.

108
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,350
That incident was unavoidable.

109
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,920
How was that unavoidable?

110
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,740
It all started with me.

111
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,800
 Seo Tae Pyung, the boss of Bulldog Gang, 
   

112
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,790
 has been operating an illegal gambling site worth 4 billion won. 

113
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,620
 He has been arrested for siphoning the funds to foreign accounts. 

114
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,450
 The prosecution is investigating him for overseas tax evasion, 

115
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,690
 hiding criminal profit, and bribery... 

116
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,350
We need to move before my dad does.

117
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,880
Freeze the assets that he hasn't laundered yet.

118
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,270
Regarding the hotel, get the shareholders together this week.

119
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,120
- Prepare to hold a shareholders' meeting. 
 - Okay.

120
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,840
What if people find out you ratted him out?

121
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,190
They'll be up in arms.

122
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,230
Don't you think you need to hide out somewhere for a bit?

123
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,230
I'm prepared for it.

124
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,260
   

125
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,010
We're here, Hyungnim.

126
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,120
Il Yeong, take the car to school.

127
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,340
I can take the bus.

128
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,900
I thought you had an exam today.

129
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,980
Get in, man. And show us around the campus sometime.

130
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,810
Are you worried I'd ask you to set me up with a girl?

131
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,160
It's not like that.

132
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,990
Can I go on a blind date, Hyungnim?

133
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm sorry, Hyungnim. Get in, man.

134
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,400
Go.

135
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,670
See you later.

136
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,050
   

137
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,000
Hello.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,560
Why is no one working?

139
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,200
We're setting up. You can head to the event hall.

140
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,600
Go help the guests over there.

141
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,280
Yes, sir.

142
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,780
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry. Are you all right?

143
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,670
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes.

144
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,140
I'm sorry.

145
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:17,270
   

146
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,020
   

147
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,540
Hi! Have you eaten?

148
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,000
You know,

149
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,400
it's been 15 years.

150
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,100
I worked under Hyungnim like a dog for 15 years to make us prosper.

151
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,400
Then you got to inherit it because you're blood-related!

152
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,300
Damn it! It makes me so mad, I could die!

153
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,020
Then you hand off the whole thing to the prosecution...

154
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,300
and finish off the group?

155
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,500
There's an event in here in two hours. Let's talk later.

156
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,000
There is no later.

157
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm going to take over this hotel,

158
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,000
and you're going to die here.

159
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
Everybody get out!

160
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,030
Bye!

161
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,140
   

162
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,360
So cool!

163
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,030
Go ahead.

164
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,770
Hey!

165
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,780
If you don't kill him, I'll kill all of you!

166
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,700
Hyungnim.

167
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,000
Grandma!

168
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,080
Grandma...

169
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,570
Grandma, it's Mi Jin.

170
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,020
Wake up!

171
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,280
Wake up, ma'am...

172
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,880
Just a little bit...

173
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
Why is the door open?

174
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,500
I just saw the door was open. I was going to close it.

175
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,890
Have you been out?

176
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,600
- I was feeding the dog. 
 - In the middle of the night?

177
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Yes.

178
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
What's the bulldog's name?

179
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,830
- Bulldog. 
 - I know it's a bulldog. What's his name?

180
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,390
His name is "Bulldog."

181
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
Bulldog. Because he's a bulldog.

182
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,890
Yes.

183
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay.

184
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,600
Excuse me, Mr. Seo.

185
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,670
Well...

186
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,200
You told me last night that some memories are better left buried.

187
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,500
- What did you mean by that? 
 - It's what it sounds like.

188
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,800
For some people, confronting the past is a difficult thing.

189
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,940
Everyone has a different story.

190
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,380
Does that answer your question?

191
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,020
Yes.

192
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,250
 Like and subscribe... 

193
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,050
 please! 

194
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,710
 Turn on your notifications, too! 

195
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,990
   

196
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,900
Do we really need to do this?

197
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,600
- Yes, dude. 
 - She's here!

198
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,780
- Eun Ha, you made it. 
 - It looks so good!

199
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,670
Little rat! Sit here.

200
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,160
You shouldn't sit somewhere cold.

201
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,050
- What? 
 - Sit on a cushion.

202
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,220
- Is it a special day? What is it? 
 - Just sit.

203
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,000
Sit. I prepared a special meal.

204
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,500
Man Ho!

205
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,280
- Cuttlefish. 
 - What is going on?

206
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,070
It's just that...

207
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,430
I had a conception dream.

208
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,730
- Conception? 
 - Yes.

209
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,550
I saw a cute, pink, chubby pig.

210
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,450
We were carefully moving it somewhere.

211
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,500
Wait.

212
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,400
- Was the pig dead? 
 - Yes, it was.

213
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,500
Piggy!

214
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
 I knew it. 

215
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,680
Not all dreams with pigs are good.

216
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,570
A dream where you're carrying a dead pig...

217
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,740
   

218
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,830
It's bad luck.

219
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,520
Maybe it wasn't dead.

220
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,860
- Maybe it was sleeping. 
 - It was sleeping.

221
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,970
Was it sleeping?

222
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,530
Dong Hee.

223
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,480
Where's Hyungnim?

224
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,420
- What's wrong with you? 
 - What is it?

225
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,120
What's going on, Dong Hee?

226
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,860
Well...

227
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,800
- Hyungnim went looking for Taek. 
 - What?

228
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,660
   

229
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,630
What a beautiful day. Hey, hey, hey!

230
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,560
It's a nice day. Let's enjoy it. Play some music. Something happy!

231
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,480
Yes, sir.

232
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,220
What do you mean Ji Hwan went alone to get Taek?

233
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,890
He told me recently to drop out of finding Taek.

234
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,840
He was planning to go by himself.

235
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,550
Why are you telling us just now, you bastard?

236
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,260
- I'm sorry. 
 - But I just saw him.

237
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,110
Shouldn't we call the cops first?

238
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,350
I think Taek is stuck in the middle. We can report it, right?

239
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,490
Report what? And who's going to do it?

240
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,410
Did you hear anything about a location?

241
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,560
No, I didn't.

242
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,240
The cops can figure out how to track them down.

243
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,530
We don't have time! Something might happen to Ji Hwan!

244
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,990
We need to call the cops.

245
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,360
Call them. Hurry.

246
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,650
Call them.

247
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,560
 Do you know how to do that thing? 

248
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,380
What thing?

249
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,080
So... a coupâ€”

250
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,250
I heard... two people, in a dangerous situation,

251
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,340
there's a way to know each other's location?

252
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,720
It's just that if a situation like today...

253
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,770
or something dangerous happens,

254
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,270
it wouldn't be bad to know where we can find each other.

255
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,750
I know.

256
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,160
I know where Seo Ji Hwan is.

257
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,940
- Where? 
 - Here!

258
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,020
He told me how to...

259
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,570
Where is he?

260
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,200
    
 This...

261
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Yes. Asia Food in Jeyang-dong.

262
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,100
It's not a confirmed report.

263
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,500
But the description matches.

264
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm on my way now.

265
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,980
   

266
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,330
Did you report it?

267
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,170
 Yes, they should arrive just about now. 

268
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,150
Okay.

269
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,170
Wait, where are youâ€”

270
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,140
I told you I'm going alone. Head back.

271
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,100
- I'm sorry. 
 - Don't make me waste time on this.

272
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,390
- So let's go. 
 - Don't make me say this twice.

273
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,630
I told you I'm doing this on my own.

274
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,100
I'm going with you.

275
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,700
- Geez... 
 - 10 years ago, when that happened,

276
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,090
I was late because I had an exam.

277
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,590
I didn't answer my phone, either.

278
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,940
Back then...

279
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,580
I didn't pick up on purpose.

280
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,520
 After the exam, my classmates wanted to go out to eat. 

281
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,790
 We played pool, and we went to karaoke. 

282
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,610
   

283
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,100
When you were stabbed and unconscious in surgery,

284
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,600
I was acting like an ordinary college student, laughing and chatting.

285
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,390
After I let you go that day,

286
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,600
do you know what I thought about?

287
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,670
 Il Yeong, take the car to school. 

288
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,240
 I thought you had an exam today. 

289
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,510
 I should have let him go earlier so he could have studied more. 

290
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,420
You always felt guilty getting money for your tuition.

291
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,760
You couldn't even take breaks in order to receive scholarships.

292
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,910
I've said a lot of nonsense for nothing.

293
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,640
Even just for a moment that day,

294
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,610
if you felt like an ordinary college student,

295
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,990
I would have died happy that day.

296
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,220
Still, I'm not going back.

297
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,380
   

298
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,400
The rats are coming out.

299
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,090
Make sure you check the cheese boxes later.

300
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,950
There's a lot of them.

301
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,590
That's Ta Wan.

302
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,500
Bingo, bingo.

303
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,110
There are a lot of rats today. Be on your best game.

304
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,590
Let's go.

305
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,990
Hey, start the car. Let's go.

306
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,160
They're headed toward Jeyang Intersection. Signal and follow them. Got it?

307
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,560
   

308
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,820
 Hello, Hyungnim. 

309
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,990
Are you shooting a movie?

310
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,320
So bloody. It's hot in here.

311
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,750
Is that him?

312
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,260
This is Jung Yoon Taek.

313
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:51,120
Aigoo! You look so sly, you traitor.

314
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,630
Hey, just so you can survive...

315
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,290
It's okay.

316
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,440
If you send your bros to jail,

317
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,220
do you think the remaining guys would be happy or not?

318
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,800
- They're unhappy, which is why you'll die. 
 - W-What?

319
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,070
I mean, a guy who sells out his friend to establish solid footing...

320
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,790
You two are cut from the same cloth, man. Oh, right...

321
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,560
You haven't seen Ta Wan in a while, right?

322
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,000
Bye.

323
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,330
P-P-Please save me!

324
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,600
It's hot. Turn off the lights.

325
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,220
Hyungnim!

326
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,120
Hyungnim!

327
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,140
Son of a bitch... Seo Ji Hwan is here!

328
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,960
- Seo Ji Hwan! 
 - Find Hyungnim now!

329
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,800
You son of a bitch!

330
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Hey. Get that bastard!

331
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,660
Don't you dare move an inch.

332
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,420
Get him.

333
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,440
- Don't move! 
 - Get him!

334
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,070
Hey! Don't...

335
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,590
Hey! Get him! I'm okay! Get that bastard!

336
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,120
CEO.

337
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,550
- Hurry, go. 
 - You must come.

338
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,180
Hurry up!

339
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,450
Hey, hey, hey!

340
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,260
Stay back, stay back!

341
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,400
Hey! Stay back!

342
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,430
Hyungnim.

343
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,940
Hyungnim, are you okay?

344
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,910
Get that bastard!

345
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,130
Take your time.

346
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,780
Keep left. 
  (T/N: speaking Thai) 

347
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,550
Follow them slowly. To the left.

348
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,630
What's that?

349
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,510
We're being followed.

350
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,720
F*cking Go Yang Hui!

351
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,410
Stand by.

352
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,800
Hey, split up.

353
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,520
We're f*cked! Split up!

354
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,150
Yes. Split up.

355
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,060
Floor it!

356
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,990
Hey, hey, hey. They're onto us. Follow them.

357
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,120
Swerve to the right. Now!

358
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,350
Near Sanhwang-ro?

359
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,150
If they caught on, they must've changed directions.

360
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,600
We'll have to give up on getting them on the road.

361
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,790
Got it. Officer, follow Ta Wan.

362
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,140
Chief, put out an alert on Go Yang Hui and Seo Ji Hwan's cars.

363
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,610
Track their phones, too.

364
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,010
Unfortunately, I don't have their numbers.

365
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,060
- The info's in my briefcase. 
 - Got it.

366
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,080
Busy, busy.

367
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,230
What is that cumbersome thing?

368
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,590
Don't worry about it. It's for our safety.

369
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,000
Okay.

370
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,280
Officer Jang, I need your help tracking down a car.

371
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,920
It's super, super, super urgent. The name is Go Yang Hui.

372
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,580
His number is 010...

373
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,000
Sister-in-law, where do we go from here?

374
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,130
Turn left.

375
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,670
Little rat. Give me your phone.

376
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,790
You'll leave me behind.

377
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,840
Of course. We can't take you there! Do you even know where we're going?

378
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,780
We don't need you. Give me your phone and get out.

379
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,280
We can't just leave her. Let her have it.

380
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,620
Hand me your phone and get out.

381
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,370
Hyung, I know you're worried about her, but we don't know where we're going.

382
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,180
Sister-in-law, where do I go?

383
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,550
Turn left.

384
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,400
- Give me directions ahead of time. 
 - Okay.

385
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,360
I've been waiting for this day. How dare you ruin it?

386
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,330
How dare you get in the way, asshole! My throat hurts!

387
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,530
I don't care what you do.

388
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,590
I just want Taek.

389
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,280
- This is it. 
 - Prosecutor.

390
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,220
Prosecutor?

391
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,890
You called for local backup, right?

392
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,830
Yes. So let's go in five minutes. They'll be here in five minutes.

393
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,890
We shouldn't do this on our own. I have my Da Sol...

394
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,760
- Go. 
 - Prosecutor. Prosecutor!

395
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,240
Sol, Daddy has to do this for our nation.

396
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,030
Right. Stay strong and live on Mommy and Daddy's pension.

397
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,420
Let me do it.

398
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,270
All right.

399
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,440
You kill him.

400
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,310
Hold him.

401
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,080
More, more, more.

402
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,480
Go around them!

403
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,560
Swerve more!

404
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,640
Get closer!

405
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,960
Hurry up! More!

406
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,940
Stop there right now! Stop, bastard!

407
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,700
Hey! Stop the car!

408
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,420
Swerve!

409
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,850
I heard you live with a woman.

410
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:42,360
A kids cre-cre-crea something?

411
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,500
What was her name?

412
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,860
Are you two dating?

413
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,820
This is so fun.

414
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,970
Hey!

415
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,750
- Come on! 
 - I'm sorry.

416
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,580
Buddha, have mercy...

417
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,080
Go Yang Hui, come outside!

418
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,360
What's going on?

419
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,500
Hurry up and get out!

420
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,280
 Hurry up and get out! Hurry up! 

421
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,830
Hey, who are you?

422
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,690
I'm just a passerby. I'll pass and never come back...

423
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,050
Hey!

424
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay.

425
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,710
You know your Miranda rights, right? Let's go quietly.

426
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,700
Hey, hey, hey. Get him!

427
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,840
Tell them to stop.

428
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,800
Move!

429
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,150
I-It's mine!

430
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,040
Hey, Gang Gil.

431
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,510
I-I'm off.

432
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,850
- Hurry up! 
 - Are you all right?

433
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,520
This way. Go on in.

434
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,490
Arrest them!

435
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,440
Police!

436
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,690
We're here.

437
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,390
I see police cars.

438
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,630
Police? Where?

439
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,440
Hey, little rat. Look inside the box.

440
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,350
Get the binoculars. The binoculars.

441
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,770
The bino...

442
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,190
Give it to me.

443
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,920
Prosecutor?

444
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,360
A prosecutor is here?

445
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,390
That thing's mine! We should have gotten rid of her.

446
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,030
- Seo Ji Hwan! 
 - Where?

447
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,370
What are you doing? Move.

448
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,870
   

449
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,140
   

450
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,650
Be quiet! Shut it!

451
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,400
- What? 
 - Right to remain silent!

452
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,210
Hey! Answer me!

453
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,600
You have a Korean name.

454
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,030
You f*cking traitor!

455
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,660
You bastard!

456
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,870
Let go!

457
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,510
Get her out of here!

458
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,900
Get her out!

459
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,910
Get out!

460
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,030
Shut up!

461
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,530
Geez, another car!

462
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,850
These pigs...

463
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,960
How did they find us?

464
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,620
I'm getting eaten by mosquitoes. I want to shower.

465
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,880
This is mine. Mine.

466
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,500
Il Yeong is on his way. You guys go home.

467
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,900
I'll stay.

468
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,100
Dong Hee, you guys go home.

469
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,700
I'll stay, too. Hyung, you go home.

470
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,800
What am I going to do alone? I'll stay. Mini Unni, go rest.

471
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,430
   

472
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,970
I have to take this.

473
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,310
Yes, Prosecutor.

474
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:23,510
Something came up. I have to cancel dinner.

475
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,530
I meant to call earlier, but I was all over the place.

476
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,800
 I'm so sorry. 

477
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,810
No, it's okay. Something came up for me, too. But...

478
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,150
what's going on?

479
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,900
I have a case.

480
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,700
Nothing serious, right?

481
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,240
What?

482
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,980
I'll have to see whether it's serious or not.

483
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,400
- Don't worry. 
 - Okay.

484
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,970
 It's just urgent. 

485
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,140
Anyway, I'm sorry.

486
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,830
No, it's okay.

487
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:58,040
But when do you think the investigation will be done?

488
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,370
   

489
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,510
Do you need to go to the hospital?

490
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,500
- No, I'm okay. 
 - Then let's get started.

491
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,700
Mr. Seo Ji Hwan.

492
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,000
 Hey, why weren't you picking up all day? 

493
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,390
 Are you crying? 

494
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,130
No, it's nothing.

495
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,060
Where are you? I'm coming.

496
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,100
 The police station. 

497
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,300
What?

498
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,070
Seo Ji Hwan has been arrested.

499
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,740
Seo Ji Hwan has been arrested? For what?

500
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,200
It's a long story.

501
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,800
 Hey. Calm down. Tell me what happened. 

502
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,550
Where is Jung Yoon Taek now?

503
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,600
I don't know.

504
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,490
Let's say you're telling the truth, and you went to save him, not to take him away.

505
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,280
Why did you stay at the scene afterward?

506
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,090
I had some unfinished business.

507
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,130
Was that "business" buying Jung Yoon Taek time to run away?

508
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:46,490
You spied on a drug cartel, figured out where and when the deal was happening,

509
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,130
all for an employee of less than a year.

510
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,910
You didn't tell anyone and entered the lion's den by yourself.

511
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,100
By chance, were you the one who sent in the tip this morning?

512
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,600
Yoon Hyun Woo.

513
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,650
Do you know someone named Yoon Hyun Woo?

514
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,790
I don't.

515
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,500
Do you, Prosecutor?

516
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,300
Go Eun Ha thinks it's me.

517
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,150
Because this person named Hyun Woo

518
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,430
dreamed of being a prosecutor.

519
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,100
She's so desperate to find him. If I ever found him, I was going to tell her.

520
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,800
But I don't think I can.

521
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,300
It seems like you have your own reasons for not telling her.

522
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,720
It has nothing to do with me.

523
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,340
Are we done with the interrogation?

524
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,160
   

525
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,400
   

526
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,810
Prosecutor.

527
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,550
   

528
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,620
I'm Jung Yoon Taek.

529
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:54,030
   

530
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,630
Hyungnim!

531
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,540
Hyungnim!

532
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,100
Are you okay?

533
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,400
Are you okay, Hyungnim?

534
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,300
If you look like this, you must be hurting inside. Are you okay?

535
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,400
Taek isn't done. You guys should goâ€”

536
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,400
Your face looks terrible, Hyungnim.

537
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,920
Go on home.

538
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,400
Take care of yourself.

539
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,010
Seo Ji Hwan...

540
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,920
What is going on?

541
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,120
Did Hyungnim deal drugs with the Kitty Gang or something?

542
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,670
If he was caught on the scene...

543
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,300
it won't be easy to get out of this.

544
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,000
I saw the news.

545
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,700
They didn't bust the deal itself.

546
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,100
We'll have to see how the investigation goes, but it's not the worst-case scenario.

547
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,500
What about the little rat?

548
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,000
Is she still outside?

549
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,780
Yes.

550
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,950
 Seo Ji Hwan... 

551
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:03,000
â™«  Even if I don't see you  â™«

552
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,060
â™«  Your face keeps coming to mind  â™«

553
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,600
â™«  Still, with a heart on edge  â™«

554
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,920
 Oppa, what's your dream? 

555
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,200
 When I grow up, I'll become a prosecutor. 

556
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,270
 What's a prosecutor? 

557
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,900
 A prosecutor... 

558
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,890
 is someone... 

559
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:33,930
 who scolds the bad guys.  
 â™«  Will the day come when my heart reaches you?  â™«

560
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:42,080
â™«  Will the day come when my heart reaches you?  â™«

561
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:50,630
â™«  Though time passes by, itâ€™s still you for me  â™«

562
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:57,660
â™«  Please remember me this way  â™«

563
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:06,650
â™«  Now, please look at me  â™«

564
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,700
- Can you walk by yourself? 
 - Yeah, I'm fine.

565
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,700
Thank goodness you're not worse.

566
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,100
Thanks for everything. Go take care of Taek.

567
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,130
Okay. Get some rest.

568
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,250
Seo Ji Hwan.

569
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,900
It's late. You shouldn't be outside.

570
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,400
Are you okay?

571
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,300
Let me see how badly you're hurtâ€”

572
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,610
Go Eun Ha.

573
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,000
Do you like me?

574
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,900
- What? 
 - I don't like you.

575
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,400
You asked me what you were to me.

576
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,450
To me, you are...

577
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,690
a tenant. Nothing more, nothing less.

578
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,990
CEO.

579
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,200
Hyungnim!

580
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,800
Are you all right, Hyungnim?

581
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,510
Are you out?

582
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,200
How could you go there alone?

583
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,200
We were worried to death.

584
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:07,300
How could you bring her there when she's got nothing to do with it?

585
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,200
You really don't get the picture?

586
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,600
Hyungnim, we were worriedâ€”

587
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,230
 Yoon Hyun Woo. 

588
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:11,700
 Do you know someone named Yoon Hyun Woo? 

589
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,500
 I don't. 

590
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,830
You fed the dog at dawn, and you were totally fine.

591
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:46,450
Then you come home at night hurt like this. Even if you were a stranger, I'd be worried.

592
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:49,690
You don't have to be cruel to me. I know it makes you uncomfortable.

593
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:52,910
Disinfect your wounds and put on some ointment.

594
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,000
- Whose turn it is to sayâ€” 
 - Let's say grace individually.

595
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,340
We don't share secrets. What's the point of praying together? Just do it alone.

596
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,540
Blah, blah, blah. Please. Yes.

597
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,020
- Please. 
 - Are you speaking in tongues?

598
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,850
Amen!

599
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,870
Sister-in-law, eat. Eat plenty.

600
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:35,080
Little rat, you like this. Right? Have plenty.

601
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,910
Jae Soo, you like this, right?

602
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,560
Little rat is so quick. That's what I call food.

603
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:58,120
Have more. You like this one.

604
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,800
I need to pick up books for class. Why don't we all go to the bookstore tomorrow?

605
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,780
Sister-in-law, we've never been to a place like that.

606
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:09,060
Of course. What time should we meet tomorrow? I'll get jjajangmyeon. Wait...

607
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,400
One, two, three, four,

608
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,380
five. I'll also get tangsuyuk.

609
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,200
The five of us can split tangsuyuk.

610
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,390
Let's eat first.

611
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,570
What a day.

612
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:36,150
Wow, 150 billion won worth of drugs were found in Ta Wan's car.

613
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:41,130
Imagine if this was released onto the streets... Whoa, that's crazy.

614
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,870
Say something.

615
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,230
Since they weren't, I'm so grateful.

616
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,510
I really hate you!

617
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,460
We missed the deal, but we got Ta Wan.

618
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,090
You could also say we got Ta Wan but missed her customer.

619
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,530
Jung Yoon Taek is a more trustworthy source anyway.

620
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,410
Among everyone arrested,

621
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,960
get a warrant for Lee Gang Gil first, please.

622
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,640
Okay, got it.

623
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,150
Oh, the Chief Prosecutor is buying lobster for dinner. You're going, right?

624
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,220
I have some work left and other plans.

625
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,980
Why don't you two go?

626
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,130
What?

627
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,860
Do I need to go to a work dinner if the Prosecutor isn't?

628
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,860
Huh?

629
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,450
Then you can go by yourself.

630
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:28,100
Chief Prosecutor isn't going to treat me alone to lobster.

631
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,750
I'll be lucky if I get some baby shrimp.

632
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,580
Claw, claw, claw.

633
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,720
I should go fishing for some lobster.

634
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,960
I don't know if I'll get any.

635
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,550
I need at least three.

636
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:59,960
   

637
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,740
CEO.

638
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,320
How are you feeling?

639
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,430
I'm sorry. All because of me...

640
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,480
Why are you sorry? I'm sorry I didn't get there sooner.

641
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,490
I will...

642
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,680
never forget what you did for me.

643
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,810
Just don't forget the promise you made to your sister.

644
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,120
- Oppa. 
 - Yun.

645
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,060
Oppa, are you okay?

646
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,240
I'm okay.

647
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,540
Yun, are you okay?

648
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,830
If you're not hurt, I'm okay.

649
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:03,370
I'm sorry for making you worry.

650
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,850
It's okay.

651
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,690
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

652
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,200
    
 I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

653
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,240
Eun Ha.

654
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,660
It's only been a few days, but it feels like it's been forever.

655
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,340
I know.

656
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,740
I'm sorry about canceling yesterday.

657
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:02,100
No, I had something come up, too. It's okay.

658
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,930
Prosecutor.

659
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,600
Do you find it uncomfortable when someone asks about your past?

660
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,620
Even if two people share an experience,

661
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,570
they might have different perspectives on it.

662
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,430
How I remember it may be different from how they remember it.

663
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,100
Maybe I kept digging for a memory that someone...

664
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,160
would rather not recall.

665
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,600
I didn't think of how that might be out of place.

666
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,130
Did someone...

667
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,850
say something?

668
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,780
Eun Ha.

669
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,120
I have to tell you something.

670
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:10,150
About the person you're looking for...

671
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,540
Hyun Woo.

672
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,930
Why...

673
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,120
Why are you carrying that around?

674
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:38,930
Who are you?

675
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,900
Do you know me?

676
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:45,860
Weird. I don't know who you are.

677
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:54,070
You must have been drinking. You smell like alcohol.

678
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,170
I had a few. I was in a good mood.

679
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,200
I found the person I buried this with.

680
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:16,980

681
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,010
Thanks for everything, Seo Ji Hwan.

682
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,330
Let's not see each other again.

686

687
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,930
 - Oh, so bright!  
  - We should go. 

688
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,950
 She has nothing to do with me. 

689
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,650
 A blind date? 

690
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:10,630
 How could you do something so dangerous? 

691
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,960
 I forgot how sensitive and easily surprised you are. 

692
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,830
 - You were so happy you were singing.  
  - I did. So what? 

693
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,350
 Just be honest. You don't want her to leave. 

694
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,660
 That sounds like my ringtone. 

695
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,010
 Why are you following me? I didn't do anything. 

696
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:26,080
 Eun Ha! 

697
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,620
 Eun Ha. 

698
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,780
 I like you.
