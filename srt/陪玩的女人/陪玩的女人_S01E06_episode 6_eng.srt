10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,900
Help me. Help me!

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,800
Have some.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,720
It'll help your stomach.

00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,500
- What is this? 
 - Have some honey water.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,740
Honey water?

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,750
Dong Hee! Dr. Dong Hee!

17
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,390
My insides hurt. I feel like I'm going to die.

18
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,810
You said you were going to destroy her.

19
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,960
Aigoo, you're the one who got destroyed.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,050
I would have outdrunk her! The little rat played tricks on me with those games.

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,750
 I love drinking! I love this game! 

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,200
 I love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! 

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,570
 - Hong Gi, do you love it? 
 - I love it. Il Yeong, do you love it? 

24
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,570
 - I love it. Jae Soo, do you love it? 
 - I love it. 

25
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,400
 Hyungnim, do you love it? 

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,750
 Bleh. 

27
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,680
 - Il Yeong, do you love it? 
 - Bleh. 

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,290
 - Hong Gi, do you love it? 
 - Bleh. 

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,480
 Man Ho, do you love it? Dong Hee, do you love it? 

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,200
 I hate you! 

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,110
 I hate her! I hate you so much! 

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,840
 If you say you love it, you don't have to drink. 

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,610
   
 I am ground, introduce yourself. 

34
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,720
 - Jae Soo one! 
 - Jae Soo, Jae Soo, Jae Soo! 

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,570
 0-0-7 shoot! 

36
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,550
 This is wrong! 

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,050
 You're going to fill it up again? Again? 

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,570
I'm not the kind of guy who loses at games.

39
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,010
That little rat targeted me.

40
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,640
When you play games, it's like you don't even speak Korean.

41
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,410
Why aren't Hyungnim and her downstairs yet?

42
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,400
Wait. I've never made such a huge mistake in my 10 years of drinking.

43
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,000
If I was sleepy, I should've just gone to bed.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,190
If I was going to bang my head, I should have just hit the table.

45
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,130
He was the only one sober, right?

46
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,130
He didn't have a drop of alcohol.

47
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,160
I drank way too much last night. I don't remember anything.

48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,820
Y-You don't remember a thing?

49
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,490
No. I remember that I drank...

50
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,290
but after that, it's like it got edited out.

51
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,590
I don't remember a thing. I haven't drunk like that in forever.

52
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,950
Well, it happens.

53
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,170
Right? I'll take a break from alcohol for a while.

54
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,160
Sure. I think that's a good idea.

55
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,800
You might find yourself in an unpleasant situation. 
    

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,430
   

57
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,710
It must have been very unpleasant for you.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,430
   

59
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,930
You should be careful.

60
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm sorry to hear it was so unpleasant for you. 
    

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,850
From now on, I'll be careful not to make any mistake. 
    

62
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,560
I'll be very, very careful. 
    

63
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,930
I left something in my room.

64
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,760
How can she not remember a thing?

65
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,730
Mistake?

66
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,420
- No, man. 
 - Hyungnim.

67
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,710
Good morning, Hyungnim.

68
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,860
Breakfast is ready, Hyungnim.

69
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,200
You can call me "Hyung" from now on without the "nim." 
  (T/N: sounds more like "Older brother" than "Boss") 

70
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,180
- Pardon? 
 - He wants us to call him "Hyung"?

71
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,410
What?

72
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,200
What are you talking about, Hyungnim?

73
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,590
- And let's not use rough language. 
 - What?

74
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,640
Wear long sleeves if possible.

75
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,750
- And Hong Gi. 
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

76
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,670
I mean...

77
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,560
well...

78
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,120
- Hyung. 
 - Damn you.

79
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,520
Turn in your letter of apology by midnight.

80
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,030
And at the new product presentation,

81
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,970
show us what you got as the Marketing Team Leader.

82
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,350
Gosh, Hyung! I'm Yang Hong Gi!

83
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,590
I won't let you down, Hyung.

84
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,740
Where's Il Yeong?

85
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,770
Please like and subscribe!

86
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,220
   

87
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,100
It's you, right?

88
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,150
It's you. It's you.

89
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,210
Thank you for still being here.

90
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,820
One, two...

91
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,560
Three paces,

92
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,630
four paces, five paces,

93
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,740
- six paces... 
 - Six. Seven.

94
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,450
I haven't seen you before! Goodness...

95
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,680
A gold collar? So cute.

96
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,490
You know how to act cute, unlike the people who live here.

97
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,550
   

98
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,810
Yes, Prosecutor.

99
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,090
- Did you get home okay last night? 
  - Yes. 

100
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,250
- How about you, Prosecutor? 
 - Yes.

101
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,350
I got home okay, too, thanks to you.

102
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,530
Prosecutor, by any chance...

103
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,680
have you ever buried a time capsule?

104
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,010
A time capsule?

105
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,710
- Yes, I have. 
 - What did you put in it?

106
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,760
Probably something important to me?

107
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,770
- Where? 
  - Probably in the ground? 

108
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,820
Where?

109
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,650
Right. I got into interrogation mode again.

110
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,780
What are you doing this Saturday?

111
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,890
Saturday? I don't have much going on.

112
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,850
Want to meet up?

113
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,230
Dig up dirt another time.

114
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,620
Let's go see some land this weekend.

115
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,790
 How come you're doing all this for just 20 million won? 

116
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,450
 How did you know it was 20 million? 

117
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,120
 - It was in the contract back then. 
 - The loan contract... 

118
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,230
 said 80 million. 

119
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,790
 What you paid eight years ago was the principal, 20 million. 

120
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,610
 So you did remember me? 

121
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,580
 There's no use in digging up each other's past. 

122
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,400
 Ms. Kang Ye Na. 

123
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,570
 The most famous kids' creator in South Korea. 

124
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,510
 That's the Kang Ye Na I know. 

125
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,510
   

126
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,250
 So pretty! 

127
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,250
Go on, take the photos.

128
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,130
See if I let any see the light of day.

129
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,350
You have more connections than I thought you did.

130
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,610
Why are you going to work at 2 in the morning?

131
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,820
You were awake? You must have had trouble falling asleep.

132
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,490
Try getting older. You miss the sleep window, and that's it.

133
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,260
Did you age quickly these past few days, Hyung?

134
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,980
Ms. Kang Ye Na, please try it and tell us how it is.

135
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,810
Let's set the schedule. Go to Sokcho tomorrow...

136
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,520
Do CEO Jung's kids' cafÃ©...

137
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,810
Ye Na.

138
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,120
They asked you to try it.

139
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,890
What are you doing?

140
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,200
I told you I won't eat on camera.

141
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,460
But look at the situation we're in. Then...

142
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,080
just pretend to eat it. You got this.

143
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,900
   

144
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,200
Ye Na, how's the taste?

145
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,800
- It's delicious. 
 - How's the texture?

146
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,670
It's so chewy.

147
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,290
It's delicious.

148
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,200
Do you think kids will like it?

149
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
Is it really not salty?

150
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,200
No, it's not salty at all. We lowered the sodium content.

151
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Kids will be dying to eat it.

152
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,800
In a good way. Because it's delicious.

153
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,260
Excuse me.

154
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,250
Are you okay?

155
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
It's an allergic reaction. Let's get you to the hospital.

156
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,740
We'll wrap up the product launch here due to time.

157
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,800
Please try the samples and give us your honest feedback.

158
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,700
Thank you.

159
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,070
Let's go.

160
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,050
   

161
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,200
Ta Wan is very cautious.

162
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,200
She won't make deals with anyone who's not trustworthy.

163
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
No samples. Just wholesale.

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And we heard whispers of Go Yang Hui,

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,990
but it's all talk, no action.

166
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,480
Maybe Jung Yoon Taek is hiding, or has shaved his head and become a monk.

167
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,760
We don't even see a hair on his head.

168
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,220
- One person is up and moving, though. 
 - Who?

169
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,650
- Seo Ji Hwan. 
 - Seo Ji Hwan?

170
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,730
I've never understood this.

171
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,600
I get it about Go Yang Hui. But Seo Ji Hwan?

172
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,300
I thought he was living a normal life.

173
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,700
It's like Officer Yang read my mind.

174
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,400
Thirsty Deer isn't your average company.

175
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,720
All kinds of ex-cons gathered together.

176
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,170
It looks legit from the outside, but you could say...

177
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,100
Seo Ji Hwan has all these dangerous individuals by his side.

178
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,900
Especially, this Jung Yoon Taek is one of them.

179
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,300
You mean that Seo Ji Hwan wouldn't just have had...

180
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,000
Jung Yoon Taek around for no reason, right? I see your point.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,860
Do you think Seo Ji Hwan will make a move?

182
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,330
I don't think so.

183
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,780
He will.

184
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,910
Without a doubt.

185
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,710
   

186
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,820
Have you eaten, Chairman?

187
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,310
On days like this...

188
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,020
I crave a bowl of cold blowfish soup.

189
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,480
We just finished expanding the restaurant menu.

190
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,200
It's going to bring our restaurant a lot of luck.

191
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,100
You'll have to wait and see whether it's luck or poison.

192
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,720
This menu won't fail. You can trust me.

193
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,210
In my days...

194
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,390
we didn't touch blowfish* unless it was a big one. 
  (T/N: sounds like luck, fortune) 

195
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,590
When we couldn't catch big ones, we had to use the little ones.

196
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Those guys might be small, but they're quite poisonous.

197
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,900
There's a reason why fishermen speak of little blowfish as if they're the devil.

198
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,430
Fish or man, one must know one's own size.

199
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,800
Our Chairman still seems to think of me as a figurehead.

200
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,570
I've run the restaurant for years.

201
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,810
Call Ta Wan.

202
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,430
Tell her to stop dipping her toes and come back.

203
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,450
Yes, sir.

204
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,430
Where are they? It's past 8 o'clock.

205
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,430
A boycott, huh?

206
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,870
 If you're not here within five minutes, I'll tell the CEO. 

207
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,500
Tell who? Traitor.

208
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,600
No sense of loyalty whatsoever. What's all this?

209
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,190
Today's the first class! Are you all coming from work?

210
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,460
We had a new product launch event.

211
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,290
- I have no strength to respond. 
 - Thank you.

212
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,090
What is all this?

213
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,300
Congratulations.

214
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,400
How did the event go?

215
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,390
If I may say so myself, it was very successful.

216
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,770
Something unplanned even became the highlight of the event.

217
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,670
- The highlight? 
 - Ms. Kang Ye Na was like this...

218
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,550
and was about to collapse when Hyungnim...

219
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,900
took her in his arms and said, "Let me hold you."

220
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,100
Wasn't he sexier than Hyun Bin?

221
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,700
- He held her? 
 - Just like this.

222
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,750
Is Hyungnim going to get married?

223
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,640
Judging from today, it's possible.

224
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,470
- Kang Ye Na offered to model first. 
 - For real?

225
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,140
If this goddess were our sister-in-law, Hyungnim would look good.

226
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,510
Both ambitious.

227
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,810
If her guys and our guys combined forcesâ€”

228
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,030
Stop talking.

229
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:41,500
Okay, today is the first class, so we'll do a simple test.

230
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,980
It's not an evaluation. It's just to see where you are at, so don't stress.

231
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,570
Who are you to test us? I'm uncomfortable with this.

232
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,930
The questions contain the answers, so listen up.

233
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,700
- Okay. 
 - Here we go.

234
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,800
Something soft on the outside and strong on the inside

235
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,100
is called "A steel hand in a velvet glove."

236
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
Then what about the opposite?

237
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,690
What do you call something strong on the outside and soft on the inside?

238
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,310
Stop insulting us. Do you think we don't know?

239
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,620
If you don't know this, you're not human.

240
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,780
Definitely not human if you don't know.

241
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,450
This is it, right?

242
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,910
   

243
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,970
This is it. 
    

244
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,780
Do you think this is about chicken? Crispy tenders?

245
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,420
Where did pecking duck come from? You spelled it wrong, too!

246
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,400
All right, all right. Then...

247
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,600
we'll do a math question next. It's a simple factorial.

248
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,100
What's a factorial?

249
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,790
Like a meat factory?

250
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,470
You don't know what a factorial is?

251
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,330
- How about an equation? 
 - The guy who broke my arm had a similar name.

252
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,910
To this day, I can't bend my arm outward.

253
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,640
You must know division.

254
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,630
Don't mock us. We all did that in elementary school.

255
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,790
You never graduated from elementary.

256
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,580
Do you have nine lives?

257
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,250
No, no, no.

258
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,910
- What are you guys doing? 
 - Stop right there.

259
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,500
Stop. Stop. Go sit.

260
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,560
Well, let me start with an easy question.

261
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,980
Ji Yun has four cherry tomatoes.

262
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,300
She wants to share half of them with her friends.

263
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,350
How many tomatoes does Ji Yun have left?

264
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,800
What a great gal.

265
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,090
Sharing the few she has... It shows loyalty.

266
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,540
Dumbass, who wants half-sliced tomatoes?

267
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,310
She should just give up all of them!

268
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,240
Man Ho, let's see.

269
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,290
"Jeju-do's old name used to be Hanyeo Village."

270
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,260
A lot of Hanyeos live there.

271
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,510
Thank you for your hard work, Man Ho.

272
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,400
Hyungnim?

273
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,150
What? That's my writing. Even with a heart.

274
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,830
"Something strong on the outside but soft on the inside."

275
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,200
Your answer is Big Boss?

276
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,180
You said "crispy tenders" was wrong.

277
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,190
- What the heck is "crispy tenders"? 
 - Isn't it right?

278
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,380
I can't talk to him.

279
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,290
It's the same difference. It describes the Big Boss!

280
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,330
Hey, little rat. You tell us.

281
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,840
Describe the Big Boss in two words.

282
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,670
"Shoulder thug."

283
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,500
I get where you're at, so we'll end here today.

284
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,290
Here's your homework.

285
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,930
What homework? We're busy!

286
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,480
It's not hard.

287
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,650
Write a simple self-introduction.

288
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,190
For example, how I introduced myself the other day, write out your introduction.

289
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,770
Wow, this is so annoying.

290
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,680
Great job on your first class!

291
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,890
"Shoulder thug"?

292
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,590
   

293
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,890
   

294
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm a thug twice over.

295
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,170
   

296
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,430
   

297
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,950
I heard you had a busy day.

298
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,850
The launch. Chauffering. You must be tired.

299
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,990
Well, it's not tiring...

300
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,420
for a thug...

301
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,600
The class went well. In case you were wondering.

302
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,650
What is there to wonder about? I'm just a thug.

303
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,400
Sorry for bothering you when you weren't wondering.

304
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,790
I'm not bothered. I'm a thug.

305
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,120
Why do you keep saying "thug"?

306
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,550
They're not fighting, are they?

307
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,190
What are you guys doing?

308
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,200
I think the teacher and Hyungnim have a beef.

309
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,730
Am I wrong? I'm just calling a thug a thug.

310
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,800
Exactly. Why are you suddenly going on and onâ€”

311
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:13,610
It's not because I called you a "shoulder thug," right?

312
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,850
Is it because of that?

313
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,970
Hey.

314
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,210
They were just fighting! Why is she laughing and flipping out like that?

315
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,780
What did you eat, man?

316
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,690
For real?

317
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,340
I wondered who the guys took after, but they're just like you.

318
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,690
How are you so similar? You really are a family.

319
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,040
Excuse me.

320
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,830
You were just standing here laughing at me.

321
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,400
Are you going to tell me why?

322
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,490
Look it up yourself what it means.

323
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,770
What is she talking about?

324
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,980
   

325
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,900
   

326
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,570
T-That's what that means?

327
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,420
Is it too late to eat?

328
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:52,540
This is what I usually eat. Hope you like it.

329
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,530
This is what you usually eat?

330
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,860
I don't have time to go out to eat when I'm working.

331
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,850
But I don't skimp on meals. Go ahead.

332
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,020
Thank you.

333
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,990
So what do you do at Thirsty Deer?

334
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,050
Legal counsel, business strategy.

335
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,430
You could say I'm an executive.

336
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,840
Are you a lawyer?

337
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,200
I have a license.

338
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,000
What kind of sport did you play, Mi Ho?

339
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,300
- Soccer? 
 - I get so restless when I'm working.

340
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,540
Then how did you become a hairdresser?

341
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,240
I took a test and got a license.

342
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,270
How simple.

343
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,990
A civil servant takes the civil service exam.

344
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,560
A lawyer takes a bar exam.

345
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,590
An athlete goes to tryouts to get in.

346
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,670
It sounds simple, but...

347
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,930
only the person knows what happened...

348
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,300
between the test and becoming who they are.

349
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,960
No matter how smart or educated someone is,

350
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,830
it's not easy to become a lawyer.

351
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,680
You're right. It wasn't easy.

352
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,780
I owe a lot to the CEO.

353
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,730
I wanted to become useful to him.

354
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,830
It's a debt I could never pay back,

355
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,740
but I wanted to try, at least.

356
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,600
You can't live in someone's debt, can you?

357
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,820
If you pay back a favor right away,

358
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,400
it could be a disappointing thing.

359
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,050
Because once you pay it back, it's over.

360
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,720
I don't think your CEO helped you, expecting you to repay him.

361
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,480
Maybe he did because he wanted...

362
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,910
to have you in his life.

363
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,310
Thank you for dinner.

364
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,080
It was just what I had in the fridge.

365
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,570
Let me buy you coffee, at least.

366
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,850
Sure.

367
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,550
It's late, though, so we might have to walk a bit.

368
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,840
Over there.

369
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,360
If you go down this way, there's a field inside the park.

370
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,710
When I feel like kicking around a ball, I go there.

371
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,500
Sometimes I run around with kids.

372
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,010
It's so fun.

373
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,520
Watching kids kick a ball around...

374
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,560
Do you like kids?

375
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,070
- I want it! 
 - No.

376
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,730
- I want it! 
 - It's dangerous. No.

377
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,780
I want it!

378
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,360
They're loud, they cry,

379
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,010
they're stubborn...

380
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,210
But I'm not raising them, so they're fine.

381
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,870
You're so honest, Mi Ho.

382
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm so sorry. Let me get you a towel.

383
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,880
I'm sorry!

384
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,590
Mi Ho, are you okay?

385
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,500
   

386
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,260
Hyungnim!

387
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,570
You're working out so early in the morning!

388
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,140
100 kg, Hyungnim?

389
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,660
You haven't worked out since your shoulder injury.

390
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,550
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

391
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,280
It's just for my health.

392
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,890
Since when have you cared about your health, Hyungnim?

393
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,960
And purely focused on your shoulders, Hyungnim?

394
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,050
   

395
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,120
   

396
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,010
   

397
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,740
   

398
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,030
 Something is definitely going on between those two. 

399
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,620
- For real? 
 - Think about it.

400
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,130
Why would Hyungnim get so hurt over being called a "thug"?

401
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,110
He doesn't even let the milk delivery lady in...

402
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,540
and he moves a girl in? I knew it was weird.

403
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,920
So does that mean...

404
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,370
we should call her "sister-in-law"?

405
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,400
Sister-in-law?

406
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,980
I'm against this marriage, Hyungnim!

407
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,850
Over my dead, buried body with dirt in my eyes!

408
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,650
My eye! I think there's dirt in my eye!

409
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,720
Hyungnim! Is there dirt...

410
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,730
Hyungnim! Is there dirt in my eye?

411
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,620
 Hyungnim! 

412
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,640
 My eye! 

413
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,780
My eye is still burning, Hyungnim.

414
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,440
Hey, little rat!

415
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,830
What are you looking at? So sneaky!

416
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,990
I wasn't looking! Who said I was looking?

417
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,790
You're looking again!

418
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,950
I wasn't looking.

419
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,460
W-Were you working out?

420
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,730
Yes. This is our home gym. Well...

421
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,190
- Oh, you were working out. 
 - It's not much.

422
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,970
- Let's go upstairs. 
 - Okay.

423
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,640
No! Absolutely not!

424
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,800
Right, Hyungnim?

425
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Man Ho, this is so good!

426
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,790
So good. Eat, everyone! Why aren't you eating?

427
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,570
Sorry, sorry. Are you okay?

428
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,380
Did I scare you? Was it my shoulders?

429
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,660
Where's Il Yeong?

430
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,470
He's not around much at this hour. Busy with business.

431
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,200
Business? What business?

432
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,970
Romantic business.

433
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,550
Il Yeong has a girlfriend?

434
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,350
He does. Lots of them.

435
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,560
Lots of them? Is he a player?

436
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,880
What's wrong with players playing the field together?

437
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,610
Better than taking advantage of a poor 36-year-old who's never been with a woman.

438
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,740
Am I wrong?

439
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,410
Who's the poor 36-year-old who's never been with a woman?

440
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,040
How's Ms. Kang Ye Na doing?

441
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,780
Oh, Kangâ€”

442
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,640
It's not serious. She took meds and feels better.

443
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,030
If she has a meat allergy,

444
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,650
should she be promoting sausages?

445
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,190
She can't model with a meat allergy, no.

446
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,210
If we break her contract over this, people will talk.

447
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,380
We can't be putting out false advertising, though.

448
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,820
She has to be able to eat it and tell the truth.

449
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,790
Hong Gi, talk to her and get it done.

450
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,320
Aigoo, what a disaster.

451
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,590
Whose turn is it to say grace?

452
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,600
Going somewhere?

453
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,670
Yes. I have plans.

454
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,370
- I'm meeting a friend. 
 - Oh, a friend.

455
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,080
Okay, take care, then.

456
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,610
Eun Ha.

457
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,800
Hi.

458
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,710
I was going to open the door for you.

459
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,020
Oh, really? You were starting the car, so I just got in, thinking we were leaving.

460
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,120
- I see. Should we go? 
 - Yes.

461
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,450
Seat belt on, please.

462
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,140
Okay.

463
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,770
Is it not working?

464
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,330
My goodness. My head...

465
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,240
- What's wrong? 
 - What? Nothing.

466
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,430
My goodness...

467
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,190
Wow! Whoa! I'm so excited.

468
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,610
I'm sorry.

469
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,920
- I'm sorry. 
 - Yeah. It works now.

470
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,570
Did I scare you?

471
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,010
Is someone talking about me? Why are my ears burning?

472
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,750
- Are you still counting rice? 
 - Yeah.

473
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,340
It's the weekend. Don't you have any men to see?

474
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,290
Aigoo. Make sure you clean up.

475
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,680
Something on your mind?

476
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,000
I always have something on my mind.

477
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:45,170
How do we get our sales up? How to make sure our employees behave?

478
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,410
Will I see Hyung on a date this weekend?

479
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,040
Don't talk nonsense.

480
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,760
You know...

481
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,470
I think Go Yang Hui hid Taek really well somewhere.

482
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,230
There's no movement, so no way to find him.

483
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,470
Our only option is to focus more on Thailand.

484
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,250
When they pick a date, we'll see movement.

485
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,830
I put someone on Ta Wan. Let's wait a bit longer.

486
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,020
Let's do that.

487
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,740
She won't be back for three or four hours.

488
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,470
- What do you mean? 
 - You don't have to come down every 30 minutes to check.

489
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,300
Don't assume. I just came to get water.

490
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,600
I was just walking back and forth.

491
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,900
- I'm going upstairs. 
 - Sure.

492
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,620
Six o'clock? Isn't that too late to come home?

493
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:56,040
It's rough out there.

494
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,500
Maybe we should have a curfew?

495
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,500
Eun Ha, do you like tofu?

496
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,950
There's a famous handmade tofu place in Yangpyeong.

497
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,990
The grandma who owns it makes the tofu every morning in a cauldron.

498
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,130
But the best part is the soft tofu in warm broth...

499
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,820
they give you as soon as you sit down.

500
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,760
The sesame seed powder makes it twice as savory.

501
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,040
It's fantastic.

502
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,460
   

503
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,310
   

504
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:43,500
"Handmade tofu made by grandma every morning in a cauldron" is closed.

505
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,710
It said they're open on weekends, but they're out of ingredients.

506
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,670
- I'm sorry. 
 - Oh, no. It's okay.

507
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,070
Don't worry. There's another famous place around here.

508
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,600
They sell bossam*. Every morning, the grandpa... 
  (T/N: boiled pork wrap) 

509
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,200
boils 27 medicinal herbs in a cauldron... just follow me.

510
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,200
   

511
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,140
   

512
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,050
Do you like Korean dinner sets?

513
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,710
   

514
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,710
Excuse me.

515
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,700
Prosecutor, should we just go next door since we're hungry?

516
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,310
Oh, yes.

517
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,710
The smell of MSG is making my mouth water.

518
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,210
- Go ahead, Prosecutor. 
 - Okay.

519
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,530
- Enjoy your meal! 
 - Enjoy your meal.

520
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,400
Even some added protein.

521
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,190
Oh, no, I'm okay.

522
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,900
I like the soup. This one looks soupier. Is that okay?

523
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,150
- Thanks. 
 - Enjoy.

524
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,100
It's so good.

525
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,340
It's the best ramen I've ever had.

526
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,350
Really?

527
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,240
   

528
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,740
   

529
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,110
Aigoo, have some sweet potatoes.

530
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,100
They're good.

531
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
- You didn't have to. 
 - Thank you.

532
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,110
Thank you.

533
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,920
She gave us some nice sweet potatoes.

534
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,000
We should eat them while they're hot. Here.

535
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,100
Take the big one, Eun Ha.

536
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,860
 Hot... 

537
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,020
 Take the big one. 

538
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,980
 Thanks. 

539
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,220
 It's hot. Make sure you blow on it. 

540
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,760
 - It's tasty. 
 - It's tasty. 

541
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,110
Prosecutor, the time capsule...

542
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,610
Excuse me...

543
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,100
Somebody keeps calling me.

544
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,700
- It's okay. Go ahead. 
 - I'm sorry.

545
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,080
Yes, Chief. I'm...

546
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,300
Yun is missing?

547
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,700
Chief Oh!

548
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,690
You made it.

549
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,820
What happened?

550
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,000
Is she the unni from last time...

551
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,800
I'll explain later. What's going on?

552
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,230
I've been sending someone here to check it out.

553
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,810
Yun and her grandma haven't been seen for a few days.

554
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,290
All their stuff is still here, and they're gone.

555
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,300
Eun Ha!

556
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,160
It's locked.

557
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,900
- Eun Ha. 
 - Where did Yun go?

558
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,490
Yes, Officer Song. Her name is Jung Yun. Her grandmother is Kim Soon Hui.

559
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,140
Please find out where they are. Thank you.

560
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,770
Eun Ha, don't worry too much.

561
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,880
It's me.

562
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,000
Yun's not home. Do you know where she is?

563
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,500
Eun Ha, how did you...

564
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,800
You already knew?

565
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,830
Are you with someone right now?

566
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,690
I'm with the prosecutor.

567
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,500
I can't tell you over the phone. Come to the house.

568
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,290
I'll get out here, Prosecutor.

569
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,240
Eun Ha.

570
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,530
Who were you just talking to?

571
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,980
I'll tell you later.

572
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,170
Was it Seo Ji Hwan?

573
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,060
I'm sorry. I'll find out where Yun is and call you.

574
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,080
Hold on.

575
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,800
Let me take you home.

576
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,800
It's okay. I can take a cab.

577
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,600
Hello, Ji Hwan speaking.

578
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,600
Where is Yun?

579
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,000
Are you really here to figure out where Yun is?

580
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,590
Tell me where she is.

581
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,680
She's safe, but I can't tell you where she is.

582
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,850
- Is she really safe? 
 - She is.

583
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,300
- I guess you can't talk about Jung Yoon Taek, either. 
 - No.

584
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,400
- I cannot. 
 - How about Go Eun Ha?

585
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,100
I heard she owes you one, but you're making her pay back slowly.

586
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,790
She paid back the favor a long time ago.

587
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,660
So why are you still acting like she owes you?

588
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,630
You seem like you'd move on once a business is done.

589
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,240
It's none of your concern, Prosecutor.

590
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,840
I am concerned about it.

591
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,870
Are you concerned about Go Eun Ha or me?

592
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,000
You're the one I'm concerned about.

593
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,840
My concern for Go Eun Ha is none of your business.

594
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,000
Then the reason for your concern for me...

595
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,160
Is it because my name is on the DNA database of ex-prisoners...

596
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,840
that the Prosecutors' Office maintains?

597
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,270
No.

598
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,750
It's because I saw you at the hotel 10 years ago.

599
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,970
I...

600
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,090
was a witness to that incident.

601
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,350
CEO.

602
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,820
So where's Yun? What happened to her?

603
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,430
Do you also think that I did something to her?

604
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,090
What?

605
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:43,980
Nothing.

606
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,150
Yun is safe.

607
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,720
Thank goodness. I was so worried.

608
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,320
Since when is the prosecutor your friend?

609
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,380
Well, that's...

610
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,310
So you couldn't tell him where you live...

611
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,240
because he's a prosecutor, or...

612
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,680
because he's your friend and you felt awkward?

613
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,580
â™«  Unusually warm wind  â™«

614
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,920
I mean, that's not it...

615
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,150
â™«  Soothe my weary day  â™«

616
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,350
â™«  Reflect on my uneasy heart  â™«

617
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,130
 Are you concerned about Go Eun Ha or me? 

618
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,960
 Aren't you... 

619
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,170
 afraid of Seo Ji Hwan? 

620
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,640
 I know I should be. 

621
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,160
 I thought I would be. 

622
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,490
 But I'm not. 

623
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,550
â™«  Lights of the past  â™«

624
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:12,050
â™«  Warmly embrace me again  â™«

625
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,090
â™«  I want to see the light  â™«

626
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,330
 You're the one I'm concerned about. 

627
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,740
 My concern for Go Eun Ha is none of your business. 

628
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,490
 Since when is the prosecutor your friend? 

629
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:29,850
â™«  Push away the time that feels like a lie  â™«

630
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:37,090
â™«  Oh, shine on me at the end of the road  â™«

631
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:41,450
â™«  May the thick darkness be lifted  â™«

632
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:48,990
â™«  and the bright light come to me  â™«

633
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,120
What's going on? What is this?

634
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,320
Is there a fire?

635
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,560
How many came in? That many?

636
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,970
Got it. Get the tools and wait.

637
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,650
What? Did something happen again?

638
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,600
- Where's Hyungnim? 
 - He went out.

639
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,310
Out of all days...

640
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,580
We'll have to stop this ourselves. Buckle up and get in the car.

641
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,140
Dong Hee, get the tools.

642
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,740
T-The tools? Why?

643
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,930
Good thing we sharpened them yesterday.

644
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,290
Two should be enough, right?

645
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,390
Get changed and gather.

646
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,040
Where are you going? Where?

647
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,310
What? Someone tell me!

648
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,180
Let's see the end of this today.

649
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,160
- Hey, Hong Gi. 
 - Yeah.

650
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,260
- This time... what the...? 
 - What?

651
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,180
- What are you doing here? 
 - You said everyone get in the car!

652
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,540
Anyway, where are we going? To fight, right?

653
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,490
Can we just go back?

654
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,430
- Hey, drop her off. 
 - We have class this morning.

655
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,760
I'll mark everyone absent!

656
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,300
- What is she saying? 
 - Put that knife down.

657
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,740
- I'm going to lose my mind. 
 - What should we do?

658
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,880
- What else? Drop her off! 
 - Where?

659
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,130
- Out of the car! 
 - Pull over, then!

660
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,960
- Pull over, man! 
 - There's nowhere to pull over.

661
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,620
You guys are supposed to be good! I'm telling the CEO.

662
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,020
You don't know anything!

663
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,610
Wait. Where are we? Dong Hee!

664
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,040
Dong Hee, tell me!

665
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,670
What is going on with everybody? Huh?

666
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,100
Me, too. Me, too...

667
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,050
Knives.

668
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,870
Hurry up. If you snooze, we'll have to work overnight.

669
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:33,140
- Yes, sir. 
 - Hey, we might have to work overnight.

670
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,000
Hurry up!

671
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,140
- Hello, sir. 
 - Let's go.

672
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,000
This way.

673
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,680
Where are we going?

674
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,870
Wait.

675
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:53,000
Did they come to get the meat?

676
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,690
- Are you new? 
 - What?

677
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,510
- New? 
 - Why are you standing here? We're busy.

678
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:02,100
Are you praying, or what? Follow me!

679
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:20,660
Here.

680
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,350
Over here. Move the meat.

681
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,930
You've put stickers on before, right?

682
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,030
Stickers?

683
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,490
Ever since I was little, yes.

684
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,120
Then you'll be great.

685
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,710
Stand here.

686
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,170
Put labels on them in order.

687
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,340
- Labels? 
 - Yes.

688
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,490
Are you just going to watch?

689
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:42,880
Get started.

690
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,130
You look like you're not even 30.

691
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,100
How did you manage to go to school*? 
  (T/N: slang for prison) 

692
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,270
School? I just took the collegiate exam.

693
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:54,590
Collegiate exam? What did you do?

694
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,890
Did you steal tests?

695
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:59,400
Aigoo, stop asking her.

696
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,230
Everyone has their own story.

697
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:05,150
Not that school. That kind of school.

698
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:07,390
Make sure you stay on the right path now.

699
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,890
The CEO won't ask about your past, but he doesn't forgive twice.

700
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,120
Do you mean Mr. Seo Ji Hwan?

701
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,110
- How dare you say his name carelessly? 
 - What?

702
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,510
He's not your friend!

703
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,290
That's his name, Seo Ji Hwan. It's not like he's Hong Gil Dong. 
  (T/N: Korean version of Robin Hood) 

704
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,320
The guys are here helping?

705
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,940
There was a last-minute census.

706
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,770
Farms with more sows than they reported are in emergency mode.

707
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:30,090
Places that don't meet hygiene standards are losing their licenses.

708
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,570
That's not our problem.

709
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,350
Vendors are low on supply and are calling SOS.

710
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:37,410
Including the department store that backed out last time.

711
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,360
I see...

712
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:05,110
Dong Hee! Your knife skills are rusty.

713
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:08,010
Move, move.

714
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,140
What are you doing?

715
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,280
Look.

716
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,540
Cut.

717
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,400
Take the fat out.

718
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,100
Like this.

719
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,420
Cut the meat along the natural grain. What are you doing?

720
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,950
Hurry up and take care of the meat before it defrosts.

721
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,680
Got it?

722
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,160
Where is that little rat?

723
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:39,600
Mr. Seo Ji Hwanâ€” I mean,

724
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,960
the CEO... what is he like?

725
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,760
Do you have a crush on him, too?

726
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,870
No way! Why would I have a crush on him?

727
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:53,870
Why not? I'd love to be with a guy like the CEO.

728
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:57,740
He's manly and handsome and doesn't say much, but...

729
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,470
he's a softie inside, like custard.

730
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:01,840
"Strong on the outside, soft on the inside."

731
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,340
Not just soft. He's sexy, too.

732
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:10,310
- Sexy? 
 - Go on, put all your carts before the horse.

733
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,880
He has no interest in women.

734
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,890
He really has no interest?

735
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,590
"Kids, seniors, and beauties are nuisances."

736
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,770
That's his motto.

737
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:27,090
   

738
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,330
   

739
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,880
   

740
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,960
I killed my husband.

741
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,140
I can take him beating me up,

742
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,790
but I couldn't sit and watch him hit our five-year-old.

743
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:54,080
After five years in prison, I thought, "My kid and I can be happy now."

744
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,780
But no one wanted to hire a murderer.

745
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,920
I almost lost my kid while I was getting rejected for jobs.

746
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,300
I don't know what kind of person the CEO is.

747
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,300
But he gave me a proper job.

748
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,850
That's good enough for me.

749
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,610
It might seem like all we do is work around here.

750
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:20,000
But here, we split the time in half for work and study.

751
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,010
I'm studying to become a social worker.

752
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,710
My goal is to finish junior college and get a license.

753
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:30,650
- I'm sure you will succeed. 
 - When I pass my exam,

754
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,590
I'm buying a round for everyone. Don't forget.

755
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,620
- But no meat, please. 
 - No way.

756
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,090
I'll eat something else.

757
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,940
- You're getting paid double today. Work for it! 
 - Coming!

758
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,930
- Coming... 
 - Start working!

759
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,970
Yes!

760
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,830
Good luck!

761
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,190
Newbie. Get more labels from the storage unit.

762
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,970
Got it!

763
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,030
Man Ho!

764
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,870
Sistâ€” I mean, Teacher!

765
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,010
Where are you guys? I'm in the next building.

766
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,150
We're in there, too.

767
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,880
The meat you cut travels on the conveyor belt to our room!

768
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,400
I'm doing the packaging!

769
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,860
Where's the storage unit? She told me to get more labels.

770
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,420
Labels?

771
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,740
Over there...

772
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,860
- In here. 
 - Thanks.

773
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,830
See you later!

774
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,230
The labels...

775
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,470
This is a freezer. Why do they keep labels in here?

776
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,100
What? Why isn't it opening?

777
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,400
Is it locked?

778
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,250
Man Ho! Are you there?

779
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,130
The door's locked!

780
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,920
Hello? Is anyone in here?

781
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,800
Who's there?

782
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,840
What are you doing? We're so far behind!

783
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,700
I think...

784
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:25,300
I just made a huge mistake.

785
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,200
- A mistake? 
 - What are you talking about?

786
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,150
CEO?

787
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,850
What are you doing in here?

788
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:40,340
Eun Ha, what are you...

789
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,030
What are you wearing? Why are you holding that in here?

790
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,820
I heard they needed more hands. I'm here to help.

791
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,600
You don't need to help with this kind of work, Eun Ha.

792
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,820
Right? I know, but...

793
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,350
the door is locked.

794
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,800
You have to push hard.

795
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,700
It's not working, is it?

796
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
This thing...

797
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,140
I think it's broken.

798
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,950
Stop. You'll get hurt.

799
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,500
Hello?

800
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:04,380
I think your phone's battery ran out.

801
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,780
That's not possible.

802
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,920
- Do you have your phone? 
 - I left it back there.

803
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:22,460
I'm sure someone will come by. My legs hurt. Let's sit.

804
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:25,030
Wait...

805
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,540
Sit, CEO.

806
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,470
No, I'm okay.

807
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:08,670
Your employees really love you.

808
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,220
They don't really know me.

809
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:19,010
That's not true. They know you very well.

810
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,250
I heard from them...

811
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,300
what this company means to them,

812
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,470
and what you're doing for them.

813
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,580
I get it a little now.

814
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:40,860
You're a good person, Seo Ji Hwan.

815
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,140
That's what I felt.

816
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,700
- You locked up Hyungnim and the rat in the freezer together? 
 - Yes.

817
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,070
What's the temperature in there?

818
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,170
- Minus 18Â°C? 
 - 18...

819
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,750
You crazy bastard!

820
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,890
Do you have two lives?

821
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:04,780
Should we call 911?

822
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:07,400
911? We need to open the damn door! The key!

823
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,300
I just wanted them to have some quality time...

824
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,900
Where's the key?

825
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,640
 Man Ho! Are you out there? 

826
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,540
 The door's locked! 

827
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,230
 Man Ho! 

828
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:27,150
- You don't have them? 
 - I can't find them.

829
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:30,020
Hyungnim! Seriously!

830
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,630
I guess we're in a freezer. It's freezing...

831
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,810
Eun Ha.

832
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,420
- Stay right there. 
 - Thank you.

833
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,900
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

834
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,190
Hello?

835
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,950
There's someone in here!

836
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:08,620
The keys, the keys!

837
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,330
This is a disaster!

838
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,140
What's going on?

839
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,800
   

840
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:27,870
Do you think they forgot about us?

841
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,680
Why isn't anyone coming?

842
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,550
I'm sorry.

843
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:37,460
It's okay.

844
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,490
It's not like we're going to die, right?

845
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,700
Eun Ha.

846
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,500
Yeah?

847
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,500
I saw on TV once...

848
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,500
that Emperor Penguins that live in Antarctica,

849
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,480
in order to protect each other,

850
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,530
do something called "huddling."

851
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,240
What is that?

852
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,450
I'm going to do that thing called "huddling."

853

 Eun Ha, don't you recognize me? 

869
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,530
 Sister-in-law! 

870
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,800
 You look touched. 

871
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,900
 - Where's Hyungnim? 
 - He didn't come home. 

872
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:29,000
 "We just held hands." Don't give me that clichÃ©. 

873
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,980
 Are you sure you've never been with anyone at age 36? 

874
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,100
 It might be best to call the police. 

875
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,800
 What do you mean Ji Hwan went alone to get Taek? 

876
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,100
 Eun Ha. 

877
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,300
 There are memories better left buried. 

878
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,300
 Next time, don't go looking for them.
