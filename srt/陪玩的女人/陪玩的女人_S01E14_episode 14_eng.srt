11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,410
Remember when we buried this together?

12
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,590
We promised to find it together as adults.

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,200
And here we are.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,010
So much time has gone by.

15
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,410
You don't know how hard I've looked for you, do you?

16
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,360
I should have said goodbye back then.

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,350
But I couldn't, so it was always...

18
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,740
on my mind. I felt sorry.

19
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,350
I left after checking that you got inside safely.

20
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,910
I had no idea you'd been looking for me...

21
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,700
your whole life.

22
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,450
I was the one who said I would find you.

23
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,340
You were right next to me, and I didn't realize it.

24
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,240
When did you first realize it was me?

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,620
When you had Taek's sister write down her wish on a kite.

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,010
 We used to do that when we were little, so I thought maybe. 

27
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,150
 I used to have an oppa who made kites for me. 

28
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,070
 He used to write a wish on every kite. 

29
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,360
 He told me the wish would reach the heavens. 

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,050
You should have told me then. I would have known earlier.

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm such a different person from who I was then.

32
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,970
I thought you might be disappointed.

33
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,270
I'm glad Seo Ji Hwan ended up being Hyun Woo.

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,700
Hyun Woo and Seo Ji Hwan both...

35
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,790
have always been good to me.

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,580
Thank you for saying that, Eun Ha.

37
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,560
Look at this.

38
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,270
   

39
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,350
   

40
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,770
   

41
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,530
   

42
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,300
How did you get here?

43
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,920
CEO's car.

44
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,250
Then how did he get home?

45
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,750
A cab?

46
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,540
Take your car. There's no place for it in front of my house.

47
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,350
You can have it.

48
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,940
You might need it more in the future.

49
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,830
Hold on.

50
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,040
This is...

51
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,070
I think I might keep the baby.

52
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,010
Really?

53
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,820
That's what it looks like, huh?

54
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,660
Long arms.

55
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,590
Long legs, too.

56
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
Can you tell?

57
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,440
That's the head, arms, and legs.

58
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,710
How can you tell right away? You said you don't even like kids.

59
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,140
- I do like kids. 
 - You do?

60
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,420
I do.

61
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,300
Really?

62
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,710
Even if I like something, I don't let it show.

63
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,370
People say they really can't read me.

64
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,840
Were you always like that?

65
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Since I grew up without parents,

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,130
I think I turned out like this because I didn't want people to see my pain.

67
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,420
I think that's why I'm like this now.

68
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,040
I might not know...

69
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,780
what a good dad is like.

70
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,870
But I'll be good.

71
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,190
I'll do my best and be good.

72
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,990
I've never been a mom before. So I don't know much, either.

73
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,490
What is going on?

74
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,990
- Dad? 
 - Father.

75
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,100
   

76
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,780
- You twoâ€” 
 - Dad, it's not like that.

77
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,350
You two...

78
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:05,850
â™«  A story from long ago, Comes back to my mind  â™«

79
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:15,300
â™«  See the moon, moon, moon  â™« 
 â™«  We were like that back then  â™«

80
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:24,210
â™«  Your voice that I missed so much, will I hear it again?  â™«

81
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:32,830
â™«  Like a more beautiful flower blooming in late spring, appears before my eyes  â™«

82
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:39,160
â™«  We all wanna be to the by no farewell  â™«

83
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,600
â™«  Now that weâ€™ve met again  â™«

84
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:51,700
â™«  A fateful miracle that recognized each other, may it become love  â™«

85
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,960
â™«  Back then, I didnâ€™t fully understand my feelings  â™«

86
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,200
Gosh, sorry, sorry. When did I fall asleep...

87
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,100
No, no.

88
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,350
Drink this.

89
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,520
Ginger and dates are good for your respiratory system.

90
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,260
Oh, okay.

91
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,730
Thanks.

92
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,090
Try this, too.

93
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,850
â™«  May our fate be as deep as the time lost  â™«

94
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,020
It's so good. Did you make all this this morning?

95
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,870
Yeah. It's good, right, Oppa?

96
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,420
â™«  You  â™«

97
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,290
Yeah, O-Oppa...

98
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,200
- Aren't you Ji Hwan Oppa now? 
 - Right, I am.

99
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,560
Thank you for the food, Eun Ha.

100
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,870
Hyungnimâ€”

101
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,000
Hyungnim!

102
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,460
You weren't in your room. Where were youâ€”

103
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,340
Hyungnim.

104
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,220
Hyungnim!

105
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,180
Have you been going to her room every night?

106
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,960
The door's soundproofing is quite good.

107
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,100
They say the tamest kitty jumps onto the stovetop first.

108
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,720
Hey, Man Ho. You should have made noodles today.

109
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,810
Should I make a bowl now?

110
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,260
What's the rush? We'll be having some soon.

111
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,930
Why noodles? Are you craving noodles?

112
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,960
You guys, cut it out.

113
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,280
- You guys... 
 - Hyungnimâ€”

114
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,240
Hey, Il Yeong. Do you...

115
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,640
like oxtail soup, noodles, or a buffet?

116
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,630
- Let's have steak. A full course. 
 - Shall we?

117
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,920
All he drinks is coffee. Why bother...

118
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,000
- I have something to tell everyone. 
 - Tell us.

119
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,680
- I'm going to be a dad. 
 - A dad?

120
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,200
As in "My dad is an alien"?

121
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm going to get married.

122
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,480
If you're getting married, I'm getting divorced, man.

123
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,400
Marriage? What marriage?

124
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,520
What did you just say?

125
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,890
What are you talking about?

126
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,100
- With Mi Ho. 
 - What?

127
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,600
Miâ€”

128
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,620
M-M-Mi Ho?

129
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,220
My friend Mi Ho?

130
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,460
- Press the button. 
 - Please.

131
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,630
Go ahead.

132
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,380
- Press "Like." 
 - Press.

133
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,130
Stop it.

134
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,020
   

135
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,490
T-T-That thing then!

136
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,430
When was that?

137
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,320
When I found the COVID test in the car after our trip.

138
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,300
Right!

139
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,280
Hey, Joo Il Yeong.

140
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,890
Explain what happened. From beginning to end.

141
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,360
Well...

142
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,530
You said you weren't pregnant. What a disaster. Are you crazy?

143
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,100
Hey!

144
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,300
I need to be careful!

145
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,970
Please don't touch me from now on.

146
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,770
So when you weren't feeling well, that was morning sickness?

147
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,690
You should have told me, girl! You went all the way there to be sick.

148
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,040
Hey.

149
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,590
In conclusion, your help was instrumental.

150
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,830
- Like, two assists. 
 - Hold on.

151
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,500
How long have you and Il Yeong been a thing? I had no idea.

152
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,190
You know that I'm into pretty faces.

153
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,170
Into pretty faces? All right, brag away.

154
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,560
How's the body?

155
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,390
Oh, his body?

156
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,770
It was nice.

157
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,980
Your body.

158
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,490
Your body!

159
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,940
Oh, my body! I'm fine.

160
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,430
What did your parents say?

161
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,300
Ask them yourself.

162
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,600
Ask us what? It's a no, of course!

163
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,670
- So, you haven't gotten their approval yet? 
 - No.

164
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,220
Then how can you get married?

165
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,600
But they have a child. They have to get married.

166
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,250
This is complicated.

167
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,770
Not only did you guys cross the line,

168
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,940
but her parents are against it because of our company image, right?

169
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,840
We still have time. I'll take my time and persuade them.

170
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,340
- Stand up. 
 - What?

171
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,050
You kept Mi Ho waiting long enough. Let's straighten this out quickly.

172
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,770
It's okay. I can take care of it slowly.

173
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,900
You guys, pack some gifts for her parents. You go get changed.

174
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,290
- Oh, and... 
 - W-Why...

175
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,440
Go, go! Hurry up!

176
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,580
Hyungnim!

177
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,570
I think he's going to come with you.

178
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,110
Is Hyungnim just going to cause a backtrack?

179
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,220
You mean "backfire," right?

180
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,130
- What? 
 - What?

181
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,810
They say the tamest kitty jumps onto the stovetop first.

182
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,830
I think we should just let Il Yeong handle it.

183
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,000
I am going to handle it.

184
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,700
We will not allow it!

185
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,590
Speak up!

186
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,680
Talk!

187
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,810
Well, Il Yeong is a really nice guy, Dad.

188
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,960
He went to S University, your favorite.

189
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,200
He's tall, handsome, has a great personality, and is so polite to adults.

190
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,640
Son-in-law Joo is handsome.

191
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,400
What "Son-in-law Joo"?

192
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,620
Hold on.

193
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,550
Who is that?

194
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,860
Mother and Father, hello.

195
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,780
I'm sorry to show up unannounced.

196
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,900
I'm the oldest hyung Seo Ji Hwan. I live with Il Yeong.

197
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,800
I'm here to get your approval in place of his parents.

198
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,200
Are you a mobster here to take money?

199
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,550
Do we owe you our approval? There's nothing to get from us.

200
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,580
I took him in when he was young since he had nowhere to go.

202
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,140
He hasn't said or done a single bad thing in those 16 years.

203
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,400
He finished graduate school and paid his own way.

204
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,800
He won't let his own family or someone else's go hungry.

205
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,480
He's fundamentally a kind and diligent person.

206
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,170
If the issue was just between these two, I wouldn't butt in.

207
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,870
But now it involves three people.

208
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,130
I would be grateful if you could reconsider it once more.

209
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,400
Your hyung seems so trustworthy.

210
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,100
My husband is also the oldest of six siblings.

211
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,690
Every time one of his siblings got married, he went around...

212
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,290
to ask for permission in place of their parents.

213
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,320
For me...

214
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,400
my child's life is more important...

215
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,400
than an unborn grandchild.

216
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,700
I'm going to have a good life with Mi Ho.

217
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,290
I'll be a proud dad to our unborn child.

218
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,260
At this point...

219
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,320
just saying "All right" will make you look cool, Dad.

220
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,270
You... Be quiet.

221
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,310
All right. You guys have done enough.

222
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,740
Sit comfortably, please.

223
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,330
Son-in-law Joo. Stretch out your knees.

224
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,340
I'll bring out some food. Have lunch before you go.

225
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,520
- Honey. 
 - You stand up, too.

226
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,370
You're the best at making pancakes!

227
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,750
- We said we'd say the same thing. What's this? 
 - Stand up.

228
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,800
Stand up!

229
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,900
- Youâ€” 
 - Come on.

230
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,200
- Follow me. 
 - It's okay.

231
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,490
Don't worry. They're going to have a good life.

232
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,760
So you never knew your parents and grew up in an orphanage?

233
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,480
Yes.

234
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,700
It must've been so hard to go through that alone.

235
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,020
You turned out so well.

236
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,200
He did inherit something huge from his parents.

237
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,770
His face.

238
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,480
Seriously, you're so...

239
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,660
- My head hurts. 
 - Oh, no.

240
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,970
Mother and Father, please take good care of Il Yeong.

241
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,320
He's drunk.

242
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,760
You're drunk. Sleep. It's okay.

243
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,300
Wow! How can he get so drunk after one drink?

244
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,090
- He's a lightweight. 
 - I see that.

245
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,300
I told him to go sleep inside, but he won't.

246
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,320
He's...

247
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,280
someone I really love and care about.

248
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,750
Mother and Father, isn't he so good-looking?

249
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,720
Please take good care of him.

250
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,700
- Wrong way. Just sleep. 
 - Please take care of him...

251
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,580
- It's okay. 
 - They've met once before.

252
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,260
They're neighbors.

253
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,200
Hey, Joo Il Yeong.

254
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,100
You thief!

255
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,240
When did you get a perm?

256
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,730
You thief!

257
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,240
Ji Hwan! Wrong way.

258
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,490
Il Yeong...

259
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,690
You'll be a good dad, for sure.

260
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,710
- Gosh, they must be similar! 
 - Okay.

261
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,670
That guy...

262
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,590
- He must resemble Il Yeong. 
 - No, he doesn't!

263
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,770
Just a little more.

264
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,830
Wait.

265
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,250
Just a little more.

266
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,870
What? You're totally sober. You're doing this on purpose.

267
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,110
Oppa, you got down on your knees so easily.

268
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,280
No. I don't easily bend my knees.

269
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,930
No. It looked pretty automatic.

270
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,080
How do you feel, Oppa?

271
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,900
- About what? 
 - About Il Yeong getting married.

272
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,360
Aren't you sad?

273
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,370
- No. 
 - You're not sad?

274
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,980
No.

275
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,800
He's old enough to have a family.

276
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,140
I'm just happy for him.

277
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,130
I feel a little weird.

278
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,380
Mi Ho getting married...

279
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,550
or becoming a mom.

280
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,170
It hasn't quite sunk in yet.

281
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,780
Oppa, have you ever thought about getting married?

282
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,950
Marriage?

283
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,860
You're not that young, Oppa.

284
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,830
Jae Soo is older than me.

285
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,620
Il Yeong is seven years younger than you.

286
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,350
Il Yeong has a baby, though.

287
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,560
But is marriage...

288
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,430
something you do for a baby? It's for love.

289
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,070
Because you love someone and don't want to be apart.

290
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,060
Really?

291
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,670
- I don't know. I've never thought about it. 
 - What?

292
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,620
But the guys need me. So they all need to get married first.

293
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,710
- They all what? Get them married off first? 
 - Yeah.

294
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,990
But Dong Hee is only 22.

295
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,820
If you wait for him, you'll be over 50 when you get married.

296
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,760
Well, is that so? Am I that old already?

297
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,480
Well, fine. People live to be 100 these days. It's doable.

298
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,470
Take care of your health, Oppa. Don't drink like today.

299
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,340
Take care of your health and live long and well.

300
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,510
Hey, Eun Ha.

301
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,930
Sleep.

302
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,880
Why so suddenly...

303
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,840
He didn't use to be this clueless.

304
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,420
He's changed.

305
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,500
    
 - Gosh! 10,000 people?

306
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,840
10,000 people? 10,000 people!

307
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,040
- Gosh! 10,000 subscribers! 
 - Sister-in-Law, you're up early.

308
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,660
Man Ho! I have 10,000 people!

309
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,390
- What? 
 - I have 10,000 subscribers!

310
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,980
10,000? Already?

311
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,190
- Wow! 
 - What's going on?

312
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,650
- 10,000 subscribers! 
 - Wow!

313
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,670
- What's going on? 
 - Don't be shocked.

314
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:31,240
Sister-in-law has reached 10,000 subscribers.

315
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,280
Applause!

316
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,350
Little Rat is "Cure for all"! 
  (T/N: Sounds like "10,000 people") 

317
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,600
- Congratulations, Noona. 
 - Thank you!

318
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,080
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

319
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,760
- Congratulations. 
 - Noona, should we organize an event for 10K?

320
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,250
That's a great idea!

321
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,330
I've been wanting to do an offline event. Now is the time!

322
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,070
- Right! That's a great idea! 
 - Thank you!

323
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,720
That's great!

324
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,090
Good morning, Hyungnim. Hyungnim!

325
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,950
Little Rat has more than 10,000 subscribers, Hyungnim!

326
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,820
- What are you saying? 
 - She has more than 10,000 subscribers.

327
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,540
More than 10,000 subscribers?

328
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,730
- Yes, Hyungnim. 
 - More than 10,000?

329
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,390
- You have more than 10,000 subscribers? 
 - Yes!

330
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,730
Congratulations! Congratulations!

331
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,950
Congratulations!

332
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,690
 I don't know. I've never thought about it. 

333
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,840
 But the guys need me. So they all need to get married first. 

334
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,140
10,000 people!

335
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,430
Wait, wait.

336
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,410
Right.

337
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,890
- Huh? 
 - I need to get ready for the event,

338
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,110
and I'm having lunch with Mi Ho. See you later. Enjoy breakfast.

339
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,230
- Sister-in-Law! 
 - What?

340
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,730
- What? 
 - Eun Ha.

341
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,530
- Sister-in-Law... 
 - What?

342
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,730
The vibes were pure honey! Why did you ice it out, Hyungnim?

343
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,760
W-Why is she acting like that?

344
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
You're the source of 10,000 troubles, Hyungnim!

345
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,030
Hyungnim.

346
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,560
What? Are you sure she has 10,000 subscribers?

347
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,990
Is he a matchmaking company?

348
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,530
Think about it after marrying off Jae Soo, Man Ho, Hong Gi, and Dong Hee?

349
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,560
He's saying he doesn't want to get married.

350
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,040
What's all this marriage talk all of a sudden? Do you want to get married?

351
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,960
It's not that I want to, but he's not thinking about it at all.

352
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm just disappointed.

353
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,410
So you call him something else now.

354
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,940
"Oppa" sounds so natural.

355
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,550
Hey!

356
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,600
- I got so worked up that I forgot to tell you. 
 - What?

357
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,790
Seo Ji Hwan...

358
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,730
is Hyun Woo oppa.

359
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,500
- What? Really? 
 - Yeah!

360
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,900
- It wasn't just a feeling? He really is Hyun Woo? 
 - Yes!

361
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,530
Stop messing with me.

362
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,810
Hey, that doesn't make any sense.

363
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,060
He's so different from what you've told me.

364
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,730
Look. You said Hyun Woo is fair. Almost like a prince.

365
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,170
And sensitive and tender?

366
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,550
Hey. Seo Ji Hwan is sensitive and a prince, too!

367
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,750
You just haven't looked up close.

368
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,650
He has dark eyes, a nice nose, plump lips. He's good-looking!

369
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,050
- What? 
 - Hey, to be good-looking...

370
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,280
Look.

371
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,590
This is what good-looking looks like.

372
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,400
Or a face like Il Yeong's.

373
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,940
You're so weird. What's wrong with Ji Hwan?

374
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,280
Ji Hwan is second to none anywhere we go! Right, Dong Hee?

375
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,550
Of course. But please don't fight.

376
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,640
I mean, he even sent a bodyguard for his girlfriend.

377
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,690
How considerate.

378
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,870
Seo Ji Hwan is Hyun Woo!

379
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,340
Il Yeong, Eun Ha was mad at me earlier, right?

380
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,260
Did something happen yesterday?

381
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,940
Yesterday? We talked about Dong Hee.

382
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,890
Before that, we talked about age. Before that, marriage.

383
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,430
She didn't ask you, "Do you ever want to get married?" did she?

384
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,950
How did you know?

385
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,320
Did you say no?

386
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,800
It's not that I don't want to. I just said I've never thought about it.

387
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,490
What, what?

388
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,580
Did I make a mistake?

389
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,540
You did, but this kind of mistake will only upset her more if you apologize.

390
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,730
I think you should approach it from a different angle.

391
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,710
- How? 
 - "I haven't thought about marriage,

392
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,330
but my heart belongs to you.

393
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,460
I love you with all my heart."

394
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,260
That's what you need to express.

395
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,230
What are you saying? C-Can you repeat that?

396
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,160
You don't do this with words.

397
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,760
You do it with a gift.

398
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,930
A gift?

399
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,540
By the way, I have one more thing to tell you.

400
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,270
After you left the other day,

401
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,510
Seo Tae Pyung called up former Bulldog Gang members.

402
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,060
Right after my visit?

403
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,660
Yes.

404
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,730
Il Yeong, drop me off at the Prosecutor's Office.

405
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,390
Okay.

406
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,890
    
 You should've done this sooner.

407
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,980
Damn it. Stamp your finger now.

408
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,690
Who is next?

409
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,410
What's going on?

410
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,250
Just pick it up.

411
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,620
What is all this?

412
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,610
Bastard, pick it up.

413
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,340
Move, you bastard.

414
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,610
Get him.

415
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,040
That way.

416
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,870
What's this?

417
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,650
Should have brought something cold.

418
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,420
These guys are executives under Seo Ji Hwan.

419
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,000
Celebrating 10K followers! Meet Eun Ha Unni to play!

420
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,580
Click below for details, and please sign up in the comments!

421
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,300
What's going on?

422
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,480
My dear, beloved Prosecutor. Do you want to go on a blind date?

423
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,750
Pardon? A b-blind date?

424
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,020
My cousin's friend's in-laws' second cousin is a pianist.

425
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,550
In terms of phrenology and MBTI, you two are a match. 
  (T/N: Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, a personality test) 

426
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,860
So I thought I'd set you up.

427
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,690
That's why he asked for your MBTI type yesterday.

428
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,950
If you start dating, we can go back to a normal life.

429
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,310
Look. It's work, work, work, work!

430
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,330
I didn't realize yesterday was Sunday until I checked that today was Monday.

431
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,790
If you keep working this much, you'll die early and never touch...

432
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,060
that pension you worked so hard for.

433
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,150
The world is cruel. We should just die early.

434
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,360
Let's die early!

435
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,490
Let's just die.

436
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,570
Sounds good.

437
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,740
- What? 
 - Your in-laws' second cousin.

438
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,230
I'll meet her.

439
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,600
You mean that?

440
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,620
Let's strike while the iron's hot. I'll set it up right away.

441
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,750
If you change your mind, you'll have to write your name with your butt.

442
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,980
What?

443
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,910
   

444
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,610
   

445
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,710
Come in.

446
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,500
Seo Ji Hwan, you're here.

447
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,310
You came right when Officer Yang is in.

448
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:02,290
Wow, I never thought I'd see the day you would two shake hands!

449
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,940
Or you would go on a blind dateâ€”

450
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,210
Let me introduce everyone.

451
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,250
This is Chief Oh Chul Man.

452
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,250
This is Officer Yang Jong Chul.

453
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,790
- And this isâ€” 
 - I'm Seo Ji Hwan.

454
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,820
Sure, sure. Yes.

455
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,350
He'll help us catch Seo Tae Pyung and Go Yang Hui.

456
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,070
How could you work with such a person?

457
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,200
Sure, sure. We can trust him, right?

458
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,740
Someone who's gone down that road before will know betterâ€”

459
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,970
Anyway, have a seat.

460
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
Thank you.

461
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,960
Seo Ji Hwan, could you repeat what you told me earlier?

462
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,660
On Friday, Seo Tae Pyung gathered former Bulldog Gang members.

463
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,420
He bought their businesses at dirt-cheap prices.

464
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,260
I think he's expanding his business to rebuild the Bulldog Gang.

465
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,030
The company that bought those businesses is none other than...

466
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,270
Sangnam Liquor.

467
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,980
   

468
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,830
Seo Tae Pyung, that guy...

469
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,600
He's set for life with the money he stole. How power-hungry can he be?

470
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,900
Chief Oh is looking into Sangnam Liquor's transactions.

471
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,900
But we don't have enough data and need help from the inside.

472
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,100
So, by any chance...

473
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,960
what do you think of Lee Gang Gil?

474
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,030
Lee Gang Gil.

475
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:38,280
It looks like Lee Gang Gil is taking care of the important paperwork.

476
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,440
You probably saw from the drug deal, but he won't flip easily.

477
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,880
But if you need it,

478
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,270
I'll meet him.

479
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,990
Here's the paperwork from people turning over their businesses.

480
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:57,800
So it's no longer Sangnam Liquor but Sangnam Group, right?

481
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,620
It's a big responsibility to run a company so large.

482
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,750
You're not going to hand it over to an outsider, are you?

483
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,530
It's none of your business.

484
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,340
You can go.

485
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,500
Why do you think the Chairman called up Seo Ji Hwan that day?

486
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,720
- I don't know. 
 - He betrayed him and put him away for 10 years.

487
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,070
He should've snapped his neck right there and then.

488
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,940
But he just had a calm conversation and sent him away.

489
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,320
Blood is thicker than water.

490
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,370
Is it that?

491
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,390
   

492
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,500
Tell him to try me.

493
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,730
This time, I'm not just going to take it.

494
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,520
- What's going on? 
 - Can I see you tomorrow? I need to talk to you.

495
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,320
Got it.

496
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,670
- Could you close the door, Dong Hee? 
 - Sure.

497
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,300
- Look, Dong Hee. I'll show you. 
 - Okay.

498
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,380
This is yours.

499
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm going to decorate it like this.

500
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,330
It's easy. Can you do it?

501
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,700
- I'll try. 
 - Try.

502
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,820
That's it! Just like that.

503
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,030
- Are those eyes? 
 - Yes.

504
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,370
So cute. Dong Hee, you're talented!

505
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,380
You're better than me.

506
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,520
- No way. 
 - Yes way!

507
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,380
Can you finish those?

508
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,340
Okay.

509
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,780
That was so quick, thanks to you.

510
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,850
I think you have talent in this area, Dong Hee.

511
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,100
I just followed you, Teacher.

512
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,400
That's why you should believe what I say.

513
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,190
These are for tomorrow.

514
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,630
Should I put these outside now?

515
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,090
Now you know what to do.

516
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,940
Thank you.

517
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,230
These are for the guys.

518
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,070
I'm still mad at him. Should I surprise him again?

519
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,840
â™«  I canâ€™t forget that beautiful heart  â™«

520
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,590
Welcome.

521
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,290
Hello.

522
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,800
Are you looking for something specific?

523
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,830
My girlfriend is mad at me.

524
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,870
Someone told me something small and sparkly would make her stop being mad at me.

525
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,280
Something small and sparkly?

526
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,060
I don't know these things well, so I'm not sure what to get...

527
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,290
What's your girlfriend like?

528
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,230
So pretty and seriously cute.

529
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,210
Of course, she's pretty and cute.

530
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,140
Specifically, her face is small, fair, and cheery.

531
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,960
She's always smiling. When she smiles, her eyes are like this.

532
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,650
Oh, I have a video.

533
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,580
Here. Here you go.

534
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,030
 The caterpillar can have pretty wings... 

535
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:21,160
She's a kids' content creator. She just got 10K subscribers.

536
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,860
She's really pretty and cute.

537
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,850
Yes, she is. Cute and pretty.

538
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,470
How about this one? I think it'll look good on her.

539
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,740
Get in line.

540
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,740
Can we have a hot americano, a hot chamomile tea, and...

541
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,860
a piece of cheesecake?

542
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,580
Wait.

543
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,200
We don't need the cake. Just the two drinks, please.

544
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,700
- I thought you liked cake. 
 - You know...

545
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,760
we have to do wedding prep, find a place...

546
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,440
- We need to save. 
 - It's just 7,000 won.

547
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,850
See? I knew you'd be like this.

548
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,110
- You've never kept a budget, have you? 
 - No.

549
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,380
This is a reality now.

550
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,280
Kids cost a ton of money.

551
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,410
Since we're having a baby before getting a place,

552
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,550
we need to be on alert more than others.

553
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,840
As soon as the baby's here, we'll need milk, diapers, clothes, and...

554
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,470
toiletries, and what else...

555
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:40,630
Toys! We'll need a lot of toys. So...

556
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,850
You don't need to worry about paying for milk or diapers.

557
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,400
What is this? Why are there so many numbers?

558
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,650
One, ten, hundred, thousand, hundred thousandâ€”

559
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,590
Hundreds of millions?

560
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,140
Are these your savings?

561
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,520
Did you save all this money? At your age?

562
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,030
Didn't I tell you?

563
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,370
You can trust me.

564
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,770
Then...

565
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,930
- can I order cake now? 
 - Yes!

566
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,280
I'll have the cheesecakeâ€” wait.

567
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,900
I want something more expensive. Strawberries and cream!

568
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,250
- Strawberries and cream? 
 - Yeah.

569
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,140
Got it.

570
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,300
Hey. How am I supposed to hug a kid like this?

571
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,950
Is it to protect my back from carrying the baby?

572
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,340
It looks like a parachute.

573
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,910
Do I carry the baby and run?

574
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,380
- Hyungnim. 
 - Good evening, Hyungnim.

575
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,810
What?

576
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,510
Hyungnim.

577
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,190
What's with the flowers?

578
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,860
You know how to buy flowers now. You're practically a terrorist!

579
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,800
Terrorist? You mean a romantic.

580
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,950
What is all this?

581
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,100
Hyungnim, we bought some stuff for our nephew.

582
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:07,820
We don't know if it's a boy or girl, so we prepared both.

583
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,010
Are you guys seeing anyone?

584
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,430
- No. 
 - A girl, you mean?

585
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:23,730
You're old now. You should think about getting married. What's all this?

586
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,060
I'm 32.

587
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,340
What nonsense. Don't lie to me.

588
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,580
I'm actually 32.

589
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,820
You're that young?

590
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,390
Yes. I'll wait until you guys are married.

591
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,650
I think I can take my time.

592
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,400
No, don't take your time.

593
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,200
The order doesn't matter. Whoever's ready goes next.

594
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,400
Stop sticking together all the time, you two! Stay apart!

595
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,110
- We're apart right now. 
 - More!

596
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,880
We're...

597
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,260
Don't stick together.

598
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,370
Did you ever go out with a girl?

599
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,400
Dong Hee isn't the problem. It's those two. Those guys...

600
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,960
Eun Ha.

601
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,820
Eun Ha?

602
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,860
Where did she go?

603
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,920
Ta-da!

604
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,930
E-E-E-Eun Ha. It's you. One second.

605
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,580
E-Eun Ha, one second.

606
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,770
You can turn around now.

607
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,140
- Can I? 
 - Yes.

608
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,030
I was going to surprise you, then I was surprised.

609
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,020
A surprise.

610
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,390
Want to sit down for a second?

611
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,080
Here.

612
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,710
What is this?

613
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,710
Wow, is this for me?

614
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,460
There are two hearts inside.

615
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,100
I-Is this for me?

616
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,600
They're for the event tomorrow. I made some for you.

617
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,060
Really?

618
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,470
Thank you.

619
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,000
Eun Ha.

620
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,570
I have something for you, too.

621
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,000
Huh?

622
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,160
Flowers?

623
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,080
Congratulations on 10K subscribers for "Eun Ha and Friends."

624
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,270
Sunflowers.

625
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,480
You remembered that I like sunflowers.

626
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,580
Of course. I remember everything about you. I don't forget.

627
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,590
Also, the important stuff is happening now.

628
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,110
What?

629
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,340
Eun Ha.

630
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,390
From now on,

631
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,770
I'll always be by your side.

632
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,150
Don't you dare go anywhere.

633
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,570
I'll stick by you.

634
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:31,420
- Are you ready for the event tomorrow? 
 - Yeah.

635
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,040
If you're curious, come check it out.

636
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,890
I don't have anything after my morning meeting. I'll be there.

637
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,570
Good.

638
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,440
- It's tasty, right? 
 - So tasty. How did you make them?

639
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,270
Dong Hee helped me. We did it together.

640
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,150
â™«  Once I see you, twice I see you, I keep wanting to see you more  â™«

641
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,130
â™«  Your beautiful figure  â™«

642
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,190
Watch out! Move! 
 â™«  Your beautiful figure  â™«

643
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,790
Hey!

644
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,280
Ahjussi! You can't ride your bike here!

645
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,520
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay, Dong Hee?

646
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,530
This looks like our spot.

647
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,820
I think so, too.

648
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,880
Hello. Hello.

649
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,830
Everything is ready. Let me know when you're done.

650
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,850
Thank you.

651
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,410
- Should we put them up, Dong Hee? 
 - Yes.

652
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:05,130
We have a group meal after today's meeting! 
    

653
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,530
Man Ho is treating!

654
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:14,160
Quick correction. Gwak Jae Soo is treating today!

655
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,220
Applause!

656
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,170
Everyone's in the conference room, right?

657
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,370
You need to see something before you go.

658
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:52,330
Director Nam Pil Ho and Goo Choong Bae are in touch with Go Yang Hui's gang.

659
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:07,660
Got it. I'll meet with them after the meeting. Let's go for now.

660
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,100
   

661
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,460
What's going on?

662
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,690
What's going on?

663
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,330
What are you doing here, you bastards!

664
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,990
 It's an emergency. The conference room is a mess. 

665
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,780
 That guy is here. Your father! 

666
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,450
 What do we do? 

667
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,710
 Go Yang Hui and the guys stormed in. People are on their knees. 

668
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,420
 I'm so scared, I can't even leave. 

669
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,800
   

670
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,390
Do something.

671
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,250
I'm going to lose my mind.

672
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,150
- Hyungnim! 
 - Hyungnim!

673
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,360
What are you doing at someone else's company?

674
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:41,080
If you're not associated with Thirsty Deer, please leave right now.

675
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,160
Returning after 10 years,

676
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,700
I noticed there were so many new faces, so I came to see them.

677
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:59,460
It looks like everyone's been well here.

678
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,770
"From bone to flesh."

679
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,120
Bone to bone,

680
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,830
flesh to flesh!

681
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,990
We need to get back what we're owed.

682
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,550
I'm sorry, Hyungnim! Please spare our lives!

683
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:28,090
Hyungnim, I'm sorry.

684
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,760
Damn it. What are you doing?

685
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,190
Have you all lost your mind? You traitors!

686
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,030
Who betrayed the Chairman first?

687
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,170
Hey, bastard. Are you calling the CEO a traitor?

688
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,410
Tell it like it is. He did betray him.

689
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,160
Shut your mouth, bastard.

690
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,190
Are you going to hit me, bastard?

691
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,940
What a well-run company.

692
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,830
- Who's calling who a traitor? 
 - You're the traitor!

693
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,920
What do we do...

694
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,570
What the hell is this?

695
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,690
Stop it!

696
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,810
The meeting is adjourned for today.

697
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:36,460
If you don't have business here, please leave.

698
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,320
Let's go.

699
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,990
Gosh. Your hand is bleeding.

700
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,540
Why did you do that?

701
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,020
To be honest...

702
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,290
I'm scared of the Chairman.

703
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:31,590
I've trusted and followed you until now.

704
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,140
But I can't anymore. I'm too scared.

705
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,800
I'll turn in my resignation letter, so process it.

706
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:42,760
Could you stay?

707
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,770
Do you think we have two lives?

708
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:50,580
I'd rather not get involved than stick it out and die.

709
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,020
Don't do that.

710
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,300
Please trust me just a little longer.

711
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,100
No one who turned his back then has slept well since the Chairman got out.

712
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,000
CEO Seo, I mean, Ji Hwan, the reason we supported you back then...

713
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,760
was because the Chairman was in jail and not around.

714
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,040
That's why you turned him in.

715
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,630
You knew if he was around, you couldn't escape him.

716
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,530
We can't escape him now.

717
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,530
   

718
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,830
Let's go.

719
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,600
Director, why are you doing this?

720
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,600
    
 You can't do this right now, Director.

721
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,130
Chairman, I have something to tell you.

722
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:16,860
- What is it? 
 - I meant to report to you a while ago.

723
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,930
Seo Ji Hwan has a girl.

724
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,600
Someone he's known since childhood. He's crazy about her.

725
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,810
So?

726
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:34,390
Her job is to play with kids. She's doing an outdoor event today.

727
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,920
This is a surefire way to destroy Seo Ji Hwan.

728
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,310
If we kidnap that girl and blackmail himâ€”

729
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:46,060
You know what the difference is between you and Ji Hwan?

730
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,680
- Pardon? 
 - If I tell you to bring me something,

731
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,810
you push and try to steal it.

732
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:54,410
Ji Hwan makes the other person give it to him.

733
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:58,290
That's why you're inferior, man.

734
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,450
Prosecutor.

735
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:17,190
You haven't forgotten about the blind date today, right?

736
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,950
Of course not.

737
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:21,730
Fighting!

738
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,550
Sure.

739
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,870
Yes, Officer Yang.

740
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,380
What?

741
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:37,020
Seo Tae Pyung stormed into Seo Ji Hwan's company?

742
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,640
How can that be...

743
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,560
Of course, we didn't know.

744
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,610
Got it.

745
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Chief Oh, what was that? Seo Tae Pyung went to Thirsty Deer?

746
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,690
What?

747
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:55,850
It's something that always happens on this Earth.

748
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,210
He brought his guys with him and stormed in this afternoon.

749
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:01,000
But I don't think anything is going to happen.

750
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,100
Nothing unusual happened, right?

751
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,150
 What is this? Why is this playing? 

752
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,710
 Be Eun Ha and Friends and watch... 

753
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,100
 Hey, what are you doing? 

754
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,700
 - Damn it! 
 - Hey, hey! 

755
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,530
 Why are you watching this? 

756
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,500
Those guys are constantly going somewhere in packs.

757
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,700
   

758
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:32,000
He's not going to pick up right now.

759
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,820
Prosecutor?

760
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,380
Okay, got it.

761
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,560
Mi Eun!

762
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,350
Nice dance! But the prince isn't smiling.

763
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:05,100
What about you, Yoo Min?

764
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,250
- Let's go! 
 - I wanna dance too.

765
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,080
For Yoo Min.

766
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,950
Thank you.

767
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,820
- Let's eat. 
 - Here are some drinks.

768
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:25,740
- Have some drinks. 
 - Here you go.

769
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,130
Thank you for coming, Prosecutor.

770
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:32,740
Of course, I should come. I was Eun Ha and Friends' first fan.

771
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,700
Hi. I watch your channel every day. Can I get a picture with you?

772
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,040
Of course, you can! One moment.

773
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,690
One, two, three!

774
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,070
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you.

775
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,830
Bye!

776
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,930
Would you like a muffin, Prosecutor?

777
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,090
It's a little squashed.

778
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:13,420
   

779
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,030
 That's why you turned him in. 

780
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,880
 You knew if he was around, you couldn't escape him. 

781
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,090
 We need to get back what we're owed. 

782
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,930
 You're all criminals. Aren't you? 

783
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:29,280
 Stop wasting your time and come back where you belong. 

784
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,650
 I belong to Thirsty Deer. I don't want to come back. 

785
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:37,830
 From now on, your name is Seo Ji Hwan. You're my son. 

786
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:41,000
 I'm glad Seo Ji Hwan ended up being Hyun Woo. 

787
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,300
 Hyun Woo and Seo Ji Hwan both... 

788
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,340
 have always been good to me. 

789
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,000
 A tiger's son should be a tiger. 

790
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,500
 No matter what people say, you're my son. 

791
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:03,850
   

792
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,580
CEO.

793
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,400
- What? 
 - Five executives have resigned.

794
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,290
I think more are on their way.

795
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,100
All right.

796
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,790
Are you okay?

797
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,080
What time is it?

798
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,090
It's 5:50 p.m.

799
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:35,890
You were supposed to go to the event.

800
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:40,500
I'll wrap up around here. Go.

801
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,420
I think his meeting is running long.

802
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,600
Of course. His work should come first.

803
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,700
Thank you for today, Dong Hee. I'll buy you a nice dinner.

804
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,930
Okay.

805
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:07,410
- I'll go return these. 
 - Okay.

806
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,930
Thank you.

807
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,180
Dong Hee, can you take this, too?

808
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,650
- Okay. 
 - Thanks.

809
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:16,430
I'm sorry it got so late. It took so long to clear everything.

810
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:18,330
No, it's all right. We're almost done.

811
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:21,770
Did you have other plans today?

812
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:24,900
No. I didn't.

813
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,000
I'm going to go throw this out.

814
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,070
Let me do it.

815
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,100
No, I got it. Give it to me.

816
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,500
- I'll clean up the rest. 
 - Okay.

817
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,560
- See you in a second. 
 - Okay!

818
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,470
   

819
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,110
Eun Ha.

820
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:49,040
   

821
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,480
Eun Ha?

822
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,010
Eun Ha!

823
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,900
Eun Ha!

824
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:13,470
It's you again, Unni.

825
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:16,300
Wait. Wait!

826
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,000
Wait! Wait...

827
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,880
Eun Ha!

828
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:28,430
Eun Ha, are you okay?

829
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,770
Eun Ha!

830
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,600
Prosecutor.

831
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,900
Prosecutor!

832
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,700
Prosecutor... you're bleeding...

833
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,040
- What? 
 - Prosecutor!

834
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,990
Eun Ha...

835
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:56,310
Get out of here now.

836
01:02:56,310 --> 01:03:00,650
Damn it. Hey! Run! Run!

01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:20,990
Prosecutor, please...

842
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:23,800
Wake up, Prosecutor!

843
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,780
Prosecutor!

844
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,700
Oh, no!

845
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,270

850
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,800
 I thought I could protect her. 

851
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,960
 Please go, Go Eun Ha. 

852
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,080
 I think this is wrong. 

853
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,290
 You said you would always be by my side. You just said that. 

854
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:15,180
 What's wrong with living an ordinary life like others? 

855
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,960
 That's given, Hyungnim. 

856
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,400
 If there's something I can do, 

857
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,900
 I'm going to do everything I can. 

858
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,690
 What are you talking about? That's reckless! 

859
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:29,200
 You still remember how you can leave, right?
