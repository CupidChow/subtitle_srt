00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,990
I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

13
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,340
Prosecutor! Wake up! Are you okay, Prosecutor?

14
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,110
Prosecutor, please...

15
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,800
Please...

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,520
Prosecutor! Wake up, Prosecutor! Prosecutor!

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,100
Prosecutor!

18
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,680
- Dong Hee, call an ambulance right now. 
 - Prosecutor!

19
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,960
I told you not to mess with her.

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,160
You bastard!

21
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,930
Prosecutor, wake up! Prosecutor!

22
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,910
Prosecutor!

23
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,690
I told you.

24
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,490
Sir!

25
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,440
- What are you doing? 
 - Stop!

26
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,080
Stop it, sir!

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,990
Let him go! Let him go!

28
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,900
- Let him go! 
 - Let him go, sir.

29
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,410
Sir, calm down.

30
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,480
Calm down. Calm down, sir.

31
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,820
There were three people, and one of them ran away?

32
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,680
No, two of them ran away.

33
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,540
The person who was hitting is not the perpetrator.

34
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,520
Who is he, then?

35
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,590
Someone who came to help.

36
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,900
Ouch, it hurts.

37
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,890
Geez, I thought Korea was a safe country. How can he hit me like that?

38
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,680
You guys saw that, didn't you?

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,560
H-He went mad and beat me up. He's a bad guy!

40
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,590
I got it. Please just stay still.

41
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,770
He said it was an attempted kidnapping.

42
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,730
Kidnapping?

43
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,500
I was jogging in the park. I'm wearing sneakers!

44
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,710
- Officer. 
 - Yeah.

45
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,400
You need to look at this.

46
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,350
What is it?

47
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,820
   

48
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,300
   

49
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,000
    
 What's up with these guys?

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,330
Kitty Gang. Bulldog...

51
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,090
You're not just ordinary guys.

52
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,930
What is it?

53
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,560
Look.

54
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
   

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,330
   

56
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,870
The CT scan is normal, and we finished stitching up his head.

57
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,300
We'll hospitalize him for a day. Let's see how he does.

58
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,600
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. 
 - Thank you.

59
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,070
Thank you.

60
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,540
Prosecutor.

61
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,750
Eun Ha.

62
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,640
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

63
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,490
I'm okay. How are you? Does it hurt a lot?

64
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,030
I passed out for a second from the shock.

65
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,790
My wounds aren't bad, thankfully.

66
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,090
Why did you let her stay here? She must've been scared.

67
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,070
She wanted to make sure you were okay.

68
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,540
What happened to the people at the scene?

69
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,780
Someone named Go Yang Hui is with the police.

70
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,410
Really?

71
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,620
I need to go.

72
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,380
The doctor said you need to be hospitalized for a day.

73
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,400
Eun Ha, I'm okay. Don't worry.

74
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,080
Let's get out of here.

75
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,860
But...

76
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,450
Eun Ha, don't think about anything tonight. Get some rest.

77
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,380
Prosecutor.

78
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,100
Seo Ji Hwan is at the police station.

79
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,940
- I'm coming with you. 
 - Eun Ha.

80
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,750
I'm sure he already gave his statement. There's nothing you can do.

81
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,060
Go home and rest. I'll handle it.

82
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,350
Let's go.

83
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,340
- We'll get going. 
 - Okay.

84
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,710
 The things you're thinking about and concerned about... 

85
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,490
 will never happen. 

86
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,830
 I'll give my life to protect Eun Ha. 

87
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,040
I hear the victim is at the hospital.

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,560
Was it really an attempted kidnapping?

89
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,320
You didn't assault him?

90
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,300
- No. 
 - Excuse me.

91
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,000
The victim is right here. Who are you talking about?

92
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,500
   

93
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Sir, a moment, please.

94
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,940
I see Seo Ji Hwan's fists are still strong.

95
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,560
That's right. That's Seo Ji Hwan.

96
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,780
I don't care if you washed your hands.

97
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,950
No matter how clean you pretend to be,

98
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,360
a dirty rag is a rag, even after being washed.

99
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,060
Once a thug, always a thug.

100
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,730
Hyung.

101
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,980
I'm Seo Ji Hwan's lawyer.

102
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,640
Right. Of course, you have one.

103
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,590
Where's Gang Gil? I called that bastard forever ago!

104
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,110
Who are you?

105
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,330
I'm a victim and a witness to this case.

106
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,390
I witnessed the first victim, Go Eun Ha, being kidnapped.

107
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,150
As I was trying to help her, I was assaulted.

108
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,430
There are two more accomplices besides him over there.

109
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,880
Hwang Gang Sik, age 35. Hwang Gang Tae, age 32.

110
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,750
All three committed attempted kidnapping, robbery, assault, and conspiracy to murder.

111
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,790
They fled to destroy evidence. I request an investigation with detention.

112
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,640
For evidence, there are security cameras...

113
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
at the park entrance and behind the restrooms.

114
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,720
Check the footage. You'll see the crime.

115
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,130
Okay. But what do you do?

116
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,120
I'm Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

117
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,030
Hey, you!

118
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,980
Is a prosecutor allowed to distort the facts?

119
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,610
Fine, look at the security footage!

120
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,600
Hey, hey. If you keep making a scene,

121
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,900
we'll lock you up for obstruction of justice. Sit down.

122
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,540
How about this person?

123
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,750
He...

124
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,500
arrived at the scene in the aftermath...

125
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,010
and helped us.

126
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,510
Have a good night.

127
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,390
Thank you. Get home safe.

128
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,540
You almost got Eun Ha kidnapped. She could have died!

129
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,710
What did you do? You said you would protect her!

130
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,430
Is Eun Ha okay?

131
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,240
You don't deserve to ask me that!

132
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,340
Where is she?

133
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,120
I don't even want to think about what would have happened if I weren't there.

134
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,530
It's my fault...

135
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,550
for thinking you're trustworthy, even for a moment.

136
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,260
   

137
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,070
   

138
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,650
Seo Ji Hwan.

139
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,150
Oppa.

140
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,100
- Eun Ha. 
 - Are you okay?

141
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,300
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

142
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,100
Goodness...

143
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,640
I told you not to come here.

144
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,760
Please go, Go Eun Ha.

145
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,770
Il Yeong, let's go.

146
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,610
I told you.

147
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,670
People don't change.

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Stop all this and come back to where you belong.

149
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,060
   

150
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,100
Let's go.

151
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,750
   

152
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,240
   

153
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,820
- Sister-in-law! 
 - Little Rat!

154
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,750
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you all right?

155
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,440
What happened? Are you hurt? Are you okay?

156
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,580
Don't worry. I'm okay.

157
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,660
Man Ho, go make something warm to calm her down.

158
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,970
Let me make some adlay tea.

159
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm tired. I'm going to go upstairs and rest.

160
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,000
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

161
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,930
Go on up.

162
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,010
   

163
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:45,810
â™«  Unusually warm wind  â™«

164
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,970
â™«  Soothe my weary day  â™«

165
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,270
 Stop it, sir! 

166
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,210
 Let him go! Let him go! 

167
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,280
 Let him go, sir! 

168
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,890
 Let him go! Calm down! 

169
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:08,030
â™«  I wish it was all a dream  â™«

170
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:17,500
â™«  When I feel alone, lights of the past  â™«

171
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:24,010
â™«  Warmly embrace me again  â™«

172
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:33,490
â™«  I want to see the light, wake me up from my tiredness  â™«

173
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:41,920
â™«  Push away the time that feels like a lie  â™«

174
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,990
â™«  Oh, shine on me  â™«

175
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,600
    
 â™«  Oh, shine on me  â™«

176
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,900
   

177
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,880
   

178
00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:01,000
â™«  May the thick darkness be lifted and the bright light come to me  â™«

179
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,820
I think I'll get sick this early in the morning.

180
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,700
Excuse me, Sister-in-Law.

181
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,560
Why don't you stay with Mi Ho for a while?

182
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,400
Why?

183
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,950
The company and everything...

184
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,110
Until things calm down,

185
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,450
I think you should stay there.

186
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,500
We have a lot to take care of here. It's uncomfortable.

187
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,600
Go stay with your friend.

188
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,830
Okay. I will.

189
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,800
Eat.

190
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,800
Hi.

191
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,900
What's up with the atmosphere at work this morning?

192
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,000
Haven't you heard? Thugs stormed the conference room yesterday.

193
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,360
The thug is the CEO's father.

194
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,820
All the executives quit because they're so scared.

195
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,880
My team leader didn't show up today.

196
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,070
What's going to happen to us now?

197
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,610
I have nowhere else to go.

198
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,810
Same here...

199
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,910
Get to work!

200
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,490
Do you know what time it is? Get out of here.

201
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,580
Get out of here!

202
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,800
It's nothing, Hyungnim. They were snacking instead of working.

203
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,490
Let's go.

204
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,310
As for Little Rat...

205
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,300
Il Yeong is going to take her.

206
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,600
- How was she doing? 
 - Well, okay.

207
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,990
She was trying.

208
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,300
Jae Soo.

209
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,200
Yes, Hyungnim.

210
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,350
Am I being too greedy?

211
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,010
I tried to live an ordinary life like others.

212
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm wondering if that was wrong.

213
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,980
What's wrong with living an ordinary life like others?

214
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,600
That's a given, Hyungnim.

215
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,810
I thought I could protect her.

216
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,880
But I don't know anymore.

217
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,070
I'm not confident that I can handle this.

218
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,590
Hey, Ji Hwan. 
  (T/N: switches from polite/respectful to casual/intimate style) 

219
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm older than you.

220
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Don't you know why I call you "Hyungnim"?

221
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,900
Even when I got into trouble like a stupid dumbass,

222
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
you handled it for me.

223
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,370
You took responsibility.

224
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,620
You led us here, being responsible for all of us.

225
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,800
That's why I call you Hyungnim.

226
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Because you do things I can't.

227
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Something impossible?

228
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,730
There's no such thing. You can handle it. You can get through it.

229
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,650
You got this.

230
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,380
Why?

231
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,830
Because you're Seo Ji Hwan.

232
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,500
I heard Ji Hwan's father came to the company.

233
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,390
I heard you guys talk about it yesterday.

234
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,840
Is that why he hurt his hand?

235
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,880
Yes.

236
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,990
Why does Ji Hwan's dad do that to Ji Hwan?

237
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm not too sure, but I think he wants a different version of his son.

238
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,360
I thought a father would want his child to be happy.

239
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,930
Never mind being happy.

240
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,260
At least don't make him suffer like he is now.

241
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,500
- Take care of her. 
 - No need to tell me.

242
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,720
She lived in this house for 18 years*. 
  (T/N: sounds like a curse word in Korean) 

243
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,270
I wasn't cursing.

244
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,140
Thank you.

245
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,260
Don't worry. Go.

246
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,670
- Go. 
 - Bye.

247
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,630
- Bye. 
 - Okay.

248
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,590
Bye!

249
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,770
Go. Bye!

250
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,310
Go on.

251
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,120
Bye.

252
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,770
Go! You said you were late.

253
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,360
- Bye. 
 - Call me.

254
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,800
 Sister-in-law is at Mi Ho's. 

255
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,140
Thanks.

256
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,640
Form the executive team with trustworthy guys.

257
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,970
Pick a CEO election date within the month.

258
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,070
Got it.

259
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,570
Attorney Kang called from the police station.

260
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,020
I have something else for Attorney Kang. Tell him to come in.

261
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,610
Yang Hui needs a wake-up call.

262
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,770
- You can go. 
 - Yes, sir.

263
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,800
   

264
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,750
- Yes? 
 - Can we meet at 7 p.m. if you have time?

265
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,570
All right.

266
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,530
Yes, got it.

267
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,000
Prosecutor, Go Yang Hui, Hwang Gwang Sik, and Hwang Gwang Tae are being held in custody.

268
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,400
- Who's in charge of the case? 
 - Prosecutor Bae.

269
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,100
This is enough for search and seizure.

270
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,160
- Request their arrest warrants. 
 - Got it.

271
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,700
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

272
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,860
I know how you feel, but I think you're rushing things a bit.

273
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,660
We should cool our heads, take our timeâ€”

274
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,370
It's kidnapping and assault. How can we take our time?

275
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,330
Still, we're supposed to wait for Seo Ji Hwan to hear about whether Lee Gang Gil flipped.

276
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,910
We can't just wait.

277
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,460
If we request arrest warrants and it goes awry like last time,

278
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,890
it will only be a matter of time before Seo Tae Pyung hears about it.

279
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,770
Wait.

280
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,630
Seo Tae Pyung could've kept Go Yang Hui from being detained.

281
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,940
Why didn't he do anything?

282
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,560
Break up.

283
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,580
I know you can't break up. But break up anyway.

284
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,460
Of course, you can't. But stillâ€”

285
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,140
You weren't too scared, right?

286
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,670
If you're scared, the baby will be, too.

287
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,160
I don't want to stress you out instead of helping with prenatal care.

288
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,460
I'm glad you brought it up. Stress?

289
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,020
You don't know how stressful in-laws are, do you? I don't, either.

290
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,070
Il Yeong doesn't have a family, so I'll never know.

291
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,930
Hyo Sung, who got married a month ago?

292
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,350
She's losing her hair because of stress from her in-laws.

293
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,620
Every morning, she wakes up to a clump of hair on her pillow.

294
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,780
Think it through. Who is the enemy of hair loss?

295
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,810
Who has too many enemies and is dangerous?

296
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,110
You're right. He has many enemies and is dangerous.

297
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,990
How lonely must he be to have a father who is the most dangerous of them all?

298
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,260
I need to stand by him.

299
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,900
Fine.

300
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,120
Nobody can talk you out of this.

301
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,880
Take his side, then.

302
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,370
I'll take yours.

303
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,290
Where's the ledger?

304
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:18,200
- What ledger do you mean? 
 - Father's ledger for his slush funds.

305
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,370
- I can't tell you. 
 - Is it Sangnam Liquor?

306
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,540
I can't tell you.

307
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,700
Why do you live as one of my father's pawns?

308
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,020
I'm sure you know he can replace you at any moment.

309
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,610
I don't know how else to live.

310
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,330
I don't think that's true.

311
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,330
You just haven't tried.

312
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,380
Why didn't you join us when I asked you to come to Thirsty Deer?

313
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,670
I feel no need to, looking at you now.

314
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,740
Trying to protect something...

315
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,490
seems like even more of a hassle.

316
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,830
It's not a hassle. It's just tough to do.

317
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,670
If you give up,

318
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,200
- it'll be easier for everyone. 
 - I can't give up.

319
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,820
I still need to protect something.

320
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,750
If you change your mind, let me know.

321
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,450
Well, I can really feel the emptiness she left behind.

322
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,220
Without Sister-in-law, the house feels empty.

323
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,150
I can't remember what it was like before.

324
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,200
So we're not allowed to contact her?

325
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,110
Well, couldn't we at least ask her how she's doing?

326
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,830
Get it together, you guys.

327
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,660
She almost got kidnapped.

328
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,370
How is the word "kidnapping" part of Little Rat's life?

329
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:18,560
She went through something she shouldn't have for getting involved with people like us!

330
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,600
So what's happening with Hyung and Noona now?

331
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,180
I don't know, dude.

332
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,880
Watch your mouth in front of Hyungnim.

333
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,190
Where are you going?

334
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,160
I don't know, man.

335
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,690
â™«  Even if I don't see you  â™«

336
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,380
   

337
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:32,460
â™«  Your face keeps coming to mind  â™«

338
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,770
â™«  Still, with a heart on edge  â™«

339
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,520
   

340
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,800
 The one person I need: Seo Ji Hwan. 

341
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:49,800
â™«  But you donâ€™t seem to know  â™«

342
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,400
â™«  Will the day come  â™«

343
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:04,580
â™«  when my heart reaches you?  â™«

344
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,630
â™«  Though time passes by, itâ€™s still you for me  â™«

345
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:18,620
â™«  Please remember me this way  â™«

346
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:28,880
â™«  Now, please look at me  â™«

347
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,530
   

348
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,010
 Because of the employee exodus, 

349
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,520
we don't have enough people in the factories.

350
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,720
At this rate, production may stop altogether.

351
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,940
Send employees over from headquarters and keep up with production.

352
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,960
- Reduce the supply for a while. 
 - Got it.

353
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,510
Jae Soo, don't skimp on quality control even if we're busy.

354
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,630
Be thorough with customer feedback.

355
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,100
Got it.

356
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,970
Il Yeong, give me the distributor list Director Park used to manage.

357
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,010
I'll call them personally and explain...

358
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,880
I'll do all that.

359
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,550
Okay.

360
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,060
- Noona! 
 - Hong Gi!

361
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,970
Where are you going?

362
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,870
What is this?

363
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,830
Did you two scheme and call me up here?

364
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:41,320
Geez. Noona, why are you here? I'll get in trouble for seeing you.

365
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,500
I missed you, Hong Gi.

366
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,750
I missed you a lot, too, but...

367
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,730
- I have something I want to do with you. 
 - Sure, that could be true.

368
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,770
But you need to stay home and rest right now.

369
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,330
Staycation. That kind of thing.

370
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,380
Everyone's worried about you.

371
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,690
I know everyone's worried about me.

372
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,120
But I'm worried about everyone, too.

373
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,970
Thankfully, Ye Na is here to help. Listen to her.

374
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,120
I didn't say I'd help yet.

375
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,620
I thought you didn't like each other.

376
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,110
What is this?

377
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,610
Kids' sausage skewer challenge? 
    

378
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,640
If there's something I can do,

379
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,310
I'll try everything.

380
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,610
C-Come in.

381
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,380
So this is Seo Ji Hwan's house.

382
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,360
- More modest than I thought. 
 - What's modest about this?

383
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,120
Come, come. Get over here.

384
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,210
Are those all rooms?

385
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,670
Of course, they're rooms. What else would they be?

386
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,700
We need to film before people get here. Hurry.

387
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,310
Is Seo Ji Hwan's room on the second floor?

388
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,880
Hurry up!

389
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,190
No way.

390
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,830
Your room isn't on the second floor, is it?

391
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,430
Aigoo, we need to start filming. Let's go.

392
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,100
- To the studio. 
 - No, right?

393
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,620
The studio is in the basement.

394
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:28,560
This house isn't Seo Ji Hwan's. It's Seo Ji Hwan and Friends' house.

395
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,740
   

396
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,320
Did Seo Ji Hwan set all this up for Eun Ha?

397
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,520
I helped a little.

398
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,550
I'm too upset. I can't do this.

399
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,850
I'm leaving.

400
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,610
I didn't ask you to do this.

401
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,520
Why did you offer help anyway? It's unlike you.

402
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,330
Unni was sad, unlike herself. So I offered help, unlike myself.

403
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,050
Who's worried about whom?

404
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,140
Right, who's worried about whom?

405
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,030
I didn't expect my first visitor in prison...

406
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,570
would be the prosecutor who put me here.

407
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,450
I have nothing personal against you, Prosecutor.

408
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:36,110
Why did you hang around with that girl and get into trouble?

409
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,970
Does it hurt?

410
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,860
I'm not here because of personal feelings, either.

411
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,560
You know that, right?

412
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,470
The day Seo Ji Hwan got out, Seo Tae Pyung came down to the police station.

413
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,930
You don't know that, do you?

414
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:56,430
At first, I thought he was there to get you.

415
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,190
But he had just come to see Seo Ji Hwan and left.

416
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,680
As if he doesn't care about you at all.

417
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,020
So I warned you before.

418
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,940
The figurehead might get blamed for everything.

419
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,520
So...

420
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,990
doesn't it feel unfair to take the fall all by yourself?

421
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,040
No matter how unfair it might be,

422
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,790
I'm not stupid enough to offer bait to the prosecutor who locked me up.

423
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,560
Or maybe you don't have any bait.

424
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,870
Well,

425
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,450
I thought you might not.

426
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,610
Looks like Seo Tae Pyung...

427
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,320
has Lee Gang Gil take care of everything important.

428
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,950
By the way,

429
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,440
does it hurt?

430
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,580
 If you give up, it'll be easier for everyone. 

431
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,170
 I can't give up. 

432
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,700
 I still need to protect something. 

433
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,480
 If you change your mind, let me know. 

434
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,580
Noona, if we get a lot of views on this, it'll be great.

435
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,240
Yeah, it'll be great.

436
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,780
With Ye Na, we'll get a lot of views.

437
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,570
With Ye Na's help, we'll at least get two or three million.

438
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,460
Hyung.

439
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,130
CEO...

440
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,020
We were on our way out.

441
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,190
You're out of the office early.

442
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,820
What happened was... Eun Ha...

443
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,540
wanted to lift the company atmosphere.

444
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,240
She came up with a lot of ideas. Her proposal was great.

445
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,250
Oh, you know challen... challenges, right?

446
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,880
Someone posts a video, and others follow. It's a trend.

447
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,810
Ye Na also offered to help.

448
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,350
As the Marketing Team Leader, I couldn't just do nothing.

449
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,920
We have a studio and everything, so...

450
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,500
Ye Na has other things on her schedule. Let me take her.

451
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,750
What things?

452
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,970
You have other things. Let's go.

453
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,720
- Dong Hee. 
 - Yes.

454
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,520
Take her home.

455
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,100
You can go. I'll take her.

456
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,000
- I'll be at the office. 
 - Okay.

457
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,560
Let's go.

458
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,810
Why do you keep telling me to go? Do you hate seeing me that much?

459
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,060
You told me I could stay here. You told me I was family.

460
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,500
Are you never going to see me again? Can you live with that?

461
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,770
You said you'd always be by my side. You just said that.

462
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,790
I'm scared.

463
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,170
I pretend like I'm fine in front of others, but I'm scared.

464
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,360
Not because of what happened to me.

465
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,720
Because you're not by my side when I'm scared.

466
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,830
I'm scared you'll never be by my side again.

467
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,170
Let's go.

468
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,170
I don't want to be somewhere safe alone. Why don't you get that?

469
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,580
I want to be with you wherever it is. Why don't you get that?

470
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,990
â™«  Faint stars in the night sky  â™«

471
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:28,860
â™«  You, who always seemed out of reach  â™«

472
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,860
â™«  Your gaze...  â™«

473
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,790
The incident at the park was really scary, right?

474
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,940
It's okay.

475
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,830
Never again.

476
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,160
That will never happen again. I promise.

477
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,680
Oh, yeah. I have ointment.

478
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,570
â™«  You came back again  â™«

479
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:58,160
â™«  I donâ€™t want to let you go  â™«

480
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:05,110
â™«  In my dream every day  â™«

481
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,850
â™«  I want to be with you in every moment  â™«

482
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,400
I think I was fearful and anxious...

483
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,600
that you'd get hurt because of me. That I might lose you.

484
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,720
â™«  I'll always be there for you  â™«

485
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,430
Do you think you could wait a little longer for me?

486
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,860
â™«  Forever  â™«

487
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,960
I'll wait for you.

488
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,800
Make sure you eat.

489
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,630
Okay. You, too.

490
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,150
Get plenty of sleep.

491
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,110
You, too.

492
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,220
Go.

493
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,160
I'll watch you get inside.

494
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,400
   

495
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,800
- Hey. 
  - The ledger is in the Sangnam Liquor office safe. 

496
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,280
The password...

497
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,940
is the date Bulldog Gang was formed.

498
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,050
   

499
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,620
Did you know our company is hot right now because of the sausage challenge video?

500
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,390
Of course, I know. So hot.

501
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,520
- Should we do it together? 
 - Let me get the sausage.

502
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,090
- I'm joking. 
 - Hey, I'm the face of the company. I'll represent us.

503
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,530
When I do the challenge, it's over.

504
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,950
Stop being so transparent.

505
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:00,980
Challenge?

506
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,990
 Oh, you know challen... challenges, right? 

507
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:08,550
 Someone posts a video, and others follow. It's a trend. 

508
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,930
 I put broccoli and peppers on mine like Ye Na Unni. 

509
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,000
    
 Ta-da! It's done!

510
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,640
    
 Ta-da! It's done!

511
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,270
I didn't think it'd go together, but it did. So we're surprised.

512
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,680
Hi everyone, I'm actor Kim Do Hoon.

513
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,800
I saw that the kids' sausage challenge was popular these days.

514
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,560
I prepared to do the challenge myself.

515
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,560
Can you see it? This is my meal skewer.

516
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,190
What? This is good.

517
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,800
   

518
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,340
   

519
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,740
   

520
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,360
Ye Na...

521
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,360
 - Ye Na Unni... 
 - And Eun Ha Unni are here together for... 

522
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,380
- A special kids sausage... 
 - Skewer...

523
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,440
 Challenge! 

524
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,650
Let's start!

525
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,920
Wow! We'll put on the things we want to eat, one by one.

526
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,940
Eun Ha Unni picked a cherry tomato first.

527
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,830
Ye Na Unni likes vegetables, so I'll try that first.

528
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,860
Put the sausage on.

529
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,420
Yellow tomatoes, grapes...

530
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,230
Ta-da! Eun Ha Unni's looks like a traffic light, right?

531
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,430
Red light, orange light, green light!

532
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,650
Ye Na Unni made a cute person!

533
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,400
Should we take a bite?

534
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,750
The sausage is...

535
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,520
sweet and salty!

536
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,720
 I never knew fruit and sausage went so well together! 

537
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,900
 Sausage and fruit are a good match. 

538
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,450
 - I learned that today!  
 - You're already watching it.

539
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,710
 I had a bite of the pepper... 

540
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,490
 and it's so crunchy and sweet. 

541
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,100
Did you know about this?

542
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:04,070
Sister-in-law found the right time to breathe some energy into us.

543
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:08,740
Our client responses have been positive. Moreover, the employee morale is up.

544
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,960
People want to rally and work hard.

545
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,020
   

546
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,200
Is it that fun?

547
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,620
Team Leader, isn't it fun?

548
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,640
I filmed one. Want to see?

549
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,340
- Let's see. 
 - It's really cute.

550
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,130
Got it, let me see.

551
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,010
One second.

552
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,330
- Hello? 
  - Hey. 

553
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,150
 It's me. 

554
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,980
If you don't want to cause a scene at the company,

555
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,630
get over here quietly.

556
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,370
I'm headed out.

557
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,720
 Ta-da! It's done! 

558
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,980
 Let's take a big bite. 

559
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,680
What's this necklace? I haven't seen it before.

560
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,650
Look at this. Someone put kimchi and chocolate together.

561
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,050
I'm looking at the necklace.

562
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,710
   

563
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,570
The Prosecutor is calling me.

564
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,680
Go ahead.

565
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,560
Okay. See you later.

566
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,930
Yes, Prosecutor.

567
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,700
Eun Ha.

568
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,640
How is it staying over there?

569
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,420
I'm good.

570
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,210
How's your head?

571
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:41,060
The gauze is off. It's better.

572
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,400
That's a relief.

573
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,230
Is the family all at work?

574
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,990
Yes. Mi Ho just left, so I'm by myself.

575
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,470
 I'm going to open the doors and clean up. 

576
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,680
I see.

577
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,510
So you don't have any other plans?

578
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,440
Other plans? I have a lot.

579
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,290
- A lot? 
 - Of course.

580
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:07,590
I need to prepare dinner, wash my shoes, and...

581
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,690
So don't worry about me.

582
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,050
Got it. I won't bother you any longer.

583
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,710
 Prosecutor. 

584
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,590
Yes?

585
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,610
Don't get hurt.

586
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,460
Okay. I won't.

587
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,670
Bye, Eun Ha.

588
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,410
Prosecutor.

589
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,160
You look like you're very moved and about to cry.

590
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,900
Oh, wait, here...

591
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,520
   

592
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,180
You have a secret.

593
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,270
As expected, Go Yang Hui paid bail and will be released at 4 p.m.

594
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:09,140
Really? We asked to track his location, right?

595
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,390
Yes.

596
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,990
We can't lose him.

597
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,110
 You'll wear this electronic ankle bracelet 24/7 while you're out on bail. 

598
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:29,370
 If you run or fail to appear when summoned, your bail will be revoked, and you will be arrested. 

599
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,320
   

600
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:43,400
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

601
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,880
What do you mean you're giving Bulldog Gang to Seo Ji Hwan?

602
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,640
I've worked under you for 15 years! W-Why?

603
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,420
Why not me? Why Seo Ji Hwan?

604
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,800
Because I'm not your birth son?

605
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,890
Ji Hwan is the only one who can lead the Bulldog Gang.

606
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,390
Help him out.

607
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,070
Hyungnim.

608
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,410
A child who betrays me twice...

609
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,500
can't be left alone.

610
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,040
Please spare his life, Hyungnim.

611
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,990
Hyungnim.

612
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,020
Ji Hwan...

613
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,590
Please forgive him, Hyungnim.

614
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:22,320
Hyungnim, punish me instead. Kill me instead.

615
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,390
Hyungnim!

616
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,410
Did you explain to her parents why we postponed the family introduction?

617
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:33,670
Yes. They understand what's going on with the company.

618
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,490
Okay.

619
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:41,170
It's great that her parents are such good people.

620
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,960
   

621
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,460
   

622
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,800
Even if...

623
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,710
I'm not here, you'll take care of the company. So I'm not worried.

624
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:09,550
As you know, our employees have nowhere else to go.

625
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,120
If the company goes down, they have no options. Take care of them.

626
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,720
You're here, CEO.

627
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,250
When I'm not here.

628
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:40,070
Seo Tae Pyung and Go Yang Hui remind me of the saying, "Killing a dog after the hunt is over."

629
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,900
When he was in jail, he made him watch the safe.

630
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,200
And now that he's scheming big, he's sick of a dog that barks too much and cuts him out.

631
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,700
That's Seo Tae Pyung for you.

632
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,600
Seo Tae Pyung only wanted Seo Ji Hwan from the beginning.

633
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,800
Whether it's a father's love gone wayward, competitiveness, or his pride,

634
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,250
he won't stop on his own.

635
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,390
I'm scared as someone who loves peace.

636
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,700
Does one of them have to die for this to end?

637
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:11,990
   

638
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:18,970
Yes, Seo Ji Hwan.

639
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:21,360
 I'm in front of Sangnam Liquor. 

640
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,490
What?

641
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:24,530
Please send the police in 30 minutes.

642
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,590
 I'll bring out a dual ledger that can bring Seo Tae Pyung down. 

643
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:32,540
I know data obtained illegally can't be entered as evidence. But if you arrest me,

644
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,600
the evidence can be used.

645
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,810
Wait, Seo Ji Hwan. W-What are you saying? This is reckless!

646
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,300
Thank you for everything.

647
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,200
 Hey, Seo Ji Hwan! Seo Ji Hwan! 

648
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,540
   

649
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,560
 The phone is turned off. After the tone... 

650
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,910
What's going on, Prosecutor?

651
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,630
Seo Ji Hwan is at Sangnam Liquor.

652
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,510
Please request backup.

653
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,340
Got it.

654
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,800
Tell them not to arrest him but to stand by.

655
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,970
   

656
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,110
   

657
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,900
Are you here to take this?

658
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:38,580
If that's what you want, take it.

659
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,300
Let him go. He's not involved in this.

660
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,300
I'm the one you want anyway, right?

661
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:53,800
If you agree to live as my son,

662
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,600
I'll let him go.

663
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:15,390
Or you can try taking him with your own force.

664
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:19,950
You remember the way to get out, right?

665
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:41,600
There's only one way to get out.

666
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,400
 Knock down your opponent. 

667
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,500
 If you want to survive, you must kill others. 

668
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,400
 If you don't, you'll die. 

669
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,350
Jae Soo.

670
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,800
Father.

671
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,920
In the past,

672
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,030
I used to be afraid of you.

673
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:51,990
So I thought I had to follow everything you said.

674
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,750
But it's not like that now.

675
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,400
I will never...

676
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,600
I'll never ever follow your orders.

677
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,000
As long as you make up your mind,

678
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,400
you can leave.

679
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,400
Your mistake is that you were so busy watching Seo Ji Hwan...

680
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,330
that you never saw me.

681
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,150
Chairman!

682
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,580
Eun Ha...

683
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,680
 I'll wait for you. 

684
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,640
 Hyun Woo Oppa. 

685
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,800
I'm going to come get you...

686
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,650
Eun Ha.

687

 - Sister-in-Law! 

692
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,600
 I will never leave you. 

693
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,700
 It's okay now. I'll be by your side. 

694
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,600
 Eun Ha, thank you for always playing with me. 

695
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,290
 He won't stay in a coma, right? He'll wake up, right? 

696
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,700
 Think of what the CEO would want. 

697
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,500
 Would he want us to stay by his side and worry? 

698
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,200
 Or bravely go out there and do our jobs?
