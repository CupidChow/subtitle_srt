4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,890
   

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,430
♫  Baby, baby, let me come along  ♫

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,540
♫  Every single day I belong  ♫

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,500
♫  Baby, baby, let me come along  ♫

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,590
♫  Keep you happy all day long  ♫

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,240
   

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,250
Look, a plane!

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:57,950


12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,570
Those people must be happy, right?

13
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,330
Looking down from the clouds.

14
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,020
Is the person down here...

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,570
happy?

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,560
Well...

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,170
right now, a little.

18
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,350
Keep making your videos.

19
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,220
What?

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,340
Your videos.

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,420
Keep making them.

22
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,530
Are you talking about "Play with Mini"?

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,190
I told you I'm taking a leave of absence.

24
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,360
Even so, keep making them.

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,090
How? I'm on a leave of absence.

26
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,590
What should I do?

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,760
Why?

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,730
Because...

29
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,020
I...

30
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,680
miss watching them.

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,440
My gosh, it's late. I should get home.

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,850
Mini.

33
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,310
You're heavier than you look.

34
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,800
Hold on.

35
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,290
Why are your legs so long?

36
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,210
Aren't you going home?

37
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,510
Let's go!

38
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,410
Aren't you getting a call?

39
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,580
   

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,700
How did he get so drunk after one drink?

41
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,670
I don't know. He drank to his potential.

42
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,770
What? His potential?

43
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,090
His potential for turning cute after drinking.

44
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,020
One glass is more than enough.

45
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,260
Oh, really.

46
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,990
Come with us. I'll take you home.

47
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,340
No. I've sobered up.

48
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,990
My house is nearby.

49
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,450
Well, then.

50
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,030
Take care.

51
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,220
Il Yeong...

52
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,460
Yes, Hyungnim.

53
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,150
I had a good time today.

54
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,340
It must've been nice to have some fun away from work.

55
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,570
I'm...

56
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,350
really happy.

 I'll make sure you're safe. 

68
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,040
 Transform! Flash mob! 

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,900
 My neck. 

70
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,280
 I... 

71
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,840
 miss watching them. 

72
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,430
 I miss watching them. 

73
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,990
I should have given it to him yesterday.

74
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,010
 Let me know whenever you need a ride. 

75
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,180
 I'll take you on a drive. 

76
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,550
   

77
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,400
It wasn't his card?

78
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,220
Shit! Why did I do that?

79
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,780
Have I gone insane?

80
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,950
Wait...

81
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,540
Was there a drug in my Sprite?

82
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,090
That's why I was drunk! She saw everything!

83
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,840
What else did we do? Were we on the swings? Flash mob...

84
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,700
What else?

85
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,350
   

86
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,870
- Hey. 
  - Why don't you pick up the phone? 

87
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,800
We're ready for the meeting. Come down.

88
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,920
Okay.

89
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,020
 Did you get home okay last night? 

90
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,920
 I didn't get to return your jacket. 

91
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,460
 When's good for you? 

92
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,660
Not that way.

93
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,540
This way.

94
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,390
   

95
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,580
Thank you.

96
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,940
How did he know?

97
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,820
Go Eun Ha.

98
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,790
Over here.

99
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,650
Me?

100
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,490
Yes. Come on in.

101
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,710
   

102
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,810
   

103
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,570
   

104
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,590
   

105
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,460
Did you have a hard time finding your way?

106
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,760
No, not at all.

107
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,780
Is your name really Jang Hyun Woo?

108
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,780
Yes, I'm Jang Hyun Woo.

109
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,750
That's your real name? You didn't change it?

110
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,740
Yes.

111
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,730
I see.

112
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,420
Can we start the interview now?

113
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,100
Your name is...

114
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,600
Go Eun Ha. 
    

115
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,930
Your age is thirty—

116
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,470
How about you, Prosecutor?

117
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,990
- Excuse me? 
 - How old are you?

118
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,500
I was born in 1988.

119
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,830
You're 36?

120
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,100
Was being a prosecutor your childhood dream?

121
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,600
Ms. Go Eun Ha, I'm sorry, but...

122
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm supposed to be the one asking questions.

123
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,100
Well, you can just respond.

124
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,370
Okay.

125
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,710
Go ahead.

127
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,800
Okay, let's continue.

128
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Your address is...

129
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,380
We're good on your identity.

130
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:11,360
On March 20th at Club Cat, you reported Seo Ji Hwan to the police for assault.

131
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,690
My friend called the police. I just put handcuffs—

132
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,900
Did you use to be in our line of work?

133
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,300
- Pardon? 
 - Do you happen...

134
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,900
to remember the faces of the people there?

135
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,760
 The employee who fell... 

136
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,890
 She's a cop! 

137
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,220
 and Seo Ji Hwan. 

138
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,800
And...

139
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,130
Oh, there was a guy with a scar on his face.

140
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Him?

141
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,120
Oh, yes. That's him.

142
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,250
This man and Seo Ji Hwan.

143
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,850
Do you know what they were talking about?

144
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,970
When I got there, everything was already happening.

145
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,220
Honestly, I didn't see much.

146
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,800
Seo Ji Hwan was holding a broken bottle, so I misunderstood.

147
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,920
Excuse me, but do you and Seo Ji Hwan know each other well?

148
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,710
- Pardon? 
 - You say his name so comfortably.

149
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,960
I just happened to see him a few times since that night.

150
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,800
I heard you had a negative involvement with Thirsty Deer over a video.

151
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,360
Did you experience any retaliation or blackmail afterward?

152
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,240
I guess prosecutors know everything. You know about that, too?

153
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,310
No, nothing like that.

154
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,620
That was also over a misunderstanding.

155
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,290
It may not have been a misunderstanding.

156
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,310
That day might have been, but that can't be said for the other days.

157
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,070
They have records.

158
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,300
What I mean by that is that one day,

159
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,100
something did happen.

160
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,900
Man Ho, what is our company's motto?

161
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
From bone to flesh!

162
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,300
Yes, "From bone to flesh."

163
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,900
"Bone Flesh" for short.

164
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,440
Very good. It's good, but it's too harsh!

165
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,500
Our branding is too harsh.

166
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:14,420
We need to clean up our brand and make it seem friendlier to children.

167
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,100
That's one way to distinguish us. For example,

168
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,000
a model like Kang Ye Na...

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,150
could help register our product as "Kang Ye Na's sausage,"

170
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,140
rather than Thirsty Deer's.

171
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,120
Register...

172
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,910
So...

173
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,310
I mean, I guess it's a stretch.

174
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,600
Then we could open a kids' channel.

175
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,600
We're planning on a series of videos on cooking our products.

176
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,440
But in reality...

177
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,990
Did you get home okay last night?

178
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,400
Aigoo, yes... what...

179
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,460
I— I got home safe, shamefully.

180
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,420
I'm sorry. I should have taken you home, but... Oh, my God...

181
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,260
What about your jacket?

182
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,360
When can I get it back to you?

183
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,930
My jacket? Right, my jacket.

184
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,220
If you let me know your address, I could go pick it up.

185
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,710
It might make you uncomfortable, or you could feel pressured to share your address.

186
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,690
What should we do then?

187
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,620
Then we could meet in the middle somewhere?

188
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,410
We could meet again in the middle somewhere?

189
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,890
If you're too scared if I said to come that far, I mean, not scared...

190
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:51,200
That's right, I'm sorry. Not scared, I mean it's too heavy.

191
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,500
That was my marketing plan for the kids' sausage.

192
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,970
I should ask her how she's doing first...

193
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,950
I'll try that...

194
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,810
CEO?

195
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,000
CEO?

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,530
- Huh? What? 
 - He's done presenting.

197
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,200
Oh, sure.

198
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,860
Great work, Hong Gi. Good job.

199
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,470
Good job. You can go.

200
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,800
   

201
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,790
Fk?

202
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,320
Wait. This—

203
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,920
Why did that—

204
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,010
No! No! No!

205
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,420
I think we're good on the interview.

206
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,810
I didn't give you my card.

207
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,780
If you think of anything else, get in touch anytime.

208
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,650
Okay.

209
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,650
Thank you.

210
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,430
Oh, be careful.

211
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,070
Slowly.

212
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,840
Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo.

213
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,730
Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo.

214
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,620
 Oppa, what's your dream? 

215
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,500
 When I... 

216
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,600
 grow up, I'll become a prosecutor. 

217
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,540
 Really? That's awesome. 

218
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,260
Are you okay?

219
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,360
Prosecutor.

220
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,680
This umbrella.

221
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,340
   

222
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,840
Do you remember?

223
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,820
 Take it. You'll catch a cold. 

224
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,940
 I have another. 

225
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,460
My gosh! You're the guy who got dumped!

226
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,640
What?

227
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,850
That was you? Wow!

228
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,670
This is so neat! Did you get home okay that night?

229
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,910
 Get home safe. 

230
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,020
 Take this. You'll catch a cold. 

231
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,110
 - You didn't bring your car? 
 - Oh, no. 

232
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,260
 I'll be going, then. 

233
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,490
 To be clear, I'm the one rejecting you. 

234
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,790
Yes. Thanks to you.

235
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,840
Thank goodness!

236
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
It would've been so sad if you had to get wet on top of getting rejected.

237
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,860
I wasn't rejected.

238
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,790
It happens! We can't be everyone's type.

239
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,670
I think you've misunderstood. I don't get rejected.

240
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,460
Did you bring it because you knew I was coming?

241
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,830
How did you know it was me?

242
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,870
Did you subscribe to my channel?

243
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,340
I mean, I don't watch it religiously, but...

244
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,990
Did you ever leave a comment?

245
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,430
Because I have most of the usernames memorized.

246
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,770
"Justice." Is that you?

247
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,250
 Defamation and contempt are prohibited under South Korean criminal law. 

248
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,850
 They are subject to criminal punishment. 

249
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,640
 So think before you leave a comment. 

250
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,280
 Justice? 

251
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,910
No, you wouldn't pick such an obvious username.

252
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,280
Anyway, amazing.

253
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,670
"Justice"?

254
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,190
No.

255
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,300
I have to go now.

256
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,950
- Prosecutor! 
 - It wasn't me.

257
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,500
You told me to get in touch if I remembered anything else.

258
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,990
Actually, I have a question.

259
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,240
What is it?

260
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
One second.

261
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,100
Yes, Chief Oh.

262
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,030
Right now?

263
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,030
Got it.

264
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,330
I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.

265
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,850
Can I hear it over the phone later? I'll give you a call.

266
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,010
Okay.

267
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,810
And...

268
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,410
this is a gift from me. Make sure you use it.

269
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,270
- A gift? 
 - Yes.

270
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,840
Okay.

271
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,710
I'll call you.

272
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,820
   

273
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,970
Fk...

274
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,120
F...

275
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,920
   

276
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,240
   

277
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,840
   

278
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,080
   

279
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,460
   

280
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,850
   

281
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,780
   

282
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,820
 Hello. 

283
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,050
Okay.

284
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,140
- Hello? 
 - Oh, hello.

285
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,300
I, um, I made a mistake.

286
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
What?

287
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,240
The text I just sent was a mistake.

288
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
Don't read it. Just delete it.

289
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
 What are you doing right now? 

290
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,310
I'm sorry. I— I don't know what I'm doing.

291
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,930
 Excuse me, this is my place. I live here. 

292
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,960
I'm at work.

293
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,200
 Why are you taking my stuff out? 

294
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,400
Hello?

295
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,100
- You live here? 
 - Yes.

296
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,800
I was told to get the stuff out of here today.

297
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,820
- Who says? 
 - Your CEO.

298
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,760
CEO, what is going on?

299
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,590
Eun Ha.

300
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,310
- What's today's date? 
 - The 10th.

301
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,850
What was the date from today, a year ago?

302
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,680
The 10th.

303
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,240
Exactly a year ago,

304
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,280
you and Macaron Soft signed a contract.

305
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,330
And as of today, that contract has expired.

306
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,650
Then...

307
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,950
are you firing—

308
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,080
You're not a gun. How could I fire you?

309
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,440
You can just return your key...

310
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,340
and walk out like any other day.

311
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,660
Were you planning to let me go?

312
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,710
Not from the start.

313
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,950
No one knows from the start if something's doenjang or shit. 
  (T/N: fermented soybean paste) 

314
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,060
Of course. I'd be a shaman if I knew.

315
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,730
Things reveal themselves with time.

316
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,150
It's fit for a lettuce wrap or to be thrown into a toilet...

317
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,610
and flushed.

318
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,460
So you think I'm shit?

319
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,470
Well I mean you jumped into the toilet yourself,

320
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,890
so you're shit.

321
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,120
That's the conclusion I came to.

322
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,130
It's been nice.

323
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,170
Bye.

324
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,320
Really?

325
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,480
"Bye"?

326
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,460
"Bye"?

327
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,960
Wait, CEO. CEO! CEO!

328
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,300
That was insulting.

329
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,200
If he didn't like it, he should have just said so.

330
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,930
He was ripping up paper the entire meeting with that scary look!

331
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,850
Am I supposed to move forward or not?

332
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,690
Hello.

333
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,740
Hello, Marketing Team Leader Yang Hong Gi.

334
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,120
This is Kang Ye Na.

335
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,270
Kang Ye Na from where?

336
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,510
There are lots of Kang Ye Nas in the country—

337
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,630
Wait, Kang Ye Na?

338
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,700
CEO, how can you do this during my leave?

339
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,650
Eun Ha. If you're on leave...

340
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,160
Can we have lunch tomorrow?

341
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,020
Still, you can't just do this—

342
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,810
Producer Lee! Get out of here!

343
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,190
- Wait, Producer Lee. 
 - Eun Ha!

344
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,560
Stop it! The CEO must have his reasons!

345
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,990
I didn't even get to say bye to the kids! CEO!

346
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,140
She was let go from the company and got kicked out of her housing.

347
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,960
What about her family?

348
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,840
- They don't live in Seoul? 
 - I don't know the details,

349
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,750
but she lives alone in Seoul.

350
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,840
 What? 

351
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,740
Aren't you at your shop?

352
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,740
It's my dad's birthday, so I closed the shop early.

353
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,450
It's your dad's birthday?

354
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,020
Tell Eun Ha to come eat.

355
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,320
 We have tons of food. 

356
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,420
Let's have a drink together!

357
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,500
He's had a couple of bottles already. He's in a great mood.

358
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,490
 Let me talk to her! 

359
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,310
What's going on?

360
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,770
I had no idea it was his birthday. It's nothing.

361
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,280
- Please congratulate him double for me. 
  - What? 

362
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,330
I can't hear you! I'll call you back later!

363
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,150
Okay.

364
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,310
What should we eat?

365
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,670
- Hamburgers! 
 - Hamburgers! And?

366
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,740
- And cake! 
 - Cake!

367

368

 ♫  Uncertain of where to go next  ♫

371

 Are you tired? Should we slow down? 

372
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,010
 Yeah. 

373
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:22,740
♫  My cherished dreams that I longed for dearly  ♫

374

♫  Was I heading towards dreams I couldn’t reach?  ♫

♫  Was I heading towards dreams I couldn’t reach?  ♫

378
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,910
It's still here.

379
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,180
 - It's hot, be careful.  
  - Thank you.

♫  In my long, endless nights, will morning ever come?  ♫

 ♫  In my long, endless nights, will morning ever come?  ♫

382
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
 Here. You eat the big one. 

383
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,250
 - Thank you.  
  - It's hot, blow on it.

 Oppa! 

390
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,570
 I'm here. 

391
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,540
 Hyun Woo oppa! 

392
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,660
 Oppa! 

393
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,940
 What happened, Eun Ha? 

394
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,060
 Are you okay? 

395
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,300
 Let's go inside. 

396
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,610
 Oppa! 

397
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,500
 Come on. 

398
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,010
 It's okay. It's okay. 

399
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,290
 Listen to me. 

400
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,440
 From now on, 

401
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,190
 we're playing hide and seek. 

402
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,370
 So don't come out until I come get you. 

403
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,160
 - Okay?  
  - Yeah. 

404
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,660
   

405
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,630
It's closed off.

406
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,580
Seo Ji Hwan?

407
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,380
Wait, Mini?

408
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,160
CEO, why are you here?

409
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,610
Mini, why are you...

410
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,500
Wait. Take this first.

411
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,430
You're soaked.

412
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,570
- Thank you. 
 - I'll take that.

413
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,830
I used it as an umbrella.

414
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,810
It's wrapped up, so it shouldn't be wet.

415
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,980
I tied it really tightly.

416
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,660
It doesn't matter.

417
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,720
For a trip!

418
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,190
I'm going on a trip. Then it started raining,

419
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,700
so I was trying to stop somewhere.

420
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,700
- Do you live around here? 
 - Yes, here.

421
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,410
- This house? 
 - Yes.

422
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,770
- Since when? 
 - I moved in eight years ago.

423
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,470
Eight years...

424
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,750
You moved here.

425
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,500
How could it be...

426
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,930
this house?

427
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,340
Thank you. I'll be going now.

428
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,970
Mini.

429
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,250
This is expensive...

430
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,440
so I need to check if the stains are all gone.

431
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,610
Come in for a second.

432
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,630
For a second.

433
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,710
- I'm sorry. 
 - No problem.

434
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,750
Thank goodness.

435
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,250
Got it.

436
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,580
I'll get going.

437
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,040
What did he say? Did he find her?

438
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,780
Where is she?

439
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,210
Is she okay?

440
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,840
You don't need to worry. She's with our CEO.

441
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,950
With the CEO...

442
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,210
Thank goodness.

443
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,800
When you say CEO, do you mean that man from last time?

444
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,600
I know he looks scary, but you can trust him.

445
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,830
When someone close says they're trustworthy,

446
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,920
it makes me trust them less.

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,900
Are you his right arm?

448
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,540
Well, you could say that.

449
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,100
Are you...

450
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,740
also...

451
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,300
An ex-con?

452
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,420
No, but basically, yes.

453
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,500
"I had alcohol but didn't drink and drive."

454
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,220
I had alcohol and did drive drunk.

455
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,900
- I just got lucky and didn't get caught. 
 - Why?

456
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,000
That's not being lucky.

457
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,600
You should get caught and face the consequences. Then you'll never do it again.

458
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,810
You're right.

459
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,900
Forgive me. It's pouring. Go on in.

460
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,430
Have you...

461
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,300
eaten?

462
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,720
Did I eat?

463
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,100
You must not have had a chance to eat all day.

464
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,520
Have some food.

465
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,200
We had a party, so we have a ton of leftover food.

466
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,600
I hadn't really thought about it.

467
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,100
Do you need to think to eat?

468
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,800
Don't you eat when it's time to eat?

469
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,600
Well, fine. If you're interested,

470
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,000
come by next time.

471
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,020
All right, then.

472
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,960
Bye, now.

473
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,960
   

474
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,940
   

475
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,260
 Mini Unni, you have to come back! 

476
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,830
 Mini Unni, I miss you! Come back soon! 

477
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,990
 Mini Unni, I love you! 

478
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,140
 Mini Noona, fighting! 

479

 Mini Unni, I'll wait for you. 

480
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,730
 - I'll be rooting for you.  
  - Come back soon. 

481
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,300
 - Mini Unni, fighting!  
  - Mini Unni, sending you strength! 

482
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,500
 My friends, it's Mini Unni. 

483
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,790
 Today, we're going to play with sand. 

484
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,400
 Yay! Fun! 

485
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,760
 Fill it all the way up, press it well... 

486
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,180
 Oh, no, I messed it up!

♫  Soothe my weary day  ♫

488

 Eun Ha, something came up. I have to go. 

489
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,040
 Okay, see you later! 

490
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,010
 Good work. 

491
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,830
 See you later! 

492
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,780
 Eun Ha, wrap up quickly, please. 

493
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,100
 Yes, yes. 

494
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,750
 Let's set up before Ye Na gets here. 

495
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,840
♫  When I feel alone  ♫

496

 Why don't you want to promote makeup toys? 

497
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,430
 Eun Ha, Eun Ha. Lower. 

498
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,950
 Right. Let me do it again. 

499
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,250
 I'll eat you, little pig! Ahjussi, why... 

500
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,210
 - Eun Ha! You broke the sign. 
 - Let me do it again. 

501
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,170
 Let's go again. Focus! 

502
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,130
♫  The time that feels like a lie  ♫

503
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,530
 My daughter was a fan of yours. 

504
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,740
 Thank you for playing with my child all this time. 

505
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,050
 - Look. It came out so great.  
  - Where?   

506
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:48,760
 High-five!  
 ♫  At the end of this road  ♫

507
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,040
♫  May the thick darkness be lifted  ♫

508
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:01,330
♫  and the bright light come to me  ♫

509
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:04,370
   

510
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,380
♫  The lonely sunset shines on me  ♫

511
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,200
 I lost my confidence. 

512
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,730
I didn't ask if she was okay.

513
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,800
♫  When I feel alone  ♫

514
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,020
 Actually, I have a question. 

515
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,830
♫  Lights of the past  ♫

516
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,330
♫  Warmly  ♫

517
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,130
   

518
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,690
   

519
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:41,130
♫  I want to see the light, wake me up from my tiredness  ♫

520
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:49,310
♫  Push away the time that feels like a lie  ♫

521
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:56,680
♫  Oh, shine on me at the end of this road  ♫

522
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,060
♫  May the thick darkness be lifted  ♫

523
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,010
♫  and the bright light come to me  ♫

524
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,600
 She was let go from the company and got kicked out of her housing. 

525
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,800
 What about her family? They don't live in Seoul? 

526
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,550
 I don't know the details, but she lives alone in Seoul. 

527
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,220
So...

528
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,800
you have a pretty big house.

529
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,330
A few of us live together, so...

530
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,970
Oh, there are others?

531
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,630
I only saw one toothbrush.

532
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,100
Six of us live together.

533
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,340
Are you married?

534
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,720
- No. 
 - Right.

535
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,000
Thank you.

536
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,600
Excuse me.

537
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,040
If it's okay with you...

538
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,960
- ramen... 
 - What?

539
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,630
Do you want some before you go?

540
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,810
- How about some ramen? 
 - Ramen?

541
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,400
It's raining, and...

542
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,700
Ramen is good.

543
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
Ramen.

544
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,570
Hyun Woo Oppa...

545
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,340
Hyun Woo Oppa...

546
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,540
Do I really need to pick up food?

547
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,850
The weather report didn't mention rain.

548
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,920
You can never write down the weather in your diary. It'll change anyway.

549
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,720
This was so embarrassing.

550
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,860
This is not a real umbrella. It's half of one.

551
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,990
Did you take that outside?

552
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,930
I had to. At least to get my head covered.

553
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,040
If you don't need this, can I give it to my daughter?

554
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,150
She likes doing kendo with umbrellas.

555
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,090
All our umbrellas break.

556
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,640
Chief Oh.

557
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,600
Yes, sir.

558
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,440
Do you remember the grandmother convicted of theft...

559
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,300
for taking her neighbor's bicycle last year?

560
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
Did that happen?

561
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,600
Well, she used it and gave it back to the owner,

562
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,400
but she was punished for the intention of illegally taking someone else's property.

563
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,050
Don't you remember?

564
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,740
I think I might remember.

565
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,890
But why?

566
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,600
Well, do you remember or not?

567
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,900
I think I might or might not.

568
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,700
You might or might not... What does that mean? It's a yes or no.

569
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,040
That's how I feel.

570
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,040
How does someone so slow investigate anything?

571
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,900
Please get me the materials I asked for.

572
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,490
I'll buy Sol an umbrella. A sturdy one for kendo.

573
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,250
You should have said something.

574
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,840
I wondered why you were watching kids' videos and obsessed with a kids' umbrella.

575
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,520
I guessed correctly, right?

576
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,930
Guessed what?

577
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,230
You have a new nephew.

578
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,400
This is why I like you, Chief. You're quick.

579
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,660
I got to where I am because I'm quick.

580
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,150
I hope you get married and become a dad soon...

581
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,630
so we can get off on time.

582
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,730
Okay. I'll do my best. Just for you, Chief.

583
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,050
What is this?

584
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,870
Jung Yoon Taek worked at Thirsty Deer after leaving prison, and he disappeared.

585
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,830
Seo Ji Hwan is looking for him.

586
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:15,860
If the man Seo Ji Hwan confronted at Club Cat is Lee Gang Gil, Go Yang Hui's subordinate,

587
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,870
there are clearly drugs involved.

588
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,500
That's right. There are a lot of rumors in Go Yang Hui's camp.

589
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,450
    
 We need to find Jung Yoon Taek first.

590
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,720
Where am I?

591
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,910
Wait a minute...

592
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,700
Yes! My boy! Wow! Nice!

593
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,130
Smells amazing.

594
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,990
Fermented just right.

595
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,070
No, no.

596
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,140
It's spicy. Go away.

597
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,580
   

598
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,160
A guest in this house? Do you know who it is?

599
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,350
I'm not sure, either.

600
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:57,400
Look at how red this kimchi is. Looks good, right?

601
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,530
Steak and kimchi? It's not the right combination.

602
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,830
I told you to wear disposable gloves!

603
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,850
Kimchi needs bare hands!

604
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,540
You know nothing.

605
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,980
Even my hands are red. 
  (T/N: Sounds like the f-word) 

606
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,990
- I should wash. 
 - Bring it over here. I'll chop.

607
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,100
Everything he says sounds like cursing. Crazy.

608
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,860
It's a lively morning in here.

609
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,420
A bright red day, indeed.

610
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,580
You should have washed your hands before getting the kimchi!

611
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,040
What's the use of washing them now?

612
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,470
Domestic beef!

613
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,650
- What country is this from? 
 - What?

614
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,130
I just said domestic.

615
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,410
I know it's domestic, dude. So what country is it from?

616
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:38,880
What are you talking about? Look at this juicy steak.

617
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,210
Looks delicious.

618
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,720
Oh, my God!

619
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,150
What, the little rat?

620
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,070
How did you get in here? Where's everyone else?

621
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,170
- Everyone come out! 
 - No, no, it's just me.

622
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,680
I see. Hyungnim's guest was you, Mini Unni?

623
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,780
Guest? She's an invader!

624
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,730
Stop her so she can't leave!

625
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,380
You're up.

626
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,780
Have a seat. Let's eat together.

627
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,910
You all live together.

628
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,810
Can you explain what's going on?

629
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,120
What is happening?

630
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,800
 Good morning, Hyungnim. 

631
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,330
Why are you all standing? Is there a cockroach on the floor?

632
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,140
Not a cockroach! A little rat is here, Hyungnim!

633
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,070
Sit down.

634
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,080
- Me, too? 
 - Yes, have a seat.

635
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,740
- Sit here. 
 - Go ahead.

636
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,800
Yes, thank you.

637
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,060
Little rat...

638
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,550
Excuse me...

639
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,560
- Will you just let her be? 
 - Jae Soo.

640
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,850
Yes, Hyungnim.

641
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,080
Here's a flower.

642
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,460
- Whose turn is it to say grace? 
 - We can't pray while—

643
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,560
My turn, Hyungnim.

644
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,620
Dear Lord, thank you for this food we are about to eat. However,

645
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,500
you have led us into temptation by giving us a rat with the food.

646
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,450
We will fill the hole where the rat got in

647
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,730
and catch it with a mousetrap and sticky glue

648
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,140
and reclaim the peace of this home. Amen.

649
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,090
Amen.

650
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,390
- Let's eat. 
 - Would you like some coffee?

651
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:40,320
I cannot eat at the same table with the enemy, Hyungnim.

652
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,700
I thought we cleared it up.

653
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,300
Thanks to Mini Unni for posting the original video,

654
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,150
I had an easy time writing the article.

655
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,640
I'm sorry about what happened—

656
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,370
I heard your CEO did it.

657
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:55,170
Hyungnim told us everything.

658
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,040
Those who don't want to eat in gratitude...

659
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,010
can get up and get out of everyone else's way.

660
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,420
I will eat with gratitude, Hyungnim.

661
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,090
Hyungnim, are you protesting, too?

662
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,380
No.

663
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,000
It's just strange to have a woman in our house.

664
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,280
Go ahead.

665
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,160
Try it.

666
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,790
I'll do the dishes.

667
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,950
I don't let other people in the kitchen.

668
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,320
This is Man Ho's hobby. Leave it.

669
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,180
Let me help.

670
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,760
It's okay. I'm done.

671
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,940
Can I help you?

672
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,330
No. It's best if you get out of the way.

673
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,800
Okay.

674
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,030
- Can I help— 
 - You scared me!

675
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:13,010
You got free beef. You want a free drink, too?

676
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,780
Where's your conscience? Get away from here!

677
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,670
I'm sorry.

678
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,860
You're going by yourself?

679
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,730
Yeah.

680
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,920
Everyone's busy. I should go by myself.

681
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,580
What are you going to say?

682
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,950
Ask where Taek went.

683
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,610
To a seven-year-old? You're just going to ask?

684
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,030
There's no other way.

685
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:43,290
When was the last time you talked to a kid under age 10?

686
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:46,700
- What? 
 - Ever smiled at a kid on the street?

687
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,630
You've made one cry, right?

688
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,600
 Hey, kid, isn't this yours? 

689
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,820
 Here. You dropped it. 

690
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,320
It's a waste of time.

691
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,960
Why don't we get help from someone who knows kids?

692
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,810
Who?

693
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,690
Can I help you?

694
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,960
Yes, tell me.

695
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,550
Today?

696
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,070
I'll go with you.

697
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,990
Do you even know where I'm going? Why insist on going with me?

698
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:04,390
An employee's house with a seven-year-old. I slept for free,

699
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:08,820
I had beef for breakfast for free. It'd be rude to not go.

700
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,940
I didn't see anyone suspicious when I was there.

701
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,680
I don't think it'll be dangerous.

702
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,790
Still, I...

703
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,830
Then, can Dong Hee at least—

704
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,650
I need to borrow Dong Hee.

705
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,350
I haven't finished reviewing the meeting materials yet.

706
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,990
Well...

707
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,670
- Okay, good luck. 
 - Thanks.

708
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,380
Take the day off.

709
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,830
Take it off?

710
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,030
- The weather's nice. 
 - Should we listen to something?

711
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,810
- Sure, anything. 
 - Yes, the weather is nice.

712
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,740
Anything.

713
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,110
Last time—

714
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:37,860
I'm sorry. One second.

715
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,810
Yes, go ahead.

716
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:46,780
I'm sorry for thinking you were hitting that guy at the club.

717
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,040
I didn't get to apologize properly.

718
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,700
About that...

719
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,060
I'm sorry as well.

720
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,140
- To me? 
 - Yes, well...

721
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,340
The candy...

722
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,210
We both misunderstood each other.

723
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:07,040
Is there really a drug that looks like this?

724
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,200
Drugs are dangerous.

725
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,430
They shouldn't look so cute and edible.

726
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:16,140
People might eat them thinking they're candy. Even kids.

727
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,380
Yes, I think so, too.

728
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,530
The employee we're looking for...

729
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:30,790
He used to be involved in drugs. He disappeared, and I'm looking for him.

730
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:34,300
He really cared about his younger sister.

731
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:43,700
So why did you start a company with only ex-cons?

732
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,400
Ex-cons are more likely to commit crimes than others.

733
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,980
It's a road they've already gone down.

734
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,910
Their environment and the people around them make it easy.

735
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,510
But you still trust them?

736
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:57,920
You trust them.

737
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Isn't that why you're going all this way?

738
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,510
To be honest, I don't trust them.

739
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:09,550
That's why I keep them around. That's why I'm going all this way.

740
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,500
I'm Team Leader Yang Hong Gi.

741
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,720
Why did you want to see me?

742
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,040
One second.

743
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,900
Yes, of course.

744
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,400
Yes, Manager Park.

745
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,700
Kids' sausage?

746
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,730
I have nothing against that.

747
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,220
It's for King Meats, after all.

748
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,340
- King Meats? 
 - I'm with someone.

749
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,050
I'll call you back. Bye.

750
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:49,830
Excuse me, but was that Manager Park from King Meats?

751
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,360
You know well since you're in the same industry.

752
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,860
They're launching a new kids' sausage and want me to model it.

753
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,910
Those dudes! Anytime we do something...

754
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,700
You're not going to do it, are you?

755
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,700
Why would I say no? They're number one in the industry.

756
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,430
I guess there's one reason to say no.

757
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,850
What is that reason?

758
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,410
I have some personal debt.

759
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,800
 - Let me go!  
  - Be quiet. 

760
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,100
 It's not my debt. Why should I pay it back? 

761
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,030
 I didn't do anything wrong! 

762
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:35,600
 - Let go. Let go!  
  - Hey. 

763
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,800
 This is the 80 million won that your father owes. 

764
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,770
 Your dad stiffed us and ran off. You should pay it instead. 

765
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,100
 How does 20 million turn into 80 million in two years? 

766
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,660
 Let go! 

767
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,950
 This isn't something you can just rip up. 

768
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,030
 We totally can. 

769
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,590
 Hey! 

770
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,160
 Ahjussi! 

771
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,340
 Hey, thug! 

772
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,000
   

773
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,400
 What do you want? Are you trying to buy me with this money? 

774
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,400
 You can't buy a person with money. 

775
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:26,370
 You expect me to believe that you're just helping me? 

776
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,910
 You said it wasn't your debt. 

777
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,510
 Go. 

778
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,520
We're here.

779
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,430
Yes.

780
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,670
Excuse me.

781
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,190
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

782
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,550
Stay here for a second. I'll go first...

783
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,500
and look around.

784
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,000
Sure.

785
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,490
You can't come in!

786
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,440
- I got it. 
 - Um, well... thank you.

787
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,310
Hi.

788
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,630
Are you Yun?

789
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,430
I'm Mini Unni.

790
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:04,250
The guy over there is the CEO of your brother's company.

791
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,580
He wants to see your house.

792
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,790
We need your permission. Without it, we won't come in.

793
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,210
My brother didn't do anything bad.

794
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:22,700
He's not here to take your brother. He's here to find him.

795
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:27,580
I think he's very worried about your brother.

796
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,770
She says yes.

797
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:37,330
Oh, thank you.

798
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,770
Wow! Is this a kite?

799
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,490
Did your brother make it for you?

800
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:47,320
You must be so upset that it's broken.

801
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,280
Want me to fix it?

802
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,300
I'm a wizard who can fix anything.

803
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,800
We can do it together. Let's go!

804
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,180
   

805
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,940
   

806
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,620
   

807
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,560
 I— I want to work here and do my best. 

808
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,000
 You know what the easiest way to ruin someone's life is? 

809
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,300
 Drugs. You know that, right? 

810
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,080
 You must be used to making easy money. 

811
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,660
 How can I trust you'll never touch drugs again? 

812
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:24,710
 CEO, please! One moment, CEO! 

813
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,650
 I have a younger sister. 

814
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,040
 She's over 20 years younger than me. 

815
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,400
   

816
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,900
 To her... 

817
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,500
 I don't want to be a shameful older brother. 

818
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,320
 I may not be a great brother... 

819
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:42,030
 but I don't want to be a shameful one. 

820
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:53,050
I used to have an Oppa who made kites for me.

821
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:57,920
He used to write a wish on every kite.

822
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,480
He told me the wish would reach the heavens.

823
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,340
Yun, do you want to write down a wish, too?

824
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,710
Let's write it right here.

825
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,220
   

826
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:22,620
 Will my wish really come true? 

827
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:26,030
 You should write it really big to get your wish. 

828
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:38,170
♫  See the moon, moon, moon  ♫

829
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:40,560
   

830
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:47,340
♫  Your voice that I missed so much, will I hear it again?  ♫

831
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:51,610
♫  The image I dreamed of in my heart  ♫

832
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:55,040
We're going to fly a kite. Want to do it with us?

833
01:00:55,970 --> 01:01:02,390
♫  We all wanna be to the by no farewell  ♫

834
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:11,100
♫  Now that we’ve met again, a fateful miracle that recognized each other  ♫

835
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,810
♫  May it become love  ♫

836
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,570
♫  You  ♫

837
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,860
♫  You  ♫

838
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,800
Prosecutor.

839
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,900
Eun Ha.

840
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,970


841
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:40,570
♫  My everything  ♫

842
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:45,320
♫  You are precious, I don't deserve you  ♫

843
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,500
♫  Will you be my everything?  ♫

844
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,690
♫  My everything  ♫

845
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:55,480
   

846
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,100
 From now on, don't trust and follow someone like me. 

847
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,600
 Seo Ji Hwan isn't just an ordinary CEO. 

848
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,390
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 

849
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:07,330
 Is there a reason you came to this house? 

850
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,450
 He was the best person I ever knew. 

851
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,630
 Let's go. 

852
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,090
 I'm going to help you study. 

853
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,670
 Three syllables! 

854
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:19,470
 Eun Ha, I like you. 

855
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,790
 Why are you so nice to me? 

856
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:25,090
 Who am I to you, Seo Ji Hwan? 

857
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,900
♫  Protecting your warm laughter  ♫
