11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,420
 - Hello, Chairman! 
 - It was 10 years ago. 

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,970
 Seo Tae Pyung, the Bulldog Gang boss who ruled the scene, 

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:07,500
 is said to have had a son named Seo Ji Hwan. 
   

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,170
   

15
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,730
Let's end this today!

16
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,440
We'll see who comes out on top.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,750
Let's see it, then.

20
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,850
You...

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,090
Hey...

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,900
Look away.

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,080
Hey, you...

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,400
Hey, hey! Look at this bastard.

25
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,060
 Seo Ji Hwan inherited the Bulldog Gang after defeating the Kitty Gang. 

26
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,470
 He conquered the chaotic scene, 
   

27
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,990
 and led an era without defeat. 

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,740
A round of applause!

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,410
 But the moment he defeated his opponents and rose to the top, 

30
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,330
 Seo Ji Hwan dissolved his organization. 

31
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,490
 He then returned to civilian life, 

32
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,400
 and disappeared all by himself. 

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,110
   

34
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,800
 Oh, blessed one

Damn, look at all this blood.

39
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,620
This junkie.

40
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,060
Where is Taek, that f*cker?

41
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,190
Looks like it's been rotting for at least a week.

42
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,330
What are we supposed to do?

43
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:35,420
 Oh, blessed one

Yes?

46
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,750
Got it.

47
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,400
Wrap up the pieces in plastic so they don't bleed,

48
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,050
and ventilate well so it doesn't smell.

49
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,450
Make sure you clean up the blood on the floor.

50
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,090
Okay.

51
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,000
Well...

52
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,000
Ow, ow, one second.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,940
Ow, ow, sir, one second.

54
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,380
What is wrong with my leg?

55
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,520
This is not supposed to happen.

56
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,120
You all are amazing. I'm going to leave now.

57
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,420
Hallejuâ€” I mean, I'm sorry!

58
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,910
   

59
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,290
Where?

60
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,960
Yeah. Here? It's...

61
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,210
I see you. To my left? What cat?

62
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,320
   

63
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,090
 Hey! We're having so much fun! 

64
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,490
I didn't even change because you said it was urgent!

65
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,180
I thought something happened.

66
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,460
A club?

67
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,860
 No thanks, I'm leaving. 

68
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,400
What? Hey, hey, hold on! Geez...

69
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,250
- What the heck is she wearing? 
 - Hey.

70
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,760
Ta-da! You thought I left, right?

71
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,970
Wait, they let you in...

72
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,400
- dressed like that? 
 - I have my ways.

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,570
Go home.

74
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,060
- Please, just this one time. 
 - Go home.

75
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,370
It's a surprise.

76
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,820
You really are surprising.

77
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,500
I was going to buy a cape, anyway. It was 10,000 won  (about $7.31) . I'll use it for filming later.

78
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,960
- Where are you going? 
 - To dance! I'm here, aren't I?

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,390
You want to make the news tomorrow?

80
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,350
My cape.

81
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,590
I'll stop by the restroom first.

82
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,000
Hyungnim, Taek is not in the storage room.

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,670
I think he's using drugs again.

84
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

85
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,220
My back, my back, could you...

86
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,630
Thank you.

87
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,780
Could you lift your foot?

88
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,430
Over there, too.

89
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,280
There was one there.

90
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,730
Thank you.

91
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,280
Hyungnim, Seo Ji Hwan is here.

92
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,670
What brings you here?

93
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,850
Whoa. You can't just come in here.

94
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,570
You know Jung Yoon Taek, right?

95
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,020
Who's Jung Yoon Taek? I don't know that name.

96
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,280
There's a lot of people here, so I don't know who's who.

97
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,700
You can't take that.

98
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,400
Is it something special?

99
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,330
Hyungnim.

100
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,210
We just put in some love and trust.

101
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,050
Bastard, you broke and wasted a bottle because you can't stand up straight.

102
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,050
Stop it. He's your employee.

103
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,510
What's going on?

104
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,070
That guy...

105
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,180
 Oh, I'm sorry. My back... 

106
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,900
 Thank you. 

107
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,000
Hey. Let's go.

108
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
Let's just go. Let's go, I said!

109
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,700
No!

110
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,350
- She's a cop. 
 - A cop?

111
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,490
No, no. I'm not a cop.

112
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,300
Excuse me.

113
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,600
Let go of that.

114
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,220
- What? 
 - Let go, I said!

115
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,120
But I didn't mean to...

116
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,310
Wait...

117
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,480
- What are you doing? 
 - You have the right to remain silent

118
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,430
and the right to have a lawyer, and...

119
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,400
I mean, anything you say can be used against you in court.

120
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,600
- Crazy bitch. 
 - Excuse me.

121
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,680
You're a cop, right? I think there's been a misunderstanding.

122
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,500
You can't do this without a warrant, so please unlock this.

123
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,320
You can't do this without a warrant...

124
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,460
Your shoes are glittery.

125
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,200
Do you have an ID?

126
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
ID?

127
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,900
My ID...

128
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,100
I left it in the car!

129
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,010
Why would you leave your ID in the car? No badge, either.

130
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,660
You're not a real cop, are you?

131
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,160
Excuse me.

132
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,270
- What are youâ€” 
 - Over here! Help, please! Over here.

133
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,650
Let's go. I'm sorry, excuse me.

134
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,650
What's with you? Why did you step forward like that?

135
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,690
You're right, but he was so shameless...

136
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,790
I couldn't help myself. You know I hate people like that.

137
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,100
Excuse me, work with us. Please let us through.

138
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,500
I already told you it wasn't me. Check the security cameras.

139
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,040
We'll check. In the meantime, come with us to the station.

140
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,140
She saw me holding the bottle

141
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,080
and just put the handcuffs on me right away!

142
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,090
- I understand, so... 
 - Why don't you believe me?

143
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,520
Let's talk at the station.

144
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,700
What's wrong?

145
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,860
These aren't real handcuffs.

146
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,070
They're a toy.

147
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,000
A toy...

148
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,330
It's all right. These things happen. Can I go now?

149
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,510
- First... 
 - It was a toy!

150
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,970
 Who the hell is that woman? 

151
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,070
Please like and subscribe!

152
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,710
   

153
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,070
    
 I'm taking the kid!

154
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,000
Pow, pow, pow!

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,200
Stop, I'm Policewoman Mini! Here to save the child!

156
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,300
   

157
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,200
â™«  And when we play  â™«

158
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,880
I won't back down like this.

159
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,950
Defense gloves!

160
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,170
â™«  Let's go out, my friends  â™«

161
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,760
Mini Power!

162
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,660
   

163
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:35,250
â™«  Let's go away everyone, beware of monsters  â™«

164
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,420
Policewoman Mini successfully rescues the child!

165
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,000
Mini, while you were having fun defeating the monster,

166
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,560
you forgot to mention the police toy set. 
    

167
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,020
As CEO, I told you twice that you have to mention our sponsors.

168
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,450
I was so focused on the game that it slipped my mind.

169
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,600
Slipped your mind?

170
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,930
This toy is 80,000 won  (about $58) . Isn't that too expensive for kids?

171
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,200
The kids don't buy them, their moms do.

172
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,400
I know. Maybe some kids don't have moms.

173
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,130
Maybe their moms don't have money.

174
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,740
They might have dads, but 80,000 won might be too much.

175
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,400
Or they might not have dads.

176
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,190
Does this need to cost 80,000 won?

177
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,050
Why is that your problem, Eun Ha? That's their problem.

178
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,880
Don't worry about the kids. Worry about the company!

179
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,310
Or worry about yourself.

180
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,380
But we have a lot of views and more comments than usual.

181
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,120
They say I look good in a police uniform.

182
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,900
I think we'll keep getting better responses.

183
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,200
So, how much is a lot?

184
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,900
Five million views like Ye Na?

185
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,310
Not that much, CEO.

186
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,280
Mini.

187
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,210
If you keep this up, we can't renew your contract.

188
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,320
- What? 
 - Your contract is about to expire, Eun Ha.

189
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,160
Listen to me carefully.

190
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,480
If you disobey orders one more time,

191
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,600
it's really going to be...

192
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,050
Over! Over!

193
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,570
- My throat hurts. 
 - Are you okay, CEO?

194
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,830
It hurts...

195
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,600
Get out.

196
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,530
Hyungnim is here.

197
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,580
Open the door.

198
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,000
 Hello, Hyungnim. 

199
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,030
Is that for me?

200
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,260
It must be for your recent trip to the police.

201
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,760
It was a quick trip, so we prepared soft tofu for you.

202
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,250
- Let's sit down. 
 - Yes, sir.

203
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,280
- Whose turn is it to say grace? 
 - Me.

204
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,850
Dear Lord,

205
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,000
thank you for this food we are about to eat.

206
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,810
Please bless the pig that gave us its front and hind legs.

207
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,300
And...

208
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,860
Man Ho.

209
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,480
May it be free of pain

210
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,720
and live peacefully in heaven.

211
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,140
- Amen. 
  - Amen. 

212
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,680
- Let's eat. 
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

213
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,580
 Enjoy. 

214
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,930
Hyungnim, the people who called the police on you...

215
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,580
Who are those fearless bastards?

216
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,850
Who do you think?

217
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,570
It must have been Lee Gang Gil, the right arm of Kitty Gang.

218
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,580
Gang Gil?

219
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,240
He must be out of his mind.

220
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,740
By chance...

221
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,520
is this what you saw?

222
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,700
It's a new drug from Thailand that's been circulating the clubs since last year.

223
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,150
I hear Kitty Gang is interested.

224
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,960
Wasn't Taek in some kind of group in Thailand?

225
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,070
This is the drug?

226
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,230
It looks like candy for kids, right?

227
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,950
 Could you lift your foot? 

228
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,660
 Over there, too. 

229
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,670
 Thank you. 

230
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,000
I did see it.

231
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,780
That cop!

232
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,380
 I'll do my best! 

233
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,320
I thought a BBQ restaurant would make me a cow or pig, but I'm soju.

234
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,790
Cute.

235
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,220
   

236
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,240
Hey! I'm working right now.

237
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,730
You're doing the mascot thing again?

238
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,400
Can you stop? How much do you make anyway?

239
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,710
Probably more than what I made filming today.

240
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,500
What time are you done today?

241
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,710
This is going to take about four hours, so...

242
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,720
Mi Ho.

243
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,130
- I think I saw something. 
  - Huh? 

244
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,100
 What? What did you see? 

245
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,960
- I'll call you back later. 
  - Hey. Hey! 

246
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,040
   

247
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,760
   

248
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,740
 You have the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer. 

249
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,920
 I mean, anything you say can be used against you in court. 

250
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,420
 You're not a real cop, are you? 

251
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,780
What? What's that guy doing here?

252
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,220
Hey.

253
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,530
Get over here right now, will you?

254
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,990
How did he know?

255
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,050
Give it to me.

256
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,660
In your shoe.

257
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,690
I have eyes everywhere, so don't think you can fool me.

258
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,820
- Don't take what's not yours, got it? 
 - Yes, sir.

259
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,750
- Answer me. 
 - How cold-hearted...

260
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,980
- Louder! 
 - Yes, sir!

261
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,190
Bastard...

262
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,840
Go now.

263
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,550
It wasn't me. It was that.

264
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,000
What a bastard.

265
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,700
Stealing money from little kids?

266
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,060
I should have hit him harder.

267
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,990
Hey.

268
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,130
Are you paying today?

269
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,380
You should lock the door when you go to the toilet.

270
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,330
Don't let little brats become thieves.

271
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,150
If they see something they need, they can take it.

272
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,740
Having something is not a problem, but not having anything is.

273
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,330
If it ends here, it won't be a problem.

274
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,700
"The one who steals a nail will grow up to steal an ox."

275
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,100
Oh, I thought some guys were born ox thieves.

276
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,200
You're hitting the nail on its head this morning.

277
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,530
So how's it going these days?

278
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,890
Everyone I saw on the way was complaining.

279
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,650
Still...

280
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,430
it was better when you were around.

281
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,370
That's not to say that you did anything right.

282
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,840
I know I haven't done anything right.

283
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,350
Tell me something I don't know.

284
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,630
Wow, you've grown up.

285
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,230
You know you've done no good with your life?

286
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,270
You might be ready to get married.

287
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:41,100
I shouldn't mess up someone else's life. I barely cleaned up my own.

288
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,530
Speaking of which, want to meet a girl?

289
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,500
The daughter of the side dish store owner across the street.

290
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,310
I heard she's 30 or 31 this year.

291
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,630
I heard she got a divorce last year. No kids.

292
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,180
What?

293
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,760
Are you turned off because she's been married before?

294
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,470
If she's that great, set her up with your grandson.

295
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,980
My grandson already has three kids.

296
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,600
He got married a long time ago, aigoo.

297
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,700
You can live like my grandson, too.

298
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,830
I can barely take care of the guys I have. I'm off.

299
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,050
Put it on my tab.

300
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,380
You can't do math.

301
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,680
That's why you're not married yet!

302
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,170
Take a face mask. It's not made of soju. It's from bamboo extract.

303
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,010
Take a face mask. It's not made of soju. It's from bamboo extract.

304
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,480
- Soju! 
 - Take a face mask.

305
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,460
I love soju. Let me get a hug.

306
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,040
Ahjussi, I'm not your love.

307
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,800
- Just one hug! 
 - Please stop.

308
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,510
Just let me hug you once!

309
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,010
No, take this and go, please.

310
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,900
Take a face mask.

311
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,830
- It's not made of soju. It's from bamboo extract. 
 - Soju?

312
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,090
We're having a 10th-anniversary special event.

313
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,320
If you do that again, I'm calling the cops!

314
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,260
The cops?

315
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,400
- My son-in-law is a cop. 
 - Seriously.

316
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,550
Hold on a second.

317
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,290
Got you!

318
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,300
Take a face mask. It's not made of soju. It's from bamboo extract.

319
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,330
- Hey. Hey! 
 - Mask...

320
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,360
Stop right there!

321
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,750
Defense gloves! Mini Power!

322
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,370
Come on.

323
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,920
Try acting like a cop now.

324
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,920
You're the one who hit my head back there, right?

325
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,720
- Are you part of Kitty Gang? 
 - Cat?

326
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,600
You are. That's why you pretended to be a cop, to help them.

327
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,980
- I was just... 
 - Who did you get the stuff from?

328
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,690
- What? What stuff? 
 - The stuff at the club! Red, yellow, blue!

329
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,430
Red, yellow, at the club?

330
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,890
   

331
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,420
The drug.

332
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,600
The drug?

333
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh, those aren't drugs. They're candy for kids.

334
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,530
- I already know everything. 
 - I'm sorry to interrupt...

335
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,100
I have to go right now. I'm so sorry.

336
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,260
Hey!

337
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,480
Answer me before you go.

338
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,160
I really don't know what you're talking about.

339
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,830
If you follow me, I'll give you that drug.

340
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,610
Ma'am!

341
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,240
In all my days, I've seen it all,

342
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,580
but no one's blown off a shift like you.

343
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,980
I'm so sorry. I'll do it right now.

344
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,220
Do what? After you've made all this mess?

345
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,330
Just go. And no pay for the day.

346
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,610
Ma'am, ma'am? I can do it right now.

347
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Ma'am...

348
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,760
   

349
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,170
I'm so pissed.

350
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,420
Hey.

351
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,830
Hey.

352
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,110
Hey!

353
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,970
Are you crazy? Spit it out! Spit it out!

354
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,550
Spit it out! You're going to die!

355
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,930
This woman must be out of her mind.

356
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,860
Do you want to die?

357
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,450
W-What's wrong? What?

358
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,850
Is it stuck in your throat?

359
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,800
It's stuck?

360
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,420
Spit it out, spit it out.

361
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,350
Spit it out!

362
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,550
Spit it out! Spit it out!

363
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,360
Spit it out! Spit it out!

364
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,630
W-W-Water! Hurry up! Water!

365
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,610
Hurry up! Water! Water!

366
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,700
Hey, you bastard!

367
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,310
You have to call me, when something fun happens.

368
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,750
You were having dinner with President Park, so...

369
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,960
It's not like he's dying anytime soon.

370
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,900
Who cares about the perch sashimi?

371
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,580
I'm so stoked. So stoked.

372
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,960
Seo Ji Hwan being publicly humiliated?

373
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,900
I should have had front-row seats!

374
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,440
Gang Gil, there must be security camera footage, right?

375
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,290
Oh. I'm sorry.

376
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,940
In order to avoid problems...

377
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,690
You...

378
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,440
You deleted the footage?

379
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,110
It's my business! Why did you do that?

380
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,360
Who told you to do that?

381
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,370
You bastard.

382
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,960
I'm sorry.

383
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,670
Meow, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

384
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,910
Make sure you get the footage next time.

385
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,760
If I watched that video before bed...

386
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,080
I would sleep like a baby.

387
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,470
If we dig into it, it may become a headache.

388
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,200
Should we leave him be?

389
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,310
He left the dogfight of his own free will.

390
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,210
He'll bark a few times, then stop.

391
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,130
Yeah!

392
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,420
If the barking gets loud...

393
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,760
you can throw him a bone.

394
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,040
 The test results are negative. 

395
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,580
 Next patient, please. 

396
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,640
I told you they weren't drugs. They're candy for kids.

397
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,710
I can't believe you dragged me all the way here.

398
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,830
Then why did you pretend... pretend to be a cop?

399
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,350
You can't just hit people like that.

400
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,140
I...

401
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:38,580
You think someone who beats up people like that won't hit a woman?

402
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,100
This is my turf.

403
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,490
If you hit me here, people won't just stand back.

404
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,400
Hey, listen to me carefully.

405
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,850
If you're fearless but don't know how to use your head, you'll lose it.

406
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,960
If you want your head to stay on, stay away from guys like me.

407
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,640
Don't come within 50 meters of me, got it?

408
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,470
- My head? 
 - Aren't you going to run? 50 meters.

409
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,330
- You can't talk to me like that. 
 - Run away. 50 meters.

410
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,590
- I told you it wasn't drugsâ€” 
 - 50 meters!

411
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,430
He's crazy!

412
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,290
 What? Drugs? 

413
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,380
Yeah, he thought the candy was drugs.

414
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,930
What?

415
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,920
If he knows drugs, he must be a real gangster!

416
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,380
- Are you sure? 
 - I grew up seeing plenty of them. I'm sure.

417
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,000
So why did you go to the dumpling shop?

418
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,360
Oh, the dumpling shop...

419
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,900
Seriously. Whenever you get mixed up with the name "Hyun Woo,"

420
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,860
it never ends well.

421
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,230
So good!

422
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,010
I told you.

423
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,340
   

424
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,540
Hyun Woo?

425
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,520
Hello, how much do you need?

426
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,010
Pardon?

427
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,180
I'm here to meet someone named Hyun Woo.

428
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,550
What? Look.

429
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,190
It says, "Cash Preferred." Some letters are missing.

430
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,410
   

431
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,040
Go away.

432
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,460
I'm sorry!

433
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,590
   

434
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,380
â™«  I may have run into you once or twice  â™«

435
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,510
â™«  Your unique charm...  â™«

436
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,080
Excuse me.

437
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,070
 You talked to a random dude  
  

438
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,900
 who got obsessed with you and stalked you for more than a month. 

439
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,970
Your energy is so pure.

440
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,490
- One second! 
 - Hello.

441
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,960
Hello!

442
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,600
 Oh, right.  
    

443
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
 I once got accused of being the other woman. 

444
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,770
 I almost died that day. 

445
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,080
W-W-What?

446
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,080
   

447
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,710
Honey!

448
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,000
Hey!

449
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,740
I thought you were living quietly lately.

450
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,420
That's not it. It's our fault!

451
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,130
I didn't do it! I swear!

452
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,680
   

453
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,730
 Right! That happened. 

454
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,520
It's like searching for "Mr. Kim" in the middle of Seoul.

455
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,860
At least with Mr. Kim, you know his family name!

456
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,380
But now at least I know his first name. So it's the same, right?

457
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,890
Nonsense.

458
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:26,400
I've only ever called him "Oppa," so I don't know his last name.

459
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,580
He could at least have a more unique name.

460
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:34,330
It's been 23 years. I don't know if he's dead or alive.

461
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,790
Even if I could just know he's alive somewhere,

462
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,700
I'd be more than grateful.

463
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,450
   

464
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,700
   

465
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,970
You could be mistaken for a judge. 
    

466
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,820
   

467
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,550
A judge and a minister share a common goal.

468
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,120
To lead lambs of God toward the right path.

469
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,120
Good, then.

470
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,010
According to the members of your church,

471
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:15,570
you assaulted them for not giving tithes and offerings to the church.

472
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:21,330
I was only teaching them that tithes and offerings are the basics for believers.

473
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,530
You calculated the tithes with compound interest.

474
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,160
Not the legal maximum of 20%, but...

475
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,970
- 40%. 
 - The tithes were given

476
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,770
- voluntarily... 
 - You also mobilized your elders.

477
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:38,080
These "elders" were your minions from your Obong Gang days, right?

478
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,360
They are. But thanks to me, all those people...

479
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:49,060
have accepted Jesus, which is my eternal glory.

480
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,020
"Eternal glory"?

481
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,500
"Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give,

482
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,990
not reluctantly or under compulsion."

483
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,680
2 Corinthians 9:7.

484
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,290
"You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him."

485
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,510
That's Leviticus...

486
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,490
The Gospel of Luke says this.

487
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,910
"Don't collect any more than you are required to.

488
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,380
Don't extort money."

489
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,690
Prosecutor, are you a Christian as well?

490
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,480
No.

491
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,330
I...

492
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,570
don't believe that people change.

493
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,520
Especially...

494
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,940
criminals.

495
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,910
Drugs. Drugs...

496
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,760
Drugs.

497
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,040
I need drugs. Please!

498
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,920
   

499
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,140
 Are you an addict? Here's a special drug for you. 

500
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,430
 It's called a contract.  
  

501
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:31,400
 Earn money rightfully and feel the high of being rewarded. 

502
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,520
 Let me see the cards... 

503
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,600
 What? 

504
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,200
 What is that?  
  

505
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,340
 Your magic bullet is honesty. 

506
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,770
 Work honestly, and take what you earn. 

507
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,690
 I sent the money! Why aren't you answering? Is this a scam? 

508
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,100
 What? 

509
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,680
 What? 

510
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,640
 You can be honest, too. 

511
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,020
 Don't scam others or yourself. 

512
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,690
 Don't you dare provoke me! 

513
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,840
 Wait a moment before you throw that punch. 

514
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,590
 You can do it. 

515
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,780
 Since I've started my new life, I don't feel thirsty anymore.  
    

516
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,450
 You... 

517
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,700
 can start over, too. 

518
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,220
   

519
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,050
We've gathered all executives here today 
    

520
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,710
to discuss the unfortunate incident that happened

521
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,880
and to hear your thoughts.

522
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,870
Employee Jung Yoon Taek, who was in charge of the Hanam storage unit,

523
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:46,070
has cut off contact while he's still on probation.

524
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,010
How predictable! He's a junkie!

525
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,130
He has to be using again!

526
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,180
After he got out of jail,

527
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,680
we hired him because he begged and promised to work hard.

528
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,670
How ungrateful.

529
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,730
While other guys got their butcher licenses,

530
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,360
he wanted to take on easy jobs like managing storage units.

531
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,780
We knew he was up to no good. Don't you agree?

532
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,730
 I knew he'd be trouble. 

533
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:23,030
Is there anyone here who wasn't "up to no good"?

534
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,980
   

535
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,050
   

536
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,110
   

537
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,670
I know people don't change.

538
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,590
But if we are so quick to judge,

539
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,180
how are we different from anyone else?

540
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:49,590
Even the chaff of grains can be burned and used as fuel or as fertilizer for soil.

541
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,010
Or perhaps miraculously, something better.

542
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,600
So, why did Obong Gang's boss become a cult leader scamming people?

543
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,420
I heard he was all that back in the day.

544
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,450
Officer Song.

545
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,840
This is all because of that bastard Seo Ji Hwan.

546
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,930
 Ever since he started that company to "contribute to society," 

547
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:28,140
 he started stealing people he needed, one by one. 

548
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,420
Rock 'n' roll.

549
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,530
Welcome back. These flowersâ€”

550
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,410
Hyungnim!

551
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,570
My goodness.

552
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,630
 I learned you can't trust anyone in this world. 

553
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,260
 Then I found God. 

554
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,240
This is humiliating.

555
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,460
I should quit being a thug.

556
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,110
The only survivors of this...

557
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:06,220
are "Kitty Gang" led by Go Yang Hui and Seo Ji Hwan.

558
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,750
Those two are still mortal enemies.

559
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,800
   

560
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,130
Seo Ji Hwan...

561
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,140
I'm glad to hear that name.

562
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,100
Ye Na will go to the awards ceremony and will have to work very hard.

563
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,600
Let's distribute the items amongst ourselves.

564
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,000
Yes! Then...

565
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,360
I will take Jellinique,

566
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,880
- and Sugar. 
 - I'll take the blockbuster toy

567
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,470
and this one as well.

568
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,110
- I'll take the donuts. 
 - Okay.

569
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,350
I've always wanted to do this one.

570
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,060
Then...

571
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,950
who wants to go to the Kids Food Festival?

572
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,080
Who would want to? Sounds mega exhausting.

573
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,390
I'll go.

574
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,620
Eun Ha?

575
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,560
It's a festival. You guys don't want to go?

576
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,780
There must be fun things to do at a festival.

577
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,390
Good. I hope you have a great time, Eun Ha.

578
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:14,090
You'll have to film every company that's present. Can youâ€”

579
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,010
- Can you do it? 
 - Can I participate, too? I have an idea.

580
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,880
   

581
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:29,010
Why give him a chance? We should chew him out!

582
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,420
Think of what I did that day!

583
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,200
What are we supposed to do?

584
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,080
One, two!

585
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,240
The smell...

586
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,030
If we're going to chew him out, let's at least do it here.

587
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,850
Figure out where Taek might be.

588
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,050
Report back as soon as you have news.

589
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,040
There's one more item on the agenda.

590
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,940
Huh?

591
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,670
It's finally here.

592
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,700
The new product.

593
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,700
We finished the whole package, Hyungnim.

594
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,920
   

595
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,170
Isn't it a bit too yellow?

596
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,960
You said it was too pink last time, so we changed it to yellow.

597
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,380
   

598
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,020
   

599
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,700
Do we really need the illustrations?

600
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,400
People might complain if it's not clearly for kids.

601
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,440
   

602
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,300
What do you think?

603
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,200
I think it's pretty good.

604
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,150
   

605
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,960
To be blunt, it doesn't fit our company's brand.

606
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,320
I'm not sure it'll work.

607
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,400
   

608
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,800
Then what should we do?

609
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,120
   

610
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,080
I'd like to do a focus group first.

611
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,300
Where?

612
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,200
   

613
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,870
   

614
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,700
   

615
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,200
   

616
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,920
It makes your bones stronger, and it makes you grow.

617
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,760
This is milk that all of you will love.

618
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,450
This organic milk is from cows

619
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:32,770
that live on big green fields,

620
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,370
eat organic food, and lead happy lives.

621
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:41,290
So our friends who get stomachache or have a bad aftertaste

622
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,330
could drink it.

623
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:48,950
It has twice the healthy fats of regular milk.

624
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,280
It must be so good for you, right?

625
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,950
Mini will give it a try.

626
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,300
So savory!

627
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,350
   

628
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,020
   

629
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,230
Eun Ha.

630
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,120
- Hello, Producer. 
 - We're done filming over there.

631
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,610
- Really? 
 - Yes.

632
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,020
All of these products must be vouched for, right?

633
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,600
They must be if they're at a fair.

634
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,380
Why is no one over there?

635
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,720
Oh, those guys...

636
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,200
- Geez. 
 - Come and try some sausage!

637
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,050
This isn't your everyday sausage!

638
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,100
Hey, just focus on grilling the sausages.

639
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,100
You're scaring the kids away!

640
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,040
- Is that why? 
 - Grill them.

641
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
How cute!

642
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,310
Hey, kid.

643
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,660
Try this sausage. It's really good.

644
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,440
Try it.

645
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,100
It's okay. Try it.

646
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,750
Hey, hey! Don't eat that!

647
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:11,620
Made by ex-convicts? Who knows what's in it?

648
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,400
That's not a very nice thing to say.

649
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,670
You think we would put poison in kids' food?

650
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:20,700
Of course! You're ex-convicts. Who knows what you did?

651
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,100
Don't look, don't look!

652
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,230
Don't look.

653
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,530
Ta-da! I'm not dead!

654
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,160
You see it's not poisoned, right?

655
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,260
Come and stay with me.

656
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,280
Why don't you try it?

657
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,730
Try it.

658
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,300
Get that out of my sight.

659
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,140
It's been 40 minutes.

660
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,370
It's nice in here. Why don't you read a magazine?

661
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,380
You're holding it upside down.

662
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,900
Excuse me. Do you have a girlfriend?

663
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,800
We're working right now. I'll let you know once we're done.

664
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,990
I see.

665
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,550
Okay, then.

666
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,390
What's your secret?

667
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,550
- My face. 
 - I knew you'd say that.

668
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,680
You guys are early.

669
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,710
Sorry, I'm late. I had some work to do.

670
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,100
No problem.

671
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,600
Was it "Thirsty Pig"?

672
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,560
"Deer."

673
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,560
"Deer"?

674
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,180
I thought you didn't sell deer meat.

675
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,620
What a funny name.

676
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,220
We discussed it, but...

677
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,410
our department store...

678
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,430
is not going to work.

679
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,240
We've had a problematic product on the shelves before

680
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,860
that almost started a boycott campaign.

681
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,340
Is there a problem with our product?

682
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,260
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying something's wrong with your product.

683
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,200
It's not how it tastes.

684
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,880
I mean...

685
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:49,700
It's who made it that's the issue. You know?

686
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,980
You think I'll just stand here and take it?

687
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,460
You think our food is a joke?

688
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,600
What's wrong with our product? Is the sausage a criminal?

689
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,400
Hey, do you get a medal for going to jail?

690
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,120
You moron!

691
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,300
- Let it go! 
 - You're just an ex-convict!

692
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,610
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

693
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:13,480
- If I let this go, you're dead! 
 - Go ahead!

694
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,790
- Why would I kill someone! 
 - So what?

695
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,140
Isn't Thirsty Deer only for ex-cons?

696
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,680
I have the trademark for it!

697
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,220
What if you're not thirsty, then?

698
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,050
What are you talking about? That's nonsense, man!

699
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,770
Didn't you hear me, you bastard?

700
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,550
What the hell! What do you think you are?

701
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,100
Okay! Let's all clap together!

702
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,820
Let's clap one, two, three, I, love, you!

703
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,510
What?

704
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,760
One more time! Let's clap one, two, three, I, love, you!

705
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,290
 I, love, you! 

706
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,320
Good job, kids!

707
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,260
Just the adults this time.

708
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,470
Let's clap one, two, three, I, am, sorry!

709
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,600
Come on. You can only clap if you release your hands, right?

710
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,800
Let it go. The kids are watching.

711
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,540
 She's right! That's enough. 

712
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,350
Let's clap one, two, three, Make, up, now!

713
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,480
 Make, up, now! 

714
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,140
 Make, up, now! 

715
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,260
- Make, up, now! 
  - Make, up, now! 

716
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,430
 Make, up, now! 

717
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,790
What?

718
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,580
Are you throwing shade because I'm left-handed?

719
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,230
You bastard!

720
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,280
Got it. Let's pretend this never happened.

721
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,850
We've already distributed our product to 11 hotels and more than 80 supermarkets.

722
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:42,240
Customers see it differently now. Our sales numbers aren't bad.

723
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,140
We have a far superior repeat purchase rate than other products.

724
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,600
I think consumers trust our Honest series of brands.

725
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,000
I'm sorry. You said "trust" and...

726
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,950
I couldn't help but laugh.

727
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,750
"The hands that cook must be clean."

728
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,120
That's what they say, right?

729
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:09,070
You can't get germs in the food.

730
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,730
To be honest with you,

731
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,920
I don't want to serve our customers

732
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,010
food that was made

733
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,260
by dirty hands.

734
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:24,380
Your chairman is a regular at Quissen, right? He enjoys charcuterie boards.

735
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,460
Right. How did you know?

736
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:34,300
He especially likes jamon cut from the entire hind leg of a pig, then dried and cured.

737
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:41,500
He also likes prosciutto cut from a wild boar's thigh, salted, then cut thin.

738
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,950
How do you know all that?

739
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,550
It's right here.

740
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,170
   

741
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,320
   

742
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,140
   

743
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,940
Team Leader Kim Seung Joon.

744
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,530
The meat they use?

745
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,570
We provide it.

746
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,630
   

747
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,420
   

748
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,040
Manager Joo.

749
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,250
Yes, CEO.

750
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,210
Let's go.

751
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,780
Got it.

752
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,560
CEO?

753
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,270
I think we have a problem.

754
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,180
Why did you get into a fight?

755
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,540
Ow, it hurts! It stings!

756
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,360
Dong Hee! Take it easy!

757
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,860
Stop whining.

758
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,570
Compared to how loud you were, you have a tiny scratch.

759
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,960
In customer management, your face is life or death.

760
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,850
Huh? Then Hyungnim,

761
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:58,830
I think your customer management is terminal. Maybe dead.

762
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,580
Don't you dare say a word to Hyungnim. If Ji Hwan finds out...

763
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,020
Then what?

764
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,270
Nicely done...

765
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:20,550
We sent you out to promote the product, not get into a brawl.

766
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,220
Well...

767
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,570
how did you...

768
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:26,390
I suspected something might go wrong the way you guys are.

769
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,050
As expected, I wish I hadn't seen this.

770
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,250
Hyungnim, we didn't start it.

771
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,640
That's not what this was.

772
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,260
He insulted us for being ex-cons!

773
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,560
Aren't you an ex-con?

774
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,830
I am, Hyungnim. Butâ€”

775
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,810
Never mind, Hyungnim.

776
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:47,280
Has it been so long that you've forgotten?

777
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,000
Or since you work in an office now, do you think you're salarymen like others?

778
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,400
Paying for your crimes doesn't mean the crimes are gone.

779
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,460
We failed to do what others took for granted, and we were punished for it.

780
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,680
We were punished for not doing it.

781
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,400
You should be thanking him for reminding you,

782
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,780
instead of grabbing him by the neck.

783
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,880
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

784
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,940
My old habits must have come out.

785
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,960
You guys must have had a long day. Let's wrap up.

786
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,620
Let's get some pork belly for dinner. Pack up.

787
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,490
Yes, Hyungnim.

788
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,940
We'll make a reservation!

789
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,160
Should we make it a black pig?

790
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,900
- Pack up. 
 - Just do it.

791
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:37,700
Let's get started with a cooking class with Mini!

792
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,460
Today, we'll be making your favorite,

793
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,780
and also my favorite!

794
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,660
We'll make pizza!

795
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,570
- Pizza! 
 - Looks good!

796
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:51,410
Okay. With finely ground flour,

797
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:55,220
let's make some sticky dough.

798
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,550
If you mix the dough, it gets really sticky, right?

799
00:55:58,550 --> 00:55:59,600
 Yes! 

800
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,300
- Should we see how sticky it got? 
  - Yes! 

801
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,180
Let's see.

802
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,360
Here we go...

803
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,640
Producer!

804
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,340
It's flour!

805
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,680
Stop throwing it at me!

806
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,190
Stop it!

807
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,460
Come on, Eun Ha! Don't do that!

808
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,640
That woman...

809
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,990
You guys!

810
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:26,370
â™«  I dream a familiar dream every day  â™«

811
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:33,630
â™«  Those unforgettable times of waiting  â™«

812
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:42,620
â™«  My breathing gets faster, yeah, it's real  â™«

813
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:49,610
â™«  You know, right? That I've been waiting for you  â™«

814
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:59,090
â™«  Tik-tiktok, getting closer, I might get caught  â™«

815
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:05,820
â™«  Hidden love, time is now  â™«

816
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:12,900
â™«  Ring my heart, into my world  â™«

817
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:18,370
â™«  It's already started, already found it  â™«

818
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:22,110
â™«  Can you hear my love?  â™«

819
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:26,020
â™«  You don't have to do anything  â™«

820
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:32,170
â™«  You just have to show your heart, in my world  â™«

821
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,700
Producer, today was so fun, right?

822
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,850
Yes, so fun.

823
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,580
Let me finish cleaning up here and join you later.

824
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,860
You can go first.

825
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,680
Okay, got it.

826
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,630
See you later!

827
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:19,990
   

828
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,410
Where did Ji Hwan go?

829
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,430
Maybe he went to the restroom.

830
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:39,370
He didn't look like he was going to the restroom.

831
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:42,230
- He's not answering his phone, either. 
 - Really?

832
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,990
Let me ask around.

833
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:55,280
   

834
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,390
It's everywhere.

835
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,240
Restroom!

836
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,220
Where is the restroom?

837
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,240
Oh, no! No, no...

838
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,460
Are you okay?

839
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,880
I'm so sorry.

840
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,430
- What the...? 
 - I'm so sorry.

841
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,270
I didn't realize you were there. Does it hurt?

842
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,840
- Wait. 
 - Oh, no, hold on.

843
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,050
Try... try to stand up.

844
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:36,090
Here, here. Hold onto this.

845
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,920
Okay? I'm sorry.

846
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,600
- I'm sorry! 
 - Hyungnim!

847
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,870
Hyungnim, what are you doing?

848
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:59,810
- Your hand! 
 - Hold it!

849
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:12,580
 If you're fearless but don't know how to use your head, you'll lose it. 

850
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,910
 Stay away from guys like me. 

851
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:17,920
 Don't come within 50 meters of me, got it? 

852
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,350
 50 meters! 

853
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,580
 Hyungnim! Aigoo, Hyungnim! 

854
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,570
Oh, no!

855
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,460
 Hyungnim! 

856
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:06,240
 Hey, do something! 

857
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,610
 Hyungnim! 

858
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,670
Call 112! I mean, 119!

859
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,670
112? 119?

860
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,380
Don't touch him!

861
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,320
- Don't touch him until they come! 
 - What do we do?

862
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,170
Leave him alone! Don't touch him!

863
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:25,380
â™«  I fell for you  â™«

864
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,340
â™«  I may have run into you once or twice  â™«

865
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:37,600
â™«  You have such a unique charm  â™«

866
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:43,630
â™«  I try to forget you  â™«

867
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:49,850
â™«  But I just miss you more and more  â™«

868
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,950
   

869
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,340
 Is she part of Kitty Gang? 

870
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,280
 What's the use? 

871
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,160
 The fire has been lit. 

872
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,840
 People get into fights. 

873
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,700
 The problem is posting it online. 

874
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,490
 Why am I hiding? 

875
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:06,860
 Who is he? 

876
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,040
 Flash mob! 

877
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,660
 It's explicit. I don't think he posted it himself. 

878
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,160
 Want some? 

879
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,530
 How are you feeling? 

880
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:18,180
 I know I should be scared of you, 

881
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,000
 but I'm not. 

882
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:29,020
