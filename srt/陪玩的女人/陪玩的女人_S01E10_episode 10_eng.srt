00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,580
How did you know...

29
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,480
What's going on? What brings you here?

30
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,880
   

31
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,760
It's so hot.

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,970
Seo Ji Hwan. What are you doing?

33
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,880
We were in the middle of a conversation.

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,870
Aigoo, sure. I have something to say, too.

35
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,700
I don't know what that is, but we should talk at the office later.

36
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,530
Not to you.

37
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,990
To Go Eun Ha.

38
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,410
- Me? 
 - Yes.

39
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,270
We're cleaning the house.

40
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,140
What? Cleaning the house?

41
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,660
Yes. Today is cleaning day. We have to go right now.

42
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,010
I've never heard of that.

43
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,560
Of course! It's the first time I'm telling you. Let's go.

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,400
But...

45
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,910
But...

46
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,210
I'm talking to him right now,

47
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,550
so start without me. I'll do it later.

48
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,860
No, we have a house rule that everyone cleans together.

49
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,880
Follow the rules while you're with us. Let's go.

50
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,810
I saidâ€”

51
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,170
I said, leave some of the work for me, and I'll do it later.

52
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,810
Okay?

53
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,860
Aren't you going to leave?

54
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,380
Fine, I'll go. I'll go clean.

55
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,690
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

56
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,560
Let's talk later. I'll call you.

57
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,590
Let me take you home.

58
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,880
It's okay. I can go alone.

59
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,910
But...

60
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,550
What are you trying to do here?

61
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,720
Do you...

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,150
like Eun Ha?

63
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,460
Why do I need to answer that, Prosecutor?

64
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,580
You're a dangerous person, Seo Ji Hwan.

65
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,210
To find one employee,

66
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,820
you involved a drug cartel, Kitty Gang, cops, prosecutors, investigations.

67
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,440
Nothing's simple with you.

68
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,370
Isn't that so?

69
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,500
Do you think someone like that is capable...

70
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,760
of having someone by their side?

71
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,220
Prosecutor.

72
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,780
I know best what kind of person I am.

73
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,080
I know best what kind of danger surrounds me.

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
Everything you've thought of 10 times,

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,530
I've thought of a hundred or a thousand times or more.

76
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,930
If I hadn't, it would have been easier to catch me.

77
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,200
How about your father?

78
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,980
Did you think that far?

79
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,480
The things you're thinking about and concerned about...

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,240
will never happen.

81
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,580
I'll give my life to protect Eun Ha.

82
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,580
 Seo Ji Hwan. 

83
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,390
The table felt full with four.

84
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,530
It feels empty with one seat vacant.

85
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,500
It's been vacant for 30 years.

86
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,620
He liked these soy sauce black beans.

87
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,890
Isn't he coming back for some?

88
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,410
Is this a restaurant?

89
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,770
Is it?

90
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,760
Why would a complete stranger come back to eat these beans?

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm just saying! He's cute!

92
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,200
Cute?

93
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,520
A man should eat like a man and answer like a man.

94
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,680
He looks like a sissy.

95
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,430
Pecking at his food.

96
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,450
Why does he eat like that? Eat like a man!

97
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
It's like talking to a wall.

98
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,870
Why does it taste like this? Did it go bad?

99
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,710
Is the taste off?

100
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,100
- It tastes just fine. 
 - It's so fishy.

101
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,250
Mom, Dad, I'm here!

102
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,190
Hey.

103
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,880
Aigoo, my second daughter is here!

104
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,250
Were you eating already?

105
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,710
I got Dad's favorite marinated crab and Mom's favorite sushi.

106
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,240
You don't have to buy all that when you're coming home!

107
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,250
You can just come over!

108
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,100
- I'm late! 
 - Sit, sit.

109
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,890
- This looks so good! 
 - Sit.

110
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,350
Why did you bring fishy stuff?

111
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,750
I brought it for Dad!

112
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,940
Good job.

113
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,160
"Good job."

114
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,200
Let's see, let's see.

115
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,830
Wow. I have to win this time.

116
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,290
Let's go, Dad.

117
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,090
- Shall we? 
 - Let's go.

118
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,060
Let's go!

119
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,660
Let's go, let's go!

120
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,610
You got nothing. Nothing.

121
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,400
My turn.

122
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,510
Godori!

123
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,550
Godori.

124
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,780
Godori, godori.

125
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,010
Wow, godori.

126
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,700
Let's see...

127
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,740
Godori plus samgwang.

128
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,830
I have 19 points. Mom gets 38 with the gwangbak.

129
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,790
Dad, gwangbak, peebak. No need to count points.

130
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,000
Give me your face.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,130
You can't die anymore.

132
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,520
My second daughter.

133
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,510
- Is this why you came home? 
 - Yes, it is.

134
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,970
- Give me your face. 
 - Okay.

135
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,940
I'm so scared. She's a sociopath.

136
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,950
She's good at drawing, too.

137
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,510
You startled me.

138
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,030
What? When did you come in?

139
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,730
About five minutes ago.

140
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,700
Why didn't you say anything?

141
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,170
Are you a ninja? Make some noise.

142
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,880
I called you three times.

143
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,190
Didn't you hear me?

144
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,650
- What's up? 
 - Sister-in-law isn't coming home tonight.

145
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,920
Stop calling her thatâ€”

146
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,370
- Wait, why? 
 - She's staying over at a friend's place.

147
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,360
Something happened, right?

148
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,540
No wonder she's not coming home. Did you talk about cleaning there?

149
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,890
What else could I do? The prosecutor confessed his feelings first,

150
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,740
so what could I say?

151
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,380
They were drinking at the park, all friendly...

152
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,200
"Get a headstart. Attack first. Don't let your guard down."

153
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,080
You used to say that all the time.

154
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,780
He stole your timing. What will you do now?

155
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,660
Are you rubbing salt in the wound?

156
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,740
I was trying to get advice.

157
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,230
If rubbing salt on your wound would work, I would've done it already.

158
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,440
If you know it so well,

159
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,040
has it always worked for you without a hitch?

160
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,590
 A guy who calls it a "mistake" like a coward? 

161
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,850
 I'm not into it, either. 

162
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,010
If Eun Ha likes the prosecutor, how could I hang onto her?

163
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,630
It's not like I'm ordinary like other people.

164
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,500
You seem to think you're special, but that's narcissistic.

165
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,580
Your face...

166
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,080
Your personality is a little below average.

167
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,610
You know what I mean. Stop kidding around.

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,700
I think the difference between you and that prosecutor...

169
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,790
is that he was honest about his feelings and you weren't.

170
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,990
That's all.

171
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,720
If you like her, tell her honestly.

172
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,360
You don't know how she feels.

173
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,820
Why give up already?

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,810
Today was so fun, wasn't it?

175
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,240
You usually go easy on them.

176
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,070
You were merciless today.

177
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,260
Did it energize you to get a confession of love?

178
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,870
I got energy, and I got anger, too.

179
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,700
They say even a penguin woos another penguin by offering a rock.

180
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,320
He even looks like a penguin.

181
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,190
How can he be worse than a penguin?

182
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm the idiot for expecting something when his mouth is frozen shut.

183
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,800
Hey. It's a good thing.

184
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,200
I thought those people must at least have loyalty, but they don't.

185
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,320
Fine. They can stick together and live beautifully forever.

186
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,660
Why are you angrier than me?

187
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,070
At the hospital,

188
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,500
I gave you two some time alone and ended up with a neck spasm.

189
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,700
I'm so mad I did that for nothing. You get it, right?

190
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,470
I know. I mean, you know I rarely get this angry, right?

191
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,230
No use getting upset over someone who's impossible. It's draining me. Let's just sleep.

192
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,500
Yes, all this is just draining us.

193
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,900
I'll go pack first thing in the morning.

194
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,960
Good night.

195
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,880
You, too.

196
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,170
Be honest... be honest.

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,840
- Please like 
 - and subscribe!

198
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,310
   

199
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,670
Hurry up.

200
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,360
Why are we having a meeting at the crack of dawn?

201
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,000
It's 9 a.m.

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,050
It's the weekend. That's the crack of dawn.

203
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,580
Little Rat spent the night elsewhere.

204
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,980
Noona didn't come home?

205
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,150
- No. 
 - I knew it.

206
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,060
Hyungnim was walking around all night, getting no sleep.

207
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,260
How could he help it?

208
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,700
- He saw her with a guy. 
 - A guy?

209
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,970
What guy?

210
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,470
I only saw him from afar, but he was tall and pretty good-looking.

211
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,480
We don't need to worry, then.

212
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,920
What happened to all that shower head business?

213
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,520
Why did he lose sleep over this?

214
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,880
That's the concern, dude.

215
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,800
She's having a beef with Hyungnim. Imagine if she had a man.

216
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,200
She's leaving one hundred percent.

217
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,090
Don't you think the two of them should make up first?

218
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,300
That's what I'm saying. Anyone got ideas?

219
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,450
We just had a plan go wrong.

220
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,700
So, the shower head...

221
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,250
There's one last card we could play.

222
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,110
What is it?

223
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,280
Five, six...

224
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,060
Honestly...

225
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,020
Be honest...

226
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,520
Eun Ha.

227
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,120
I have something to tell you.

228
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,690
Can we talk today?

229
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,100
That's too direct.

230
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,690
Did you sleep okay?

231
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,800
When are you coming home?

232
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,680
Eun Ha.

233
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,090
Geez! What do I say?

234
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,470
This is so frustrating!

235
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,880
Please, please...

236
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,460
I'm going crazy...

237
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,700
- Mi Ho. 
 - Yeah.

238
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,530
I'm in the bathroom.

239
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,230
 I'm heading out. 

240
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,050
Wait, wait. I'll take you.

241
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,530
- You'll take me? 
 - Yeah.

242
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,200
How come? You're wearing that?

243
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,910
Come on. Wait for me outside.

244
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,990
I should talk to the prosecutor before it's too late, shouldn't I?

245
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,330
I feel bad leaving him hanging.

246
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,280
Right?

247
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,550
Huh?

248
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,400
Yeah, yeah.

249
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,590
Hey! She's here.

250
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,950
- Did you order fruit again? 
 - Hey.

251
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,670
Aren't they from your house?

252
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,400
They are.

253
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,050
This is deer. Deer.

254
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,830
The target is here. But there are two.

255
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,140
This is the bulldog. Get both of them in the car, over.

256
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,290
I'll get the target and leave. Over.

257
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,540
- Over what? 
 - Aigoo, aigoo, that scared me!

258
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,150
Aigoo, you scared me!

259
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,420
You scared me. You scared me so much, Hyungnim.

260
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,130
Hyungnim, could you come outside with me for a minute?

261
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,480
No.

262
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,760
It'll just take a second, Hyungnim. Just a second.

263
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,750
- What are you doing? 
 - It'll just take a second, Hyungnim.

264
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,130
- What are you two doing? 
 - Il Yeong, we need you, too.

265
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,120
You come. Come, come.

266
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,330
- It'll just take a second. A second. 
 - Geez...

267
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,780
- Just a second. 
 - What, what?

268
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,560
Dong Hee. Hong Gi.

269
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,990
You have a friend with you.

270
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,840
Are you guys going somewhere?

271
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,790
That's...

272
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,910
Man Ho?

273
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,510
Hyung is sick.

274
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,200
Hyung is sick? Who? Seo Ji Hwan?

275
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,650
Yes.

276
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,490
J-Just get in the car, Noona.

277
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,210
- Where are we going? 
 - I'll explain on the way.

278
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,160
- Eun Ha, call me. 
 - Your friend can come too.

279
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,660
- Bye. 
 - Come with us.

280
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,220
- Why? 
 - Just get in the car.

281
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,230
- Me? 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

282
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,040
- Why? 
 - Quickly.

283
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,860
Why am I going? I have my car.

284
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,270
I'll get your car key.

285
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,770
Quickly! Hyungnim, let's go!

286
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,050
Let's go, Hyungnim!

287
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,130
Hyungnim! Hyungnim is here!

288
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,470
Why do we need to talk outside?

289
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,130
It's important, Hyungnim.

290
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,670
- Quickly. 
 - There's a big problem.

291
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,900
You need to come with me immediately.

292
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,090
It's huge.

293
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,720
Just go, dude. Hurry up. Stop talking.

294
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,690
- Why won't you tell me? 
 - You'll know when you get there.

295
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,710
- Big trouble. 
 - Drive, drive.

296
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,440
- Drive! 
 - Hurry up and get in.

297
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,070
Hurry up and get in.

298
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,280
Hyungnim! Get in, Hyungnim.

299
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,160
Get in the car. Get in, Hyungnim. Hurry up and go in.

300
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,540
What is going onâ€”

301
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,440
- Start the car! Now! 
 - Seat belt!

302
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,310
Go now!

303
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,260
What's going on here?

304
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,750
Hyungnim, if you don't put your seat belt on, you'll fall again.

305
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,490
Let's go!

306
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,490
- Hey. 
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

307
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,930
Can you explain what's going on?

308
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,760
- Hyungnim. 
 - It's the weekend...

309
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
- Bonding... 
 - Family trip...

310
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,060
I mean, it's the weekend.

311
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,940
We can bond as a family and get some fresh air.

312
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,960
Isn't it nice to do a quick getaway? Don't you think, Hyung, Noona?

313
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,400
- Somewhere close? 
 - Yes.

314
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,710
Man Ho, let me out. I need to pack and do a bunch of stuff.

315
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,470
Let me out with her.

316
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,340
- Man Ho. 
 - I'm sorry, Sister-in-Law.

317
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,980
The brakes are broken.

318
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,970
Noona, come with us. It's the last time.

319
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,340
We've grown so close.

320
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,390
Think of it as making last memories together. Come with us.

321
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,820
Hey.

322
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,040
Once you get back, make sure you move out.

323
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,200
- Let me out over there. 
 - Just go, just go.

324
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,170
- Why aren't you pulling over? 
 - We know you're not on our side,

325
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,790
so we can't let you go.

326
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,400
Your rude friend will change her mind once she gets some fresh air in her nose.

327
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,600
Just go.

328
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,020
I have chronic rhinitis. My sinuses are clogged.

329
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,080
If I don't return the car today, my store can't do business.

330
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,390
The car? We'll return it for you.

331
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,330
Can we tow it?

332
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,980
Yes. I'll call a guy I know.

333
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,080
What's your address?

334
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,480
- Gosh! What a schmuck. 
 - A schmuck?

335
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,150
- What's a schmuck? 
 - It's a good thing.

336
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,080
Really? You're a schmuck, Hyungnim.

337
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,930
   

338
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,070
   

339
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,110
   

340
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,460
   

341
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,790
   

342
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,790
Is it Monday?

343
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,160
Or Sunday?

344
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,880
Is it Monday? It's Sunday.

345
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,680
It's Sunday. Why are you here, Chief Oh?

346
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,630
My daughter invited her friends over to throw a party.

347
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,460
I felt too old to be there.

348
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,160
The house is a mess. So I slipped out.

349
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,770
Why are you spending this precious weekend at the office?

350
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,330
You're reading about Seo Tae Pyung.

351
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,000
Why are you looking at stuff from 10 years ago?

352
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,340
I thought it might help the investigation.

353
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,520
The investigation? I'll be sure to give you a year-end bonus for your efforts.

354
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
Right.

355
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,100
Anyway, who could have known?

356
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,800
The heir, Seo Ji Hwan, stabbed his father in the back.

357
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,400
Go Yang Hui, who got passed over, is on Seo Tae Pyung's team 10 years later.

358
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,670
If I were Seo Ji Hwan, I'd have immigrated a long time ago.

359
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,700
If two people who hate me joined forces, I'd be so nervous I couldn't even piss in peace.

360
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,110
He's not the only one who's nervous.

361
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,490
The guys around him are nervous, too.

362
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,850
Let's just focus on our work.

363
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,590
Go Yang Hui's drug money...

364
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,720
is likely the hidden funds from Seo Tae Pyung that we couldn't track down 10 years ago.

365
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,960
Please find some clues by the end of the day.

366
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,830
You and me?

367
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,790
By the end of the day? All of this? On a Sunday?

368
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,680
It's Sunday. A holiday.

369
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,540
You, too?

370
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,020
These are the files you requested.

371
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,000
Thank you. Please.

372
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,760
Wow, I was going to kick back and watch baseball. It's more chaotic here.

373
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,520
No matter where I run, it's work, work, work, work.

374
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,420
Work, we need to break up.

375
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,210
Let's get this done today.

376
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,410
Is a trip supposed to feel like this?

377
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,520
I haven't gone on many trips.

378
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,610
Should we turn on the radio? It's so quiet.

379
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,960
That, that. That over there.

380
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,930
Can I eat it?

381
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,780
Here you go.

382
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,150
Thank you.

383
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,790
Hey, have one.

384
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,620
Thank you.

385
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,310
This is so good.

386
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,390
Eun Ha.

387
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,210
- Sorry. 
 - Man Ho, what are you doing?

388
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,350
I'm so sorry.

389
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,900
Eun Ha, I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose. Suddenly...

390
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,170
- the car... 
 - It's fine.

391
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,040
- Hey, one more! 
 - I'm sorry!

392
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,490
Seriously? Come on.

393
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,800
Hey, you!

394
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,480
You two!

395
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,860
- I'm sorry, Hyungnim. 
 - Get it together.

396
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,420
- Are you okay? Are you hurt? 
 - No.

397
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,700
I'll do better, Hyungnim.

398
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,330
What's with this...

399
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,880
Isn't the prosecutor acting odd today?

400
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,320
He's throwing himself into work like someone who got rejected after confessing his feelings.

401
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,370
I can hear you.

402
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,710
You have good hearing.

403
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,820
You're not the type who would do that impulsively without buying flowers.

404
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,830
I wasn't rejected.

405
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,190
That means you told a girl you liked her.

406
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,960
Who is it? Who could it be?

407
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,040
Is it her? Mini Unni?

408
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,690
I caught you on a date.

409
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,330
I didn't realize what time it was.

410
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,720
It's weekend. I'll buy lunch. What would you like?

411
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,330
If it's Mini Unni, why are you in distress?

412
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,740
Maybe you have a rival, and she has feelings for your rival?

413
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,400
Wow! Chief Oh, you should go ahead and start a mind-reading business.

414
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,560
In terms of love, I have no equal in Korea today.

415
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,000
Anyway, if it's a questionable confession, it's better not to do it.

416
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,800
Based on my experience,

417
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,030
girls could go, "Oppa, you're so funny! You're so fun!"

418
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,360
"Oppa, you're the life of the party! What would I do without you? You're the best!"

419
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,400
But once you tell her how you feel,

420
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,540
they ghost you immediately.

421
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,430
That's why I can't remember any of my female hoobaes' faces.

422
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:35,000
If you can't return someone's feelings, cutting them off is the polite thing to do.

423
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,500
That's why someone might choose to hide their feelings to stay in that person's life.

424
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,090
Weren't you aware you might never see her again?

425
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,060
I didn't think of that.

426
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,790
I just...

427
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,750
really wanted to tell her at the moment.

428
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,780
That's why I did it.

429
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,910
- This is nice. 
 - Where are we?

430
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,990
Let me carry that.

431
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,020
- Hyungnim. 
 - Let's go inside.

432
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,940
Noona! Noona, hurry up.

433
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,400
- Hurry! 
 - Let's go in.

434
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,660
- Hyungnim. 
 - Go on in.

435
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,390
- Aigoo, Sister-in-Law. You don't have to do that. 
 - Hyungnim.

436
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,720
You don't have to lift a finger. Let me do it.

437
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,650
Where are you going? There are so many bags. Carry this one.

438
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,570
Carry this. Quickly.

439
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,420
- While we're here... 
 - Are all the bags out?

440
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,040
Oh, Hyungnim! Take this, too!

441
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,430
You got ketchup on your shirt.

442
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,410
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

443
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,400
Hey, hey. Open the door.

444
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,930
Hey! What are you doing?

445
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,200
Have a seat. Relax.

446
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,190
Have a seat.

447
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,340
Noona.

448
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,930
Are you really a hairdresser?

449
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,390
What kind of hairstyle would suit me?

450
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,120
The shadow perm is not bad.

451
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,250
I think just toning down your color would be nice.

452
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,760
Tone it down?

453
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,600
- Is it a little too bright? 
 - Yeah, a little bit.

454
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,920
How about him?

455
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,890
Let me see.

456
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,360
- What's your personal color? 
 - I'm cool-toned.

457
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,810
- Aren't you warm-tone? 
 - I don't think so.

458
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,890
- He's good-looking tone. 
 - Come on.

459
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,330
- You'll look good with anything. 
 - You like pretty boys.

460
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,610
Il Yeong, is Hyungnim still in the shower?

461
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,370
Noona, I'll stop by the salon. Can I get your number?

462
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,350
- Dude! Is he still in the shower? 
 - Yeah.

463
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,360
Yes. He's taking a long time.

464
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,620
Why didn't you say so?

465
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,780
I'll look around for a minute. Mi Ho, want to come?

466
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,520
I'm going to get some rest. Go ahead.

467
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,300
See you.

468
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,430
Hong Gi, eat this.

469
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,050
Thanks.

470
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,860
 If you like her, tell her honestly. 

471
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,940
 You don't know how she feels. 

472
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,330
 Why give up already? 

473
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,380
You shouldn't eat uncooked ramen.

474
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,940
We brought all the groceries.

475
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,360
That looks good on you.

476
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,430
If the hanger is good, everything looks good on it.

477
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,560
Dong Hee, where's Eun Ha?

478
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,540
She went outside to look around.

479
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,020
Really?

480
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,190
W-W-Why isn't she back? It's been more than an hour.

481
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,790
- Hey, call her. Call her now. Right now. 
 - Yeah, call.

482
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,010
 The phone is turned off. After the tone... 

483
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,230
Her phone's off.

484
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,210
Her battery must've run out.

485
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,350
I tried calling her a while ago.

486
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,630
Why are you telling us now?

487
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,970
- Try her again. 
 - Hyungnim!

488
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,260
Where are you going?

489
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,650
She's probably just circling around.

490
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,290
Circling around?

491
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,850
These people are impossible.

492
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,680
- Do you see her? 
 - Hyungnim.

493
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,750
- Do you see her? 
 - No.

494
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,480
Hyungnim.

495
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,420
I didn't see her on the way to the supermarket.

496
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,640
Where did she go?

497
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,540
Did she go home?

498
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,150
 Drive, drive! 

499
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,670
 Hurry up and get in. 

500
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,620
- Hyungnim! 
 - Where are you going?

501
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,190
Hyungnim, she's not over there.

502
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,560
Where are you going?

503
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,170
I told you she's not over there.

504
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,740
- Ow! 
 - Dong Hee! Dong Hee!

505
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,670
Little Rat might come back.

506
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,500
Look for her around here. Okay?

507
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,720
Eun Ha!

508
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,840
Eun Ha!

509
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,960
- Sister-in-Law! 
 - Noona!

510
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,010
- Do we really need to do this? 
 - Little Rat!

511
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,680
Sister-in-Law!

512
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,050
I'm sure she'll be back!

513
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,930
Teacher!

514
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,990
Eun Ha!

515
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,550
   

516
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,520
Eun Ha.

517
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,030
Eun Ha!

518
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,610
Eun Ha!

519
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,830
Eun Ha!

520
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,490
Go Eun Ha!

521
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,260
Eun Ha!

522
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,710
Eun Ha!

523
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,320
 Eun Ha! 

524
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,980
 Go Eun Ha! 

525
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,200
 Go Eun Ha! 

526
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,290
Seo Ji Hwan?

527
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,790
Go Eun Ha!

528
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,680
 Go Eun Ha! 

529
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,480
Eun Ha, Eun Ha.

530
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,500
Eun Ha...

531
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,260
Eun Haâ€”

532
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,220
Eun Ha.

533
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,650
Go Eun Ha!

534
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,360
- Gosh... 
 - Eun Ha!

535
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,970
Seo Ji Hwan, what...

536
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,520
Go Eun Ha! Where were you?

537
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,090
W-W-What's wrong?

538
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,810
â™«  Once I see you, twice I see you, I keep wanting to see you more  â™«

539
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:06,590
â™«  Your beautiful figure, I keep wanting to see it more  â™«

540
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,100
â™«  Anyone who sees you once keeps staring at you endlessly  â™«

541
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,840
Eun Ha. Eun Ha.

542
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,500
E-E-Eun Ha.

543
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,800
Are you okay?

544
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,420
Are you hurt?

545
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,660
- I'm fine. Are you okay? 
 - Are you really okay?

546
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,870
I'm fine. Are you okay?

547
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,400
Why did you come all the way here alone? You should have told us you were leaving!

548
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,700
Why is your phone off? No one's around! What if something happened?

549
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,200
What if something terrible happened? Why are you so reckless?

550
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,870
What?

551
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,730
W-Why are you yelling at me?

552
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,650
I was just taking a walk.

553
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,980
Why are you taking a walk by yourself? I was so worried!

554
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,150
I-I mean, we were all so worried.

555
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,200
Did I ask you to worry about me?

556
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,350
You said you're used to being alone. So just be alone and be comfortable.

557
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,620
Why do you keep coming after me every time? It's confusing. You scared me to death!

558
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,740
I-I-I like you.

559
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,500
I'm sorry. I mean...

560
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,700
What?

561
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,090
I'm sorry I got angry and yelled at you. I'm sorry.

562
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,580
What did you just say?

563
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,520
- I'm really, really sorry. 
 - Not that. Before that.

564
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,540
I like you.

565
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,000
Eun Ha.

566
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,650
I like you.

567
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,170
Eun Ha,

568
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,600
I really...

569
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,070
really, really...

570
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,650
like you. Only you.

571
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,830
- Iâ€” Ow! 
 - W-What?

572
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,600
- W-What's wrong? 
 - It hurts...

573
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
It's fine.

574
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,290
It's not fine. It's swollen.

575
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,510
Get on my back.

576
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,340
- I'm fine. 
 - Don't be stubborn. Get on my back.

577
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,050
Okay. That's good.

578
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,110
Get back safe.

579
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,770
What did he say? Did he find her?

580
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,630
- Is she okay? 
 - Yes, she's fine.

581
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,800
What did I say? She's fine.

582
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,560
When he said, "Eun Ha! Where are you?" he made us all nervous.

583
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,460
What a relief. I'm hungry. Let's make food.

584
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,470
All right, get moving.

585
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,680
I couldn't get to the bathroom because of Sister-in-Law. Can you get the fire started?

586
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,620
I don't know how!

587
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,160
- I don't know how. 
 - Me neither.

588
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,800
I don't do that.

589
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,600
Me neither.

590
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,850
How were you going to grill all this meat like this?

591
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,420
- I'll do it. 
 - You know how?

592
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,440
My family goes camping a lot. I've done it many times.

593
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,790
Wow. Hurry up, then.

594
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,910
- What? 
 - I'm hungry. Hurry up.

595
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,570
- But I'm just a girlâ€” 
 - Let's go inside for the veggies.

596
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,170
- Thanks, Noona. 
 - Mi Ho, want me to help?

597
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,300
No. I-I can do it by myself. G-Go.

598
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,370
Seo Ji Hwan.

599
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,570
Remember how you carried me out of the hospital?

600
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,740
 Who are you? 

601
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,830
â™«  A story from long ago  â™«

602
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:57,660
 Hold onto those cartons and throw them at the milk company. 

603
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,500
â™«  See the moon, moon, moon  â™«

604
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,160
Yes, I do.

605
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,630
I think it started then.

606
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,820
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

607
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:18,200
You don't say much. You pick out mean things to say on purpose.

608
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,200
You lose your temper often, too.

609
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,390
You're awkward with words and even more awkward with actions...

610
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:29,350
You have no idea what a woman wants...

611
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,700
But I still like you, Seo Ji Hwan.

612
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:41,070
â™«  A fateful miracle that recognized each other  â™«

613
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,330
â™«  May it become love  â™«

614
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:51,560
Eun Ha, I'm s-s-sorry. Are you okay?

615
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,060
â™«  You  â™«

616
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,600
Oh, my, my. Are you okay?

617
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,400
Oh, no.

618
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,460
No, I'm really fine.

619
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,220
Let me try walking.

620
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,260
No, no. Get on my back.

621
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,200
â™«  The time when neither of us knew  â™«

622
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,800
Oh, no!

623
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,220
Are you okay?

624
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,500
Yes, I'm okay.

625
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,700
S-Should I walk?

626
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,070
I'm more than okay, Eun Ha.

627
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,060
Are you okay, Eun Ha?

628
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,950
- I'm okay. 
 - I'm going to speed up, then.

629
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,030
No, be gentle...

630
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,370
Wow, Jae Soo did a good job with the fire.

631
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,580
- I did it. 
 - I helped.

632
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,920
Who do I believe?

633
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,950
- Eun Ha. 
 - Teacher.

634
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,440
- What? 
 - Get that chair.

635
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,250
- The chair. 
 - Hyungnim!

636
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,380
What happened?

637
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,250
You said she was okay. She's not okay. Are you hurt?

638
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,660
I just sprained my ankle a little.

639
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,270
What happened? You said you'd be gone briefly. Why did you turn off your phone?

640
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,640
I didn't charge it, and it died.

641
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,350
Sister-in-Law, your shoulders, your back! Your legs and knees!

642
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:14,370
- What do we do? 
 - I'm fine, Man Ho.

643
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,690
I'm sorry.

644
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,420
Little Rat, sit here. Got it? We're making dinner. Grill the meat.

645
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,680
Don't move an inch.

646
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,240
Let me help a little.

647
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,830
Don't move an inch.

648
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,670
What is all this? So clumsy.

649
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,550
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

650
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,780
Grill the meat. Hurry up.

651
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,250
Grill the meat!

652
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,100
   

653
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,320
Chairman.

654
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,200
This is the monthly sales log.

655
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,040
Much higher than last month.

656
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,970
- I'll bring over the club logs tomorrow. 
 - From now on,

657
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,040
Executive Director Park will take care of the sales.

658
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,050
Pardon?

659
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,700
Why would he do that? I've always done it.

660
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,370
You were summoned by the prosecution.

661
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,100
Why didn't you tell me?

662
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,740
Oh, that? T-That... They just asked me to be there as a material witness...

663
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:28,540
I told you not to make any decisions with your head.

664
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,510
- C-Chairman... 
 - Until things wrap up,

665
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,220
don't make a peep, and lay low.

666
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,100
   

667
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,680
Thanks for your patience.

668
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,900
This is our company's special package!

669
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,130
You can enjoy sirloin, rib meat, and pork belly all at once.

670
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,230
A tomahawk steak. I'll open it up now! A round of applause!

671
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,790
Wow!

672
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:13,910
Here we go.

673
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,600
A round of applause!

674
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,730
It looks like an axe.

675
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,040
A little bit of salt.

676
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,200
And then...

677
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,380
It's so big.

678
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,100
It needs to be seasoned to make it good.

679
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,800
It looks so good.

680
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,470
- It needs a little bit of this. 
 - Man Ho.

681
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,800
You always do this. Let me do it this time.

682
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,300
- That's all right, I got it. 
 - No, it's okay.

683
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,710
Hyungnim, can we just enjoy the meat?

684
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,610
- He's almost done. 
 - Can I just do it?

685
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,870
Man Ho, you just do it.

686
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,060
Man Ho, you do it!

687
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,930
â™«  I've fallen for you  â™«

688
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,450
Aigoo, it's all burnt. Look at the smoke...

689
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:03,020
â™«  I may have run into you once or twice  â™«

690
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,440
Give me some water! The water!

691
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,700
The water! Give it here!

692
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,110
Well...

693
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,350
maybe it's crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.

694
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:15,130
â™«  I try to forget you  â™«

695
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,260
â™«  But I just miss you more and more  â™«

696
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,950
Aigoo. That's going to be good.

697
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,270
Galbi. Pork belly.

698
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,010
Wow! So detailed. Look at his eye for detail.

699
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:35,000
Where did you learn that?

700
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,280
Can you not reach past her, Hyungnim?

701
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,160
Everyone, eat. Let's share.

702
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,480
All of these are products from our company.

703
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,370
Where's that place with plenty of oceans and mountains? Where potatoes grow?

704
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,900
Pigs love potatoes. They say even the potatoes taste like pork.

705
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,060
He's so funny.

706
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,850
- Little Rat! 
 - Yes?

707
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,950
- Try it. Say ah. 
 - Yes?

708
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,890
- It's okay. 
 - Try it.

709
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,730
Thank you.

710
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,790
It's good, right?

711
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,500
- So good. It melts in your mouth. 
 - Right?

712
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,630
So good.

713
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,590
I'm okay.

714
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,480
Our household's youngest, Dong Hee.

715
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,250
We should take care of our youngest.

716
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,040
Good, right?

717
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,220
Try some meat.

718
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,720
Smell it. It's so flavorful.

719
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
- Later. 
 - You must not like meat very much.

720
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,350
You two came back together. Have you made up?

721
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,610
Do you need to ask?

722
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,460
I don't think Noona is moving anymore.

723
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,800
How do you know that?

724
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,670
She said, "Our household's youngest." Our household.

725
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,060
That's right! She said, "Our household"!

726
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,010
Right? If she were moving in a day or two, she wouldn't say that.

727
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,030
Then she would say, "Your household."

728
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,830
Teacher, are you really not leaving?

729
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,490
Well, I mean...

730
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,020
How could I? When you guys want me to stay so much.

731
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,710
 Yay! 

732
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,480
You can relax now, Hyungnim.

733
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,250
 Go Eun Ha! Go Eun Ha! 

734
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,410
 Go Eun Ha! Go Eun Ha! 

735
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,570
He should stop drinking.

736
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,720
- Who gave him so much alcohol? 
 - He did it to himself.

737
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
Go inside.

738
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,760
- Go inside. 
 - Good night.

739
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,170
Go inside!

740
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,630
Are you okay?

741
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,310
Come on! What are you doing?

742
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,010
Geez! Let's go inside, come on.

743
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,750
Where did it go?

744
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,010
Why don't I have it?

745
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,810
Where did I drop it?

746
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,110
Wait, it can't be here...

747
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,190
I'm going to lose my mind.

748
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,260
I'm going to lose it.

749
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,120
Where...

750
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,630
Where did I put it?

751
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:48,930
What if someone saw it? I haven't even seen it.

752
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,110
Is it in there?

753
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,980
Mi Ho.

754
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,660
Are you okay?

755
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,070
Yes, I'm okay.

756
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,710
Are you looking for something?

757
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,410
No.

758
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,210
I'm not. I'm getting out.

759
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,390
Mi Ho.

760
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,820
Here.

761
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,590
I noticed you barely ate. It's for digestion.

762
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,070
Did you run to the pharmacy?

763
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:39,390
It's not fair if you don't get to eat on vacation.

764
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,340
Thank you.

765
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,170
- Mi Ho. 
 - Oh, and...

766
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,920
It looks like we'll see each other occasionally through Eun Ha.

767
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,050
Let's be comfortable around each other as friends.

768
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,170
So are you together?

769
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,690
What do you mean, together?

770
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,160
If we said "I like you" to each other, are we together?

771
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,570
- It's hot. 
 - I'm going to wash up.

772
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,730
Okay. You go first.

773
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,860
 Eun Ha, can you come outside for a second? 

774
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,770
Are you okay?

775
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,360
Yes.

776
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,180
Have a seat.

777
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,730
I...

778
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,360
- Why... 
 - I'm sorry.

779
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,050
This is for your ankle, Eun Ha.

780
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:05,200
Thank you.

781
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,030
You can p-p-put it on your ankle.

782
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,830
I will. But are you okay, Ji Hwan?

783
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:14,950
- I-I... 
 - Are you...

784
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,960
I'm s-s-so fine.

785
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,850
It's nothing. What's wrong with me?

786
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,830
I'm fine. I wasn't hurt. I'm okay...

787
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,840
But... w-w-why...

788
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,530
No!

789
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,080
Is there something on my face?

790
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,330
S-Stand up. You should go to your room and ice your ankle.

791
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,990
Already?

792
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,800
Y-Yes... I-I'm sorry!

793
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,570
Wait...

794
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,560
She's so pretty.

795
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:57,030
What just happened?

796
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,910
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

797
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,190
This is the last one.

798
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,730
Let me park and come up. Go ahead.

799
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:19,010
- Be safe. 
 - Okay.

800
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,520
What is this?

801
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,350
Does someone have COVID?

802
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,610
   

803
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,990
 Prosecutor, are you free tonight? 

804
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,960
 Weren't you aware you might never see her again? 

805
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:19,470
 That's why someone might choose to hide their feelings to stay in that person's life. 

806
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,030
Going to work?

807
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,100
Oh, y-yes. H-How about you, Eun Ha?

808
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,890
I need to cancel my lease.

809
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,680
Right.

810
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,360
I'll give you the deposit since it was my fault.

811
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,180
No. I did it to myself. I'll take care of it.

812
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,820
Okay.

813
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,360
One second.

814
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,690
W-What's wrong?

815
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,000
Your tie is a little...

816
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,630
I'll do it. It's good now.

817
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,810
It's good.

818
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,340
What? Why is he avoiding me?

819
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,720
Does he think I'll hurt him?

820
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,010
Go, go, go...

821
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,760
That was dangerous.

822
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,300
What's wrong with me...

823
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,170
 Drive, drive! 

824
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,380
 Get in the car! 

825
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:52,740
Without Gang Gil, no one knows how to do their job.

826
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:04,150
Geez, I need to have my revenge against Seo Ji Hwan.

827
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,360
That girl who plays with kids.

828
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,050
Is she still doing that work?

829
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,060
 This is for your ankle, Eun Ha. 

830
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,250
 Thank you. 

831
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,640
 I will. But are you okay, Ji Hwan? 

832
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,420
 I'm s-s-so fine. 

833
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,520
 - One second.  
  - W-What's wrong? 

834
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,840
 It's good. 

835
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,910
Why did he tell me he likes me when he can't even make eye contact?

836
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,200
So funny.

837
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,850
Should I see who wins?

838
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,560
CEO?

839
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:58,720
CEO?

840
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,030
Could you sign?

841
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,360
When did you get here?

842
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:13,560
Hey, Il Yeong. When we were heading out yesterday morning,

843
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,910
I think I saw someone suspicious in front of the house.

844
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,060
Yesterday morning?

845
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,210
I didn't get a good look because I was getting in the car.

846
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:22,480
But you never know. So, check the security cameras around the house.

847
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,780
Got it.

848
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:30,740
   

849
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,620
Eun Ha?

850
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:39,560
 Peek-a-boo! Ji Hwan! 

851
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,400
 It's Eun Ha Unni. 

852
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,510
Do you like bunnies or me?

853
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:48,280
 Do you like "Oppa" or "Honey?" Ji Hwan! Honey! 

854
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,530
W-W-What? What is wrong with me?

855
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,440
Why does this happen whenever I see her lips?

856
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,420
Get it together. What's wrong with you?

857
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,100
I can hold back. Oh, Lord, please answer my call.

858
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:11,140
Help me, Lord.

859
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:20,770
 Ji Hwan! Honey! 

860
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,610
Prosecutor.

861
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,510
Eun Ha, you made it.

862
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:03,360
You haven't eaten yet, right? My treat. What do you want to eat?

863
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,560
Can I really tell you everything I want to eat?

864
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,050
Yes.

865
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,980
This was in the car?

866
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:13,530
At first, I thought it was a COVID test, but Hong Gi said no.

867
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,500
So I figured it out.

868
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,980
Two lines mean pregnant, for sure.

869
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,340
So whose is this?

870
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,040
Little Rat.

871
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,350
Sister-in-Law?

872
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:30,350
Teacher?

873
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,460
Why do you assume the perp is a woman?

874
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,190
It could be one of our girlfriends.

875
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:40,830
In that case, Dong Hee, be honest. Do you have a girlfriend?

876
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,540
- No. 
 - Really?

877
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,050
- How about you? 
 - You know I broke up.

878
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,200
I don't think it's one of ours.

879
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,540
When did you come out?

880
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,300
- What is that? 
 - Il Yeong.

881
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,290
This was on the floor of the car.

882
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,110
It's not a COVID test. It's a pregnancy test.

883
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,220
So whose is it?

884
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,660
If it has two lines, that means she's pregnant.

885
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,520
It has to be Little Rat.

886
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,590
She's the only girl in our house!

887
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,910
 Try some meat. 

888
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:15,380
 Smell it. It's so flavorful. 

889
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,170
 Later. 

890
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,620
 Are you looking for something? 

891
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,560
 No. 

892
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,450
 I'm not. I'm getting out. 

893
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,320
It's really good.

894
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,040
Was ramen really the thing you wanted to eat the most?

895
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:42,590
I don't usually eat stuff like ramen.

896
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:46,090
But the ramen we had was so good that I kept thinking about it.

897
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,050
The supermarket ramen? That was really good.

898
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:53,490
I didn't tell you, but I was so flustered inside.

899
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:58,000
All the places I looked up were closed, and my stomach was grumbling...

900
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,640
I was afraid you'd say you were going to leave.

901
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,630
Maybe that's why it was extra delicious.

902
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,060
Maybe.

903
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,390
- Prosecutor. 
 - Well...

904
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:15,020
Auntie, we're here.

905
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,840
- Hey guys, how many? 
 - Five more.

906
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:21,160
Give me a minute. I'll be right with you.

907
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,270
Should we get tteokbokki?

908
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:24,540
It's a little loud in here.

909
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:28,360
Should we get some ice cream and talk?

910
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,720
Sure. That sounds good.

911
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,020
You bought the ramen, so I'll buy the ice cream.

912
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,520
Sure.

913
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,040
- Should we? 
 - Yes.

914
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,010
Thank you.

915
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,580
Thank you.

916
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:45,120
Honey!

917
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,840
- Honey. 
 - Have you been waiting long?

918
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,630
- No, not at all. 
 - I'm sorry. We got out late.

919
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,270
Ta-da!

920
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:55,820
What is this? They're so pretty!

921
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,530
I got them on the way because they reminded me of you.

922
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,180
So pretty! Take a picture of me with them.

923
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,490
One is never enough. How many do you want?

924
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:04,030
- A hundred! 
 - A hundred? Got it.

925
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:07,920
They're so pretty.

926
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,470
Wow, it's so nice to walk like this.

927
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,010
The ice cream is so good, too.

928
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:21,980
I guess sweet and salty is the way to go.

929
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,370
Prosecutor, you kind of eat like a child.

930
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,500
I actually wanted to see you to tell you something.

931
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,740
I realized I've never said thank you.

932
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,570
Isn't that weird? I have so much to thank you for.

933
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,240
At first, as a prosecutor.

934
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,510
Then as someone who might be Hyun Woo.

935
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,310
And as Mr. Justice.

936
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,820
You have no idea what a comfort you've been to me.

937
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,580
Prosecutor.

938
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,660
I have someone I like.

939
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,670
So I don't think I can see you like this anymore.

940
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,310
You're a good person.

941
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:25,560
You'll meet someone much better than me.

942
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,950
Well...

943
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,700
Eun Ha.

944
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,380
You don't have to take it so seriously.

945
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,480
I'm good at moving on.

946
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,960
Instead,

947
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,630
even if you regret letting me get away,

948
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,570
I might not come back.

949
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,010
So...

950
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:07,520
call me whenever you need help.

951
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,420
To know a prosecutor...

952
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,360
might come in handy later in life.

953
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,420
I'm sorry I was weighing on you...

954
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,370
for the past few days.

955
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,730
Should we go?

956
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,660
I'll call it a night, Prosecutor.

957
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,520
Right.

958
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,380
I decided to keep living here.

959
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,760
Eun Ha.

960
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,550
It's not going to be awkward between us.

961
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,410
All right?

962
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,560
Yes, Prosecutor.

963
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,040
With that in mind...

964
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,100
Oh, my, Seo Ji Hwan!

965
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,300
Seo Ji Hwan.

966
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,480
What? What are you doing?

967
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,910
Let's go, Baby!

968
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,620
What's with you?

969
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,830
Hold on. Wait. Prosecutor, wait.

970
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:01,830
Let's go, Baby! Oppa will make you ramen!

971
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:04,810
Baby? What's wrong with you? Prosecutor!

972
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:08,100
I'm sorry! I'll call you later!

973
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,020
Get home safe!

974
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,810
- "Let's go, Baby"?
