3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,360

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,040
   

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,370
♫  Baby, baby, let me come along  ♫

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,420
♫  Every single day I belong  ♫

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,540
♫  Baby, baby, let me come along  ♫

00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,390
♫  Keep you happy all day long  ♫

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,000
   

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,020
   

11
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,670
♫  This is so fun  ♫

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,100
 Looks fun. 

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,960
 But will you be laughing in an hour? 

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:12,030


15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,680
Dong Hee.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,590
Teacher.

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,290
Hey!

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,740
 How dare you come here, bastard! 

19
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,990
 Dong Hee. 

20
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,400
 Dong Hee... 

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,670
 You must be out of your mind. 

22
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,290
W-W-What's wrong?

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,910
What the hell?

24
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,510
Who are you?

25
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,390
Who am I?

26
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,190
I'm the older brother of the girl this bastard killed.

27
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,050
Yes, this is Jang Hyun Woo.

28
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,340
Prosecutor, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,130
I know I shouldn't be calling you.

30
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,440
 But Seung Hui's older brother isn't picking up after he said he won't let that kid go. 

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,330
Hold on. What are you talking about?

32
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,560
Who's not letting who go?

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,120
He went to Thirsty Deer to see Dong Hee.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,550
To Thirsty Deer?

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,170
You murderer.

36
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,060
How dare you stand here looking normal.

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,020
You killed somebody, bastard! How could you!

38
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,260
   

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,600
I'm the CEO here. Talk to me.

40
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,020
Oh, yeah? You're the CEO around here?

41
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,140
I heard you're a mobster, and this is a company of ex-cons.

42
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,460
Looking out for your own kind?

43
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,370
You're all criminals. Aren't you?

44
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,650
Does it feel normal when you're around other criminals?

45
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,740
I apologize. I didn't know who you were, so I reacted roughly.

46
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,750
Could we finish this conversation in my office?

47
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,120
What happened?

48
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,760
Dong Hee's victim's family.

49
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,630
Dong Hee.

50
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,700
Sit down.

51
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,540
I'm Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo. I was in charge of the case.

52
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,020
- Can I get you a cup of tea? 
 - No.

53
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,110
Cut the crap and tell me what you're going to do.

54
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,690
What can I do for you?

55
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,130
Are you going to do whatever I say?

56
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,560
Then get on your knees.

57
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,590
Excuse me—

58
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,680
I know your family is in tremendous pain.

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
I am...

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,290
sincerely sorry.

61
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,790
Do you think that's the end of it?

62
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,840
Fire that bastard.

63
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,470
His nameplate on that desk over there.

64
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,530
If you get rid of it right now, I'll leave.

65
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,000
I won't defend him by saying he was young or that he already did his time.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,730
His actions were wrong and resulted in permanent consequences.

67
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,050
But that desk is all Dong Hee has right now.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,110
That's why I need to protect it. I'm sorry.

69
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,930
Is that all? What about our Seung Hui?

70
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,670
Seung Hui never got to have that.

71
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,760
This bastard is well and alive right here,

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,450
but my sister is dead.

73
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
 Hey, Lee Dong Hee! 

74
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,580
 Lee Dong Hee, I got your text! 

75
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,340
 Wow! Where did you get this? Did you buy it? Is it yours? 

76
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,710
 Wow, daebak. 

77
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,210
 How would I afford this? I borrowed it from a friend at work. 

78
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,560
 Still, it's awesome. Totally awesome. Where are we going? 

79
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,350
 The ocean. 

80
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,630
 Really? The ocean? Really, really? 

81
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,980
 You're so cute! So adorable! 

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,320
 How do you drive this thing? 

83
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,840
 What's this? 

84
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,400
 You said you like the ocean. 

85
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,730
 Happy birthday, Choi Seung Hui. 

86
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,640
 Thanks. Let's go to the ocean! 

87
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,240
 We're going to the ocean! 

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,700
 I'm so happy! 

89
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,980
 - It's dangerous! Hang on! 
 - Come on! This is so exciting! 

90
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,090
 Let's get something delicious when we get there. 

91
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,000
 Seung Hui... 

92
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,580
 Open your eyes. 

93
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,660
 Choi Seung Hui... 

94
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,460
 Open your eyes, please... 

95
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,800
I'll quit.

96
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,600
Dong Hee.

97
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,240
- I'll leave. 
 - Good.

98
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,070
Let's go.

99
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,200
Seung Hui's case was very unfortunate.

100
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,390
Dong Hee received a serious sentence for that.

101
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,810
He never returned to school and lived with remorse.

102
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,130
Of course, to the family,

103
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,330
it may not feel like enough.

104
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,240
But Dong Hee has been atoning in his own way.

105
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,840
Please give Dong Hee a chance.

106
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,890
Who are you to say this? You're a prosecutor—

107
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,220
Stop it!

108
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,290
This won't bring back Seung Hui.

109
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,840
Do you think I don't know that? I know that. That's why!

110
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,790
Seung Hui can't come back, but that bastard—

111
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,380
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,610
Get up.

113
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,820
   

114
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,290
Dong Hee.

115
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,460
Dong Hee.

116
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,620
You can stand up now.

117
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,970
Dong Hee, stand up.

118
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,970
- Stand up. 
 - Let's stand up.

119
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,900
- Dong Hee, there you go. 
 - Are you okay?

120
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,800
It's okay.

121
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,960
- I'll step out for a second. 
 - All right.

122
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,110
I don't know if he's okay.

123
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,110
Dong Hee.

124
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,450
Drink this.

125
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,260
Thank you.

126
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
I wasn't interrupting, was I?

127
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,090
No.

128
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,480
Dong Hee, I...

129
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,500
had an oppa that I liked when I was young.

130
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,300
One day, he disappeared in front of my eyes.

131
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,700
But it was because of me.

132
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,490
So I couldn't even blame anyone.

133
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,360
 Some days, I cried because I felt sorry. 

134
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,230
 Some days, I cried because I missed him. 

135
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,370
And then...

136
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,300
I realized that if I could stay strong and be happy,

137
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,200
that was the best thing I could do for him.

138
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,980
I don't think your friend...

139
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,200
would want you to live in pain because of her.

140
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,460
Hang in there, Dong Hee.

141
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,980
♫  My steps have paused briefly  ♫

142
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:39,120
♫  Uncertain of where to go next  ♫

143
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:48,760
♫  For so long my cherished dreams that I longed for dearly  ♫

144
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,520
 It's Seung Hui's mom. 

145
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,570
 I'm sure Seung Hui is well in heaven. 

146
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,290
 So I want you to put down the burden 

147
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,600
   

148
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,520
 and take care. 

149
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,200
♫  At the end of a fading day  ♫

150
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,900
 I will never forget what I did to lose Seung Hui as long as I live. 

151
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,600
 I won't forget how sorry I feel for the rest of my life. 

152
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,600
I didn't have time to prepare food today.

153
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,900
- Dong Hee likes chicken, so we ordered some. 
 - Good idea.

154
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,230
I invited him as a thank-you, but I don't know if Hyungnim will like it.

155
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,950
Drink more of this, Dong Hee. I didn't touch it.

156
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,770
It's okay. You have more, Teacher.

157
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,990
Have one more warm cup.

158
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,740
Dong Hee, drink this one.

159
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,390
You must have been in shock, Eun Ha. Have this warm one.

160
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,100
It's okay, Prosecutor. You drink it.

161
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,430
Eun Ha, drink this cold one.

162
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,710
Excuse me. This has ice in it.

163
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,940
You were in shock. Have something warm. Eun Ha, have some.

164
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,450
What the heck is going on?

165
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,830
 You should drink this one. 

166
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,250
- That didn't work. 
 - What's going on?

167
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,660
It's a moonwalk.

168
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,610
They pushed me.

169
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,310
Well, we didn't have much time, so we ordered something.

170
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,630
Go on in, Hyungnim.

171
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,880
Like and subscribe!

172
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,930
   

173
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,030
Everyone went through a lot today. You too, Prosecutor.

174
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,650
It's nothing. I was in charge of the case.

175
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,130
Dong Hee, you handled it well.

176
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,480
Dong Hee, you did well. Have a drumstick.

177
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,240
Take the drumstick and munch!

178
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,780
Dong Hee likes the marinated ones. Dong Hee.

179
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,320
Prosecutor, you too. Take a drumstick and munch!

180
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,170
Oh. I'm okay. I'll eat on my own.

181
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,840
Okay.

182
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,780
Little Rat, that was scary, right? Eat this and calm down.

183
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,550
Eat this and munch, munch!

184
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,110
Hyungnim likes the neck meat.

185
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,990
Take the neck meat and munch!

186
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,080
You munch.

187
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,950
Hyung, you're going to get your neck snapped.

188
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,860
I apologize for putting everyone through that.

189
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,640
Dong Hee, it's okay.

190
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,620
Sometimes in life, a day like this happens. Right?

191
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,330
Yeah, dude. Thanks to you, we all got to skip work.

192
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,840
We know that Hyungnim's knees are fine. Good job. It was a very meaningful day.

193
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,930
- Let's eat. 
 - Enjoy.

194
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,400
When Dong Hee said he'd work at Thirsty Deer,

195
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,900
I was against it.

196
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,800
I had negative feelings about Seo Ji Hwan.

197
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,330
Plus, I thought people might have negative associations.

198
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
But...

199
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,200
I think I was wrong.

200
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,900
For Dong Hee, you are good colleagues and a good family.

201
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,890
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

202
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,240
You scared me! That's what you meant?

203
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,760
Prosecutor, are you trying to see how we react?

204
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,760
Let's eat! I'm hungry.

205
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,510
Maybe I'll try it then.

206
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,850
Yes, go ahead. It's delicious!

207
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,370
You like this kind, right?

208
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,630
You must face a lot of challenges running a company.

209
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm sure it's the same anywhere else.

210
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,120
People, I mean, especially criminals...

211
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,730
I thought they'd never change.

212
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,300
But turns out that's not necessarily true.

213
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,620
Thank you for saying that.

214
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,750
No need to thank me.

215
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,200
Go Yang Hui is watching Eun Ha.

216
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
You know that, right?

217
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,510
Yes, I do.

218
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,890
People like Go Yang Hui are unpredictable and more dangerous.

219
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,100
To prevent someone like him from roaming freely,

220
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,500
Seo Ji Hwan, I need your help.

221
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,110
I should be asking you.

222
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,560
Anytime you need.

223
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,170
I appreciate your help.

224
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,860
I look forward to working with you.

225
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,850
Did the Prosecutor leave?

226
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,690
Yes. But are you going somewhere?

227
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,430
Let's get some fresh air together.

228
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,630
- Fresh air? 
 - Get changed.

229
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,000
- Right now? 
 - I'll wait for you outside.

230
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Have you been up here before?

231
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,880
Yes. Sometimes.

232
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,910
Today's not the first time that's happened, right?

233
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,000
Kneeling in front of people and apologizing.

234
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,040
Yes, it does happen sometimes.

235
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,910
I understand how those people feel,

236
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,670
and I also understand how it might have hurt you, Ji Hwan.

237
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,430
I had such mixed feelings about it.

238
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,050
The feelings of those people who came to see us are more important.

239
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,890
It's my responsibility to protect my employees

240
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,100
but it's also my responsibility to share their burdens.

241
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,110
It must be there.

242
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,110
Oh, yes. We're almost there.

243
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,500
It's so nice!

244
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,050
So pretty.

245
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,570
Okay.

246
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,510
No matter how loud you scream here, no one will hear it.

247
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,080
Everything you've pushed down in here, let it all out.

248
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,230
No, I'm okay. Everyone is alive and well...

249
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,770
You'll get sick like that. Say anything, even if it's "The emperor has no clothes!"

250
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,910
It's okay.

251
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,790
Should I do it for you?

252
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,250
- Oh, no, no. 
 - Let me do it for you.

253
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:02,530
Hey! I have a mouth! I know how to speak!

254
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,310
No one's around.

255
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,310
Life isn't easy for me, either!

256
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,590
Things are hard for me, too! You jerks!

257
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,800
♫  We were like that back then  ♫

258
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,010
How was that? Doesn't it feel good?

259
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,190
That was cool.

260
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,780
I know you feel bad doing this.

261
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,940
When something like that happens, I'll do it for you.

262
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,770
Thank you.

263
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,520
- Hold on. 
 - I-I'm okay.

264
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,150
Hey! I'm Hyungnim! I'm not younger than you!

265
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,500
- Eun Ha, hold on. 
 - It's okay. I'll do it.

266
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:53,380
♫  A fateful miracle that recognized each other, may it become love  ♫

267
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,330
♫  You  ♫

268
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,000
There. All good.

269
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,110
Thanks.

270
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,040
♫  You  ♫

271
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,330
You're so pretty, my Eun Ha.

272
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,070
 Hold on, Eun Ha. 

273
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
 All good. 

274
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,090
 You're so pretty, my Eun Ha. 

275
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,440
What did you just say?

276
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,850
I'm sorry, Eun Ha.

277
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,000
You looked so pretty that I spoke informally. I'm sorry.

278
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,300
- I startled you, huh? 
 - No, it's okay.

279
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,330
I think it's gotten a bit cold, Eun Ha. Should we head down?

280
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,860
Okay.

281
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,090
You're not cold?

282
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,820
   

283
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,510
Dong Hee.

284
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,020
Eat this and cheer up.

285
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,690
Fighting!

286
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,140
I'll give everything to this new product. Watch me.

287
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,360
Hey, Dong Hee!

288
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,850
What's this?

289
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,120
- What's this? Where did you get these? 
 - Dong Hee, did you bring them for us?

290
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,770
My colleagues brought them for me.

291
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,910
You're popular, Dong Hee.

292
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,730
Of course. In terms of looks, he's in the top three at our company.

293
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,920
- Who is in the top two, then? 
 - The top two?

294
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,720
 Us. 

295
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,640
Why are you saying terrible things to him this morning? Don't listen to them.

296
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,950
Hey, dude.

297
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,280
You're in the top three from the bottom.

298
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,950
Wrap it up and come in, top two.

299
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,860
I'm number one. What is he talking about?

300
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,110
   

301
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,570
Sales for the kids' sausage rose 22.1% from last month,

302
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,070
maintaining steady growth.

303
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,100
We got positive responses to "No preservatives. No coloring. No starch."

304
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,580
Responses to the ad are very good, too.

305
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,200
It's not just "good."

306
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,330
More like "explosive."

307
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,510
Day cares and schools are asking about our products, too.

308
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,800
Hey, we forgot to tell him the most important thing.

309
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,350
Hyungnim, last month...

310
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,270
we finally beat King Meats, Hyungnim!

311
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,620
   

312
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,170
First place!

313
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,920
That's just for the kids category. Don't overstate it.

314
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,080
Man Ho, how's the new product coming along?

315
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,470
Oh, yes. I have a lot of ideas, Hyungnim.

316
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,050
Our product development team,

317
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,350
and everyone at this table worked hard...

318
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,160
toward the massive success of our kids' sausage. So I prepared...

319
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,650
Yes.

320
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,300
Yes, I'll go check.

321
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,920
Text me the address.

322
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:35,300
A product that kids and their families can have together.

323
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,520
Frozen marinated bulgogi!

324
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,820
Looks delicious!

325
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,730
You can eat it while camping or cook it quickly at home.

326
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,740
Bull-gogi is better than bear-gogi. 
  (T/N: "gogi" means "meat") 

327
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,040
 We found the man in a hat you asked about. 

328
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,000
 He's a private investigator. 

329
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,940
 I'll report to you when I get back. 

330
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,970
Gu Mi Ho.

331
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,270
- Yes. 
 - Come on in.

332
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,300
Your baby grew 0.6 cm in just a week.

333
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,460
The head, arms, legs. You see that, right?

334
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,030
Where's the head, and where are the legs?

335
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,260
Can you tell the difference, Doctor?

336
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,960
If you keep looking, you'll see it, too.

337
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,590
Let me play you the baby's heartbeat.

338
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,260
This is...

339
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,450
really the baby's heartbeat?

340
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,250
Not mine?

341
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,240
It is your baby's.

342
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,500
The heartbeat sounds good. Your baby is growing well.

343
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,050
Okay.

344
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,630
It's strange.

345
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,140
Why did I suddenly think of Hyun Woo right then?

346
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,550
You said you brought up Hyun Woo earlier in the day.

347
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,210
Maybe those emotions were still there until the evening.

348
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,000
- Maybe? 
 - The names are different.

349
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,650
Right?

350
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,010
Hey. If you...

351
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,800
had to raise a child alone, what do you think it'd be like?

352
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,690
- Why would I have to raise it alone? 
 - Maybe you don't have a husband.

353
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,040
Maybe I don't have a husband, but I have you.

354
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,870
Aren't you going to help me?

355
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,370
Huh?

356
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,590
If you had a baby, I'd help you raise it. I'd stick by you even if you said to go.

357
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,950
We'd send him to kindergarten, elementary school, and college.

358
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,940
Since you're busy at work, I'd go to the open class for you.

359
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,460
Sounds so fun just thinking about it.

360
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,590
But why do you ask?

361
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,720
Someone at the shop next door is pregnant.

362
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,520
The shop? Where?

363
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,320
- The flower shop. 
 - The flower shop?

364
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,680
But she has a husband!

365
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,850
He went on a business trip far away.

366
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,950
To where?

367
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,120
How would I know all that?

368
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,840
- It's not you, is it? 
 - Huh?

369
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
- What? 
 - What you just said.

370
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,080
You weren't talking about yourself, were you?

371
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,980
Hey! I don't even have a man. A baby?

372
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,470
No way. Seriously.

373
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,760
You said no.

374
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,160
No. How could you...

375
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,150
Gosh, my goodness...

376
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,470
I'm sorry.

377
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,840
Manager Park at King Meats must be hurting.

378
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,720
Let's see.

379
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,980
 ­  

380
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,990
 ­  

381
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,570
Yes, it's Marketing Team Leader Yang Hong Gi.

382
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,530
 And? 

383
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,210
"And?" How can you talk to me like that?

384
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,910
Thanks to you, our sales are through the roof.

385
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,270
I just wanted to call you to thank you— What's that?

386
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,400
Hey, are you drinking?

387
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,880
Hello.

388
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,510
Put this on.

389
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,370
Keep it on. Everyone's staring.

390
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,990
Who cares if they're staring?

391
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,350
I care.

392
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,870
Dating rumors between the model and the Marketing Team Leader?

393
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,180
Sounds exhausting just thinking about it.

394
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,520
Dating rumors only happen when they seem plausible.

395
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,730
How did you know I was here?

396
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,290
Kang Ye Na is drinking out in the open at a place like this.

397
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,660
Who wouldn't know?

398
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,820
I'm invisible to the person I wish would look at me.

399
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:17,020
I guess people I don't care about see me just fine.

400
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,460
That person you wish would look at you...

401
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,360
Is that our CEO again?

402
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,970
I've waited eight years for him.

403
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,190
I can wait one or two more.

404
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,410
I was going to wait until his feelings for Unni faded.

405
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,840
But...

406
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,530
it's not that he didn't see me.

407
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,600
From the beginning, she was the only one for him.

408
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,100
As someone who sleeps and eats in the same house as him,

409
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,450
it goes against my conscience to gossip. But...

410
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,920
Hyungnim might look fine on the outside, but he's a mess on the inside.

411
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,940
He looks like he's good at everything, but he can't do anything.

412
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,880
So we can't even ask him to do things for us.

413
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,630
Plus he's so particular. You know that, don't you?

414
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,470
He's hard to please, and he nags all the time.

415
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,080
And you can't get a reaction out of him.

416
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,390
His face doesn't change whether he likes something or not.

417
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,100
I'm sure his face doesn't change when he's sleeping, either.

418
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,510
It's so frustrating.

419
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,550
Imagine going on a date with him.

420
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:47,870
You'll fall asleep. I'm telling you, he's boring.

421
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,940
It's not like you missed out...

422
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,360
on someone amazing.

423
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,380
He was amazing to me.

424
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,290
My life was a mess.

425
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,600
No one had come in to interrupt it.

426
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,140
 We totally can rip this up. 

427
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,120
 Hey, thug! 

428
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,930
 What do you want? Are you trying to buy me with this money? 

429
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,810
 You can't buy a person with money. 

430
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,890
 You expect me to believe that you're just helping me? 

431
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,680
 You said it wasn't your debt. 

432
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,080
It wasn't my fault that things were hard.

433
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,190
Of course, it's not fair.

434
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,820
It felt like he was telling me that.

435
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,320
It was so powerful. Maybe that's why I can't forget.

436
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,840
You've been through a lot.

437
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,400
You stayed strong.

438
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,210
You became this successful.

439
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,070
I'm proud of you.

440
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,290
Who hired him?

441
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,890
It's as you expected.

442
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,370
My father?

443
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,040
Yes.

444
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:22,000
 As a kid, I learned how to add and subtract while playing. 

445
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,600
 - These are called finger snacks. 
 - Finger snacks. 

446
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200
 Oh, my, how did you know? 

447
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,820
 There are these snacks. One, two... 

448
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,530
 three... 

449
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,490
 Four. Lastly, five. 

450
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,420
 If I take one, two... 

451
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,840
 and eat them, 

452
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,530
 how many are left? 

453
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,440
 My snacks! 

454
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,870
 Oppa, why did you eat all of my snacks? 

455
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,550
 - I'll eat these, too! 
 - No! 

456
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,510
 I think he must feel the same way. 

457
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,280
 Those memories must have... 

458
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,780
 kept him going, made him strong, 

459
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,510
 and helped him survive. 

460
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,010
I'll be back.

461
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,900
Your haircut looks great.

462
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,280
- Do you have something to say? 
 - No.

463
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,840
Officer Yang will be here in the afternoon.

464
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,570
Okay.

465
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,410
   

466
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,460
What?

467
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,400
Nothing.

468
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,800
My dear, beloved Prosecutor.

469
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,340
The higher-ups haven't told us to reopen the case for an investigation.

470
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,450
Why are we still investigating a case that's been assigned to another team?

471
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,910
As someone with experience, I just don't understand.

472
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,030
I lost a drug investigation, not my place as a prosecutor.

473
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,540
I'm more suspicious, so I need to look into it even more.

474
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,090
♫  Do it like me, just like this  ♫

475
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,880
Wow, they're up to all kinds of shows now.

476
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,900
She's something. That's for sure.

477
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,860
She completely enticed Seo Ji Hwan within months,

478
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:02,690
and even got that steely prosecutor on her side.

479
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,780
Did you say she doesn't have family around?

480
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,420
After her parents divorced, they've all separated.

481
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,970
- When she was living in Changsan-dong... 
 - Wait. Where?

482
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,820
Changsan-dong?

483
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,750
- Yes. 
 - That's where Seo Ji Hwan lives now.

484
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,370
She lived near that house until she was 12.

485
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,620
Twelve?

486
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,860
So when I went to get Seo Ji Hwan, that girl was in the same neighborhood.

487
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,440
Chairman says to close up. We have an important guest.

488
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,590
An important guest?

489
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,550
Who is that?

490
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,250
Seo Tae Pyung has a simple goal. Take a look.

491
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,880
It's to launder the 200 billion won as money that can be dealt.

492
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,180
But the most important player in this money laundering process is Sangnam Liquor.

493
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,780
Just eight years ago, this was a small company valued under 100 million.

494
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,520
But since eight years ago, their sales have been growing.

495
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,150
   

496
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:12,780
Now, they're very profitable, with 50 billion in yearly sales.

497
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:20,080
   

498
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,860
What the heck...

499
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,170
A shell corporation?

500
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:35,600
 What's strange is that Lee Gang Gil runs this company. 

501
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,000
   

502
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,020
The buyer doesn't visit the distributor's offices regularly.

503
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,920
Do you need to taste it to know if it's shit or bean paste? Just smell it.

504
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,560
I bet my entire career that this is a fake corporation set up by Seo Tae Pyung.

505
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,780
So the money started flowing from Club Cat to Sangnam Liquor eight years ago, right?

506
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,170
If we dig through eight years' worth of data, we'll find suspicious transactions.

507
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,380
Did every import company deliver to Sangnam Liquor? If so, for how much?

508
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,360
Compare it to the price that Club Cat paid.

509
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,200
Chief Oh, please look into this.

510
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,090
- All eight years' worth of data? 
 - W-W-Wait.

511
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,430
Chief, I heard the case was taken away from you. Can you still look into it?

512
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,820
I said that very line exactly 3 hours and 20 minutes ago.

513
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,180
But the Prosecutor so kindly answered, "Yes, we can."

514
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,120
No one took it from me. I won't give it up.

515
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,320
Let's get to work.

516
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,660
   

517
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,220
Prosecutor.

518
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,000
Do you have some time?

519
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,040
I have a question.

520
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,380
I'll come to you.

521
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,250
Yes. I'll call you when I get there.

522
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,990
   

523
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,510
Hi, Ji Hwan.

524
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,730
Hi, Eun Ha. Where are you?

525
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,660
Home.

526
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,810
 What were you doing? 

527
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:28,060
I'm just getting ready to film. What are you up to?

528
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,880
I have an errand to run, so I'm on my way there.

529
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,980
I see.

530
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,220
 Hey, Eun Ha. 

531
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,420
Today...

532
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,400
could you not go anywhere, just stay home?

533
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,080
Hello? Eun Ha?

534
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,770
Yes.

535
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,780
I will.

536
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,720
 Thank you. 

537
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,150
 I'll see you later, then. 

538
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,710
You've changed a lot.

539
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,690
Why aren't you telling her?

540
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,180
Tell her what?

541
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,540
I don't understand.

542
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,610
If she knew you were the oppa she was close with,

543
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,050
she would like you even more.

544
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,730
Nice memories with someone nice...

545
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,320
I don't want to ruin them for her.

546
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,630
The person Eun Ha remembers...

547
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,590
is living a good, ordinary life somewhere.

548
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,570
That's all she needs to know.

549
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Will you be okay to go inside alone?

550
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,160
If he wanted to kill me, he would have already.

551
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,670
It's still the Chairman.

552
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,930
He sent people, so I would walk in here on my own.

553
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:18,890
He won't kill me until I bow down first. Don't worry.

554
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,010
   

555
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,630
He's waiting for you inside.

556
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,510
Eun Ha.

557
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,730
Is something going on?

558
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,460
Prosecutor, you said before...

559
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,320
that you found Hyun Woo.

560
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:33,300
I couldn't ask you then, but I think I need to know now.

561
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,120
The Hyun Woo you had found...

562
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,860
Can you tell me who he is?

563
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,280
But...

564
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,240
why do you ask all of a sudden?

565
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,170
Well...

566
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,610
I think someone I know might be Hyun Woo.

567
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,890
By chance...

568
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,390
is Seo Ji Hwan Hyun Woo?

569
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,180
 Long time no see. 

570
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,580
The last time I saw you was at the trial.

571
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,150
Has it been nine years?

572
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,500
How have you been?

573
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,080
You're rusty.

574
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,800
You didn't even notice the private investigator.

575
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,690
I don't need to be as sensitive as I used to be.

576
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,660
A carnivore doesn't do well by eating plants.

577
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,820
Before you came looking for me, I was an ordinary kid.

578
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,190
I know that's what you want to believe,

579
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,870
but you've always resembled me.

580
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,430
You and I are different.

581
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,320
- You have my blood. 
 - I chose a different path.

582
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,030
By handing me over to the prosecution?

583
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,500
That was for your survival.

584
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,100
You betrayed the person who raised you so you could survive.

585
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,160
I've done that countless times to get here.

586
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,720
I did that to cut you out of my life.

587
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,820
How can a son cut out his father?

588
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,560
I'm rebuilding the Bulldog Gang.

589
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,080
Stop wasting your time and come back where you belong.

590
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,010
I belong to Thirsty Deer. I don't want to come back.

591
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,400
Is it because of the girl?

592
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:44,300
You want to date and pretend to live your life like others do.

593
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,790
But you can't do that. You'll never change.

594
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,280
That's what you want.

595
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:59,490
You'll soon find out what I mean.

596
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:19,590
 Your call cannot be completed. After the tone... 

597
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,060
   

598
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,250
So you ended up coming here, huh?

599
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:54,890
Then I guess I'll settle things with your girl.

600
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,390
- Is everything all right? 
 - What could possibly happen?

601
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,950
   

602
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,680
   

603
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,660
I'm glad.

604
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,200
Looks like you have to go. I'll take it from here. Go ahead.

605
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,860
I can drive you.

606
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,880
I feel like taking a walk. Take the car. I'm fine.

607
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,390
Thank goodness.

608
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,510
I got here in time.

609
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,850
What are you doing here? Where are you coming from?

610
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,720
There was an accident, but I didn't have time to turn the car around.

611
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,490
So I just left it there.

612
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:56,000
What? What accident?

613
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,360
Are you okay?

614
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,280
Yes, I'm fine. It's nothing.

615
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,430
What do you mean it's nothing? You're pregnant!

616
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,370
What did you just say?

617
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,150
Pregnant?

618
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,790
- I... 
 - You knew?

619
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,460
Since when?

620
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,660
Right after we got back from the trip.

621
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:32,870
That's when you suddenly pursued me. Asked me out and told me you liked me.

622
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,780
I'm sorry.

623
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:43,270
I knew something was off. There was no way...

624
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,550
You can't develop feelings you never had.

625
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,800
So what about it?

626
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,510
- Will you take care of me or something? 
 - Yes.

627
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:58,400
- What? 
 - I'm going to take care of you.

628
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,450
Who's going to take care of whom? Who asked you to do that?

629
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,560
Hey, I'll take care of myself.

630
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,790
I'm saying because it's you, stupid.

631
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,050
What?

632
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:21,200
I've never imagined having a family.

633
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,980
But I want to because it's you.

634
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,130
I've never been comfortable around anyone.

635
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,900
I've never been loved by good parents...

636
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,730
like you have.

637
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,760
But...

638
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,720
maybe it's because you're an honest person.

639
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,580
I keep opening up to you.

640
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,380
The things on my mind...

641
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,550
I find myself sharing them with you.

642
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,550
So...

643
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,900
can you trust me now?

644
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,800
No.

645
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,120
No! Let me go!

646
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,660
You're so annoying! Really!

647
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,250
Do you know how much I struggled alone?

648
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,640
You knew everything and didn't even...

649
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,180
How could you...

650
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,480
Let me go!

651
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,480
That's why...

652
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,110
I said to talk it out together.

653
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,920
Stop speaking informally to me.

654
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,800
But I want to.

655
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,430
From now on,

656
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:53,050
I want to do everything with you.

657
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,630
 How can a son cut out his father? 

658
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,600
 I'm rebuilding Bulldog Gang. 

659
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,100
 Stop wasting your time and come back where you belong. 

660
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,650
 The Ji Hwan I know... 

661
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,960
 isn't someone who did bad things under his father. 

662
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,420
 He tries hard to be a role model for his brothers. 

663
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,450
 You told Hong Gi to keep his word when it comes to keeping promises. 

664
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:51,120
 You told Jae Soo to hold back his anger, even if someone picks a fight first. 

665
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,800
 When you went to save Taek, you just took the blows. 

666
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,190
 I could be back there at any second. 

667
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,980
 If you're not seeking forgiveness for the past... 

668
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,510
 but trying not to go back to the past, Ji Hwan, 

669
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:09,190
 I want to help you... 

670
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,520
 with your efforts. 

671
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,900
   

672
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,990
It took me this long to tell you this.

673
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
You're right.

674
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,590
Seo Ji Hwan...

675
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,710
is the Hyun Woo you've been looking for.

676
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,300
So does Seo Ji Hwan know?

677
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,010
Yes.

678
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,700
- But Eun Ha— 
 - I'm sorry, Prosecutor. I have to go.

679
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,700
You're still here?

680
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,700
I have some things to take care of.

681
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,010
Are you going to keep working?

682
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,900
Oh, yes.

683
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,200
You should go home.

684
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:50,050
- You said before... 
 - Yes?

685
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:52,960
Officer Song, you said before that...

686
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,920
one might choose to hide their feelings to stay in someone's life.

687
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,220
Yes.

688
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,460
If you can hide those feelings in your head...

689
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,830
but you can't in your heart,

690
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,810
what do you do then?

691
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:21,470
Do you give up being in their life?

692
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:29,070
That's your choice, Prosecutor.

693
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:32,320
If it's really too difficult for you,

694
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:39,400
you could also develop feelings for someone else. That's another way.

695
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:57,020
 You know... 

696
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,540
 can I tell you a secret? 

697
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,490
 I hate mobsters. 

698
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:07,860
♫  Soothe my weary day  ♫

699
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:13,470
 For some people, confronting the past is a difficult thing. 

700
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,600
♫  Reflect on my uneasy heart  ♫

701
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:25,900
♫  I wish it was all a dream  ♫

702
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:35,240
♫  When I feel alone, lights of the past  ♫

703
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:41,820
♫  Warmly embrace me again  ♫

704
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:47,000
Dong Hee, is the CEO home yet?

705
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,300
Not yet?

706
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:59,590
♫  Push away the time that feels like a lie  ♫

707
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:06,780
♫  Oh, shine on me at the end of this road  ♫

708
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:11,220
♫  May the thick darkness be lifted  ♫

709
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:18,800
♫  And the bright light come to me  ♫f

710
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,810
♫  The lonely sunset  ♫

711
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:27,600
 Your name. Is it Eun Ha? 

712
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,220
 - That day... 
 - CEO, why are you here? 

713
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,270
 Was there a reason why you came to this house? 

714
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,440
 I lived around here when I was young. 

715
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,330
 I have a lot of memories of this place. 

716
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,490
 Are they good memories? 

717
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,500
 Yes. They're good memories. 

718
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,700
 With a good person. 

719
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,300
 Out of everyone I knew, 

720
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,290
 he was the best person. 

721
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,970
 You're so pretty, my Eun Ha. 

722
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:01,800
 You're so pretty, my Eun Ha. 

723
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,590
♫  Push away the time that felt like a lie  ♫

724
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,980
♫  Oh, shine on me  ♫

725
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,290
 He never answers any of my questions. 

726
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,230
 Did he ever open up to someone before? 

727
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,620
 There was... 

728
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,850
 just one person. 

729
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:25,590
 Maybe because I think we seemed similar. 

730
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,220
 She looked so alone. 

731
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,700
 So I... 

732
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:36,600
 just wanted to be by her side. 

733
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,900
 What happened after? Do you still talk to her? 

734
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,410
 No. 

735
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:47,090
 I believe she's doing well... 

736
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,010
 somewhere out there. 

737
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:53,430
 Wherever you are, I'll find you, Hyun Woo. 

738
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:58,660
 I'll find you for sure. 

739
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,200
Eun Ha.

740
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,590
How did you...

741
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,990
Did you think I would never find out?

742
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,060
I've been looking for you forever.

743
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,200
I told you I'd find you. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

744
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,660
I relied on you like I did before. Why didn't I recognize you?

745
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,260
I missed you, Hyun Woo.

746
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:09,970

 Ta-da! E-Eun Ha... 

768
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,420
 - We're going to get married. 
 - My child's life... 

769
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,400
 comes before an unborn grandchild! 

770
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,600
 We need to get back what we're owed. 

771
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,000
 It's an emergency. The conference room is a mess. 

772
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,680
 This is the surefire way to destroy Seo Ji Hwan. 

773
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,390
 Eun Ha! 

774
