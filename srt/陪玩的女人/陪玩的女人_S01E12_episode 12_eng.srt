00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,300
What is this, Chief Prosecutor? Hand over the drug case to another district?

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,390
The Thai drug case?

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,250
The Southern District has been on it since last year. They'll wrap it up.

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,000
Why are you doing this all of a sudden? This has been my case!

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,120
Why are you so obsessed with this? Don't you have any other cases?

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,860
Don't poke around the drug money or whatever. Do something else with your time.

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,510
By chance, are you linked to this case, Chief Prosecutor?

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,570
Prosecutor Jang!

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,200
I've been easy on you because you're good at your job, but you've crossed a line.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,790
Stop arguing and do what I say.

Who are you?

24
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,030
Eun Ha...

25
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,870
Unni?

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,760
Ji Hwan.

27
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,880
- Ji Hwan! 
 - Hey.

28
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,770
Why are you here right now?

29
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,410
Me?

30
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,740
I'm saying hello to my sister-in-law.

31
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,940
Hi, Sister-in-Law!

32
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,210
I heard you've been at our club.

33
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,900
That toy handcuff story made me laugh so hard.

34
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,020
This guy is basically my little brother.

35
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,440
Hey, hey, hey!

36
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,590
So rude. You know how he is.

37
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,560
Hey, man, you should introduce your girl to your brother immediately.

38
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,650
I warned you.

39
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,220
Not to get close to people around me.

40
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,850
Aigoo, I'm so scared!

41
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,560
I haven't seen this face in a while.

42
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,400
You don't know this, do you, Sister-in-Law?

43
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,460
He was incredible during his Bulldog Gang days.

44
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,600
Should I tell you about it?

45
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,460
Stay here for a minute.

46
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,600
Ji Hwan!

47
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,300
Why so serious? Don't be so serious.

48
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,880
- Let's talk somewhere else. 
 - No. I'm going to stay right here.

49
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,030
I thought you were just seeing her for fun. But what's going on?

50
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,100
But you actually like her.

51
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,390
I don't think you should be walking around like this.

52
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,580
You haven't heard?

53
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,360
That deal you messed up?

54
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,630
The Chairman took care of it.

55
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,870
You heard he's out, right?

56
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,360
You should go say helloâ€” Oh, right!

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,560
You can't.

58
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,240
Considering what you did.

59
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,960
You'd get your neck snapped the minute you showed up. Don't come.

60
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,110
Worry about your own neck. Shut up and get lost.

61
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,910
Stop talking about my neck!

62
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,450
Be sure to tell Sister-in-Law that I'll be watching her new channel.

63
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,530
I'm a fan!

64
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,950
Do you know him?

65
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,230
Eun Ha, get your stuff right now.

66
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,990
I have another hour left on my shift.

67
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,260
Do you really need this job?

68
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,620
What do you mean?

69
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,350
You're exposed to strangers and easily accessible. I think it's too dangerous.

70
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,220
A drunkard jumped on you once.

71
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,600
Are you telling me to quit?

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,270
- Must you do something so dangerousâ€” 
 - Ji Hwan.

73
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,990
I get why you're acting like this,

74
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,490
but will you be this cold whenever something like this happens?

75
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,430
You won't tell me what's going on or why you look so serious.

76
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,310
Are you going to push me away as if I wouldn't understand?

77
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,630
I made a promise, so I'm going to finish my shift. You go ahead.

78
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,520
   

79
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,430
Il Yeong.

80
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,880
Little Rat wants you to eat this.

81
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,290
Hey.

82
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,000
What are you doing?

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,780
   

84
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,320
What's wrong?

85
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,030
- Should I slap you? 
 - Hyung.

86
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,700
That's right. You don't want to get slapped.

87
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,060
What do I do now?

88
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,420
 Aigoo. My one daughter. 

89
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,550
 Mother, hello. 

90
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,290
 You fed me such a delicious meal last time. 

91
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,330
 I'm sorry I didn't even thank you properly. 

92
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,170
 Aigoo, where did you drink so much? 

93
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,650
 - Did he drink with you? 
 - Does it look like he did? 

94
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,480
 I picked him up right outside. 

95
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,000
 Mother, I don't have anything for you, 

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,710
 but take this instead. 

97
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,420
 Thank you for everything. 

98
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,100
 Honey, this is a car key. 

99
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,070
 Get it together! 

100
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,820
 This is a really nice car. 

101
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,370
 This guy would give away everything in the house when he's drunk. 

102
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,490
 You. Take him upstairs right now! 

103
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,250
 Dad, take him upstairs? 

104
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,440
 Will you let him sleep here, then? 

105
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,170
 - Until when? 
 - The morning! 

106
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,540
 How can I do that? 

107
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,600
 It's Mi Ho! 

108
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,210
 Mi Ho, you were so cute as a kid. 

109
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,700
 What are you doing? Stand up. Stand up! 

110
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,490
 You can't be this drunk at someone else's house. Just go. 

111
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,100
 He's here because it's our house! Son-in-Law, you must be tired. 

112
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,500
 - Go in, go in. 
 - I will. 

113
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,780
 What are you talking about? Why would we let him sleep over? 

114
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,750
 - He's tired! 
 - Should we have a drink? 

115
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,240
 - Should we? One more? 
 - No, no, no. 

116
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,020
 Should we have one more? Honey, let's have one more. 

117
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,210
 Wait, wait. 

118
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,950
 Let's have one more! 

119
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,810
 It's fine, it's fine! Come. 

120
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,650
 Where did you drink so much? 

121
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,150
 Not here, not here. Stand up. 

122
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,870
 Here. 

123
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,340
 Gu Mi Ho. 

124
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,510
 I don't want you to suffer. 

125
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,170
 I want you to share everything with me... 

126
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,380
 and discuss everything with me. 

127
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,850
 I want to be by your side. 

128
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,100
Then I ran away.

129
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,500
Did you run away?

130
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,030
You haven't told me anything.

131
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,280
"Hyung, what do I do? I ran away." How am I supposed to respond to that?

132
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,850
Is that a spell?

133
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,530
Ran away from where?

134
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,870
What's going on?

135
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,980
Hey.

136
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,290
Hyungnim is calling.

137
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,860
What's he talking about?

138
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,100
Yes, CEO.

139
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,600
Find out what's going on with Go Yang Hui's drug case.

140
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,550
Okay.

141
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,270
Take a cookie. Thank you!

142
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,690
Take a cookie. Thank you!

143
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,450
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

144
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,230
   

145
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,760
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

146
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,600
We're feeling down, and the weather is crazy nice.

147
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,140
Should we grab some soju? For the first time ever, my treat.

148
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,410
She'll pay for the food.

149
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,710
- I'll pay for the alcohol, too. 
 - That'd be embarrassing for me.

150
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,600
No. Thank you, but I know you haven't been home on time due to this case.

151
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,690
Go home early today and get some rest.

152
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,930
Just one glass.

153
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,810
Next time.

154
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
   

155
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,880
Take a cookie. Thank you!

156
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,310
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

157
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,380
Take a cookie. Thank you!

158
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,450
- Dong Hee. 
 - Let me take you home.

159
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,630
I think the CEO is busy with something.

160
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,490
Thank you.

161
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,220
Let me just finish this.

162
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,050
Take a cookie. Thank you!

163
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,070
 The case was reassigned to the Southern District Prosecutor's Office. 

164
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,890
 They say it was to consolidate the work, 

165
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,510
 but in reality I think there was pressure from above. 

166
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,200
- A Sprite, please. 
 - Yes.

167
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,730
A Sprite at a pub?

168
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,590
Thank you. I don't drink alcohol.

169
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,570
Why did you want to see me?

170
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,790
Seo Tae Pyung.

171
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,090
Did you investigate him?

172
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,620
Word spreads faster than I thought.

173
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,940
I took a look at the deal money.

174
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,080
There's enough related evidence, but the warrant keeps getting dismissed.

175
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,250
I can see they want to cut it off at Lee Gang Gil.

176
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,900
I was trying to see who was behind Go Yang Hui.

177
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,600
I was just starting my investigation.

178
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,270
But they took the case from me just for messing with it.

179
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,100
What kind of person is he?

180
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Your father.

181
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,940
What kind of person rots in jail for 10 years...

182
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,650
and yet has more power and money in his hands than 10 years ago?

183
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,700
You don't even know what kind of person he is...

184
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,200
and started an investigation?

185
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,610
It took me 10 years to cut him off.

186
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,690
It took me 10 more years to get away from him.

187
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:29,070
Yet I'm still hearing his name from you.

188
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,370
That's how afraid I am of him.

189
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,790
So you're not in the picture with him.

190
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,690
Are you certain?

191
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,610
I cut him off myself.

192
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,600
I never want to be associated with him again.

193
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,010
 Ji Hwan! 

194
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,420
 I get why you're acting like this, 

195
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,000
 but will you be this cold whenever something like this happens? 

196
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,030
 You won't tell me what's going on or why you look so serious. 

197
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,810
 Are you going to push me away as if I wouldn't understand? 

198
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,860
   

199
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,520
Gang Gil!

200
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,110
Welcome back. Let me take a look at you.

201
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,540
Let me see your faces.

202
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,790
You look better. Let's eat.

203
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,570
How about tofu stew? I know a great place. Let's go.

204
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,910
   
   

205
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,360
You heard the Chairman got out, didn't you?

206
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,750
- Yes, I heard. 
 - About the botched deal,

207
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,450
don't tell him it was because of Seo Ji Hwan.

208
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,350
Just hearing his name will enrage him. No need to mention it.

209
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,310
It'll just upset the Chairman.

210
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,430
Okay? Got it?

211
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,500
Yes.

212
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,600
Why not answer me...

213
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,570
   

214
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,000
Hey.

215
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,020
Eun Ha.

216
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,500
What's with the ice?

217
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,000
Aigoo, still. The shaved ice is pretty.

218
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,310
At least put some red beans on top.

219
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,780
Oh, right.

220
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,140
We're not participating in the orphanage sponsorship event, are we?

221
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,720
No. Donate what they need and tell them we can't be there.

222
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,240
What kind of event is it?

223
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,360
- Oh, that's... 
 - The sponsors visit every year...

224
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,090
and spend time with them. That kind of thing.

225
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,600
- So why not go? 
 - We...

226
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,590
We're not role models. We can't show our faces there.

227
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,010
They don't like having us there, either.

228
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,630
Am I wrong, Il Yeong?

229
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,400
I didn't hate days like that.

230
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,300
It was usually boring, so it was nice to have lots of people over.

231
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,200
Oh, really?

232
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,850
I grew up in an orphanage.

233
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,150
He's a straight shooter now, but he used to be crooked.

234
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,260
Right, Hyungnim?

235
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,010
Hey, hey. Put some red beans on this.

236
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,120
So cold. So cold!

237
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,300
At least wash your hands!

238
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,410
Hurry up and put red beans on it now!

239
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
You want to apologize, right?

240
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,310
I'm sorry.

241
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,380
Just with words?

242
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,570
Here.

243
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,200
When did you get this?

244
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,600
Yesterday.

245
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
Did you skip work just to give me this?

246
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,220
Yes.

247
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,860
I'm sorry. Well...

248
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,790
He and I have been on bad terms for a long time.

249
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,200
He's a dangerous person. I was worried about you.

250
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,000
I overreacted in the moment.

251
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,370
I'm...

252
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,540
not just someone you need to be worried about or protect.

253
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,330
You can also share things with me.

254
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,170
So, I want you to tell me everything. Slowly.

255
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,180
I want you to.

256
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,670
Also, I'm not that fragile!

257
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,860
Didn't I tell you I learned self-defense? Want to see? Look.

258
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,730
Here we go...

259
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,510
There! Wait, that's not it.

260
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,510
- Eun Ha. 
 - Yes?

261
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,600
Isn't this just a hug?

262
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,220
No! Ow. Are you okay?

263
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,100
 I don't want you to suffer. 

264
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,370
 I want you to share everything with me... 

265
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,340
 and discuss everything with me. 

266
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,580
 I want to be by your side. 

267
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,910
Why is he tempting me?

268
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,400
Mom.

269
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,860
Come home? Why?

270
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,840
Her eyes were so big and pretty, even as a kid.

271
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,680
But after starting soccer, she became a tomboy.

272
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,940
Look. So mischievous, right?

273
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,040
- So cute. 
 - It's not just because she's my kid.

274
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,030
In terms of looks, she's second to none.

275
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,260
If we add your looks to the mix,

276
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,620
wow, our grandkids will be even better looking!

277
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,670
What's going on?

278
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,400
- Mi Ho. 
 - You're home.

279
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,180
Grandkids? What grandkids?

280
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,390
Who's having your grandkids?

281
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,990
Why are you showing my pictures to a stranger without my permission?

282
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,920
I told you I'm not with him. Why can't you believe your daughter?

283
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,040
Stand up.

284
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,680
- No. 
 - Stand up.

285
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,370
- No. 
 - Stand up, I said!

286
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,400
- Come out right now. 
 - Hold on, Mi Ho...

287
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,780
Who the hell are you?

288
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,950
I thought you did well in school.

289
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,800
Don't you understand me, or do you think I'm a joke?

290
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,590
I told you no. Why do you keep showing up?

291
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,730
You're not going to come to me.

292
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,500
What?

293
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,580
I'll keep showing up until you welcome me.

294
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,790
Don't be too angry.

295
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,400
You just talked down to me.

296
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,900
You're younger than me!

297
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,340
Your pictures were cute. Bye now.

298
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,800
Hey, what about your car?

299
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,530
I brought it to give it to your mom.

300
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,260
Are you crazy? Hey!

301
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,960
Stop right there! I'll go get the car keys.

302
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,690
Hey! Stop!

303
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,240
What a nutjob he is.

304
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,700
Hey! Take your car with you!

305
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,990
Hey!

306
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,650
The CEO's not in, right?

307
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,900
- No. 
 - I'll take a nap here.

308
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,340
Okay.

309
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,700
If he comes back, don't let him in.

310
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,470
 Lee Dong Hee. 

311
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,650
 Let's go. I want to see the ocean. 

312
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,130
 It's during class hours. 

313
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,580
 Whatever. You were skipping class, too. 

314
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,220
 Let's go. I want to see the ocean. 

315
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,290
 Let's go. Okay? 

316
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,560
 Is this the ocean? 

317
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,640
 Want to die? 

318
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,290
 There's water. There's sand. 

319
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,450
 There's music, too. 

320
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,160
 Over there, the horizon. 

321
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,350
 That's basically an ocean. 

322
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,310
 Does this look like the ocean to you? 

323
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,030
 - Want to die? Come here! 
 - Don't hit me! 

324
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,260
 Isn't this fun? Next time, let's go to the real ocean. 

325
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,030
Dong Hee!

326
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,940
Lee Dong Hee!

327
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,590
What are you thinking so deeply about?

328
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,340
Why is he passed out here?

329
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,430
He was tired and wanted to take a nap.

330
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,530
Hyungnim isn't here. Il Yeong is working off-site.

331
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,600
I bought some snacks in case anyone's hungry.

332
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,840
Let's share.

333
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,730
- What are you doing here? 
 - Get up!

334
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,180
Hey. Why is Hyungnim WHF all of a sudden?

335
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,790
It's "WFH," not "WHF": "working from home."

336
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,710
Would it be "WHV" if he was working from a villa?

337
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,870
What's "WFH"?

338
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,440
This morning,

339
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,080
when we had shaved ice, wasn't the mood icy?

340
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,010
Don't you think Hyungnim wants to butter up Sister-in-Law?

341
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,110
Hey.

342
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,210
Do you think Hyungnim showed the thing to Little Rat?

343
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,210
The teacher is home. She probably saw it.

344
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,710
That could be.

345
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,020
That means that in the house,

346
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,590
it's just Hyungnim and Sister-in-Law alone.

347
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,470
How nice. Nice. Hey.

348
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,720
Everyone, go home late today. After midnight.

349
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,240
Even better if you don't go. Got it?

350
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,360
I do need to go home. I have nowhere else to go.

351
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,150
Eun Ha, close your eyes.

352
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,200
My eyes? Why?

353
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,580
It's nothing. Just close them for a second.

354
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,600
- Don't open them. 
 - Okay. What is it?

355
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,770
Okay, follow me.

356
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,980
Be careful.

357
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,970
There...

358
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,740
Stand here for a second. Don't open your eyes.

359
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,730
- Don't open them! 
 - Okay.

360
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,580
Eun Ha, when I count to three, open your eyes.

361
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,060
Okay.

362
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,390
One, two, three!

363
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,520
What is all this?

364
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,440
"Eun Ha and Friends"?

365
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,450
Is this...

366
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,390
- Did you set this all up for me? 
 - Yes.

367
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,890
Goodness...

368
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,010
This is a really nice camera! Nicer than what I had at Macaron!

369
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,810
How can I...

370
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,970
This mic is the newest model!

371
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,800
And lights?

372
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,200
But I don't know if I can accept this.

373
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,550
What do you mean, Eun Ha? You deserve this.

374
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,510
This isn't even good enough for you.

375
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,890
Also, I didn't do this by myself. The guys wanted to chip in.

376
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,750
We all came together for you.

377
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,890
Gosh, seriously...

378
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,620
You're part of our family, Eun Ha.

379
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,670
Thank you.

380
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,100
It's nothing.

381
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,540
What did you want to do first when you got a studio?

382
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,140
While teaching Man Ho, Jae Soo, and Hong Gi,

383
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,280
I thought of making content for kids who don't get the chance to study.

384
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,760
- Oh, studying. 
 - Yes.

385
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,800
Wow, this thing right here.

386
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,310
As a kid, I learned how to add and subtract while playing.

387
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,400
- These are called finger snacks. 
 - Finger snacks.

388
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,640
Oh, my, how did you know?

389
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,720
I used to do something similar.

390
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,230
You did that, too, Ji Hwan?

391
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,520
Eun Ha!

392
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,620
Aigoo, are you okay?

393
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,100
- I'm okay. 
 - Shake it off.

394
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,080
How did Iâ€” Ji Hwan, I'm so hungry all of a sudden.

395
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,360
- You're hungry? 
 - Yes. Should we eat?

396
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,210
- Can I make you something? 
 - Sounds good.

397
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,000
Fried rice?

398
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,650
- Let's eat. 
 - Shall we?

399
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,790
The table feels so big today.

400
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,480
I know, right? It's just us two at home.

401
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,650
R-R-Right...

402
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,070
Just us two.

403
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,380
I'm sorry. One second.

404
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,330
- A-Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm okay.

405
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,230
- How about dessert? 
 - I love dessert.

406
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,380
Should we eat in the living room? It's bigger there.

407
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,010
The living room, good. Yes, I'll prepare it.

408
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,390
Have some.

409
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,220
It's sweet.

410
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,150
Mm-hm. It's sweet.

411
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,780
- Should we watch TV? 
 - Yes.

412
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,360
I've already seen that one.

413
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,350
W-W-What's wrong?

414
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,770
My spit.

415
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,640
I have saliva stuck in my throat.

416
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,060
 Why am I falling backward? 

417
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,540
 If she keeps going, she'll hit her head. 

418
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,080
Eun Ha, I don't think you have a fever.

419
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,100
Oh, no!

420
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,850
Hyung!

421
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,260
I'm not hurt at all!

422
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,740
Hello? Yes?

423
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,350
What?

424
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,880
When did you get home?

425
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,940
I'm early, aren't I?

426
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,390
Are you? Really?

427
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,960
I forgot I had plans.

428
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,490
 He and I have been on bad terms for a long time. 

429
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,080
 He's a dangerous person. I was worried about you. 

430
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,350
 I overreacted in the moment. 

431
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,850
- Are you going somewhere, Jae Soo? 
 - Oh, my God!

432
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,000
- You scared me! 
 - I was more scared.

433
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,790
- Why are you here? 
 - To drink water.

434
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,050
Drink, drink.

435
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,480
- Jae Soo. 
 - Yes.

436
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,310
- Do you know what Club Cat is? 
 - Club Cat?

437
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,570
Of course. The owner is our archnemesis.

438
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,600
Are you going there? Don't. Go somewhere else.

439
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,650
- Who's the owner? 
 - This sly asshole named Go Yang Hui.

440
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,400
He's the one who got Hyungnim when he went to get Taek.

441
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,120
- Really? 
 - He's out for Hyungnim's blood.

442
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,110
Why are they on such bad terms?

443
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,870
Why do you have so many questions? I'm busy.

444
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,140
Listen up.

445
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,130
When Hyungnim joined the Bulldog Gang,

446
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,580
Go Yang Hui was the Chairman's right-hand man.

447
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,380
A young kid shows up as the heir. Of course, he hates him.

448
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,090
I feel bad for Hyungnim. He was dragged in because of family.

449
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,160
If it wasn't for that, he would have lived an ordinary, quiet, awesome life.

450
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,070
Where did he live before that?

451
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,120
I think he said he lived with his mom.

452
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,820
I don't know the details. Stop asking questions. Got to go.

453
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,960
You never saw me.

454
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,070
 I'm... 

455
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:41,410
 not just someone you need to be worried about or protect. 

456
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,500
 You can also share things with me. 

457
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:50,900
 So I want you to tell me everything. Slowly. 

458
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,680
Go Yang Hui's drug case that you mentioned before.

459
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,090
They're investigating without arrest at this time.

460
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,190
They'll likely close the case without indictment.

461
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,820
I hear Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo tracked down the money.

462
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,220
The higher-ups just wanted to close the case with kidnapping and imprisonment.

463
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,860
That's why they took the case away from him.

464
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,140
If the other guys are out, we should see movement soon.

465
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,100
No matter what it is, they'll be moving together.

466
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,790
Report back as soon as you know something.

467
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,420
Got it.

468
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,550
Oh, how's your back?

469
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:48,160
Why is there no news from the guys? Did they deliver the stuff?

470
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,700
Are you done yet?

471
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,690
This won't fit in the car.

472
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,310
This is it.

473
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,580
I see there's more.

474
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,160
Makes me happy just looking at it.

475
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,520
With the stuff we sent yesterday, they won't have room.

476
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,120
Are we refugees? We can send it over tomorrow.

477
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,890
Pick it up. Let's go.

478
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,850
Dong Hee, you like flowers. Get the flowers.

479
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,490
Sorry, sorry! One second!

480
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,710
I'm going with you.

481
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,470
- Going with us where? 
 - Are you coming with us?

482
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,890
Of course!

483
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,570
Going with us where?

484
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,740
I'm coming!

485
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,910
- What are you doing? 
 - Let's go!

486
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,570
That's the heaviest!

487
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,660
It is quite heavy.

488
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,670
It's good if she comes. Let's go, hurry!

489
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,670
It's been a while since we had an office dinner, right?

490
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,640
More than a while. I can't even remember the last time.

491
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,570
Wait. Did we ever eat out?

492
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,310
We had Vietnamese food last month.

493
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:55,390
Pho doesn't count. We have rice and noodles every day.

494
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,400
The lobster we never ate last time still sings "Under the Sea" in my ears.

495
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,100
â™ª  I want to eat lobster  â™ª

496
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,430
Then should we have lunch today?

497
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,940
A quick decision. Okay.

498
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,680
Wait.

499
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,900
It's not for work. It's for lunch. Got it?

500
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,930
Who cares what it is for? It's lobster we're talking about.

501
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,560
No way. No way.

502
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,680
Aigoo, what in the world? A place this expensive?

503
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,150
Prosecutor, you're so generous. You're the best.

504
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,210
You thought I'd say that, right? This is Go Yang Hui's restaurant.

505
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,520
You said you wanted ocean vibes. 
    

506
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,660
Somewhere exclusive like this.

507
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,870
This place is really hard to get into.

508
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,920
I made reservations.

509
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,530
I said I wanted to eat with ocean vibes, not get buried in the ocean.

510
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,980
My stomach isn't feeling well.

511
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,240
If I eat something raw, I think I'll head straight to the bathroom.

512
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,680
I think I'll spend more time on the toilet than at the table.

513
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,560
So why don't we skip the surf and go to the turf or the sky?

514
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,050
I brought medication. Don't worry.

515
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,450
You're the best.

516
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,780
Let's go in.

517
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,050
Being that calm at the brink of death means his heart has already stopped beating.

518
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,230
We don't even have bulletproof vests.

519
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,640
I don't know if this will do.

520
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,760
What are you doing? Come in.

521
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,400
I'm coming.

522
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,550
Sol, your daddy is on the brink of death every day.

523
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,230
Excuse me.

524
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,140
Do you have a reservation?

525
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,360
Yes. At noon, Jang Hyun Woo.

526
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,400
   

527
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,190
Right. Han Gwang Sik, Han Gwang Tae. You work here.

528
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,230
Yes. What are you doing here, Prosecutor?

529
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,350
What do you mean?

530
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,120
I'm at a restaurant to eat.

531
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,500
I see. I'm sorry.

532
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,130
We don't have any tables.

533
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,060
Wow. Are you joking with me since we're outside the office?

534
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,640
All I see are tables.

535
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,000
   

536
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,910
- They're all reserved. 
 - Aigoo, too bad.

537
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,710
We can't help it. We'll come back next time. Let's go.

538
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,960
I see a table over there.

539
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:08,860
Wow. Officer Song sure has sharp eyes.

540
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,020
Let's eat, then.

541
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,010
Not only does she have sharp eyes, she's quite gutsy.

542
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,500
- I think I'm having a spasm. 
 - Hurry.

543
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,840
Maybe something's wrong with my guts, too.

544
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,050
I think my spasmâ€”

545
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,900
   

546
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,150
This girl is cute, right?

547
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:33,400
Hey, in the comments, do you know who "Emperor Penguin" is?

548
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,520
Who is it?

549
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,980
Seo Ji Hwan. Seo Ji Hwan!

550
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,480
I didn't know he could be so silly.

551
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,760
Trolling back and forth with some unemployed guy on the internet... "Emperor"?

552
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,420
How dare he call himself an emperor?

553
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,940
Hyungnim, a prosecutor is here.

554
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,560
Who?

555
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,180
Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo is here.

556
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,140
Aigoo. We haven't even ordered, and I feel ill.

557
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,880
I'm not sure if I can eat.

558
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,510
I'll keep it simple and get the special course.

559
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,150
Three chirashi bowls, please.

560
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,690
Chirashi at an upscale Japanese restaurant? How crass.

561
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,540
Aigoo! I hear a very important guest is here.

562
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,700
What brings you all the way here, Prosecutor?

563
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,900
I finally get to see your face.

564
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,700
Wow. You run away so fast. It's hard to catch your face.

565
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,100
P-Pardon? I don't know what you're talking about.

566
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,190
By the way, I heard. You're quite heartbroken.

567
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,840
Get some live fish sashimi for the Prosecutor. A fresh one.

568
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,740
On the house.

569
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,600
Go Yang Hui, you're the CEO of this restaurant, right?

570
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,380
The building is in a good location.

571
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,190
Wow, how much does a building like this go for?

572
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,340
Should I ask Seo Tae Pyung these questions?

573
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,880
A figurehead wouldn't know.

574
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,630
Shit...

575
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

576
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,890
- Merciful Buddha... 
 - Fish swim in schools...

577
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,570
in order to increase their survival rate.

578
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,930
While the guys on the outside are getting eaten,

579
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:33,990
the guys hiding inside survive.

580
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,040
I already started fishing,

581
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,000
so I'll try to catch the guys on the inside, too.

582
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,720
But your fishing rod is broken.

583
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,900
So what will you fish with?

584
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,400
Thanks for your concern. I have plenty of tools, so don't worry.

585
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,720
But you know what?

586
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,730
As long as you've lent your name,

587
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,910
you can be blamed for everything.

588
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,640
Well, do whatever you want.

589
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,280
Oh, next time, give me a call beforehand.

590
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,200
We'll serve you a course.

591
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,120
- What is this? Why is this playing? 
  - Stay tuned to the end. 

592
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,300
 Be Eun Ha's friends! 

593
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,700
Hey, what are you doing?

594
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,300
- Damn it! 
 - Hey, hey!

595
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,990
Why are you watching this right now?

596
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,000
Thank you. 
    

597
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,200
Take care.

598
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,690
Start the car.

599
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,010
You're just going to go? After coming all the way here?

600
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,220
What else would we do?

601
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,710
Play with the kids while you're here!

602
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,120
- I brought all the toys. 
 - Oh, no.

603
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,850
Man Ho, Jae Soo...

604
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,600
That's nonsense.

605
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,700
People like us should disappear before anyone sees us.

606
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,650
Who are "people like us"?

607
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,550
What do you mean? Bad people.

608
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,490
People who did bad things.

609
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,080
To kids, bad people are people who don't care.

610
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,740
The people who play with them are the good ones.

611
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,520
I don't think you get it.

612
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,110
I don't think you get it, either, Jae Soo.

613
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,990
Play with them, how?

614
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,500
What are you doing there?

615
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,200
They were going to drop things off, but it worked out that way.

616
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,740
Don't worry. I'll go check on them.

617
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,200
Just do what we practiced! Okay?

618
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,780
Everyone! Are you excited?

619
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,190
 Yes! 

620
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:35,540
One, two, three!

621
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:47,420
The elephant ahjussi is so scary.

622
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,280
Stop, stop.

623
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,620
I told you this was a bad idea! Kids don't like us!

624
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,830
- Let's stop. 
 - Don't cry! Don't cry!

625
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,780
Kids don't like us!

626
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:10,850
Follow me! Now!

627
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:14,040
â™«  Do it like me, just like this  â™«

628
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,200
â™«  Do it like me, just like this  â™«

629
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,400
â™«  Do it like me, just like this  â™«

630
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,930
â™«  This is so fun  â™«

631
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,100
â™«  Do it like an elephant  â™«

632
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,290
â™«  Do it like an elephant  â™«

633
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,240
Stop, stop, stop!

634
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,660
â™«  This is so fun  â™«

635
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,920
â™«  Do it like a kangaroo  â™«

636
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,970
â™«  Do it like a kangaroo  â™«

637
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,300
â™«  Do it like a kangaroo  â™«

638
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,500
â™«  This is so fun  â™«

639
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,650
â™«  Do it like a monkey  â™«

640
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,900
â™«  Do it like a monkey  â™«

641
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,060
â™«  Do it like a monkey  â™«

642
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:03,190
â™«  This is so fun  â™«

643
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,430
Bye-bye!

644
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,060
Guys! The kids laughed!

645
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,320
The kids laughed!

646
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,200
   

647
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,660
No one was here.

648
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,580
Can we talk for a minute?

649
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,910
No, Iâ€”

650
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,840
   

651
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,100
 Your call cannot be completed. After the tone... 

652
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,410
 Your call cannot be completed. 

653
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,000
 Yes, Prosecutor. 

654
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,410
Where are you right now, Eun Ha?

655
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,940
Me? I'm at an orphanage.

656
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,620
Everything is okay, right?

657
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,890
Yeah, everything is fine. What's going on?

658
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,700
It's nothing.

659
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,500
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

660
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,920
I was out for lunch and thought of you.

661
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,560
If you're okay, that's good.

662
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,230
Have fun.

663
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,950
Bye.

664
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,200
   

665
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,600
- What is it? I'm short on timeâ€” 
 - Hey, thug.

666
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:08,200
That's what I called you eight years ago, Seo Ji Hwan.

667
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,980
You remember, right?

668
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,010
Back then, you didn't have a fancy building like this.

669
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:16,320
You weren't a CEO of a company with employees.

670
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,570
I...

671
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:21,450
liked you, no matter who you were.

672
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,500
I knew your past from the beginning.

673
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Doing whatever you needed to do to survive.

674
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,400
I understand that life.

675
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,500
How much have you told Eun Ha?

676
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,150
Does she understand you as well as I do?

677
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,000
Not being able to talk about it is my problem, not hers.

678
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,400
If you can't even tell her that much,

679
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,900
- I still have a shot, right? 
 - Kang Ye Na.

680
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,400
I'm sorry.

681
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,020
But since long before you knew me,

682
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,500
the only girl for me...

683
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,500
has always been Go Eun Ha.

684
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,020
   

685
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,930
   

686
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,260
   

687
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,500
 Does Eun Ha understand you as well as I do? 

688
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,700
The volunteers made the work go so smoothly today.

689
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:06,100
I know. How could such big guys play so well with kids?

690
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,620
The kids loved them.

691
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,760
We finished the laundry so fast, too.

692
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:28,770
â™«  A story from long ago comes back to my mind  â™«

693
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,820
â™«  See the moon, moon, moon  â™«

694
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,050
Seriously!

695
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:37,360
Hey, man, don't slack off!

696
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:47,180
â™«  Your voice that I missed so much. Will I hear it again?  â™«

697
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:55,750
â™«  The image I dreamed of in my heart appears before my eyes  â™«

698
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:02,150
â™«  We all wanna be to the by no farewell  â™«

699
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:10,200
â™«  Now that weâ€™ve met again, a fateful miracle that recognized each other  â™«

700
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,200
It's going over there!

701
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,580
Lose some weight! Geez!

702
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,100
Hyungnim!

703
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
Hello, Hyungnim.

704
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,500
Is this yours?

705
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,000
Thank you.

706
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:54,740
Ji Hwan!

707
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,000
- Come with us, Hyungnim. 
 - Come with us.

708
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,480
Come with us, Hyungnim!

709
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,400
Come over here! Join us, Ji Hwan.

710
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,150
Give Hyungnim something to do.

711
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:04,070
Come here.

712
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,130
Fighting!

713
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,590
Rock, paper, scissors!

714
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:22,220
I think our guys are more excited than the kids.

715
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:31,230
Everyone wanted to leave, but I told them to stay.

716
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,580
That was okay, right?

717
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,400
My father...

718
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,730
was the boss of an infamous mob.

719
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,400
I was 13 when I found out who he was.

720
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,580
 Stop it! Where am I? 

721
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,560
 Let go of me! 

722
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,120
 Is your mom's name Yoon Sun Mi? 

723
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,230
 How about your father? 

724
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,000
 Don't you want to know who your father is? 

725
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,120
 Why should I want to know? 

726
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,070
 When you get curious, come find me. 

727
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:22,750
 - Get up. Come. 
 - Let go! Let go! 

728
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,720
 Let go! Wait! Wait! Ahjussi! 

729
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,570
 Ahjussi, what's your name? 

730
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,700
   

731
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,870
I never thought I would go back to him again,

732
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:43,260
but I went to see him three years later.

733
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,600
 I need money. 

734
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:49,370
- How much? 
 - 20 million won.

735
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,150
 Give it to him. 

736
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,700
 - Aren't you going to ask what for? 
 - The reason isn't important. 

737
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,600
 The important thing is that you owe me now. 

738
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,070
 Patient Yoon Sun Mi has passed away. 

739
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:23,080
   

740
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,580
 Mom... 

741
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,580
 Mom... 

742
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,070
 I'm sorry. 

743
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:50,160
 Mom... 

744
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,210
 Stop crying. 

745
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,360
Everything was my choice.

746
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,030
Going to see Father,

747
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:18,330
and agreeing to go under his wing.

748
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:21,670
 From now on, your name is Seo Ji Hwan. 

749
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,090
 You're my son. 

750
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,380
The things I did...

751
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,810
weren't because I was the son of a mob boss.

752
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,110
No one forced me to do them.

753
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,820
They were all my choices.

754
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,590
It was my fault.

755
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,810
So that's your past, Ji Hwan.

756
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,790
It's very different from who you are now.

757
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,960
I'm sorry.

758
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,100
The Ji Hwan I know...

759
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,830
isn't someone who did bad things under his father.

760
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:16,550
He tries hard to be a role model for his brothers.

761
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:22,950
You told Hong Gi to keep his word when it comes to keeping promises.

762
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:28,780
You told Jae Soo to hold back his anger, even if someone picks a fight first.

763
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:31,470
When you went to save Taek,

764
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:34,310
you just took the blows.

765
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:37,940
I could be back there at any second.

766
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:45,080
If you're not seeking forgiveness for the past...

767
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:50,500
but trying not to go back to the past, Ji Hwan,

768
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,260
I want to help you...

769
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,800
with your efforts.

770
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,950
Thank you.

771
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:25,720
   

772
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:32,090
Let's stop the child's play.

773
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,080
The orphanage posted a thank-you video.

774
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,390
Is this online?

775
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,660
Yes.

776
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,600
The comments are very positive.

777
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,880
There's a negative one here and there,

778
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,930
but most responses say, "You guys are great. This is so fun."

779
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,300
 - You guys are awesome! 
 - This was hilarious. 

780
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,960
 - This looks so fun. 
 - You guys did such a great thing. 

781
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,970
 Thirsty Deer, I'm rooting for you. 

782
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:05,100
Did the kids see this, too? What did they say?

783
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,690
Everyone loves it.

784
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:14,340
Look. Oh, one more...

785
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,750
Should we have lunch together later?

786
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,400
I'll go to the office.

787
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,430
Sounds good.

788
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:38,750
â™«  Do it like a monkey  â™«

789
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,060
â™«  Do it like a monkey  â™«

790
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:46,680
Wow. Hyungnim! You look so good on video!

791
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,370
You, too. You look good on stage.

792
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,820
Look at the comments! It's all about the monkey.

793
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:57,260
People are saying you're cute, too.

794
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,840
Go watch it at your own desks!

795
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,900
I can't work with you here.

796
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,380
There are 100 comments! Can't we just enjoy it?

797
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,460
Just go to your own desks.

798
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,690
Everyone look! It's amazing!

799
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,620
I'll check this one more time and take it to Prosecutor Choi.

800
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,210
- Got it. 
 - Good day.

801
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,980
Yes, this is Jang Hyun Woo.

802
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,170
At Thirsty Deer?

803
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,340
â™«  Do it like me, just like this  â™«

804
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,620
â™«  Do it like me, just like this  â™«

805
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:46,590
â™«  Do it like me, just like this  â™«

806
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:49,520
   

807
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,010
   

808
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:56,230
â™«  This is so fun  â™«

 Be sure to tell Sister-in-Law that I'll be watching her new channel. 

811

 I'm a fan!

- I like that. 
 - I'll ask her soon.

817
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,050
Hey!

818
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:23,950

 I need your help. 

829
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,310
 Why didn't you tell her? 

830
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:26,950
 If she finds out you're the oppa from her childhood... 

831
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,070
 I'm going to find you.

 Can you tell me who it is?

 I've been looking for you for so long. 

835
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,560
 I'm different from you. 

836
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,810
 You can't live like that. 

837
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,020
 What did you do? 

838
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,640
 You said you'd protect her no matter what!
