10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,610
 The winter scenery of Antarctica looks incredible, 

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,680
 but to emperor penguins, winter is hell. 

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,590
 They are all males. 

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,220
 To protect the eggs they are holding, 

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,160
 they must stay strong. 

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,130
 This is the penguins' wise tactic to survive the winter. 

16
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,720
 It's called "huddling." 

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,560
 75 days of sacrifice have finally borne their fruit. 

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,410
 It was definitely worth it. 

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm going to...

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,520
do that thing called "huddling."

- Eun Ha! 
 - Hyungnim!

35
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,910
Hurry up, you bastard!

36
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,210
Where are you?

37
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,280
What's going on?

38
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,540
- What is happening? 
 - Hyungnim!

39
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,130
One, two, three!

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,400
That was his wife?

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,380
Eun Ha!

46
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
E-Eun Ha, are you awake?

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,000
D-Do you know who I am?

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,520
Eun Ha, don't you recognize me?

49
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,790
 Eun Ha, don't fall asleep. 

50
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,600
 - Can you hear me? 
 - Yes. 

51
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,610
 Listen to what I'm saying. 

52
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,090
 The emperor penguin... 

53
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,160
 is the only animal that lays its eggs and raises its young in Antarctica. 

54
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,920
 While the females are at sea, the males hold the eggs in a group. 

55
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,590
 The success rate is only 60%. 

56
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,740
 When they first tuck the eggs, sometimes they drop them on their feet. 

57
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,870
 But after a year, they get better at it. 

58
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,000
 Eun Ha? 

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,570
 E-Eun Ha? 

60
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,370
 Eun Ha, wake up! 

61
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,120
 Eun Ha! 

62
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,170
 Help! 

63
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,720
CEO.

64
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,800
Yes, that's right. You know who I am, right?

65
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,350
I'm sorry, Eun Ha.

66
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,560
- The guys did something stupid. 
 - No.

67
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,100
I wasn't cold at all.

68
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,160
You were way colder.

69
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,030
I'm not a penguin or your child.

70
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,800
Some parents wouldn't even do that for their children.

71
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,020
Why are you so nice to me?

72
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,550
What am I to you, Seo Ji Hwan?

73
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,370
Eun Ha...

74
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,780
To me, you are...

75
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,920
What's happening?

76
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,850
What?

77
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,750
Hello, Hyungnim.

78
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,760
Are you guys out of your minds?

79
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,430
You lock someone wearing nothing...

80
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,830
but a thin work uniform in a minus 18°C freezer for an hour.

81
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,940
Didn't you know what was going to happen?

82
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,700
- I'm sorry. I wanted something good to happen... 
 - Something good?

83
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,810
You risked someone's life!

84
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,490
Gwak Jae Soo, why did you bring along a non-employee?

85
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,670
- I— 
 - I didn't bring her.

86
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,360
The rat—

87
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,340
- I'm sorry, Hyungnim. 
 - Stop, stop scolding them.

88
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,100
I...

89
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,950
I feel so terrible.

90
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,580
Stop crying.

91
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,660
Stop!

92
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,240
I don't know what to say.

93
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,060
You didn't have to make him cry.

95
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,950
- Don't cry. Man Ho, it's okay. 
 - Sister-in-law!

96
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,030
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

97
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,640
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,580
Hey! Hey!

99
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,260
Come on.

100
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,770
We'll go calm him down, Hyungnim.

101
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,000
- Come on, come on. 
 - What's wrong with you?

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,100
Man Ho...

103
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,640
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,110
No, it's okay.

105
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,970
   

106
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,590
   

107
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,530
 Are you concerned about Go Eun Ha or me? 

108
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,660
   

109
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,530
   

110
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,170
 Who were you just talking to? 

111
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,400
 I'll tell you later. 

112
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,600
 Was it Seo Ji Hwan? 

113
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,630
 I'm sorry. I'll find out where Yun is and call you. 

114
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,000
   

115
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,300
 Aren't you afraid of Seo Ji Hwan? 

116
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,700
 To me, he just looked like an average boss concerned about his employee. 

117
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,470
He's all over the place today.

118
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,800
It has to be about a relationship.

119
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,500
- I'm not so sure. 
 - Were you ever?

120
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,860
   

121
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,130
   

122
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,430
I heard she just woke up.

123
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,300
I don't think you need to worry too much.

124
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,200
Okay.

125
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
 That night— 

126
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
...was a mistake.

127
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm sorry.

128
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,960
   

129
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,970
I...

130
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,690
was just going to ask if you got home okay that night.

131
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,890
I'll make you delicious food for you to eat. Get well soon.

132
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,300
Hey! How did you know I was here?

133
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,120
That guy called me up.

134
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,740
Who are you calling "that guy"?

135
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,410
- You called Mi Ho? 
 - Oh, yes.

136
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,170
I thought you might need some stuff. Thank you for coming.

137
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,960
Sure.

138
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,230
Hey. Are you okay?

139
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,960
Yeah, I'm fine. This is my friend Gu Mi Ho.

140
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,100
Gumiho? 
  (T/N: means Nine-tailed fox) 

141
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,200
So you're not a human?

142
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,930
Just let it go.

143
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,700
It's a joke. Don't take him so seriously.

144
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,300
Joke?

145
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,110
- Hello. 
 - Hey, Il Yeong.

146
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,400
Sister-in-law is resting, so...

147
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,480
- Let me go inside. 
 - Oh, okay.

148
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,630
   

149
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,860
Gosh, so embarrassing!

150
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,270
I'm so embarrassed! I can't believe I ran into him.

151
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,040
How am I supposed to look at him?

152
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,370
Where did she go? Oh, she's outside.

153
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,400
    
 Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo?

154
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,360
CEO, you should get some rest, too. You must be exhausted.

155
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,410
I'm okay. I'm totally fine.

156
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,760
Right, you were both in that cold freezer together!

157
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,410
Hyungnim, maybe you should get a vitamin shot or something.

158
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,090
Hypothermia is no joke! Right, Dong Hee?

159
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,790
Right. We'll take care of stuff back there—

160
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,180
What are you talking about?

161
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,330
Hyungnim takes cold showers in the dead of winter.

162
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,830
Seriously?

163
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,850
Come on...

164
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,300
What?

165
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,820
Why don't you go get another shot, little rat?

166
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,610
Let me just go check on the factory.

167
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,700
If you need anything, let us know. Get some rest.

168
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,000
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

169
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,690
Hyungnim, you should lie down with her and spend some time...

170
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,230
Get some rest!

171
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,100
What's her name? Gu Mi Ho?

172
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,420
She's a brat like the little rat, calling you "that guy."

173
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,150
Wait! If they're friends, they're the same age.

174
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,830
She's only 30? That damn little...

175
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,740
I thought I turned into a popsicle for a second.

176
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,810
Getting iced out like that.

177
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,230
Look upon her kindly.

178
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,500
What?

179
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,430
She's a friend of Eun Ha.

180
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,690
What's going on with you?

181
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,880
Something happened, right?

182
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,400
What's going on? Has the player entered the field?

183
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,590
Hey.

184
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,660
What's with the suitcase? I'm here for one night.

185
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,110
Gosh, I know, right?

186
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,830
I'd like to know as well.

187
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,320
Why do you need all this stuff for a one-night stay?

188
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,810
What is this?

189
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,840
"Stuff Eun Ha needs at the hospital."

190
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,770
   

191
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,190
   

192
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,540
    
  (T/N: US size 7, UK 5, EU 38) 

193
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,170
   

194
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,700
You look touched.

195
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,670
I thought "kids, seniors, and beauties were nuisances." Liar.

196
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,820
I'm so tired.

197
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,110
That's right. We've met here before.

198
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,350
 Hyungnim! 

199
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,680
 We're coming in, Hyungnim! 

200
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,790
 How are you doing? 

201
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,900
 Please? What are you doing, Dong Hee? 

202
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,170
 - I was going to put the cover on you.  
  - Okay. I'll do it. 

203
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,180
 Thanks. 

204
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,280
 - Get out.  
  - Get some rest, Hyungnim. 

205
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,180
 We'll get going. 

206
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,500
 They're gone. 

207
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I had no idea we'd end up like this.

208
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,740
- End up like what? 
 - What?

209
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,830
You know, the prosecutor who might be Hyun Woo...

210
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,790
Is his last name Jang?

211
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,380
How did you know?

212
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,420
Have you checked? What did he say? Is it him?

213
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,590
I'm waiting to see.

214
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,600
Why is that so hard to answer?

215
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,560
Hey, maybe he's married and pretending to be single?

216
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,000
- It's not like that. 
 - What do you mean?

217
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,100
He's Hyun Woo, but he can't say he is.

218
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,910
He's not Hyun Woo, but he can't say he's not.

219
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,320
He must have a reason he can't say!

220
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,220
I can't tolerate this.

221
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,730
When he's here, I'll ask him myself.

222
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,870
Who's coming here?

223
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,400
The prosecutor? Here?

224
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,360
 Let me just go check on the factory. 

225
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,300
 If you need anything, let us know. 

226
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,000
 They can't run into each other. 

227
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,800
Thank you.

228
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Prosecutor!

229
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,050
Eun Ha.

230
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,260
Thank goodness, I thought I might miss you.

231
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,400
Let's go somewhere else.

232
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Where?

233
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,690
- Eun Ha... 
 - Yes?

234
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,370
Your hand.

235
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm sorry.

236
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,970
I wanted to show you around the hospital.

237
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,810
You shouldn't be wandering around, Eun Ha.

238
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,900
It's fine. I'm not even that sick.

239
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,810
These are just nutrients.

240
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,650
Hemorrhoids...

241
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,130
are serious.

242
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,970
What? Hem... what?

243
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,320
75% of Koreans have them at least once in their lives.

244
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,420
You don't need to be embarrassed.

245
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,350
Who told you I had hemorrhoids?

246
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,840
The front desk when I asked for your room number. Isn't that right?

247
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,520
- Those guys... 
 - What?

248
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,170
Well, I'm anemic, so I just came in for some tests.

249
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,230
- You're anemic? 
 - Yes.

250
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,480
- Really? 
 - Yes.

251
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,220
I don't have hemorrhoids.

252
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,100
Okay. I believe you. That's good.

253
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,400
You don't have to believe me...

254
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,000
- You do look a bit pale. 
 - Mini Unni!

255
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,130
Yoo Na! Joon! Chul!

256
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,910
I haven't seen you in forever! Long time no see! How've you been?

257
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,480
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

258
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,060
Unni, are you sick?

259
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,710
I was a little sick, but now I'm okay.

260
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,800
Why don't you come by anymore?

261
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,500
We're bored watching the same videos over and over again.

262
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,310
I'm sorry I haven't been able to come.

263
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,410
I really missed you guys, Yoo Na, Joon, Chul.

264
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,400
Who are you, Ahjussi?

265
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,640
Isn't it obvious? It's her boyfriend.

266
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,120
- He's not my boyfriend... 
 - What do you think?

267
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,350
Do you think I look good next to Unni?

268
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:32,880
Ahjussi, are you strong? I like men who are strong.

269
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,000
I think that describes me.

270
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,900
I'll show you how strong I am.

271
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,280
Here we go!

272
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,560
Aigoo! H-Hi, you're here.

273
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,240
Yes.

274
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,180
Oh, Eun Ha just went out to get something.

275
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,340
She'll be right back. Go on in.

276
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,960
It's okay. Here...

277
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,990
Her shoes were back there.

278
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,790
I just came to drop this off.

279
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,700
Eun Ha will be sad if you leave without seeing her.

280
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,170
I have to head out now to run an errand.

281
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,290
Wait inside. It's okay!

282
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,990
- Then... 
 - Let me open it for you.

283
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,750
Don't worry. Go on in.

284
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,740
Prosecutor, you're so good at playing with kids.

285
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,430
Oh, no. Compared to you, I'm not even close.

286
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,650
You're the professional at playing with kids.

287
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,830
It seems like you still love kids.

288
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,520
Are you done being a content creator?

289
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,670
A lot of things happened.

290
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm scared of the fact that the kids could get hurt because of me.

291
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,950
I don't have the courage yet.

292
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:27,920
Everyone has those concerns. Including me.

293
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:35,600
But you must have started this work for a reason.

294
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,410
I'll go now. Don't come down. Get some rest.

295
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,570
- Get some rest. 
 - Okay.

296
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,620
 The door is closing. 

297
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,560
 So do you have break-ins every once in a while? 

298
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,210
 No, that's not it. I'm just used to being alert. 

299
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:08,330
♫  A story from long ago  ♫

300
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:17,900
♫  See the moon, moon, moon  ♫

302
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,680
 Close your eyes and count to ten. 

303
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,200
 Keep making your videos. 

304
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,370
 I miss watching them.

Oh. I'm so sorry.

312
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,330
I dozed off while I was waiting.

313
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,430
It's okay. I just got here.

314
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,860
You don't look well. Get some rest.

315
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,340
I'm okay.

316
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,650
You really don't look well.

317
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,790
I'm totally fine.

318
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,450
How about getting an IV?

319
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,950
It's okay.

320
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,130
"It's okay, it's okay."

321
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,190
That means you'll get one, right?

322
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,530
No... I... really... am okay.

323
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,360
Get some sleep.

324
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,920
I'll sit here quietly.

325
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,640
Let me know if you need anything.

326
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,070
Well, um...

327
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,390
- I'll just stay like this for a second. 
 - Okay.

328
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,830
CEO, what were you like as a kid?

329
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,130
Seo Ji Hwan now...

330
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,890
is sensitive to small noises,

331
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,880
can't sleep deeply, no matter how tired he is,

332
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,380
feels more comfortable in the dark,

333
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,170
and furrows his brows when he's sleeping.

334
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,520
I'm curious what Seo Ji Hwan was like 20 or 30 years ago.

335
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,630
Did he sleep well back then?

336
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,860
So deeply that someone could run off with him?

337
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,350
He never answers any of my questions.

338
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,070
Did he ever open up to someone before?

339
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,370
There was...

340
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,370
just one person.

341
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,560
Who was it?

342
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,680
When I was little,

343
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,570
we moved around a lot.

344
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,230
Even if I grew close to someone,

345
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,190
I knew I had to leave them.

346
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,830
That's why I didn't open up easily. But...

347
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,190
with that one person, that was impossible.

348
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,590
Why?

349
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,870
Maybe because I think we seemed similar.

350
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,510
In what way?

351
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,520
She looked so lonely.

352
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,590
So I wanted to be close to her.

353
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,920
I just wanted to be by her side.

354
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,600
What happened next? Do you still talk?

355
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,750
No.

356
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,620
I haven't seen her since.

357
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,610
But...

358
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,270
I believe she's doing well...

359
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,800
somewhere out there.

360
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,430
My shoulders are still sore from working.

361
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,280
Dong Hee? Are you okay?

362
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,460
Totally okay.

363
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,700
I'm still so tired, no matter how much I sleep.

364
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,320
I don't have an appetite.

365
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Where's Hyungnim?

366
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Well, he didn't come home.

367
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,470
Hyungnim spent the night somewhere else?

368
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,350
F-For real?

369
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,510
Oh, my, Miss. Your purse fell on the floor.

370
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,660
Thank you.

371
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,420
I'm having a neck spasm.

372
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,200
My neck won't move.

373
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,760
Hold on. No, no...

374
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,750
No...

375
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,800
You're so good at that.

376
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,210
You should be a masseuse. A little lower.

377
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,020
You're so good at that...

378
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,110
Mi Ho, are you okay?

379
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,750
Oh, no. Does it hurt a lot? Should we get an X-ray at the hospital?

380
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,380
I don't need to be hospitalized for a neck spasm. Forget it.

381
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,650
Why did you sleep here? You should have gone home.

382
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,380
Il Yeong!

383
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,390
Here.

384
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,030
- I'm getting a cab. 
 - No way. You have a neck spasm.

385
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,050
Just take the ride. Il Yeong, please take care of Mi Ho.

386
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,920
I can go home on my own.

387
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,110
Il Yeong, Samcheong-dong.

388
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,380
- Please. 
 - No, no.

389
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,340
Hey. If it gets worse, go to the hospital right away. Close the shop for the day.

390
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,940
If you'll open, call me. I'll go and clean.

391
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,590
Be careful. Careful.

392
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,070
I'm not getting in!

393
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,340
Get in! It looks like it hurts!

394
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,000
- No! 
 - Take care of her, Il Yeong.

395
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,690
Sure.

396
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,550
Hey! I'm going to kill you!

397
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,360
Go like this. The other way.

398
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,910
Bye!

399
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,200
How are you feeling?

400
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,390
Fine.

401
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,480
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,320
I didn't mean to scare you.

403
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,530
I'm sure it was a "mistake."

404
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,400
- That was actually a mistake. 
 - Damn it!

405
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,750
Are you a mistake maniac?

406
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,030
Thanks for the ride.

407
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,440
If you need to charge, let me know.

408
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,190
Stop right there.

409
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,560
Dad?

410
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,680
Hey.

411
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,950
You with XY chromosomes.

412
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,200
Move two meters to your left.

413
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,180
Dad, I think there's been a huge misunderstanding.

414
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,380
My daughter, who packed a bag for an overnight stay without telling me.

415
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,580
Do not speak.

416
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,400
You have a good sense of distance.

417
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,920
Left face!

418
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,980
Face front!

419
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,790
That's your house, sir.

420
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,110
My house.

421
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,450
Go! Left foot, left foot.

422
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,450
Left foot, left foot.

423
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:50,620
Change feet. Left foot, left foot, left foot.

424
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,990
   

425
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,220
Age.

426
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,320
29, sir.

427
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,800
You look young.

428
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,960
Your face looks way younger than that.

429
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,490
- Name. 
 - Joo Il Yeong, sir.

430
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,340
What a nice name.

431
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,070
- Where do you belong? 
 - I work at a company.

432
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,970
Do you not know what "belong" means? Which company?

433
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:23,850
Dad, you're barking up the wrong tree. Totally wrong.

434
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,170
My daughter, who stayed out overnight...

435
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,570
Have I ever told you I'm staying out?

436
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,180
Were you also with Mi Ho last week?

437
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,350
If you don't answer me within one second,

438
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,690
I will consider your answer a lie.

439
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,360
You're so good-looking.

440
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,370
Ow. I need to stand up.

441
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,570
Stand up. Oh, no. Your knee...

442
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,910
Mom, Dad! He has to go to work! What are you doing? Just go.

443
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,860
Stop right there!

444
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,900
Stay for breakfast. Sit. Eat breakfast.

445
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,900
- Pardon? 
 - Sit down.

446
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,940
Honey.

447
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,650
He has to go to work!

448
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,780
We just need to set the table. Grab a bite.

449
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,930
- Honey, fill it up. 
 - Sure, sure.

450
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,520
Mom, Mom! Don't!

451
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,850
- I-I... 
 - Do you like eggs?

452
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,730
Fish cakes? Lotus roots?

453
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,060
Sit, sit down.

454
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,940
- Sit down, sit. 
 - You should go.

455
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,400
- Sit down. 
 - Have a seat.

456
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,790
   

457
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,830
Wow. It's huge.

458
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,930
Wow, it's a sausage.

459
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,960
Hello.

460
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,070
I'm here to meet with the CEO. I have something for him.

461
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,420
I'm sorry, but you can't see the CEO without an appointment.

462
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,690
Oh, right, right.

463
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,550
I...

464
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,810
know Mr. Seo Ji Hwan.

465
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,130
We're close. My name is Go Eun Ha.

466
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,970
If you call him, he'll know. Go Eun Ha.

467
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,830
You've misunderstood. It's not like that!

468
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,510
- I just need to give this to him! 
 - Please leave.

469
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,790
- Let's talk outside. 
 - I'm not a weirdo!

470
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,060
Mini Unni!

471
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,920
Hong Gi!

472
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,380
This thing. This.

473
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,010
What?

474
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,380
I heard from Marketing Team Leader Yang...

475
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,880
that you don't need a model who can't eat meat.

476
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,750
Is breaking a contract this easy?

477
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,930
I'm sorry about that.

478
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,500
But I think you're partially responsible for not informing us in advance.

479
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,810
Can't you just use a body double for eating scenes?

480
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,150
I don't know about other places, but that's not how we work.

481
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,120
I can shoot without having to eat.

482
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,390
- Ms. Kang Ye Na. 
 - Yes, Mr. Seo Ji Hwan?

483
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,940
Do you even know what a sausage tastes like?

484
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,260
When was the last time you had some?

485
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,670
How is our product different from others?

486
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,450
Are you able to explain?

487
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,170
If you need to take legal action,

488
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,600
go ahead.

489
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,400
I get what you're saying.

490
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,620
So if I can eat it, we can make it work?

491
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,900
 The door is closing. 

492
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,980
Dong Hee!

493
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,420
Teacher.

494
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,510
Wow, is this your desk?

495
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:50,760
You look so cool like this!

496
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,970
This is Mr. Seo's wallet. I wanted to hand it to him.

497
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,290
Is he inside? Oh, there.

498
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,430
Wait. He's in the middle of a meeting.

499
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,340
It's Ye Na.

500
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,010
Oh, about modeling.

501
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,720
Well...

502
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,740
Dong Hee.

503
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,150
I'll give it to him.

504
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,880
Yes.

505
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,950
We didn't do anything wrong. Why...

506
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,850
I think I've made my point.

507
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,580
I hope we can stop talking about this now.

508
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,200
I won't take legal action.

509
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,500
I'll make you chase me, Mr. Seo.

510
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,830
Hyungnim.

511
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,070
Hey, what's going on?

512
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,000
Clean up!

513
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,410
- Sir! 
 - What?

514
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,960
Could you let me out just for a day?

515
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,450
I'm not asking you to let me go. I'll come right back.

516
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,560
Just a day. If not, just a phone call.

517
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,790
I'll just say I'm okay and hang up right away.

518
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,090
They got in via the port of Incheon around 3 a.m. today.

519
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,300
Look closely. It's blurry, but it's definitely Ta Wan.

520
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,310
Any movement since then?

521
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,000
She's as fast as they say.

522
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,610
She changed cars many times. Officer Yang lost her.

523
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,750
She showed up here herself.

524
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,140
Something is different about this deal.

525
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,120
When you hear from Officer Yang,

526
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,930
let me know.

527
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,590
- Got it. 
 - Okay.

528
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,760
By any chance...

529
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,970
how do you track down a person?

530
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,490
Who? Let me find them for you.

531
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,350
Name, age, sex.

532
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,300
Born in 1988, Hyun Woo.

533
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,920
Hyun Woo.

534
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,120
That's you.

535
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,300
Are you looking for yourself?

536
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,050
Are you trying to find yourself?

537
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,560
It might be faster to do that yourself instead of me.

538
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,540
I am finding myself, but it's a different person.

539
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,550
It won't be easy to find him without a last name.

540
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,910
We could use a private investigator, but that's illegal.

541
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,900
Or we could use government powers, but that's also illegal.

542
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,110
Then could I look at a list of households from a certain year?

543
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,950
I don't think that's illegal.

544
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,160
- Please. 
 - Sure.

545
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,130
What?

546
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,500
H-How did you get this?

547
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,550
The teacher dropped it off.

548
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,730
Eun Ha was here?

549
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,240
- Yes. 
 - Why didn't you let her in?

550
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,910
 So if I can eat it, we can make it work? 

551
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,640
She saw that?

552
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,100
What part?

553
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,610
The hands.

554
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,050
I thought beautiful women were a nuisance.

555
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,840
That definitely did not look like...

556
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,390
someone who found her a nuisance.

557
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,750
Where is that thing?

558
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,250
Everyone is on time today.

559
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,670
Do you have your introductions?

560
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,700
No need for introductions.

561
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,040
Introduce us to where Hyungnim was last night.

562
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,420
Do you have to ask?

563
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,100
The torrid affairs between a man and a woman?

564
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,880
You were with him, right, little rat?

565
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,450
Your bratty friend said she wasn't with you.

566
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,640
What were you two doing?

567
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,520
What is there to do at night besides sleep?

568
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,380
Did you sleep together?

569
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,700
So...

570
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,590
the two of you... "We just held hands."

571
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,750
Don't... Don't give me that cliché.

572
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,200
We didn't hold hands.

573
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,920
- You didn't hold hands? 
 - We didn't hold hands.

574
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,450
I can't do class today.

575
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,350
- Where are you going? 
 - I'll get him.

576
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,820
Where are you going?

577
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,300
- What's wrong? 
 - I'm sorry, but I need to make a phone call.

578
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,020
What? What's wrong...

579
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,400
You've heard our prayers.

580
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:14,350
- You're home late. 
 - Oh, hello.

581
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,590
Well...

582
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,420
well, you know...

583
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,960
- Have you eaten? 
 - You haven't eaten?

584
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,420
Thank you.

585
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,660
Fried rice.

586
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,680
I used some leftover stuff in the fridge.

587
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,540
Thank you so much. I'll enjoy this meal.

588
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,290
Did you get your wallet?

589
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:50,340
You looked busy, so I just handed it off.

590
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,230
That's right. Well, she was there for work.

591
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,550
Did you hold hands for work?

592
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,680
No. It wasn't like that.

593
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,090
She can't eat meat.

594
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,330
But she tried to eat sausage, so...

595
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,470
She tried to eat sausage, so you held hands.

596
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,800
- No, I... 
 - Have some.

597
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,180
Are you sure you've never been with anyone at the age of 36?

598
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,270
The way you held her hand was so natural.

599
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,120
Eat.

600
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,950
Eat slowly.

601
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,170
Was I eating too fast?

602
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,350
CEO, could you answer my question...

603
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,250
About that...

604
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,120
Are you sure you've never been with anyone at the age of 36?

605
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,420
Oh, there's water.

606
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,040
You won't get a deep clean like that. Use more force.

607
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,180
It should be squeaky clean.

608
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,340
Yes. That's right. Good job.

609
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,590
- I'm sorry, I'll wipe it off— 
 - No, it's okay—

610
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,100
I'm sorry. One second.

611
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,390
- Let me wipe it for you. 
 - It's okay.

612
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,530
- One second. 
 - I'm fine.

613
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,240
One second.

614
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,350
The foam...

615
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,370
What... What's happening?

616
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,900
- What is that? 
 - Now they are...

617
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,290
We're home, Hyungnim!

618
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,970
Oh, hey, guys. You're home.

619
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,120
What are you doing? Cleaning, huh? Stand up right now.

620
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,380
Have you all eaten?

621
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,080
I made some fried rice!

622
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,670
Hey.

623
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,070
 I think Taek stopped by often, though. 

624
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:37,080
 Their house is stocked, and repairs are done. 

625
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,840
 He washed his hands clean after he learned he had a sister. 

626
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,960
 He must have taken good care of them. 

627
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,320
 Did something happen down there? 

628
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,210
 A prosecutor followed us. 

629
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:49,540
 Did Taek already get into trouble? 

630
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,410
 He wouldn't have followed us otherwise. 

631
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,530
Did I call you at a bad time?

632
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,100
No.

633
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,290
- Have you eaten? 
 - Yes.

634
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,350
You ate?

635
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,920
I got some bread. The kind you like.

636
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,490
I had to run an errand around here and had extra time.

637
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,610
Take it with you later.

638
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,800
But why do you speak formally on the phone?

639
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,750
Did I? Did I do that?

640
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,610
I guess I was making an official inquiry as a prosecutor.

641
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:42,880
But seeing your face, it feels friendly.

642
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,050
That's why I'm speaking informally.

643
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,160
I mean...

644
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,010
should I speak formally again?

645
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,590
You want to know about Taek, right?

646
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,730
Well, that, too.

647
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,900
Nothing new.

648
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,760
Anything about him meeting with anyone?

649
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,490
No.

650
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,420
He only talks about important stuff with Il Yeong.

651
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,770
Prosecutor.

652
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,210
The CEO won't do anything differently if I'm gone.

653
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:33,850
What does that mean?

654
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,510
He'll look for me, just the same.

655
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,020
Come in.

656
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,580
Is it ready?

657
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,230
Do you think I'd be here without it?

658
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,940
Enough with the small talk. The location?

659
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,550
Where do you want him to send it to? 
  (T/N: speaking Thai) 

660
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,310
Do not play tricks with me.

661
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,860
Go.

662
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,090
Can you translate?

663
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,090
   

664
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,510
   

665
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,700
We know where the deal is taking place.

666
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,110
The day after tomorrow. Sanhwang-dong.

667
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,200
Is the CEO inside?

668
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,570
Yes. He is.

669
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,320
There's a deal tomorrow morning.

670
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,930
Taek didn't go by his own will.

671
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,860
What are you talking about?

672
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,510
What Ta Wan wanted from the start was not Taek but his neck.

673
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:11,430
She became the boss because of Taek. But to quiet her opponents,

674
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,660
she needs a reason.

675
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:17,440
Taek wasn't the means, but the condition of the deal.

676
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,250
- Yes. 
 - Hold on...

677
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,900
Don't say this to anyone.

678
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,500
Go Yang Hui will do anything to close this deal.

679
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,020
It's too dangerous now.

680
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,560
That means Taek kept his word.

681
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,190
And that means I need to protect him.

682
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:09,900
   

683
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,700
- Eun Ha, over here. 
 - Prosecutor!

684
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,550
Hello.

685
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,530
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

686
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:26,760
Yes, that's why I don't have much time. Let's walk and talk.

687
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,980
Okay.

688
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,050
   

689
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:50,850
They said the kids still wait every Wednesday.

690
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,900
For somebody.

691
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,280
They gather voluntarily.

692
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,620
No one told them to.

693
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:08,320
Maybe you should be where you want to be.

694
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,670
Prosecutor...

695
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:14,090
Also, I'm not as talented as you are,

696
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:18,720
so I didn't make this myself, but I hope you can make use of it.

697
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,800
I'll call you later.

698
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,250
Prosecu—

699
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,820
Yes!

700
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,700
We're ready for tomorrow's deal.

701
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:50,400
You know I hate it when things don't go according to plan, right?

702
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,770
I mean...

703
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,450
if we made plans...

704
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,600
that don't succeed, it sucks! For me, that is.

705
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,210
You don't need to worry.

706
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,670
Worry?

707
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:15,210
Does it look like I'm worried?

708
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,290
Why? L-L-Look at me.

709
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,540
Does it look like...

710
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,350
I'm a coward?

711
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,530
No.

712
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,900
 Go Yang Hui will do anything to close this deal. 

713
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,400
 It's too dangerous now. 

714
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:19,210
   

715
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,770
Oh, hello!

716
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,010
- So cute! 
 - Mini Unni!

717
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:32,000
Okay, okay. Thank you!

718
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,600
Good job, Ji Woo and Hui Soo! See you again!

719
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,490
Prosecutor!

720
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,520
   

721
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,810
How was it?

722
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,330
It was so nice.

723
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:08,000
I thought I would be nervous since it's been a while.

724
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,790
But when I stood in front of them, all that went away.

725
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,950
I didn't even notice the time passing.

726
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,500
- That's good. 
 - Yes, it's good.

727
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,340
Silly me.

728
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,900
Eun Ha.

729
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,980
I wasn't crying.

730
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,390
But your nose is running.

731
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,240
Lower.

732
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:40,190
- Let me wash this and give it back. 
 - Sure.

733
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,800
Oh, and...

734
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,660
Thank you so much. This was so helpful.

735
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:51,690
You might need it next time.

736
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,260
Eun Ha, you look happiest when you're with kids.

737
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:03,180
Keep playing with them as Eun Ha unni.

738
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,050
Okay?

739
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,590
   

740
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,080
Jang Hyun Woo.

741
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,170
To Jang Hyun Woo.

742
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:29,340
Jang Hyun Woo.

743
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,370
Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo.

744
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,360
It's a lot.

745
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,460
 It's an older boy that I lost touch with as a child. 

746
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,810
 I haven't heard what happened to him since. His name was Hyun Woo, too. 

747
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:48,500
Yes, Chief. Is the household list I requested ready?

748
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,100
The second drawer?

749
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,900
Yes. I see it.

750
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,770
   

751
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,880
He was born in 1988, so let's assume his parents were born...

752
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,060
between the '50s and 1968.

753
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:08,600
It must be at least a two-person household. Okay.

754
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,730
And one of the names is?

755
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,250
 All right. 

756
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,100
 I think it's done. Should we close it? 

757
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,100
 One second. 

758
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,190
 What's that? 

759
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,640
 Oppa, thanks for always playing with me. 

760
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:13,490
Thirteen.

761
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,590
It's more people than I thought.

762
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,550
Yoon Sun Mi?

763
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,100
Yoon Sun Mi.

764
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,930
   

765
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,430
   

766
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,930
Seo Ji Hwan.

767
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,330
Seo Ji Hwan, child of Yoon Sun Mi.

768
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:01,640
Seo Ji Hwan, child of Seo Tae Pyung.

769
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:21,030
Chansang-dong 12.

770
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,880
September 2000.

771
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,100
Go Eun Ha.

772
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,720
Chansang-dong...

773
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,570
   

774
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,670
   

775
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,900
2000...

776
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:15,030
   

777
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,330
Seo Ji Hwan's name is...

778
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,700
Yoon Hyun Woo?

779
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:35,040


780
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:45,220
♫  I dream a familiar dream every day  ♫

781
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:52,900
♫  Those unforgettable times of waiting  ♫

782
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:58,280
♫  My breathing gets faster, yeah, it's real  ♫

783
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,490
   

784
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:05,650
 Do you know someone named Yoon Hyun Woo? 

785
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:09,420
 For some people, confronting the past is a difficult thing. 

786
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,900
 Jae Soo, you like this, right? 

787
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,500
 Who are you? Do you know me? 

788
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,900
 Damn it. 

789
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,600
 So whose is this? 

790
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,100
 What's going on? 

791
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,460
 I had a conception dream. 

792
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,550
 We don't have time! Something might happen to Ji Hwan! 

793
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:23,900
 I know where Seo Ji Hwan is. 

794
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,190
 I heard you live with a woman. 

795
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,770
 A kids' creator? 

796
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:31,700
 Did you think you were capable of having someone by your side? 

797
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,400
 Thanks for everything, Seo Ji Hwan. 

798
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,470
 Let's not see each other again. 

799
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:40,440
♫  Can you hear my love?  ♫
