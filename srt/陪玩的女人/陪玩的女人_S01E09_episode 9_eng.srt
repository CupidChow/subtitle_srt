1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,050
   

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,950
   

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,350
   

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,830
   

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
♫  Baby, baby, let me come along  ♫

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,590
♫  Every single day I belong  ♫

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,460
♫  Baby, baby, let me come along  ♫

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,440
♫  Keep you happy all day long  ♫

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,400
   

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,040
I'm...

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,380
not the Hyun Woo you're looking for.

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:01:01,080


13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

14
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,250
No, it's okay.

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,210
Honestly,

16
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,740
I wished that I was the Hyun Woo you're looking for.

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,120
You must have been excited, then disappointed,

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,760
every time you met someone named Hyun Woo.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,100
And it'll continue...

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,500
- to be that way. 
 - No, don't think like that.

21
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,660
It was because it was you.

22
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,130
If someone like you were Hyun Woo,

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,580
I wouldn't have to feel guilty.

24
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,550
So...

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,300
can you tell me what happened?

26
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,130
When I was young, mobsters sometimes came to my house.

27
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,510
 One day, a scary guy was asking for directions. 

28
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,850
 I thought he was looking for my dad, so I pretended I couldn't hear him 

29
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,120
 and passed by our house. 

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,730
 I found out later that... 

31
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,620
he wasn't there for my dad.

32
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,770
He came looking for Oppa,

33
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,950
who lived in the house I ran away from.

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,490
 Oppa, I'm here. 

35
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,620
 Hyun Woo Oppa! 

36
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,750
 Oppa! 

37
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,400
 What's wrong, Eun Ha? 

38
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,140
 Are you okay? 

39
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,590
 Come inside. 

40
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,560
Eventually...

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,710
Hyun Woo was taken away because of me.

42
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,740
That wasn't your fault, Eun Ha.

43
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,330
Yes, it was.

44
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,420
I don't think he would blame you, either.

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,550
The Hyun Woo you're looking for?

46
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,560
I found him.

47
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,910
If you want to meet him,

48
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,940
I can tell you who he is.

49
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,960
Why...

50
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,170
Why are you carrying that around?

51
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,070
Who are you? Do you know me?

52
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,740
Weird. I don't know who you are.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,870
You must have been drinking. You smell like alcohol.

54
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,020
I had a few. I was in a good mood.

55
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I found the person I buried this with.

56
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,680
I hear he's doing well.

57
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,040
So well that I don't have to feel guilty.

58
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,470
I had so many questions for him.

59
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,510
♫  Soothe my weary day  ♫

60
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,240
But I'm not going to meet him.

61
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,420
You told me, Seo Ji Hwan,

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,170
that some people have trouble confronting the past.

63
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,110
♫  Reflect on my uneasy heart  ♫

64
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,850
If he's doing well,

65
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,970
that's enough.

66
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,890
♫  When I feel alone  ♫

67
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,490
Yeah.

68
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,730
I guess so.

69
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,060
Thanks for everything, Seo Ji Hwan.

70
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,920
Let's not see each other again.

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,790
I'm going to move out.

72
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:13,050
♫  Push away the time that felt like a lie  ♫

73
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:20,380
♫  Oh, shine on me at the end of this road  ♫

74
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:32,310
♫  May the thick darkness be lifted and the bright light come to me  ♫

75
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,380
 It's Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo. 

76
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,480
 We need more information regarding the Jung Yoon Taek case. 

77
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,770
 Please come to the Prosecutor's Office by 10 a.m. tomorrow. 

78
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,870
 Noona! Are you ready yet? 

79
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,290
I'm coming down.

80
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,880
"Coming down right now, dude." It would be five words, right?

81
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,050
Well...

82
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,820
Little Rat, do you know how many people are waiting for you?

83
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,310
Gosh, my eyes! Too bright!

84
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,730
Little Rat, you are way too beautiful today.

85
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,230
- No, you're more beautiful. 
 - Really?

86
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,710
Sister-in-Law, we prepared food for just the five of us.

87
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,320
We can't eat this inside a bookstore.

88
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,230
We can eat it at the movie theater. What are you saying?

89
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,580
Hey.

90
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,210
You know we're taking a half-day off today, right?

91
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,140
We're buying textbooks. Purchasing textbooks.

92
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,350
Expense as "personal development" or something. We'll be back after lunch.

93
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,040
We already expensed it, so no need to report it.

94
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,640
It sounds like you are reporting it.

95
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,540
What did you say?

96
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,430
Shall we go?

97
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,250
- Let's go! 
 - It's so nice to be a group of five.

98
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,610
One, two, three, four, five, that's it!

99
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,420
Let's go.

100
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,660
This is so fun!

101
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,600
They'll be gone for a while, right?

102
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,440
Please like and subscribe!

103
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,010
   

104
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,800
Why are there so many books?

105
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,830
Man Ho.

106
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,690
- Yes, Sister-in-Law. 
 - You can look here.

107
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,660
Got it.

108
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,940
Hong Gi and Dong Hee, look over there.

109
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,870
Jae Soo, you can look over here.

110
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,520
Elementary?

111
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,050
Why am I here—

112
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,380
I graduated from elementary school!

113
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,370
These books are fun. Just take a look. It's fun.

114
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,930
What's the GED? Does it mean it's black? 
  (T/N: sounds like "black" in Korean) 

115
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,090
Take off your sunglasses.

116
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,800
What are you guys talking about? Be quiet.

117
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,510
Wow, this...

118
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,170
I don't think this was printed properly.

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,650
She's missing her eyebrows. Did they run out of ink?

120
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,840
He's so dumb.

121
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,050
Wow, her name is Rodin.

122
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,620
I said be quiet. Please.

123
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,150
There's even a cow. Pi-cow-sso.

124
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,350
Moo.

125
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,060
That's totally wrong.

126
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,980
How can I study complex things around such simpletons?

127
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,190
   

128
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,440
   

129
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,420
 Eun Ha. 

130
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,860
 I'm going to do that thing called "huddling." 

131
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,870
 Just imagine... 

132
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,780
 that I'm a penguin. 

133
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,910
   

134
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,270
So, right before the police arrived,

135
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,290
Go Yang Hui ran off with the bag?

136
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,590
- Yes. 
 - How big was it?

137
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,550
A sports bag holding around 90 liters.

138
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,360
That's enough about Go Yang Hui.

139
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,420
I told Eun Ha myself...

140
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,870
that Yoon Hyun Woo...

141
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,550
is alive and well.

142
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,900
I know you said it doesn't matter, but I thought I should tell her.

143
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,530
- Do you have any more questions? 
 - I think I'm good.

144
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,740
But Seo Ji Hwan.

145
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,830
Do you have anything else to say?

146
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,080
No.

147
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,650
   

148
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,610
   

149
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,680
   

150
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,900
What is this?

151
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,950
Hyungnim!

152
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,790
What?

153
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,500
- Damn it! 
 - Why isn't it opening? Open it!

154
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,770
Open the—

155
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,760
How dare you come here? Get out! It's not opening, open it!

156
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,500
If you mess with my employees one more time, I won't forgive you.

157
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,300
You messed up my business. You're the one that should be begging for forgiveness.

158
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,000
I will...

159
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,100
definitely mess with them. Most certainly!

160
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,850
Hey.

161
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,400
This is your last warning.

162
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,100
Next time, there will be no warning.

163
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,000
Understand?

164
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,430
Hey, hey. Get over here...

165
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,970
He's always going for my neck...

166
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,000
Hey, did you see those geezers?

167
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,790
- They were looking at elementary schoolbooks. 
 - What? Elementary school?

168
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,380
- For real. 
 - So they didn't even finish elementary?

169
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,290
Such dumbasses.

170
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,370
Why was he wearing sunglasses?

171
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,300
The sunglasses.

172
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,430
Just pretend you can't hear them.

173
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,330
I should quit smoking.

174
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,020
I don't want to smoke the same thing those kids are smoking.

175
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,950
Let's go.

176
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,400
I could just—

177
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,100
Hey, friends!

178
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,110
What are we doing here? Shouldn't you be in school?

179
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,160
No smoking.

180
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,220
Don't spit.

181
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,390
- Oh, so— 
 - So what?

182
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,150
It's not because they're stupid that they didn't graduate.

183
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,700
They have their own reasons.

184
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,370
They might look like thugs,

185
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,900
but they're great people who work at a nice company.

186
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,000
If you want to be great like them, work on being better people.

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,690
- You crazy bitch— 
 - Hey, you juceniles!

188
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,210
It's "juvenile."

189
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,490
- What's "juvenile?"
 - It's how you say it.

190
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,580
Hey, kids. She might be a little rat, but she's bigger than your fist.

191
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,410
Guys, you shouldn't smoke in your uniforms.

192
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,470
These guys know Tae Kwon Do!

193
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,520
What are you doing? Kick!

194
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,800
- So fast. 
 - Go to school.

195
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,140
What a grand exit.

196
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,370
Walk, walk.

197
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,590
Be careful!

198
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,760
Sister-in-Law.

199
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,300
Little Rat, you got some guts.

200
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,300
- Did they hurt your feelings? 
 - I have a thick skin.

201
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,720
What are you talking about?

202
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,200
We need her on our side.

203
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Let's go, Jae Soo.

204
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,810
Prosecutor, are you okay?

205
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,600
Why wouldn't I be?

206
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,170
- Do we have Ta Wan's phone records yet? 
 - Here.

207
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,990
Looking through her call log in Korea,

208
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,100
the number ending in 4885 often called from near Club Cat.

209
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,610
According to Seo Ji Hwan's testimony,

210
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,360
Go Yang Hui took his precious sports bag and disappeared.

211
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,370
That means the drug money is inside, right?

212
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,220
Summon Go Yang Hui as well.

213
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,650
Got it.

214
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,080
    
    

215
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,500
- Hello. 
  - This is Seoul Central District Prosecutors'... 

216
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,300
Seoul? Damn it!

217
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,800
   

218
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,030
- Chairman! 
  - Welcome! 

219
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,450
   

220
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,030
    
    

221
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,550
Chairman, it's been a long nine years. 
  (Korean tradition: first food on leaving jail is tofu) 

222
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,450
What is this?

223
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,280
Where are the rest of the guys?

224
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,900
Chairman!

225
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,070
 Please get home safe. 

226
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,390
   

227
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,090
- What are you doing? Take him. 
 - Yes.

228
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,180
Did you see the article?

229
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,120
Yes.

230
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,880
Where did he go?

231
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,980
Go Yang Hui took him home.

232
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,720
Are you going to see him?

233
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,640
He has nothing to do with me.

234
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,400
Considering the two of them are moving together,

235
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,200
I suppose the Chairman was behind Go Yang Hui.

236
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,740
Should we be prepared on our end?

237
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,400
No. We don't need to stir up our employees.

238
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,900
We should just keep doing what we're doing.

239
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,720
Not get affected.

240
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,180
 You're going to move out? 

241
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,600
My strengths as a creator. I'm cute, bright, lovable...

242
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,630
You almost hit my hands.

243
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,310
Did you guys fight?

244
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,910
Fight? No.

245
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,590
How big a fight was it?

246
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,500
You know what he told me when we first met?

247
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,900
He told me to always stay at least 50 meters away from him.

248
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,010
I thought he was just trying to scare me.

249
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,390
But no. That's how he actually feels.

250
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,850
He was pretty accurate.

251
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,590
I mean...

252
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,930
do you feel better when you don't see him?

253
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,730
Do you think you won't like him if you don't see him?

254
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,860
I'm leaving before I start liking him more.

255
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,400
Afraid I'd be the only one with feelings.

256
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,750
Hey, wait.

257
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,240
"I feel batter from my cold, so I can go to school now."

258
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,150
Why is that wrong?

259
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,720
That's not the right "batter."

260
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,380
I feel...

261
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,580
"all batter from my cold." You left out the "all."

262
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,320
That's right.

263
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,420
That's right. It's "all batter."

264
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,740
No, this "batter" is for cookies.

265
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,200
It's "better" with an "e."

266
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,000
How can you not know something so basic?

267
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
Why are you talking to me like that?

268
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,500
Dong Hee is finally revealing his hidden claws.

269
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,200
I thought you didn't have class today.

270
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,110
Good evening, Hyungnim.

271
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,150
Good evening.

272
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,900
Expense the books as professional development at the company.

273
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,500
Yes, Hyungnim.

274
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,400
Little Rat bought our books. Let's study hard for her sake.

275
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,200
Right.

276
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,130
I'm home!

277
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,710
Aigoo, what's all this?

278
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,750
You should have called us to help you carry them!

279
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,990
It's too heavy for you.

280
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,260
The chicken looked so good on my way. I also got pizza and ice cream.

281
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,200
Why did you spend so much money? I'm sure the books cost a lot, too.

282
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,920
Sister-in-Law, did you win the lottery?

283
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,850
I haven't done anything for you guys while living here for free.

284
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,600
I wanted to treat you one last time.

285
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
Last time?

286
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,390
- Last time? 
 - Noona.

287
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,300
Last time?

288
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,700
Last time for what?

289
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,090
Have you found a place to go?

290
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,910
I'm looking. Why do you ask?

291
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,810
Whenever an employee leaves the company, I check on where they're going.

292
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,000
You have many questions about others...

293
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,630
for someone who doesn't like that kind of attention himself.

294
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,070
It's my job as their guardian...

295
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,190
I don't need a guardian at my age.

296
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,850
No thank you for that kind of guardianship.

297
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,110
I'd like to help you as much as I can.

298
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,400
I hope you take me up on it.

299
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,500
No.

300
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,600
I don't like being confused.

301
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,560
I don't want to be confused and cross the line again.

302
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,450
Thanks, but no thanks.

303
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,760
 Then the reason for your concern for me... 

304
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,930
 Is it because my name is on the DNA database of ex-prisoners... 

305
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,260
 that the Prosecutors' Office maintains? 

306
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,260
 To me, he just looked like an average boss concerned about his employee. 

307
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,810
 The CEO won't do anything differently if I'm gone. 

308
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,100
 He'll look for me, just the same. 

309
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,600
 Grandma! 

310
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,620
 Grandma! 

311
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,980
   

312
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,760
 Commencing the meeting regarding Little Rat's exit.  
    

313
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,770
Hong Gi, hit her to the right from the left.

314
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,140
And Dong Hee, just stay still right there.

315
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,150
Man Ho, you stay even more still.

316
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,590
I'll be watching as the director.

317
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,840
- Got it? 
 - Okay. So this...

318
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,080
What are you talking about? I don't get it.

319
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,600
- I agree. 
 - Shit...

320
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,740
Positions, everyone.

321
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,210
What? What position?

322
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,940
Don't you understand?

323
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,420
Understand what?

324
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,580
Hey, I told you to silence your phone during meetings.

325
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,220
- It's yours. 
 - I know.

326
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,450
I'm in a meeting. What?

327
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,790
The kids' order exploded?

328
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,050
What is he saying?

329
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,740
The kids' sausages...

330
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,560
are sold out?

331
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,410
What are you talking about? Just yesterday, we had inventory—

332
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,800
What search engine?

333
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,920
Look it up.

334
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,750
Yeah, I'll look it up.

335
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,220
What's going on here?

336
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,980
Hyungnim.

337
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,890
Here.

338
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,160
What is this?

339
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,810
    
 - It's all about sausage.

340
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,300
I know why.

341
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,010
Kang Ye Na made a post about our kids' sausage.

342
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,590
- Kang Ye Na? 
 - Yes.

343
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,570
I said I'd make him chase me, right?

344
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,090
Thanks for cleaning.

345
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,530
I guess nothing's changed.

346
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,380
- What? 
 - Hold on.

347
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,760
We need to go.

348
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,790
- Dong Hee, wrap it up here.
 - What?

349
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,180
Yes, Team Leader. We're on our way. Dong Hee, you got this.

350
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,660
- Wait. 
 - We're on our way.

351
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,300
Dong Hee, I'll get the player.

352
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,600
- Just take care of the wrap-up. 
 - Hyung, I...

353
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,960
General Manager.

354
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,980
   

355
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,280
   

356
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,490
   

357
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,620
   

358
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,730
   

359
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,000
Yes, Dong Hee.

360
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,860
We sold out our online inventory and preorders in two hours.

361
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,600
She sure does have an influence.
    

362
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,910
Aren't you going after her?

363
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,420
It's okay. If this was going to make a difference, I would have held onto her.

364
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,090
I already talked to her about the contract.

365
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,410
Not Kang Ye Na. Sister-in-law.

366
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,640
Are you calling her that, too?

367
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,620
Jae Soo said you were quite harsh with her.

368
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,490
I can just see it.

369
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,100
How can you see if you didn't see it? Are you clairvoyant or something?

370
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,100
- Don't be cheeky. 
 - I've been meaning to tell you.

371
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,730
Considering your history,

372
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,190
I get that being gentle has seldom worked for you.

373
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,380
But being harsh will only work at Thirsty Deer.

374
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,830
Talking to the average person like that hurts their feelings.

375
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,720
And when someone's hurt, they do things like going on blind dates.

376
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,800
What are you talking about?

377
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,730
I think it's happening right now.

378
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,960
At the café on the first floor.

379
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,800
Yes, Dong Hee. I'm here. Where are you?

380
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,660
 I'll be right there. 

381
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,260
Okay, I'll wait for you.

382
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,790
- Go Eun Ha? 
 - Yes?

383
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,930
I'm Go Eun Ha, but who...

384
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:58,980
Who knows? Perhaps a man who could be your destiny?

385
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,420
What?

386
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,780
   

387
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,560
A blind date? How could she do something so dangerous?

388
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,340
Meeting a stranger is so dangerous! This is so frustrating.

389
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,710
 You have many questions about others. 

390
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,080
Right. It's none of my business.

391
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,820
 I don't need a guardian at my age. 

392
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,650
Right, I'm not her guardian.

393
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,560
 I don't like being confused. 

394
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,060
I shouldn't be sending mixed signals.

395
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,930
 - No, thank you.  
 - Okay, no—

396
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,800
No?

397
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,410
- Oh, my! Do it again! 
 - Peekaboo.

398
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,040
What?

399
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,620
- Eun Ha. 
 - Yes.

400
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,700
- Didn't it hurt? 
 - What do you mean?

401
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,210
- When you fell from heaven. 
 - Heaven?

402
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,800
- Seriously, you are too much. 
 - Eun Ha.

403
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,230
Yes.

404
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,500
- The tea. 
 - Yes.

405
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,300
- Give me a sip of tea. 
 - My tea?

406
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,370
Your beau-tea.

407
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,130
Because you're laughing so much,

408
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,280
I want to throw it at you.

409
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,920
Throw myself at you.

410
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,560
What a crazy nut.

411
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,130
- Sir. 
 - Stop it!

412
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,070
Can I take your order?

413
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,790
- One more. 
 - What is it now?

414
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,720
Oh, my god...

415
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,640
- A soda. 
 - Soda?

416
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,230
Do you want ice with that or on the side?

417
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,370
- On the side. 
 - Got it, on the side.

418
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,450
Coming right up.

419
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,630
My heart is beating so fast. Oh, no...

420
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,590
Stop. Stop. I get it.

421
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,330
So how do you know Dong Hee?

422
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:50,870
Not Dong Hee. Team Leader Yang Hong Gi laid down the bridge of love.

423
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,430
So do you work at Thirsty Deer?

424
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,740
Right, I haven't given you my card yet.

425
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,300
Sure.

426
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,030
What now?

427
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,990
What are you doing?

428
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,980
W-W-What?

430
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
Was that magic?

431
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,370
It's not magic. I hid it two hours ago.

432
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,060
On my way to work.

433
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm sorry.

434
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,710
- You're just so funny. 
 - We were too loud.

435
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,590
Yes. Give it to me.

436
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,080
Oh, Manager Goo Joon Gyung.

437
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,960
I didn't know someone so funny worked here.

438
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,550
So, do you know Seo Ji Hwan, too?

439
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,250
Oh, the CEO? Of course I do.

440
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,550
He's an amazing guy.

441
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,380
Here's the drink you ordered.

442
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,780
C... E... O?

443
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,750
He is a master of martial arts.

444
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,220
He has powerful charisma.

445
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,700
   

446
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,130
He's someone I admire as a fellow man.

447
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,800
Except he's a loser in romance.

448
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,810
- A loser in romance? 
 - Disappointing, right?

449
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,000
No, not at all. Why would I be disappointed?

450
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,190
I see.

451
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,040
Seo Ji Hwan?

452
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,720
C-C-CEO?

453
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,560
What?

454
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,850
W-Who, why are you here?

455
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,250
What are you doing here, Kang Ye Na?

456
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,740
You're here. That's why I'm here.

457
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,570
Just because I'm here, why...

458
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,020
We're going on a date today. Remember?

459
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,460
A d-d-date?

460
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,400
This is not a bad spot.

461
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,100
N-N-No. I...

462
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,230
- W-When did I... 
 - Should we go get some lunch?

463
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,930
I love this kind of touch.

464
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,110
I'm so hungry.

465
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,790
Have a good time, CEO.

466
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,850
You have many stars in your eyes.

467
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,310
I'm sorry I made a mistake earlier.

468
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,230
I apologize.

469
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,500
What's going on with Eun Ha?

470
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,000
- Do you like Eun Ha? 
 - Why should I answer such a personal question?

471
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,720
Fine. I don't need to know. Let's talk about work, your favorite subject.

472
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,480
You saw, right? A creator who can't eat meat can still promote the product.

473
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,830
You take care of the product quality,

474
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,120
and I'll take care of the promotion. Right?

475
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,920
You're confident in your product, right?

476
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,450
Thank you.

477
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,610
Bye. Be safe.

478
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,000
My shoulders.

479
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,030
I mean, why am I still aching?

480
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,450
Aigoo. Why does it hurt so much...

481
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,580
 You're so good at that. 

482
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,410
Crazy bitch!

483
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,440
Why did I act like I was soaking in a hot tub?

484
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,500
Why did I make those noises?

485
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,190
I'm so embarrassed.

486
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,020
Gu Mi Ho.

487
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,820
Get it together. The dark times can stay in the dark. Forget it.

488
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,370
Wait.

489
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,570
I shouldn't be sitting around. She's moving out.

490
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,700
 Jae Soo said you were quite harsh with her. 

491
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,700
 - That night... 
 - That night was a mistake. 

492
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,030
I'm one to talk.

493
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,110
   

494
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,250
 - I thought he liked her.  
 - What?

495
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,510
I thought your hyungnim liked Eun Ha.

496
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,770
You even took all her stuff. What changed his mind?

497
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,840
Well, it's complicated.

498
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,190
 Complicated? 

499
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,110
I'd like to hear what's so complicated in person.

500
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,840
I'm sorry. I lied to you to get you there.

501
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,020
It's okay. I had fun.

502
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,400
It wasn't supposed to be fun! You even had lunch with him.

503
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,020
It's fine, she had fun! Don't you know him?

504
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,410
Highest sales for five years straight. Super popular.

505
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,140
You're the problem, dude!

506
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,700
How can you set her up with an actual player?

507
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,500
- We were trying to make Ji Hwan jealous— 
 - It's not because of the CEO.

508
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,240
I'm going to start working again. Get a fresh start.

509
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,440
Sister-in-Law, couldn't you get a fresh start here?

510
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,850
That's right. Do you need to leave to do that?

511
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,750
Thank you.

512
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,220
Hyungnim is home.

513
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,910
Get up.

514
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,430
Good evening, Hyungnim.

515
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,580
Could you say something?

516
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,000
- She's been waiting for you. 
 - I was not!

517
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,150
Go Eun Ha.

518
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,460
Well, I just wanted to say I don't care whether you go on blind dates or not,

519
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:02,510
but I'd personally prefer it if you didn't call up an employee during work hours.

520
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:08,310
It wasn't during work hours. It was at lunch, as I understand.

521
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,150
It seemed like you had no problem taking personal meetings.

522
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,290
Wait. No, that wasn't a personal meeting.

523
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,670
I see. Was it a work meeting to secure Ye Na...

524
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,550
since she got your kids' sausages to blow up?

525
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,590
Hey, have some water.

526
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,190
That reminds me. Homeowner, the shower on the second floor is broken.

527
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,820
It needs repair. It's very uncomfortable for me as a tenant.

528
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,640
That's because the tenant, after using the shower head,

529
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,390
places it on the faucet instead of putting it back. I saw that many times.

530
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,020
It breaks because it drops to the floor. It cracks.

531
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,180
- Hyungnim. 
 - Speaking of the shower head,

532
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,170
could you be mindful of the direction of the shower head?

533
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,880
I keep getting splashed with water whenever I turn it on.

534
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,900
I have one. When you close your bedroom door, please make sure you don't slam it.

535
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,600
- It startles me. 
 - Startled...

536
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,900
Right? I forgot how sensitive and easily startled you get.

537
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,880
I'm not sensitive...

538
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,380
You sang in the middle of the night because you were in a good mood, right?

539
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,000
Yes. I did. So what?

540
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,310
Try not to do it. It's unpleasant in the middle of the night.

541
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,900
This is over. This is how my girlfriend and I broke up.

542
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,800
I sang one time.

543
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,600
How sensitive can a person be?

544
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,280
Dong Hee. The blanket.

545
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,960
Why did I say that?

546
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,470
Mi Jin?

547
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,010
Yoo Mi Jin?

548
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,300
Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo?

549
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,310
Have a seat.

550
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,650
I've been wondering how you are.

551
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,480
I didn't want to bring back painful memories.

552
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,350
That's why I couldn't reach out sooner.

553
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,450
I thought about it from time to time.

554
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:25,620
If I ever got to meet you, I wanted to say thank you.

555
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,980
Are you still playing the cello?

556
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,910
Yes. I'm in grad school now.

557
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,000
I thought about quitting,

558
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,600
but someone has been supporting me, so I've been okay financially.

559
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,770
The hotel CEO has been supporting me.

560
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:50,740
The hotel CEO? Seo Ji Hwan?

561
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,660
Yes. He came to the funeral.

562
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:59,280
The person he was with told me that he had surgery.

563
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,200
We kicked him out, of course. My mom threw food in his face.

564
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,900
Get out! Bring my mom back.

565
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,090
Bring my mom back, you bastard!

566
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,430
I found out about three years later...

567
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,330
that he'd been paying for my scholarship.

568
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,250
Wait.

569
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,330
I don't understand.

570
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,780
So, Seo Ji Hwan has been supporting you as compensation for...

571
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,910
hurting your grandmother?

572
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,900
No. I don't think so.

573
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,000
 Right before the incident... 

574
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,860
I'm sorry.

575
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,690
 I had run into him briefly on the second floor. 

576
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,510
 It didn't seem like he knew what was going to happen. 

577
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,180
 He went into the event hall, 

578
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,030
 then mobsters with weapons followed him in. 

579
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,900
If he knew,

580
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,550
he wouldn't have walked in there alone and unarmed.

581
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,610
   

582
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,100
This is pissing me off more and more.

583
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,800
How did you live this whole time if you were so uncomfortable?

584
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,500
I sang that one time. Really.

585
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,140
   

586
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,050
Yes, Prosecutor.

587
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,920
Eun Ha.

588
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,900
I just wanted to hear your voice.

589
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,090
 Did something happen? 

590
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:07,740
No, nothing. Just because.

591
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,120
I don't know what's going on, but tell me. I'll listen.

592
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,630
I...

593
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,350
thought I knew someone really well.

594
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,830
But I think I was wrong.

595
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:35,540
 I thought I knew everything about them. 

596
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,900
But I was wrong.

597
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,100
It's confusing.

598
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,600
I think I know how you feel, Prosecutor.

599
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,140
Someone whom I thought was bad has a soft side,

600
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,490
 and someone whom I thought was soft has a cold side. 

601
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,950
I think people are complicated.

602
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,000
It must be so challenging for you, Prosecutor.

603
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,800
 But still... 

604
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,900
you're a good prosecutor for just asking these questions.

605
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,950
Wow. I'm glad I called you, Eun Ha.

606
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,760
I always welcome a call from you.

607
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,870
Really?

608
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,960
In that case, I might keep bothering you.

609
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,440
I might get a little annoyed, then.

610
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,920
I won't bother you any longer.

611
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,080
Good night, Eun Ha.

612
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,700
 You too, Prosecutor. 

613
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,390
Bye.

614
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,440
We had an information leak in Thailand.

615
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,030
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

616
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,510
Did the info leak happen just in Thailand?

617
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,430
Of course. We did everything we could to clamp things down.

618
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:11,130
We made sure everything was put in place to prevent getting busted.

619
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,300
Then why are the guys in custody?

620
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,420
Well, they got arrested on the scene,

621
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,690
and one guy was locked up as part of the deal...

622
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,400
You bragged, saying you could pull this off and bring in some good fortune.

623
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,960
If you'd lost my money, you wouldn't be here right now.

624
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,940
Please forgive me just this once.

625
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:48,500
Stop trying to be clever with your dumb head.

626
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,270
From now on, just do...

627
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,100
what I tell you to do.

628
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,700
Yes, Chairman.

629
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,100
    
 Get rid of this cat. 
  (T/N: means "No. 2") 

630
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,810
Okay.

631
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,750
    
 You asked for it, so I got you the list.

632
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,130
But you won't actually sign, right?

633
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,360
- You prioritized security, right? 
 - Yes.

634
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,490
Hey, look at this one.

635
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,440
It's too far from the bus stop.

636
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,140
It's less than 100 meters.

637
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,730
What? That's 20 seconds, even if she runs for her life.

638
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,480
It has to be within 50 meters to be safe. Pass.

639
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,960
This one is under 50 meters.

640
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,300
Why are the windows so low on the first floor?

641
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,100
Look, you could pull up a car, step on the roof and get in.

642
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,780
These places don't have good security. They're dangerous.

643
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,960
Just be honest. You don't want to let her go.

644
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,390
What are you talking about? Who said that?

645
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,700
It's just that the world is so dangerous...

646
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,550
and chaotic out there.

647
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,130
Look.

648
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,150
The main room.

649
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,990
Okay.

650
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,700
This is the kitchen.

651
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,430
The security camera in the hallway is working, right?

652
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,750
Of course! The lobby password changes every month.

653
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,160
Every floor has an emergency button to call the security company.

654
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,650
A team will arrive within five minutes.

655
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,960
Is it facing south?

656
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,210
Southeast.

657
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:16,200
Then it'll get chilly in the afternoon.

658
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,100
Earlier, you said you didn't like a place because it faced north.

659
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,400
Earlier than that, you didn't like a place that faced southwest.

660
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,780
I don't know if you know, but east, west, south, north,

661
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,080
southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest are all the directions.

662
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,630
You've seen places facing every one of these directions.

663
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:40,870
If you don't want her to leave, just say you don't.

664
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,630
We'll take this one. Sign the papers.

665
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,330
How much is this place?

666
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,420
You won't get a deal better than this. This is the last one left.

667
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:01,050
Five million won for a deposit, and 300,000 won for rent. It's cheap.

668
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:05,000
You couldn't lower the rent, right?

669
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,900
How about 10 million and 200,000?

670
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,890
I could ask the owner.

671
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,540
Ten million for the deposit?

672
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,940
Thank you. Let me think about it.

673
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,100
What is there to think? You won't get a better deal than this.

674
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,000
- Think about it, then. 
 - Okay.

675
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,200
Hey.

676
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,100
- It's that girl, right? 
 - It is.

677
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,160
How can it be so hard to find a room in Seoul?

678
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,700
I don't have time to stand around. Let's go.

679
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,430
- You guys... 
 - Look who's here!

680
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:45,140
What are you doing all alone without your thug friends?

681
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,550
Wait, it's not the weekend.

682
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,400
Did you guys skip school again? Why are you out again?

683
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,400
   

684
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,450
Please fill out this area and sign.

685
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,970
   

686
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,430
   

687
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,080
Why are you following me? I didn't do anything.

688
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,710
Gosh! Stop!

689
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,690
 Hello, Eun Ha? 

690
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,710
Eun Ha?

691
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,800
- Nose bleed. 
 - What?

692
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,010
I'm bleeding.

693
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,930
No!

694
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,790
I guess Go Yang Hui isn't coming in today.

695
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,670
He wouldn't come voluntarily.

696
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,730
As soon as he heard "Seoul Central," he hung up.

697
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:14,130
Seo Tae Pyung was released that day. I heard he had gone to see him.

698
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,260
Go Yang Hui went to see Seo Tae Pyeong...

699
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,990
Hello?

700
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,180
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

701
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,100
I know a guy who knows the law really well.

702
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,000
- He says she should get jail time for this. 
 - What? Jail?

703
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,500
- Officer! 
 - Hey, kid!

704
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,630
Quiet, quiet.

705
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,570
- Ahjussi... 
 - Yes?

706
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,520
I'm trying to be a celeb. I have an audition tomorrow, too.

707
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,560
But that woman, ouch...

708
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,870
I'm out of the alley.

709
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:03,320
I'm at the sloping three-way intersection.

710
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,980
Yes.

711
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,130
Are you...

712
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,800
- Are you... 
 - The phone? Here you go.

713
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,310
Thank you. Did you see where she went?

714
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,740
There's a police station all the way down there.

715
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,750
They all ran there. Superfast.

716
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,090
- Thank you. 
 - Hurry.

717
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:31,060
No, no. I wasn't trying to hit her.

718
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,840
My bag swung and hit her when I was running away.

719
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,720
They came after me first.

720
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,130
- I didn't go after her. 
 - You—

721
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,400
We were minding our own business.

722
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,060
- Right, guys? 
 - That's not true.

723
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,750
So they didn't attempt to mug you or assault you.

724
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,560
They just ran after you?

725
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,960
Do you know how scary that is?

726
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,190
I mean... you guys—

727
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,930
Eun Ha.

728
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:56,590
Prosecutor.

729
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,700
What happened, Eun Ha? Are you okay?

730
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,030
Oh, Prosecutor Jang!

731
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,860
Aigoo, what brings you down here?

732
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:08,420
Say hello. It's Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

733
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,480
What's going on here?

734
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,560
Let me explain...

735
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,430
I'll make sure we get a 100-page letter of apology from all of them.

736
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,490
I'll pay for the girl's medical bills.

737
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,070
That's all right. It's just a nosebleed.

738
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,040
If you need anything, contact me.

739
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,480
Sure. Get home safe, Prosecutor.

740
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,600
Thank you.

741
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,060
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

742
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,220
Are you sure you're okay? Do you need to go to the hospital?

743
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,410
I'm fine. But...

744
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,630
I dropped my phone on the street and didn't get to pick it up.

745
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,050
Oh, really?

746
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:57,200
Someone might have found it by now. Let me call it.

747
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
Thank you.

748
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,840
   

749
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,370
Wait.

750
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:10,790
That sounds like my ringtone.

751
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,130
No way.

752
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,980
It really sounds like my ringtone.

753
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,000
Did you lose it around here?

754
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,630
No, but...

755
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,490
You're right. I hear something.

756
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,430
Right?

757
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,710
   

758
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,020
This is my phone!

759
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,300
- Is that really your phone? 
 - Yes, it's mine.

760
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,630
But how'd it get here?

761
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,120
I'm sorry I always make you help me out.

762
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,250
It's okay.

763
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,740
What was the address again?

764
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,120
- Prosecutor. 
 - Yes.

765
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,560
I don't live there anymore.

766
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,860
- What? 
 - You know I left my job.

767
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,920
I had to leave the housing, too.

768
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,250
- You did? 
 - Yes.

769
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,970
Then where are you staying now?

770
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,580
I'm staying at Seo Ji Hwan's house.

771
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,340
Where did you say?

772
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,610
After I left my job and had nowhere to go,

773
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:54,150
that was the first house I thought of.

774
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,800
Hyun Woo used to live there.

775
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,650
Turns out Seo Ji Hwan lives there now.

776
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,200
Is that so?

777
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,800
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

778
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,730
It happened after you and Seo Ji Hwan saw each other at Taek's place, so...

779
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:16,540
I think I felt bad about it.

780
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,310
So why are you looking for a place now?

781
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,980
I'm going to move out of there.

782
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,000
I think the CEO made a mistake.

783
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,500
I mean, you guys seem to make a lot of mistakes.

784
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,970
I mean, what's more convenient than a mistake?

785
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,920
You don't even have to be that sorry. You can go back to normal.

786
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,970
The one who can't get over it is the weird one, right?

787
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,060
That night wasn't a mistake for me.

788
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,750
I liked you from the moment we met. I slept with you because I liked you.

789
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:08,400
But that's how I feel.

790
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,700
If you don't feel the same way, I won't push it.

791
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,910
I wasn't asking you to take me for good after one night.

792
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,980
A guy who calls it a "mistake" like a coward?

793
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,390
I'm not into it, either.

794
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,780
   

795
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:04,780
You must've been scared. Drink some hot tea and get some rest.

796
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,540
Thank you so much for today.

797
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:12,260
Think about the place I mentioned.

798
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,670
Make sure you lock your door.

799
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:19,550
- Good night. 
 - I'll leave once you get inside.

800
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,920
Well...

801
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,690
don't stay out too late. I read on the news...

802
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,410
that the air quality is even worse at night.

803
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,400
Then why aren't you in bed?

804
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,770
I tend not to sleep at night.

805
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,790
What's that?

806
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,020
Nothing.

807
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,400
Good night.

808
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,430
   

809
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,030
   

810
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:14,270
Why did he call me so many times?

811
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,980
   

812
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,420
 This is my phone! 

813
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,780
Hello?

814
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,260
Yes, sir, hello.

815
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,220
The owner agreed to lower the rent?

816
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,300
That's great!

817
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,800
I'm sorry, sir...

818
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,650
Could I sleep on it and give you a call tomorrow?

819
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,810
Thank you so much.

820
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,340
   

821
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,760
We need to talk.

822
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,190
I'm signing a lease tomorrow.

823
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,000
Is that so?

824
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,200
At 11 o'clock,

825
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,700
- I'm going to go sign the lease. 
 - Okay.

826
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,700
Were you at the police station earlier?

827
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,110
You left my phone there, right?

828
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:12,650
Why did you just leave?

829
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,500
It looked like you were okay, so I left.

830
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:22,390
If I didn't mention it, were you not going to say anything?

831
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,900
You were so worried about me that you called 20 times.

832
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:27,500
What are you so scared of?

833
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:35,500
This is who I am.

834
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:40,400
I'm used to being like this, and I'm comfortable this way.

835
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,660
Fine.

836
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,000
If that's how you feel, there's nothing more to discuss.

837
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,700
I know you said you don't like me.

838
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:01,250
But I liked my time in this house.

839
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,380
Including the time I spent with you.

840
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,180
Hello.

841
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,790
I told you to come at 11. You're early.

842
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:40,950
I just came early.

843
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,430
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay.

844
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,700
 It should be squeaky clean. 

845
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,500
 Good job. 

846
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,100
 Three words! Three words! 

847
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,710
 I love drinking! I love this game! 

848
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:41,610
 I love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! 

849
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:54,300
♫  Still, with a heart on edge, I gaze at you from afar  ♫

850
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:57,090
 I will be your live-in tutor. 

851
01:04:57,090 --> 01:05:03,420
 It's not because I called you a "shoulder thug," right? 

852
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,130
 You fed the dog at dawn, and you were totally fine. 

853
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:09,690
 Then, you come home at night hurt like this. Even if you were a stranger, I'd be worried. 

854
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:12,700
 You don't have to be cruel to me. I know it makes you uncomfortable. 

855
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,900
 Disinfect your wounds and put some ointment on. 

856
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:21,540
♫  Though time passes by, it’s still you for me  ♫

858

♫  All those moments filled with you  ♫

859

♫  Keep me breathing every day  ♫

860
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:51,300
♫  On the day when my heart reaches you  ♫

861
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:54,800
 - There's a bug on your face. 
 - Where? 

862
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,500
 Where? Where? 

863
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,200
 - Where? 
 - L-Let me do it. 

864

01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:22,030
Bye now.

868
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,400
Yes, Prosecutor.

869
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:58,140
Hey kitty, Hyung is here!

870
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,860
You didn't eat your food because you didn't have water!

871
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,400
So cute!

872
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:12,440
Kitty, I like our bulldog, but I love you too, my kitty!

873
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,280
I'll be back. Stay here and eat—

874
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,000
Isn't that Little Rat?

875
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,000
Who's that next to her?

876
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,400
- Congratulations on your new place. 
 - Thank you.

877
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,970
There's nothing like drinking in the daytime.

878
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,660
Do you like to drink, Prosecutor?

879
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:39,760
I don't know if I like it.

880
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,650
But I think I'm good at it. I don't get drunk easily.

881
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:46,400
You're even good at drinking? That's not fair.

882
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,200
I don't know if it's a good thing.

883
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:54,100
Maybe that's why I'm not so good at relationships.

884
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:00,290
What's this reaction? Seems like you get it right away.

885
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:03,220
- It just reminded me of old times. 
 - Old times?

886
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,040
What...

887
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,000
Are you talking about that rainy day?

888
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:14,300
Eun Ha, I'm telling you again. I wasn't the one getting rejected.

889
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,200
I didn't say anything.

890
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,030
Wow. That was a poor choice of words on my part.

891
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:22,580
It's not that I'm not good at relationships.

892
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:26,300
I just haven't met anyone I wanted to work hard at.

893
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,270
In short, there's a difference between not having talent and not having motivation.

894
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,450
Do you understand?

895
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:33,850
Yes. I understand.

896
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:36,460
I don't think you mean it.

897
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,900
Wow. This is frustrating.

898
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,940
How's the new place? Do you like it?

899
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:49,100
Yes, I do.

900
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:53,390
My friend's place that I mentioned yesterday is nice too. It's been empty for more than a year.

901
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:02,500
A person can get used to their environment so easily.

902
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,600
It's easy to forget how things were before.

903
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,900
I used to be fine by myself.

904
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:16,300
But being alone again feels strange and empty.

905
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:20,000
If I lived in a really nice place, it'd be sad when I had to move out.

906
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I want to live within my means.

907
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,800
 At 11 o'clock, 

908
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,680
 I'm going to go sign the lease. 

909
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:01,100
 But I liked my time in this house. 

910
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,050
 Including the time I spent with you. 

911
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,480
- Hyungnim! Wait! 
 - What?

912
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,210
Little Rat! Little Rat!

913
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:24,000
The park! Gajisan Park!

914
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,600
Go to Gajisan Park! Right now!

915
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,050
They were weirdly so good at math problems that day.

916
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,750
They even got 3-digit multiplications right. But it turns out,

917
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:40,820
they had hidden calculators under their feet. Isn't that funny?

918
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,700
So funny.

919
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:49,080
It sounds like you got really close to the people there.

920
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,670
Yes.

921
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:53,750
They're really good people.

922
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:09,630
   

923
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:18,340
 The call is not going through. After the tone...

 - Yes. 

948

 I'm the idiot for expecting something when his mouth is frozen shut.

 It'll just take a second, Hyungnim. 

951

 You're awkward with words, and even more awkward with actions...

01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,450
 But I still like you, Seo Ji Hwan. 

953

 No, no, no!

 There's someone I like. 

955

 Let's not be awkward over this.
