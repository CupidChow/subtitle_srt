00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,410
   

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,920
   

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
   

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,090
   

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,500
♫  Baby baby let me come along  ♫

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,520
♫  Every single day I belong  ♫

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,470
♫  Baby baby let me come along  ♫

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,560
♫  Keep you happy all day long  ♫

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,620
   

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,770
Defendant Go Eun Ha.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,680
You are guilty of impersonating a public official and committing murder.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,290
I sentence you to life imprisonment.

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,870
 You have the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer. 

14
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,200
 I mean, anything you say can be used against you in court. 

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,480
 You're not a real cop, are you? 

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,570
   

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,130
Hyungnim!

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,040
   

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,640
Murder? I didn't! I didn't murder him!

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,130
    
 I didn't commit murder! Your Honor!

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,580
 Hyungnim! 

22
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,590
 Hyungnim! 

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,830
 - Hyungnim! 
 - I'll go! 

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,320
Follow them!

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,270
 Go, go! 

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:51,000


27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,970
   

28
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,650
He can't be dead, can he?

29
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,800
Please like and subscribe!

30
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,970
   

31
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,160
It's the right size.

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,210
Get the most expensive wood coffin.

33
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,960
For food, yookgaejang would be good, right?

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,890
We'll dress him in his favorite outfit,

35
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,880
- a black suit. 
 - It's a burial. White would be better.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,910
I'm not dead.

37
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,180
Some big guys are coming, so put in lots of beef, please.

38
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,860
That's enough.

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,090
- Hyungnim! 
 - Are you okay?

40
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,350
Where am I?

41
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,650
Don't you remember?

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,930
Hyungnim, can you tell how many fingers?

43
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,510
What are you doing?

44
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,510
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,210
Are you awake?

46
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,660
- Broken ribs and a light concussion. 
 - Thank goodness.

47
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,200
You should rest for about a week.

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,160
Rest? I'm fine.

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,330
Hyungnim! Don't get up.

50
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,990
I knew you'd be like that.

51
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,420
Precisely the fifth and sixth rib.

52
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,970
- No way. All from that mop? 
 - A mop?

53
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,370
I saw it with my own eyes, Hyungnim.

54
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,000
That tiny woman was wielding her mop like a club.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,910
 She stuck it right in your chest. 

56
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,130
And you, Hyungnim,

57
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,200
you were thrown to the ground

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,170
like a piece of paper.

59
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,210
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,150
These guys, stop pretending to cry and get out.

61
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,180
Please get some rest, Hyungnim.

62
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,060
   

63
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,570
 - Mini! 
 - Stop throwing it at me! 

64
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,420
 - Hey, kids! 
 - Mini Unni! 

65
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,060
 Mini Noona! 

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,770
   

67
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,770
    
 "Kids' creator"? What is that?

68
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,840
Oh, WeTube.

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,040
WeTube.

70
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,130
"Saving a child from the octopus monster."

71
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,380
"Play like a Special Operations Police Unit"?

72
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,960
This woman...

73
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,760
If we play Special Operations Police Unit one more time,

74
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,280
I might rot in jail for the rest of my life.

75
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,390
What does she do on WeTube?

76
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,080
 I got you! 

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
 Policewoman Mini has caught the thief! 

78
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,660
She's better at catching the bad guys than I am.

79
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,070
   

80
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,040
Mommy will be out soon. Stay right here.

81
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,380
Don't go anywhere.

82
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,960
- Got it? 
 - Yes.

83
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,020
   

84
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,190
   

85
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,930
 Let's play with Mini! 

86
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,530
I don't understand why our prosecutor keeps bringing over another defendant's kid.

87
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,510
I'm so curious, I might go crazy or die.

88
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,540
Don't you know? We also double as a daycare.

89
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,080
I can't leave a kid alone in an empty hallway.

90
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,120
Sure, sure.

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay...

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,830
- What do you think is in here? 
 - Snacks.

93
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,370
Correct! Ta-da! Let's have some.

94
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,500
I know this video.

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,520
How do you know what kids watch? You don't even have kids.

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,900
I've seen it a few times. I haven't seen this one. Should we watch it together?

97
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,170
Okay.

98
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,040
I guess there are two kids in this office.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,810
Big news, big news. Last week at Club Cat,

100
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,340
nothing happened.

101
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,000
There was an assault at Club Cat, and Seo Ji Hwan was arrested.

102
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,270
Seo Ji Hwan? Assault?

103
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,280
No need to get all starry-eyed.

104
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,820
He got out right away.

105
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,210
This isn't a case. It was just a little incident.

106
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,620
- Why are you turning around? 
 - This...

107
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,450
isn't a simple incident.

108
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,710
What's so odd about it?

109
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,830
Go Yang Hui and Seo Ji Hwan get along like cats and dogs.

110
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,870
Everyone knows that.

111
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,730
So, why would Seo Ji Hwan go to Go Yang Hui's club?

112
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,690
Isn't that odd?

113
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,870
You have a point.

114
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,920
Have I seen almost all of them?

115
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,890
   

116
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,960
Bubble challenge? 
    

117
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,060
- Play! 
 -  Let's play with Mini! 

118
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,100
 Hi, friends, it's Mini Unni. 

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,660
 No bubble gun toy? No worries, my friends. 

120
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,020
All you need is a homemade stick like this.

121
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,220
 It's a gigantic bubble! 

122
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,560
 Wow! So many! 

123
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,350
 It's beautiful. 

124
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,090
What?

125
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,340
W-What? What in the world?

126
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,170
What? Is it because I hurt my head? Go away!

127
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,850
What?

128
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,830
That scared me.

129
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,030
Geez.

130
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,550
I turned it off...

131
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,360
What's going on?

132
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,700
What is this?

133
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,400
What? Hey!

134
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,900
Okay.

135
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,480
The last one.

136
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,960
I'll finish you!

137
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,890
This one doesn't pop.

138
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,860
 That is no ordinary woman! 

139
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm telling you.

140
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,680
She's a trained assassin.

141
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,620
A trained assassin who makes videos?

142
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,110
That makes no sense.

143
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,300
- Hey, Dong Hee! 
 - Yes.

144
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,500
What happened to the broadcast station thing I asked you to do yesterday?

145
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,600
Did anyone come to film us?

146
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,670
No, not yet.

147
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,280
Maybe this is the Kitty Gang's doing.

148
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,130
Does the Kitty Gang have a girl?

149
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,520
Maybe they scouted her.

150
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,250
She's a Girl Scout?

151
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,600
Hey! Grab it! Grab it!

152
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,700
Grab it!

153
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,200
Her code name was something "Unni".

154
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,940
"Mini Unni."

155
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,090
 "Mini Unni"? 

156
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, this is calcium-fortified soy milk. It's good for your bones.

157
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
Okay. Put it over there.

158
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,770
Okay.

159
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,600
And you dropped this there.

160
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,170
Oh, sure.

161
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,830
How are you feeling?

162
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,850
Me? I'm okay.

163
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,820
I'm totally fine. Nothing's wrong.

164
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,980
I always do this.

165
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,530
It doesn't hurt. I always do that to relax.

166
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,710
That's good.

167
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,240
I'll let you get some rest.

168
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,260
Oh, well...

169
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,180
Excuse me, your bag.

170
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,680
   

171
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,070
Are you...

172
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,050
on your way to slay a tiger or something?

173
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,530
I'm prepared. Just in case.

174
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,200
Sure, sure. Life is precious.

175
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,100
You have to protect the kids and defeat the monsters.

176
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,180
I hope you're always prepared.

177
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,160
- Sure, thank you. 
 - Goodbye.

178
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,010
 Hyungnim! 

179
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,400
Hey!

180
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,980
Hey! No!

181
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,430
Is something wrong with him?

182
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,020
- Hyungnim! 
 - I'm not decent. Wait!

183
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,770
I took off his underwear yesterday.

184
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,650
Underwear?

185
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,060
Would you get under...

186
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,130
Hyungnim!

187
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,750
 Can we come in, Hyungnim? 

188
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,250
Shouldn't we go inside?

189
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,280
- Let's go inside. 
 - We should go inside, right?

190
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,070
Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Just for a moment.

191
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,870
Just wait here for a second.

192
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,020
 We're coming in, Hyungnim! 

193
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,500
Excuse us, Hyungnim.

194
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,450
How are you doing?

195
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,300
Yeah. I'm okay.

196
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,320
Hyungnim, we figured out who that little rat is.

197
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,000
- Little rat? 
 - The woman who ambushed you.

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
The little rat is...

199
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,400
Christmas?

200
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,250
- Christmas, Hyungnim. 
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

201
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,170
Not "Christmas," a creator.

202
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,940
A kids' creator.

203
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,130
One more thing, Hyungnim. She belongs to a group called...

204
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,250
Macao?

205
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,720
Not "Macao."

206
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,630
Papillon.

207
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,000
Not "Macao," not "Papillon."

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,100
Macaron. Macaron Soft!

209
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,200
That's it, Hyungnim. Don't show off, man.

210
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,270
Okay, okay. Good work.

211
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,570
- You can go now. 
 - Oh, Hyungnim.

212
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,310
This is my guess.

213
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,850
I think she's a spy planted by the Kitty Gang.

214
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,830
How else would she be so skilled at playing with kids?

215
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,400
- Should we get her and mess her up? 
 - Jae Soo, you can go.

216
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,040
Man Ho, put that down. Take these guys and go.

217
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,520
Hyungnim! She broke your ribs!

218
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,880
We should at least separate her back from her spine!

219
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,430
Jae Soo. Jae Soo!

220
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,260
Do you see this?

221
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,450
Jae Soo, I'm begging you.

222
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,930
Get out!

223
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,800
Jae Soo, I'm in so much pain. I'm sorry.

224
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,580
Please? What are you doing, Dong Hee?

225
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
- I was going to put the cover on you. 
 - Okay.

226
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,020
I'll do it. Thanks.

227
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,390
All right.

228
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,820
See? I'm in so much pain.

229
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,620
The doctor told me not to see anyone.

230
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,510
Hurry up and go. You first! Get out!

231
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,800
And it's not anything like that.

232
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,430
Don't lay a finger on her.

233
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,240
Don't even think about going after her. Especially you!

234
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,380
We need to take her spine apart, Hyungnim!

235
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,800
Hyungnim, your spine will come apart at this rate.

236
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,250
Get some rest, Hyungnim. We'll get going.

237
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,360
Shouldn't we get her and mess her up?

238
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,190
They're gone.

239
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,830
They're all gone.

240
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,970
- I'll go, then. 
 - Right.

241
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,480
- Get home safe. 
 - Yes.

242
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,970
   

243
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,330
It was he who laid a finger on me first.

244
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,900
    
What? They figured out your name and workplace?

245
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,050
In only one day?

246
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,470
They don't know my name.

247
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,880
But they know what I do and where I work.

248
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,800
They were making threats, talking about breaking my bones. I'll be okay, right?

249
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,500
Who is he, exactly?

250
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,160
Is he a mobster or a meat processing company owner?

251
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,130
I heard it's a company run by ex-cons. So probably both?

252
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,750
I guess. I heard the mobsters pretend to run businesses.

253
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,520
Right.

254
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,400
How can you know that and go there yourself?

255
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,900
Hey, he broke his ribs because of me. What was I supposed to do?

256
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,700
- He broke his ribs? 
 - Yeah, I thought he was fine, but I guess not.

257
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,720
I thought those guys were made of pure muscle.

258
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
- Why is he so fragile? 
 - He didn't look fragile.

259
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,920
- Huh? 
 - Nothing.

260
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,600
Anyway, make sure you carry your self-defense stuff with you.

261
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,520
If they figure out who you are, these are no ordinary guys.

262
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,890
Hey, what's that noise?

263
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,790
Isn't that yours?

264
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,200
Oh, the comments.

265
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,290
Why do I have so many comments?

266
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,770
Why is there a video I don't know about?

267
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,150
   

268
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,130
Have you seen Producer Lee?

269
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,040
- He's probably at his desk. 
 - His desk? Okay.

270
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,820
Producer Lee!

271
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,160
- CEO, hello. 
 - Look who's here!

272
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,560
Our headline-making darling!

273
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,890
What's going on? You're not filming today.

274
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,600
A party to celebrate? I was going to throw one tomorrow!

275
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,030
CEO, there's a video of me that I don't recognize.

276
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,900
- Did you upload it? 
 - Who cares who posted it?

277
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,020
It's gone viral. That's important, don't you think?

278
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,510
- Let's talk inside, our newest star! 
 - Wait.

279
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,600
- Let's go, let's go! 
 - Producer!

280
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
 Made by ex-convicts? Who knows what's in it? 

281
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,100
   

282
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,930
   

283
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,830
   

284
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,230
   

285
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,530
   

286
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,260
Bam!

287
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,720
Views? 2.5 million.

288
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,120
At this rate, you'll hit 10 million, no problem.

289
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,730
How could you upload this without even telling me?

290
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,820
How could I not upload something like this? Why?

291
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,330
Because of your bare face?

292
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,130
- Should we airbrush you a little? 
 - That's not it.

293
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,870
You made a meat company look like a bunch of thugs.

294
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,630
Is that wrong? They are thugs. They got into a fight.

295
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,390
Producer Lee did a good job editing. Come on.

296
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,180
This is not fact. This is a devilish edit!

297
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,670
Yeah. Devils get the devilish edit. Angels get the angelic edit.

298
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,380
Seriously.

299
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,390
Eun Ha.

300
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,850
If I hadn't been aggressive like this,

301
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,000
do you think you would've blown up big time?

302
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,600
I don't want to blow up like this. In fact,

303
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,040
I might get blown to pieces.

304
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,990
 It strengthens your bones and makes you grow. 

305
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,430
 This is milk that you'll love. This milk is... 

306
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,830
- Come on. 
  - from cows out in the field... 

307
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,760
Is he holding the camera with his foot?

308
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,100
 - From happy cows...  
 - He couldn't even capture a sliver of her good looks.

309
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,520
- These guys... 
  - It's organic. 

310
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,100
 So our friends who get 

311
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,690
 stomachache or have a bad aftertaste could drink it. 

312
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,930
 It especially has twice the amount of good fats— 

313
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,600
I haven't seen this one.

314
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,400
"Battling the villain who makes bad sausage!"

315
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,390
Wow, this woman has no fear.

316
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,930
What is she going to do?

317
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,400
Maybe she didn't know who they were.

318
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,420
Is there a way to delete this altogether?

319
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,670
If the Prosecutor finds out, he'll go on about Thirsty Deer.

320
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,910
He'll go on about assault. It'll be a lot of work for us.

321
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,290
What's a lot of work?

322
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,180
With the new law, we're all getting two years younger.

323
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,940
Does someone born in December need to call someone born in May "hyungnim"?

324
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,080
What is it?

325
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,460
In case you're bored lately,

326
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,140
we hear news about Seo Ji Hwan everywhere.

327
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,210
- What news? 
 - Thirsty Deer is being ripped apart online...

328
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,460
like butchered meat. They're being cut, torn, and deboned.

329
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,590
Here it is.

330
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,750
   

331
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,480
   

332
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,720
"Play With Mini"?

333
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,330
She should have just played with the kids.

334
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,850
Why mess with these scary adults?

335
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,360
So much hate in the comments.

336
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,730
Feck, fick, fock, fack...

337
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,130
Dickwad, barnacles, son of a monkey, douchcanoe...

338
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,880
I hope the kids don't know how to read.

339
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,940
   

340
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,220
   

341
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,990
What happened exactly?

342
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,290
So much for acting all innocent.

343
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,580
She ended up going low to get views.

344
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,600
Did she have it all planned out when she said she was going to the festival?

345
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,060
Who knows?

346
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,340
"I'm only thinking of the kids!"

347
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,250
Maybe she was calculating all this time.

348
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,690
If you talk behind someone's back, make sure no one can hear.

349
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,250
If we can all hear, you're saying it to their face, not their back.

350
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,390
It wasn't to her face. So what?

351
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,690
"So what"?

352
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,470
How do you know she can't hear you?

353
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,010
I didn't upload it.

354
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,700
I didn't know, either.

355
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,530
But now you do.

356
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,800
We sit around doing toy unboxing videos. Do we look like villains to you, too?

357
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,160
Villains? Not at all.

358
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,400
Unni, you think you get to be a hero all by yourself?

359
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,350
You have to be right and everyone else wrong.

360
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,530
That's the only way you can pretend to be righteous.

361
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,770
 Let's stop paying attention. 

362
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,960
 What's it like to see mobsters in real life? 

363
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,370
 Can't you tell? They pulled her hair. 

364
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,160
 - It might be fake. 
 - Who does such a poor job? 

365
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,720
 Must be struggling to pay her bills. Risking her life to make money. 

366
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,490
 With this many views, it's worth risking your life. 

367
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,930
 I was a fan of this channel, but I'm disappointed. 

368
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,490
 Unsubscribing. 

369
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,330
 Get out of this industry! 

370
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,130
Why am I logged out?

371
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,010
   

372
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,500
What?

373
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,050
Did he change my password, too?

374
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:14,820
   

375
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,420
Who is this girl? Good for her for making this.

376
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,170
She's a kids' creator.

377
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,130
She makes videos that kids watch.

378
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,540
Kids' creator?

379
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,330
Oh, like the six-year-old who bought a building?

380
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,470
I know what that is.

381
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,590
But...

382
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,290
why is this grown-ass woman doing this?

383
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,410
I don't know. I'm sorry.

384
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,260
Well?

385
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,380
They'll be dealing with this for a while to pay attention to Jung Yoon Taek.

386
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,650
So what if they've caught a whiff?

387
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,930
Their asses are on fire.

388
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,100
No.

389
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,060
Maybe they caught a whiff ...

390
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,540
of their own asses burning.

391
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,980
We can't let this one go, Hyungnim.

392
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,620
They made us into villains, and what? Assault?

393
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,760
What assault? We should sue them.

394
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,190
Even if we sue them, the damage is already done.

395
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,030
Anyway, this is all because of that little rat!

396
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,890
Ambushing you, too. She's set on bringing our company down!

397
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,160
Why do you keep yelling at him?

398
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,330
It's not the first time we've been mocked.

399
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,600
But this was a shady way to do it.

400
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,990
Seriously.

401
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,750
I lost sleep making that product.

402
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,110
Not even getting judged fairly...

403
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,510
makes me sad.

404
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,200
We'll do everything we can legally.

405
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,450
But the video is already everywhere.

406
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,080
It seriously damaged our brand even before the new product launch.

407
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,960
Are you sure she uploaded it?

408
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,370
It says "Mini Unni" in gigantic letters, Hyungnim.

409
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,980
She has no fear! She didn't even hide.

410
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,930
Creators make their own content.

411
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,770
I doubt it was uploaded without her consent.

412
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,080
All right...

413
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,790
Okay, I understand what you mean.

414
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,130
People get into fights. You shouldn't just upload it online.

415
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,880
Taking out cameras whenever something happens.

416
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,290
Maybe she was already filming rather than filming on purpose.

417
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,690
- Posting for public view is another matter. 
 - But this is her job.

418
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,410
Still, I think she intended to stir up controversy.

419
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,410
I don't think so.

420
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,400
If you look, it's very different from her other videos.

421
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,320
It's so provocative. I don't think she posted it.

422
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,830
You don't get it. Provocative sells. Exposing things.

423
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,960
I guess people think that. Just look at the comments.

424
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,750
Comments?

425
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,900
People aren't thinking when they comment.

426
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,760
They do it because they have fingers to move.

427
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,310
I have fingers, too.

428
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,580
Anyway, if I didn't know you, I'd think you had a crush on that unni.

429
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,880
- What? 
 - I know it's because you hate Thirsty Deer.

430
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,790
But it might look like you care because you like her.

431
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,970
Have you looked into Club Cat?

432
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,590
What?

433
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,290
Of course. This is why Seo Ji Hwan went to Club Cat.

434
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,300
A Thirsty Deer employee went missing, so he went to get him.

435
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,520
Which employee? The one from the Kitty Gang?

436
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,600
Pardon?

437
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,320
I didn't get that far,

438
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,260
but I should have.

439
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,560
I'll look into it right away.

440
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,610
Prosecutor, you are watching me take initiative.

441
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,630
See you later.

442
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,930
All right.

443
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,590
I was thinking that!

444
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,500
Then I'll take this one.

445
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,540
In that case, I'll do this.

446
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,100
- Hey, hey, hey, Producer Lee, let's plan this. 
 - What?

447
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,350
Mini Unni fights the mobsters!

448
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,540
- It's going to blow up. With mobsters— 
 - CEO.

449
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,770
Who...

450
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,230
are you?

451
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,390
Who are you?

452
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,540
CEO, here's some coffee.

453
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,320
- Producer Lee. 
 - Yes?

454
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,380
- Producer Lee. 
 - Yes?

455
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,190
Sit down.

456
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,700
Okay.

457
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,290
Well...

458
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,360
have some coffee,

459
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
p-please.

460
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,300
General Manager Joo.

461
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,700
I'm Joo Il Yeong, General Manager of Thirsty Deer.

462
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,200
Yes.

463
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,600
You've been avoiding our calls.

464
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,900
Please excuse us for showing up without notice.

465
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,900
As you can see, due to the video that Macaron Soft uploaded without our consent,

466
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,510
our reputation and trust have been damaged.

467
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,600
    
 Our position in society has been violated.

468
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,250
We will sue for damages to our assets.

469
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,440
We also ask the employees in the video be compensated for emotional distress.

470
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,600
We will also simultaneously press charges for obstruction and defamation.

471
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,300
Under the Information and Communications Network Act,

472
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,400
defamation carries up to seven years in prison,

473
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,200
up to 10 years of license suspension,

474
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,460
and up to 50 million won in fines. You're aware, correct?

475
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,580
   

476
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,190
Oh, yes, yes.

477
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,870
Well,

478
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,160
we already planned to take down the video.

479
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,300
We understand defamation is very serious.

480
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,110
Right?

481
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,960
- Right. Sure. 
 - Yes, yes.

482
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,850
How do I put this?

483
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,600
The views make money.

484
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,000
Creators get competitive.

485
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,400
We tell them to stop, but they don't listen.

486
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,850
We can't do much about individuals posting.

487
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,500
This is embarrassing to say.

488
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,400
For someone like Mini Unni, who has few subscribers and is unpopular...

489
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,810
Creators like that are desperate to survive.

490
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,120
She's so desperate to survive that she's seeing red.

491
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,720
Hey. Am I right?

492
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,900
Yes. She's seeing red. To pay her bills.

493
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,300
Right. I...

494
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,750
will use this opportunity...

495
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,500
to lay down some severe consequences.

496
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,100
Even if it means a fine or license suspension,

497
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,430
- we'll never— 
 - Hold on.

498
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,090
You don't need to do that.

499
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,720
Just delete all the videos that have been shared.

500
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,070
Put in writing that this will never happen again, and we might let this one go.

501
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,820
Let...

502
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,590
Of course, we will delete them.

503
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,540
We'll delete everything, even the ones you can't see.

504
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,280
Who would slander such generous folks?

505
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,360
   

506
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,700
    
 Original footage?

507
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,060
Watch your step.

508
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,370
Please take care.

509
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,600
Excuse me.

510
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,620
I'll meet you downstairs.

511
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,130
Can I help you?

512
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,070
I had no idea that the video went up.

513
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,700
I should have known. I'm very sorry—

514
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,200
If you get 10 million views, do you make 10 million won?

515
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,000
- What? 
 - Or 100 million?

516
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,710
How much do you make that you could do such a thing?

517
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,560
I could just give you the money.

518
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,280
- What do you... 
 - You don't want dirty ex-con money?

519
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,590
I know why you're saying that, but—

520
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,120
My employees...

521
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,100
are not thugs who went there to cause a scene.

522
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,800
They weren't there so people could point fingers at them and curse them, either.

523
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,050
They worked hard to make food for kids, and they went to promote it.

524
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,780
They were there for the same reason as everybody else there.

525
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,530
I think you're the one who was there for a different reason.

526
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,280
   

527
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,600
   

528
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,600
I hear likes and subscribes make money around here.

529
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,170
Now that you know, you'll be rich soon.

530
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,200
Or maybe you already knew.

531
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,040
 Are you guys trying to rebrand by using kids? 

532
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,480
 Why were they allowed to be there anyway? 

533
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,360
 Thugs never change their ways. 

534
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,980
 Dirty hands, dirty food. 

535
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,930
 Doing things for kids was all just for branding. 

536
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,790
 How dare you show your face? 

537
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,320
 Trying to make money off of people fighting? 

538
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,610
 We should just stop paying attention. 

539
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,850
 Must be easy money. How can she sleep at night? 

540
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,110
 A kids' WeTuber? 

541
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,850
 Is she allowed to post stuff like this? 

542
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,140
   

543
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,600
Justice?

544
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,200
This is why I didn't want them!

545
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,560
"Honest"? Get those out of here!

546
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,200
Okay, okay. Get home safe.

547
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,900
Excuse me. Why are you getting rid of these?

548
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,900
People are complaining about these sausages night and day.

549
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,100
- I'll return them. 
 - All of these?

550
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,480
I have other sausages. I can't use these.

551
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,370
   

552
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,150
The department store turned us down.

553
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,810
Grocery stores are returning the products.

554
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,190
I see. We can't help it.

555
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,210
It took us so long to break through.

556
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,990
It takes a second to get knocked down.

557
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,000
It all happened so fast. It hasn't sunk in yet.

558
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,200
We hold back 100 times, but if we make one mistake,

559
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,250
we're judged by that one time.

560
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:38,460
♫  My steps have paused briefly  ♫

561
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,630
♫  Uncertain of where to go next  ♫

562
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,400
   

563
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,930
♫  For so long  ♫

564
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,240
I should have held back.

565
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,280
♫  My cherished dreams that I longed for dearly  ♫

566
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,930
♫  Are slipping farther away  ♫

567
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,480
 It's finally here, Hyungnim. 

568
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,160
 We finished packaging the products, Hyungnim. 

569
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,500
 Come over here and try some kids' sausage! 

570
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,800
 Hey, kid, try this. 

571
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,140
 Want to try some sausages? 

572
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,980
 Come, come. 

573
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,200
 Come try some sausages! 

574
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,190
 This isn't your everyday sausage! 

575
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,480
   

576
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,590
♫  Will morning ever come?  ♫

577
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,380
♫  If I could turn back time  ♫

578
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:44,870
♫  I’d erase the dark times  ♫

579
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:51,690
♫  At the end of a fading day  ♫

580
00:40:51,690 --> 00:41:01,410
♫  A small, shining star remains  ♫

581
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,450
   

582
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,000
You'd like a refund for the products?

583
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,800
- The product from five months ago... 
 - We sincerely apologize.

584
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,450
I think there's been a misunderstanding. You'd like a refund?

585
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,300
We don't have drugs in our sausages.

586
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,340
Give me the phone.

587
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,990
Give me the phone.

588
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,500
Yes, dear customer.

589
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,000
Have you heard of "crack gimbap"? You know, it's so good that it's addictive?

590
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,430
You've had gimbap with crack in it? Our sausages don't have crack—

591
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,380
Hello?

592
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,700
Say crack gimbap is a real thing.

593
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,900
Yes, sir.

594
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:49,090
We could release an article saying the fight didn't happen. 
    

595
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,580
We can't.

596
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:55,530
"Our employee doesn't have a record of assault. It was gambling."

597
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:00,400
Put out a correction... Come on! What am I supposed to say?

598
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,450
It's Yang Hong Gi.

599
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,690
Video?

600
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,580
What video?

601
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,610
Again?

602
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,200
I'm going to lose my mind.

603
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,400
Eun Ha.

604
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,900
We need to talk.

605
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,870
- Guilty, right? 
 - Of what?

606
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,790
Did something get stolen?

607
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:48,120
You stole the original footage and posted it!

608
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,690
These are from the shoot, right? Can I take some?

609
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,800
You think I don't know you took it from my desk yesterday?

610
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,680
I don't. Do you, Producer?

611
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,810
Do you know who edited out everything except the most unflattering part?

612
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,260
No one wants to get roasted.

613
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,980
But I think some people deserve it a little.

614
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,550
I got roasted pretty hard yesterday.

615
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,670
I should go before the CEO gets here.

616
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,850
I have a feeling he'll be in hysterics.

617
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,380
 Come over here and try some sausage! 

618
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,410
 Come try some sausage! 

619
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,190
 Come and try some sausage! 

620
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,950
 Hey kid, try this. 

621
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,070
Hey, hey!

622
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,050
What was that?

623
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,390
Do you know how much this shirt costs? Seriously!

624
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,930
What's wrong?

625
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,140
Your employee spilled food on my shirt.

626
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,190
Your shirt looks fine.

627
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:47,130
Fine? This is expensive!

628
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,520
It doesn't look that expensive.

629
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,770
Am I not a customer?

630
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,730
Aigoo, sir, it got all over your shirt.

631
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,100
I'm so sorry.

632
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,460
Please get in touch with us later.

633
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,650
What did I do?

634
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,530
Pick up the sausages. Kids might slip.

635
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,760
 I should hold it. 

636
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,150
   

637
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,790
 This is the original footage from that day. 

638
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:35,130
 I'll let you be the judge. 

639
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,750
Someone anonymously circulated this last night.

640
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,750
They didn't say their name,

641
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,420
but I have a good guess who it was.

642
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,410
But why...

643
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,130
Why didn't she post this on her own channel?

644
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,520
I think I was wrong.

645
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,000
I don't think she had access to her own account.

646
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,330
Why didn't you...

647
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,870
Why didn't you tell me that before?

648
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,350
 - I'm very sorry— 
 - If you get 10 million views, do you make 10 million won? 

649
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,570
 Now that you know, you'll be rich soon. 

650
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,220
 Or maybe you already knew. 

651
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,800
   

652
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,560
Why is she here?

653
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,110
Why am I hiding?

654
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,800
A big apple fell, like "boom"!

655
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,800
Then, a mole appeared and went munch, munch, munch.

656
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,040
It's so fresh!

657
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,630
Then a rabbit appeared.

658
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,210
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

659
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,040
It's so yummy!

660
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,780
Then a bee appeared.

661
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,720
Slurp, slurp, slurp.

662
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,590
So sweet!

663
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,400
A pig and a squirrel went yum, yum, yum.

664
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,270
It tastes so good!

665
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,700
It's Mini Unni's volunteering day.

666
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,070
The kids are so happy. They've been waiting for her.

667
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,790
So yummy!

668
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,320
Oink, oink.

669
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,990
The pig eats the most!

670
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,100
Yu Na, why did you cry?

671
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:33,800
Chul said that the pig ate the most.

672
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,380
Did you cry because you were angry?

673
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,700
No. Because I felt bad.

674
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,140
You cried because you felt bad that Chul fell?

675
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,000
Then should we go tell Chul how you feel?

676
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,950
Your feelings are not something the eyes can see.

677
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,050
If you don't tell him, Chul won't know.

678
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,290
Chul, I'm sorry.

679
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,910
Yu Na says she's sorry.

680
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,410
It's okay.

681
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:48,170
♫  Unusually warm wind  ♫

682
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:54,270
♫  Soothe my weary day  ♫

683
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:04,120
♫  Reflect on my uneasy heart  ♫

684
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:10,390
♫  I wish all of this was a dream  ♫

685
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:15,660
♫  When I feel alone  ♫

686
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,930
♫  Lights of the past  ♫

687
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:26,110
♫  Warmly embrace me again  ♫

688
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:35,730
♫  I want to see the light, wake me up from my tiredness  ♫

689
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:44,070
♫  Push away the time that feels like a lie  ♫

690
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:51,320
♫  Oh, shine on me at the end of this road  ♫

691
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,630
♫  May the thick darkness be lifted and the bright light come to me  ♫

692
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:03,100
♫  May the thick darkness be lifted and the bright light come to me  ♫

693
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,670
Four was an excellent choice.

694
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,280
Oh, this thing...

695
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,260
- What are you doing here? 
 - A hole...

696
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,160
I'm just having a beer.

697
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,620
Is there a problem?

698
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,620
No. No problem.

699
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:19,280
Did you see the thing I left?

700
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,130
Did you leave something?

701
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,050
- I'm sorry. 
 - Hey.

702
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,890
I'm sorry.

703
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,850
I didn't even know,

704
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:42,210
and I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

705
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,950
I don't like being misunderstood.

706
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,660
Yet, I first...

707
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,950
misunderstood you.

708
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,630
No, I misunderstood first.

709
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:56,300
- No, I did. 
 - No, I did it more.

710
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,960
I mean...

711
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,300
Are your ribs okay?

712
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,190
Oh, yes. They're fine. I'm being discharged tomorrow.

713
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,440
Thank goodness.

714
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,000
I should walk one stop to sober up.

715
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,800
Take care.

716
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,920
Yes. Get home safe.

717
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:31,650
 I came by to properly apologize. 

718
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:35,650
 It might not come across as sincere, but I want to apologize, 

719
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:38,750
 even if it's too late. 

720
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,800
 I'm sorry. 

721
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,100
Come by to get some kimchi. Aren't you running out?

722
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,070
 What should we eat? Boiled pork? Pig feet? 

723
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:18,520
Boiled pork or pig feet both sound good.

724
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,180
It's so nice out. Should we go on a picnic?

725
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
Get a guy to go with you.

726
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,870
Since when do I have a guy?

727
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,270
You should run into Hyun Woo on a day like this.

728
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,270
Right? Totally.

729
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,100
Got it.

730
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,850
Okay.

731
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:16,050
 You should run into Hyun Woo on a day like this. 

732
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,000
 Right? Totally. 

733
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,520
Hey, watch out.

734
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,730
   

735
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,900
Welcome back. Will you go straight to the office?

736
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,770
Sure. I've left my seat empty for too long.

737
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,360
Why is this not working?

738
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,300
I thought Hyungnim didn't like soy milk since it tastes bland.

739
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,500
I'm sure he's embarrassed. It's not like he has osteoporosis.

740
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,360
The poignant moment he realizes his bone density!

741
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,290
You know what that means?

742
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:52,800
I meant "powerful"!

743
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,450
Pack it all up, got it?

744
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:59,650
Should we head out, Hyungnim?

745
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,140
It's here.

746
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,040
Miss! You need to pay!

747
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,170
Okay.

748
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,510
Hyungnim.

749
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,690
Hyungnim!

750
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,290
Hyungnim!

751
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,610
Your bags are in the car.

752
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:33,920
 Kindergarteners who drank organic milk from a certain company 

753
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,700
 are showing symptoms of food poisoning and continue to be hospitalized. 

754
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,340
 The milk in question was featured at a recent Kids' Food Festival 

755
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,010
 promoted by kids' creator A. 

756
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:50,360
 The Jongno Health Ministry reported that at 3:30 p.m. today, 

757
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,200
 30 students from three kindergartens 

758
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,520
 showed symptoms after having their snacks. 

759
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:01,300
 The Health Ministry has ordered a sales ban on the milk 

760
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,540
 and will be recalling the products already in circulation. 

761
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,850
 This is milk all of you love. 

762
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:13,660
 This organic milk is from cows that live on big green fields 

763
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:18,000
 drinking clean water and eating organic food, leading happy lives. 

764
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,400
 So our friends who get stomachache 

765
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,700
 or have a bad aftertaste could drink it. 

766
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,610
Chul, you like milk, right? Do you want these?

767
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,440
Thank you.

768
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,090
- Chul, are you okay? Are you sick? 
 - Mini Noona.

769
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,510
Ma'am, is Chul okay?

770
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,300
What a relief...

771
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,400
What a relief.

772
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,340
- Geez. 
 - Seriously.

773
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,800
We have to wait too long. Let's go somewhere else.

774
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,320
   

775
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,970
Over here!

776
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,210
Please help!

777
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,920
Doctor!

778
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,210
Where are all the doctors?

779
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,220
It happened after he drank this.

780
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,750
I'll get to him soon. One minute, please.

781
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,790
Doctor! Please hurry!

782
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,490
She said that it would be okay on the channel.

783
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:06,240
It's true. She said that.

784
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,500
I'm sorry...

785
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,200
You said it was okay.

786
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,200
You said that it was safe!

787
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,450
You said it was okay for kids!

788
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,730
I'm sorry.

789
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:30,250
What are you going to do about this?

790
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,380
If something happens to my kid, it's on you!

791
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,700
If it's that good, why don't you have some?

792
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:59,970


793
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,600
♫  I’ve waited  ♫

794
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:27,750
♫  For your expressions  ♫

795
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,620
♫  Perhaps our comfortable smiles hold our time  ♫

796
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:35,050
Close your eyes and count to ten. 
 ♫  Perhaps our comfortable smiles hold our time  ♫

797
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,370
♫  We, who were awkward  ♫

798
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,190
♫  Suddenly realized  ♫

799
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:54,530
♫  Ways to express our hearts bit by bit  ♫

800
01:01:55,670 --> 01:02:00,250
♫  On sleepless nights  ♫

801
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:04,910
♫  I’ll be your comfort  ♫

802
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:09,200
♫  I’ll always be with you  ♫

803
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,390
   

804
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:15,230
 How do you comfort a girl when she's upset? 

805
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,600
 - "Does it hurt?" 
 - My neck. 

806
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,600
 It hurts me, too. 

807
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,060
 "Are you upset?" 

808
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,350
 It's like a map. It looks like India, right? 

809
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,610
 Was I too loud? 

810
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:27,630
 This is Seoul Central... 

811
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:28,820
 Voice phishing? 

812
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,850
 Wow, I almost fell for it. 

813
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:34,070
 I'm shutting the channel down for a while. 

814
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:34,870
   

815
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,450
 Were you really a mobster? 

816
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,820
 Keep making your videos. 

817
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:43,900
