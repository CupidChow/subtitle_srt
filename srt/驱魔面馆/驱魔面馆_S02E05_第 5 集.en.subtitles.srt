1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,224
Would the defendant like to
address the court?

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,437
You've been doing very well.

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,355
Just tell them

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,858
you regret everything
and you're full of remorse.

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,901
That's it.

7
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,561
They're all here.

8
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,147
Is this a family gathering?

9
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,069
Right now,

10
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,822
I regret everything.

11
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,367
Also,

12
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,328
I'm full of remorse.

13
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,999
If only I could turn back time…

14
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,670
and go back

15
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,881
to that same moment…

16
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,889
What is…

17
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,100
wrong with him?

18
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,648
Then, I'd kill him.

19
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,779
No matter what.

20
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,699
Mr. Ma, what are you doing?

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,784
He's one of us.

22
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:41,995
Mr. Ma.

23
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,997
Mr. Ma, what are you doing?

24
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,250
Your Honor, my client only said that

25
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:52,755
because he's still mentally unfit
from the loss of his wife.

26
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,424
I'd like to withdraw his words.

27
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,636
The defendant's statement
and his attorney's opinion seem to differ.

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,138
Could the defendant discuss

29
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,140
with his attorney
and give his statement again?

30
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,434
Thank you, Your Honor.

31
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,853
Mr. Ma, what are you doing?

32
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,564
I will never forgive them.

33
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,358
Mr. Ma, what's wrong with you?

34
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,495
Never.

35
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,081
Calm down. What's going on with you?

36
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,253
I like him.

37
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,298
I love his gaze.

38
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,300
What's with him?

39
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,719
Don't tell me

40
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,471
he can recognize us.

41
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,058
How could he when he's not awake yet?

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,150
Mr. Ma, hold on.

43
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,237
Mr. Ma. Wait, it won't take long!

44
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,446
Mr. Ma.

45
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,914
It's okay, Mr. Ma.

46
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,750
It's not over yet.
Your attorney will try--

47
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,210
What's not over yet?

48
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,632
Your trial can still end well
and you can get back on your feet again.

49
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,133
You can't give up like this.

50
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,677
Then what should I have said?

51
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,137
That I forgive him?

52
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,390
That everything is fine now?

53
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,559
That I've forgotten about Min-ji's killer?

54
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,313
Mr. Park will be punished.
So you can stop now.

55
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,650
Do you think this is
what Ms. Lee would've wanted?

56
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,112
You know very well this isn't
what Ms. Lee would've wanted.

57
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,532
Min-ji is gone now.

58
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,910
That means…

59
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,455
things can never be the same again.

60
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,170
Mr. Ma.

61
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,511
EPISODE 5

62
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,238
You know my son well, don't you?

63
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,952
You know he has a kind and gentle soul.

64
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,206
He must've been suffering

65
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,711
from so much hatred and pain.

66
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,548
Who can I talk to about this?

67
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,593
How can I let everyone know about this?

68
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,262
Don't worry, ma'am.

69
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,267
Things will work out for Mr. Ma.

70
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,644
So don't worry.

71
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,836
My dear, Ju-seok.

72
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,797
Ju-seok.

73
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,476
Is this what it feels like to be a parent?

74
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,188
How heart-wrenching.

75
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,004
AWARD CERTIFICATE

76
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,972
A savior…

77
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,685
What a great man.

78
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,275
He must've gone insane
after his wife and baby died.

79
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,361
In his gaze,

80
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,948
the power felt different.

81
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,874
And yet, he was suppressing that power.

82
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,046
He couldn't even kill Mr. Park.

83
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,008
So how could he help us in any way?

84
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,218
We should help him first.

85
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:55,850
Let's see.

86
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:01,981
If Ma Ju-seok accepts the power,
he'll be a very special one.

87
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,532
I'm getting curious
about that guy, So Mun.

88
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,330
How will he look once he sees
that his savior has become the devil?

89
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,467
What will happen to him now?

90
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,221
We'll have to wait until the next trial.

91
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,556
But he won't get a reduced sentence

92
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,060
if he refuses to change his attitude.

93
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,187
Oh, dear.

94
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,480
He looked dangerous.

95
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,566
Dangerous? What do you mean?

96
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,027
It's a hunch you have as a detective.

97
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,863
"This person shouldn't be let out."

98
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,283
"They're going to screw up
sooner or later."

99
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,744
That's how he came across as?

100
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,997
That's what my gut told me.

101
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,168
That's absurd.
You know what kind of person he is.

102
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,506
Of course, he'd want
to kill those bastards.

103
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,217
Why can't you empathize with him?

104
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,012
I wouldn't have believed him either
had I not been there.

105
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,724
He's been a good man all his life.

106
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,270
But his faith in humanity
came crumbling down in an instant.

107
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,355
Right. Where's Mun?

108
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,026
He went to drop off Mr. Ma's mother
and visit his grandparents.

109
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,196
He said his grandparents
want to know about the trial.

110
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,867
They must be so shocked.

111
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,620
I'm back!

112
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,833
I'm back, I'm back
Jeok-bong's back

113
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,834
I'm back

114
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,463
Counter Na Jeok-bong is back!

115
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,216
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

116
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,762
Hey! You think this is a party?

117
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,347
Keep your voice down at night.

118
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,725
You startled me, you punk.

119
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,103
Welcome back, Jeok-bong.
Go eat something.

120
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,406
All right. Why don't you clean this up?

121
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,048
Why did they urge me to hurry back then?

122
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,180
My goodness.

123
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:43,392
You shouldn't tire yourself out here,
just wait inside.

124
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,310
Grandpa.

125
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,189
-Grandma.
-Hey, Mun. How did it go?

126
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,317
Did the trial go well?

127
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,445
How's Mr. Ma?

128
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,698
Why are you waiting outside? It's cold.

129
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,786
Well, your grandma keeps asking
to see her darling.

130
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,037
And more than usual today.

131
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,214
Grandma, should we go look at the moon?

132
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,591
-The moon?
-Yeah.

133
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,058
Grandma.

134
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,227
Do you miss Mr. Ma?

135
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,439
Mr. Ma? He's my darling.

136
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,068
Right. Your darling.

137
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,986
Do you miss him a lot?

138
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,571
Yes.

139
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,074
Why do you like him so much?

140
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,910
My Mun-yeong…

141
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,537
Mom?

142
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,205
What about her?

143
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,709
Mun-yeong, my daughter,

144
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,504
told him to come to me.

145
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,424
-Come here!
-Ma'am!

146
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,092
Mun-yeong?

147
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,511
Mun-yeong is…

148
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,429
Yes?

149
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:06,475
She is eager to hear about
all the fun things you did on this earth.

150
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,897
She wants you to take your time
and gather as many stories as you can.

151
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,567
I'm a fun guy.

152
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,778
That's why she sent me to you.

153
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,238
I see.

154
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,367
Mun-yeong sent you?

155
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,326
Yes.

156
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,580
She told me to entertain you.

157
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:33,043
-I see.
-So let's have a great time together.

158
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,713
Then later,

159
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,423
much later,

160
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,802
you can go see her. Okay?

161
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,515
But he's not around.

162
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,435
We were going to have fun.

163
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:58,277
I need to share
my fun stories with my daughter.

164
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,696
Grandma!

165
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,784
So that was the secret.

166
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,040
Grandma.

167
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,502
Your darling is a great guy.

168
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,170
Yes.

169
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,090
He's a wonderful guy.

170
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,051
He is.

171
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,267
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER

172
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,233
Do you think this is
what Ms. Lee would've wanted?

173
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,736
You know very well this isn't
what Ms. Lee would've wanted.

174
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,282
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts again.

175
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,536
Don't you get it?
He's pretending he understands you.

176
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,205
He's distracting you, Ma Ju-seok!

177
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,792
-Be quiet.
-You need to take your revenge.

178
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,793
Just shut up.

179
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,303
Jeez. Does he have glue
on his palms or something?

180
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,016
Hey, dimwit.

181
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,644
I heard you ruined your trial.

182
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,896
Don't you want to get out?

183
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,648
Want me to send you out in a coffin?

184
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,234
What are you doing?

185
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,861
I told you not to hang out in groups.

186
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,656
We were just asking him to play with us.
We're leaving.

187
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,533
You just wait.

188
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,702
I'll peel your flesh right off

189
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,997
so you can be reunited with your wife.

190
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,797
Yes.

191
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,550
Let's get rid of them first.

192
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,806
What is it? Are you afraid
of killing those scumbags too?

193
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,184
Why in the world
are you still hesitating?

194
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,729
Remember your wife.

195
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,899
Remember your baby
who didn't even get a chance to live.

196
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,944
Those bastards are insulting your wife!

197
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,032
You just need to accept me.

198
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:14,371
Then, nobody can stop us.

199
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,545
He's here.

200
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,215
He's finally here.

201
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,133
Inmate 617.

202
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,303
You have a visitor.

203
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,389
You'd be very happy to see him.

204
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,204
Who are you?

205
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,499
Was it really Mr. Park?

206
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,379
The man who killed your wife?

207
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,090
Who are you?

208
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,011
Who do you think killed your wife?

209
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,224
Was it Mr. Park who brutally murdered
your pregnant wife?

210
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,184
Or…

211
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,524
Was it Baekdu Planning & Construction
that tormented her for over two years?

212
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,444
It must've been so tough.

213
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,946
Her husband risked his life

214
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,657
and jumped into fires
to earn and save all that money…

215
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,993
to lose it in one day.

216
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,411
Shut your trap.

217
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,204
Is that it though?

218
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,914
What are you getting at?

219
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,626
Quiet down.

220
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,934
Don't be startled.
You have this power too.

221
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,358
You already knew

222
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,903
that mere humans like him
can't stop you.

223
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,282
Who the hell are you?

224
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,120
Someone who's here to tell you the truth.

225
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,623
Sadly, you haven't arrived

226
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,877
at the end of the truth. No.

227
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,130
You're nowhere near it.

228
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,763
You were impressive, Ma Ju-seok.

229
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,739
DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO
CLASSIC PIANO ACADEMY

230
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,665
Do Ha-na.

231
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,252
You're wrong.

232
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,421
I'm right.

233
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,464
No, you're wrong.

234
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,133
-I'm right.
-Hey.

235
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,719
What were you talking about?

236
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,431
Mr. Park, what does your girlfriend do?

237
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,516
My girlfriend?

238
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,267
She's not his girlfriend.

239
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,603
Why is she always running?

240
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,480
Is she an athlete?

241
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,404
Where was she running?

242
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,824
At the park over there.

243
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,066
Park Do-hwi?

244
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,905
Gosh.

245
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,532
Goodness.

246
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,367
What a pleasant surprise.

247
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,745
Ha-na, what are you doing here?

248
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,540
Working out.

249
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,251
You come here to work out? I see.

250
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,675
When did you leave that day?

251
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,052
You were gone when I arrived.

252
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,848
Something came up suddenly.

253
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,849
I see.

254
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,895
How is he doing?
He seemed sensitive to smells.

255
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,772
Right. He's the weird one.

256
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,691
-You didn't smell.
-Right.

257
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,323
I'm glad to see you're in good health.

258
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,582
Looks like you're still playing the piano.

259
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,126
Yes. Well…

260
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,837
I may not have become a pianist,

261
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,423
but I like playing it.

262
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,052
I only started playing
after falling for do.

263
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,178
And look where I am…

264
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,430
What?

265
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,224
-What?
-What I meant was…

266
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,684
The solfège notes.
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do.

267
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,936
-That "do."
-Right.

268
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,438
-I see.
-I was talking about that.

269
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,232
They're like homonyms.

270
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,776
-Right.
-I see.

271
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:39,947
I'm relieved.

272
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,407
About what?

273
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,701
Your smile.

274
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,870
You haven't changed one bit.

275
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,793
It's a lovely coincidence
that we ran into each other.

276
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,170
How about we get coffee--

277
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,964
It was nice to see you, Do-hwi.

278
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,757
Right.

279
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,344
I have something to do
so I need to leave now.

280
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,345
-Really?
-Yes.

281
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,596
Okay, then.

282
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,181
Wait.

283
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,771
There's an exam this week
so I'll come earlier.

284
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,981
4 YEARS AGO
IN A COMA

285
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,190
I flunked my exam.

286
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,818
My charm is how I never change, right?

287
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,907
Gosh, why do these flowers
wither so quickly?

288
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,370
You will wake up
before these flowers wither, right?

289
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,924
Where's Ha-na?

290
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,219
The girl who was on that bed.
Where did she go?

291
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,516
Sorry.

292
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,226
What's wrong with my hand?

293
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,603
I guess it's been
playing the piano too much.

294
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,068
This is the cattle shed we went.

295
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,488
This is the art museum and the reeds
where we met the evil spirits.

296
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:08,744
Jeok-bong could sniff them out
within a three-kilometer radius.

297
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,746
That means there were no evil spirits

298
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,874
within the three-kilometer radius
from our hideout.

299
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,375
That's right.

300
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,503
My nose feels okay right now.

301
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,131
Then, we should look around
the area up there.

302
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,051
Mun.

303
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,677
Are you all right?

304
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,431
No.

305
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,183
I feel uneasy.

306
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,854
But Mr. Ma is in the dark,
and his hatred is focused on Mr. Park.

307
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,901
If we want him to know the truth
before it's too late,

308
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,737
we need to catch them soon.

309
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,988
All right.

310
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,365
Gosh. Worrying about it
won't change anything.

311
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,952
Those little vermin are all dead meat.

312
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,996
What's that?

313
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,581
Jeez.

314
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,837
No one can top me when it comes
to getting top-of-the-line equipment.

315
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,130
What's all this?

316
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,131
What are these?

317
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,300
Guns and bulletproof vests.

318
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,802
Those evil spirits are quick

319
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,678
-to pull out guns.
-Try it on.

320
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,389
You need good equipment
to do your job properly.

321
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,474
Try it on.

322
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,437
Is this really bulletproof?

323
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,314
It looks so thin.

324
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,066
-Try it on.
-What about our heads?

325
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,735
Jeok-bong, let's test it out then.

326
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,862
What are you doing?

327
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,948
-What are you doing?
-Jeok-bong.

328
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,074
Are you ready?

329
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,492
You won't shoot me, right?

330
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,702
We need to see if it's really bulletproof.

331
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,330
-Please have mercy.
-Jeok-bong!

332
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,042
Don't shoot! Help me!

333
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,683
Na Jeok-bong.

334
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,601
Welcome back.

335
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,063
Welcome back.

336
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,316
Be thankful that we were too busy
to plan something bigger.

337
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,946
I'm glad you're back.
I'll make you some tasty noodles later.

338
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,365
Jeok-bong, are you ready to go?

339
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,616
Let's head out now.

340
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,784
-Let's go.
-All right.

341
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,662
Jeok-bong, catch.

342
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,460
Was that a welcoming ceremony?
It was just a prank yesterday?

343
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,920
Wait up!

344
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,810
Come on!

345
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,769
You ill or something?

346
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,022
-He pretty much pooped.
-I couldn't hold it in.

347
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,441
Be careful. Don't confuse Jeok-bong.

348
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,734
Wait!

349
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,571
What is this foul smell?

350
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,780
What smell?

351
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,949
Sorry, Jeok-bong.

352
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,576
Jeez, it stinks.

353
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,785
No.

354
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,371
This isn't like any other dung smell.

355
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,041
This smell…

356
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,128
It's that same terrifying smell
from the reeds.

357
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,631
-That woman?
-Yes.

358
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,508
It's the woman you stabbed in the eye.

359
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,551
And Mr. Hwang?

360
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,763
There's only one smell.

361
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,186
And it's moving!

362
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,438
-To the east!
-Go!

363
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,065
-All right!
-Let's go!

364
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,667
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

365
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,794
Long time no see.

366
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,171
Wait a minute.

367
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,175
Your eyes look more beautiful now.

368
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,594
Where is it?

369
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,683
Did you take good care of it?

370
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,604
I laundered it well and dried it nicely.

371
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,274
I even put it in the freezer
so it wouldn't go bad.

372
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,946
You better zip up.

373
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,447
It's freezing cold in here.

374
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,825
This way.

375
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,540
Are you seeing anyone these days?

376
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,084
I guess you are.

377
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,473
I'm in no mood for jokes.

378
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,145
Where's my money?

379
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,896
Come on.

380
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,024
That money doesn't belong to anyone.

381
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,942
If anyone,

382
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,903
doesn't it belong to those poor people

383
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,197
who you scammed
with Baekdu Planning & Construction?

384
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,704
You were always dumb.

385
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,750
But I can see that you've studied a bit.

386
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,545
I wonder who taught you.

387
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,259
This crazy bitch has lived longer
than I expected.

388
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,762
Come in.

389
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,520
Give me the right answer
and maybe I'll kill you a bit later.

390
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,857
Where's Mr. Hwang?

391
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,925
I traced the smell up to this point.

392
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,385
So the woman is in there.

393
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:03,306
If she's not with Mr. Hwang,
then we definitely have the upper hand.

394
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,308
Why would she come here by herself?

395
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,768
Don't let your guard down.

396
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,938
She's still fast and insane.

397
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,609
Over here.

398
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,738
Straight ahead.

399
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,618
How did you get here?

400
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,412
We drove.

401
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,788
That's not what he meant.

402
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,164
You startled me.

403
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,504
Hello.

404
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,509
Looks like we'll earn
extra brownie points today.

405
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,727
We'll get a special promotion
given their numbers.

406
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,729
You can go first if you have to.

407
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,063
-Okay.
-You can go first.

408
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,523
Bring it on!

409
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,441
No.

410
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,026
Go on!

411
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,741
Which way?

412
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,785
-Right!
-Right!

413
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:24,179
You should've been more careful
if you knew I was a crazy bitch.

414
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,348
You're not human…

415
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,893
How can you--

416
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,688
You're the one who's not human,
because you'll be dead soon.

417
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:35,899
Hey.

418
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,277
I don't want to read your filthy mind
so just tell me.

419
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,946
Who was it?

420
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,033
Who dared to utter Hwang Pil-gwang's name?

421
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,828
What?

422
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,748
It's…

423
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,665
What?

424
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,461
Can't you talk louder?

425
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,506
Should I rip your mouth open?

426
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,563
The smell is getting worse! Over here!

427
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,233
Stop right there!

428
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,776
Damn it.

429
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,868
-Sir.
-Mun!

430
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,453
Sir! Wake up.

431
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,579
Sir!

432
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,997
Sir.

433
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,024
My nose!

434
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,280
His nose?

435
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,574
My nose!

436
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,545
Jeok-bong, don't breathe in!
Cover your nose!

437
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,796
My nose!

438
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,134
My nose!

439
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,847
Ms. Chu!

440
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,517
-What happened?
-Are you okay?

441
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,936
No, he's not okay.

442
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,271
What happened?

443
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,691
Ms. Chu, he inhaled gas…

444
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,359
-Wake up.
-Mun, are you okay?

445
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,360
I'm okay.

446
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,695
Jeok-bong.

447
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,113
He inhaled a lot.

448
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,701
Dad, I can't smell.

449
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,620
Dad, where's the smell?

450
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,997
Look at this punk.

451
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,583
He hit the ground running
as soon as he returned.

452
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,543
Let's catch them and…

453
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,669
Breathe.

454
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,714
You…

455
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,425
Get back in there, scumbag!

456
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,096
We lost the evil spirits again.

457
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,224
I did find something.

458
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,145
That money doesn't belong to anyone.

459
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,731
If anyone,

460
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,942
doesn't it belong to those poor people

461
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,611
who you scammed
with Baekdu Planning & Construction?

462
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,572
You and Mr. Hwang shouldn't
get rid of your figureheads

463
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,532
to gobble up all that money yourselves.

464
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,660
Jeez. That'll give you an indigestion.

465
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,619
Hold on.

466
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,539
They were behind
the Baekdu Planning & Construction scam?

467
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,916
I believe so.

468
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,418
She came here to get their money,

469
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,003
but someone snatched it first.

470
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,880
Come to think of it,

471
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,385
they attended Mr. Park's trial
right after arriving in Korea.

472
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:55,014
Yes. That's right.
Why didn't I realize this sooner?

473
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,309
Are you saying they fought
and betrayed each other for the money

474
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,728
that they stole
from those innocent victims?

475
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,772
They're animals.

476
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,900
Not only are they blinded by greed
but they also killed Min-ji.

477
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,360
No.

478
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,739
This is actually better.
This is our opportunity.

479
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,702
If we can find evidence,
not only will we be able to summon them

480
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,704
but we can also put them behind bars.

481
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,292
All right.
I'm already moonlighting as it is.

482
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,961
I'll show them what I got.

483
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,630
I'll show them my detective skills.

484
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:29,966
Han-ul.

485
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,092
Wrap this up for me.

486
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,596
Goodbye.

487
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,809
I discovered Gelly's weakness.

488
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,689
She has blonde hair,
so it's easy to spot her in the dark.

489
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,733
-Ha-na--
-Hurry up!

490
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,486
Goodness. Wait for me.

491
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,997
Hold on. That guy can sniff us out?

492
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,668
Oh, dear.
I definitely underestimated him, didn't I?

493
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,878
You're laughing?

494
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,755
Is this funny to you?

495
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,007
Damn it.

496
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,597
We just got duped.

497
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,182
And you find this hilarious?

498
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,369
Yes.

499
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,872
I'm having so much fun.

500
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,085
Just watch.

501
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,379
He's going to make things
much more entertaining.

502
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,387
We should get that bastard.

503
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,516
We need to get our money.

504
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,771
You said you couldn't read his mind
because those fools barged in.

505
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,816
-We don't know where it is.
-We can't just sit on our hands.

506
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,196
Avoiding those lights
won't cut it anymore.

507
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,114
Got that?

508
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:19,951
Pil-gwang.

509
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,958
They can sniff us out.

510
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,338
They'll find us sooner or later.

511
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,883
Then…

512
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,637
why aren't they coming here?

513
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,598
What?

514
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,019
They would've come here right away
if they could track us down.

515
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,359
So why can't they find us here?

516
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,244
Who do you think killed your wife?

517
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,166
Was it Mr. Park who brutally murdered
your pregnant wife?

518
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,501
Or…

519
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:16,007
was it Baekdu Planning & Construction
that tormented her for over two years?

520
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,302
But you know what?

521
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,220
Is that it though?

522
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,350
How could he know?

523
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,728
He's just bluffing.

524
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,147
It's all nonsense.

525
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,818
What if he told the truth?

526
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,821
Your wife was wrongfully killed.

527
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,450
Imagine how much
she resents you for not acting.

528
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,244
She was so devoted to you.

529
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,665
You shouldn't just sit by
and pretend to ignore it.

530
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:56,172
You need to find out
who really killed her.

531
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:03,471
You should protect her for once.

532
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,681
Are you going to

533
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,393
spit on her grave?

534
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,357
Sadly, you're haven't arrived

535
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,194
at the end of the truth. No.

536
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,322
You're nowhere near it.

537
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,850
DEMAND FOR REINVESTIGATION
OF BAEKDU PLANNING & CONSTRUCTION

538
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,773
WE ARE AGAINST
BAEKDU PLANNING & CONSTRUCTION

539
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,496
"Gelly Choi"?

540
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,957
Correct. She's the suspect.

541
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,167
She has dual citizenship
in Korea and the US.

542
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,877
She's been convicted of murder in Korea.

543
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,797
She escaped from a mental asylum
seven years ago.

544
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,091
Records show
she entered China two years ago.

545
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,219
That was exactly
around the time of the Baekdu scam.

546
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:26,887
And?

547
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,142
We're still looking into Mr. Hwang.

548
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,854
It's hard to identify him
with only his facial composite.

549
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:35,896
No priors either.

550
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,067
Is she on the wanted list?

551
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,863
Yes, we used the CCTV footage
and put her on the wanted list.

552
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,743
But why are you digging
into that case again?

553
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,871
Wasn't the Baekdu scam case closed?

554
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,667
A case is only over
when the victims say so.

555
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,797
No one has been punished
despite there being hundreds of victims.

556
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,425
We haven't located their money either.

557
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,970
It can't end like this.

558
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,932
-I won't allow it.
-I know.

559
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,394
But President Lee Chung-jae is dead
and Mr. Park had nothing either.

560
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,482
Are they

561
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,609
connected to the case?

562
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,725
Ha-na, don't forget our meetup
at 5:00 p.m. today.

563
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,937
It's chilly outside so dress warmly.

564
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,649
I'm at the restaurant. Where are you?

565
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,819
Is everything okay?

566
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,925
-Ms. Kim Jeong-yeong?
-Yes?

567
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:28,884
Ha-na!

568
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,428
-Excuse me.
-Do Ha-na.

569
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,472
-Over here.
-Sorry. Did you wait a long time?

570
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,474
It's okay. I'm glad that you're here.

571
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,185
But we missed our reservation
so we need to wait.

572
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,605
-Sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

573
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,781
Why are you laughing?

574
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,119
They say, "Tracksuits
are more addictive than drugs."

575
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,205
I didn't know you'd be
wearing one today too.

576
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,378
But did you always look
this good in tracksuits?

577
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,047
I don't remember
ever seeing you in one before.

578
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,509
I've always worn them at home.

579
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,428
I had my gym clothes too.

580
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,345
Right.

581
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,726
Hey, no, don't do that.

582
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,187
-I can do it.
-I'm almost done. Hold on.

583
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,203
What's he…

584
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,835
Why did he stop?

585
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,093
Let's… Hold on.

586
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,887
Let's go somewhere else.

587
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,640
I don't think I'm hungry.

588
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,518
-I'm not hungry.
-Mr. Park Do-hwi?

589
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,520
Mr. Park Do-hwi?

590
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,528
My God, I'm dying.

591
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:14,657
I feel nauseous. I'm burning up.

592
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,035
You could cook eggs on my forehead.

593
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,080
I wonder if I can still smell.

594
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,541
Oh, no. Poor Jeok-bong.

595
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,544
I bet you're too sick to eat dumplings.

596
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,878
-What?
-Have this instead.

597
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,879
What is this?

598
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,674
The dumplings are ready.

599
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,217
Dumplings.

600
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,638
Dumplings. I should eat well
at times like--

601
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,807
No, you shouldn't push yourself.

602
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,310
He was groaning a lot in his room too.
What if you get an indigestion?

603
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,813
You can't eat these. Ms. Chu, have some.

604
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,439
I feel so bad.

605
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,482
It's okay.

606
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,986
It's so delicious.

607
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,904
The meat, the vegetables,

608
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,448
and the skin complement
each other so well.

609
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,285
Did I do a good job?

610
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,202
Yes.

611
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,413
Have one too.

612
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,875
Thanks.

613
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,382
Jeok-bong, eat your porridge. Get better
so you can help us catch the evil spirits.

614
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,679
You want death to be knocking
on my door again, don't you?

615
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,684
I guess we didn't have any abalones?

616
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,145
I was worried it'd be
too much for your stomach.

617
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,774
-He's hungry so he won't last long.
-He's just pretending.

618
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,027
Gosh, my back.

619
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,945
Why is my back acting up now?

620
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:39,742
I heard abalone or octopus were good
for gas inhalation.

621
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,286
I'm dying here.

622
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,957
I can't even have dumplings because
I tried to catch some evil spirits.

623
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,377
Hey, Ung-min.

624
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:52,963
What?

625
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,007
Ha-na is with some guy?

626
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,635
What guy?

627
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,145
What a shame.
It was almost our turn to go in.

628
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,355
I know.

629
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,773
Are you really not hungry?

630
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,524
No, let's go somewhere else.

631
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,903
Right, I brought some tickets--

632
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,946
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Okay.

633
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,406
Let's go there.

634
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:32,503
KONGKONG ARCADE

635
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,468
What's the matter with him today?

636
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,429
You must like claw machines.

637
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,558
It's no fun to just play though.
Let's make a bet.

638
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,268
Later…

639
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,815
-Ha-na, are you okay?
-Yes.

640
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,279
What are you doing?

641
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,825
-What?
-What's the matter?

642
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:03,742
Hold on.

643
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,457
I'm near Jungjin Market.

644
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,085
I swear I saw Ha-na.

645
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,002
Darn it.

646
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,463
Where did she go?

647
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,298
Talk to you later.

648
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,931
You want to play something? Sure.

649
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,517
Which one? What should we play?

650
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,239
Why won't you grab it?
You need to grab it with your claws.

651
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,157
All right, then.

652
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,034
The score is 15 to nothing.

653
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,293
All right.

654
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,683
Okay. I'm going for a small one now.

655
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:12,019
So I'll go like this.

656
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,689
It worked for you.
From here, it looks like it'll grab it.

657
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,733
Hold on. You should…

658
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,902
Should I do it gently?

659
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,658
Yes, move a bit more.
Okay. You're good.

660
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,428
Okay. A bit more. Be gentle.

661
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,430
-Gentle?
-Now, press it.

662
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,393
-I'm pressing it.
-Okay.

663
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,243
You did it!

664
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,410
I can't believe it.

665
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,415
Darn it. That little punk.

666
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,086
This is so cute!

667
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,089
Wait. I want to get one more.

668
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,216
How nice.

669
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,468
I didn't know she could smile like that.

670
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,930
-Be gentle.
-Okay.

671
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,640
A hug from behind?

672
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,226
They're holding hands and hugging?

673
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,020
She pushed me away
last time I did that. Darn it.

674
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,566
What a wonderful sight.

675
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,776
She looks truly happy.

676
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,447
Ms. Chu, can't you see my misery?

677
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,367
Can't you see this broken heart?

678
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:52,869
That's her true self.

679
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,705
-I'm pressing it.
-Okay.

680
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,872
-Yes.
-Okay.

681
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,213
-I can't take this.
-Don't.

682
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,340
Stay out of it!

683
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,968
Sorry!

684
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,011
I'm okay.

685
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,762
-Are you okay? I'm sorry.
-Yes.

686
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,264
This is incredible!

687
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,101
It's incredible!

688
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,644
-It's as big as my face!
-Yes!

689
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,823
CLEANING MISTER

690
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:32,951
CLEANING MISTER

691
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,329
POINT OF DEPARTURE
CLEANING MISTER

692
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,792
Humans lie.

693
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,919
A car GPS never does.

694
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,421
-Right?
-Sir?

695
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,970
CLEANING MISTER

696
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,765
Oh, no.

697
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,896
I searched through the GPS data
of the ones who died at the cold storage.

698
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,315
And I found one place in common.

699
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,193
They'd been seen here often lately.

700
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,445
Quite random, right?

701
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,949
Not really.
A money launderer and a laundromat.

702
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,117
Right.

703
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:19,665
It's a pity we can't force the door open
without a warrant, Mun.

704
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,051
Jeez, Mun.

705
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,512
You're so smart.

706
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,348
-Don't tell anyone.
-Come this way.

707
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:56,952
Mun.

708
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:03,333
These darn scumbags
are really well prepared.

709
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,501
Look at this.

710
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,795
They are out of their minds.

711
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,883
So they really did launder the money here.

712
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,594
We found evidence of money laundering.

713
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,055
-What?
-What's this?

714
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,557
-Mo-tak.
-CCTV.

715
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,643
It's deleting all the…

716
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,147
It's gone.

717
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,235
Who is that?

718
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,001
Are you all right?

719
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,343
-Mo-tak.
-Hey.

720
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,180
Why are you here, you punk?

721
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,265
You left by yourself so I followed you.

722
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,058
You followed me?

723
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,770
I lost him thanks to you, you jerk.

724
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,539
Who are you? How did you get in--

725
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,343
You have pretty eyes.

726
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,564
What's all this ruckus?

727
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,690
Who's this guy?

728
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,182
What do you say?

729
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,103
Are you ready to accept the truth?

730
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,939
Tell me.

731
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,942
What is the truth that you know?

732
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,320
That's something

733
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,114
you should find out for yourself.

734
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,366
I told you.

735
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,952
You already have that power.

736
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,583
Tell me!

737
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,809
Even if you knew the truth,

738
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,145
there's nothing you can do

739
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,565
with that weak power of yours.

740
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:57,859
Tell me.

741
00:53:58,902 --> 00:53:59,945
Please tell me.

742
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,705
"Ju-seok,

743
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:58,253
what do you think about "Treasure"?
It's nice, right?"

744
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,216
Ju-seok, what do you think
about "Treasure"?

745
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:06,302
Babies listen, so we should have
a nickname for them before we name them.

746
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,471
So what do you think? "Treasure."

747
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,599
They say babies need
nicknames to be healthy.

748
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,102
"They say babies need nicknames

749
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,521
to be healthy."

750
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,480
Stop it.

751
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,607
Stop it.

752
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,443
Stop it!

753
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,616
You said you can't forgive them.

754
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:32,287
So what are you doing here,
you idiot?

755
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:42,047
Please tell me

756
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,800
what you know.

757
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,643
Are you curious?

758
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,858
Then, what can you do for me in return?

759
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,656
You haven't even figured out

760
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,451
the only truth

761
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,079
that you do know.

762
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,459
Mr. Park.

763
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,669
It was him, wasn't it?

764
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:25,840
Yes.

765
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,717
That's it.

766
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:32,931
Accept it.

767
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,186
Your power.

768
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,397
Your rage.

769
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,235
They will help you get revenge.

770
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,154
And that's what I need.

771
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,438
After your first revenge,

772
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,566
the truth

773
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,110
will be waiting for you.

774
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,116
Mo-tak, I'm done with the drawing.

775
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:35,910
Let's see.

776
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,830
It was just a glimpse
so I don't remember the details.

777
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,917
But it looked something like this.

778
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,087
Thirty-seven? Is that it's number?

779
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,465
The tattoo does look unique.

780
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,760
But so many people have tattoos nowadays.

781
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,601
But Mun, let's not be discouraged.

782
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,980
I had my partner look into this.
He'll find something.

783
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:08,818
Right, do you remember
Han-ul from that day?

784
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,154
-The one who came between us in his car?
-Yes.

785
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,364
He's normally good at his job.

786
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,200
He feels really bad.

787
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,912
You're visiting
Mr. Ma's mother later, right?

788
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,206
Yes, I'm going to get
some things for Mr. Ma.

789
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:24,918
She's not feeling well,
so it'll be difficult for her to go.

790
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,086
Of course, she's not feeling well.

791
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,881
You have a lot on your plate.

792
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:30,924
It's okay.

793
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,009
-Let's stay strong.
-Okay.

794
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,601
I'm sorry.

795
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,728
I should be the one to go.

796
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,690
What did the doctor say?

797
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,027
They said I was fine.

798
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,907
But my body has been failing me.

799
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:57,951
I'm out of it as well.

800
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,412
I need to stay healthy

801
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,875
to take good care of Ju-seok.

802
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,835
Right.

803
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,046
His underwear.

804
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,717
You already packed them.

805
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,515
Did I?

806
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,059
My mind is all over the place.

807
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,314
What's the matter with me?

808
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,530
Is this the guy? The unconscious one?

809
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,240
Yes, sir.

810
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,326
The doctor said he was fine.

811
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:46,457
So no one escaped
or got into a fight, right?

812
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:48,835
Then, it's fine.

813
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,505
Don't let this get out.

814
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,674
The inspection is in two days.

815
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,968
We need to sweep all issues under the rug.

816
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:57,969
Yes, sir.

817
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:42,096
Have you finally decided to accept me?

818
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,476
Yes.

819
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:52,148
We will be together forever.

820
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,443
All the way to the fiery pits of hell.

821
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,359
Morning, sunshine.

822
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,321
God, you sleep so much.

823
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,074
I'd love to just kill you.

824
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:46,619
But I'd feel bad for doing that
over a few punches.

825
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,039
But it would hurt my pride
to not do anything

826
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,457
for humiliating me.

827
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,129
You don't need two healthy legs to walk.

828
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,881
So don't resent us, all right?

829
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,342
If anything,

830
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,010
resent your wife.

831
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,724
She did all that bullshit
to live a better life.

832
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,976
Then, she lost all that money.

833
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,604
God damn it!

834
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,898
She shouldn't have been greedy.

835
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,360
That's when your life went downhill,
got it?

836
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,362
If you miss her that much,

837
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,865
we can help you reunite with her.

838
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,429
Earmuffs.

839
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,264
Gloves.

840
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,474
NAME OF CIVILIAN
SO MUN

841
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,516
A jacket liner.

842
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,393
A hat.

843
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,064
Stay away!

844
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,150
Back off!

845
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,241
It wasn't me.

846
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,785
I didn't say anything.

847
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,954
That woman-- No.
I didn't badmouth your wife.

848
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,048
Guards! Help me!

849
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,259
Don't kill me.

850
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,427
Please.

851
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,095
Please forgive me.

852
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:02,421
JUNGJIN PENITENTIARY

853
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,350
Stop!

854
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,317
What's going on? What are you doing?

855
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,249
Mr. Ma?

856
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,382
He's a hindrance. We need to kill him.

857
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,843
An evil spirit.

858
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,180
You've become…

859
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,810
an evil spirit?

860
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:33,823
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

861
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,783
What do you think you are doing?

862
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,618
Nothing can ever be the same again.

863
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:38,619
Ha-na!

864
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,580
Mr. Ma's been possessed by an evil spirit.

865
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,583
I don't know what you guys are,

866
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,502
but this is my final warning.

867
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,922
He may be different
from the other evil spirits

868
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,216
the moment he becomes
a complete evil spirit.

869
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:55,219
They could've planned
Ju-seok's escape from prison.

870
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,389
Are you saying he was approached
by an evil spirit?

871
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,851
Mr. Ma! He wasn't the one
who killed Ms. Lee.

872
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,853
You have to trust us.

873
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:10,901
