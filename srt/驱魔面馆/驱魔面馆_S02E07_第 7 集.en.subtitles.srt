1
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:04,355
And yet, you dare to get in my way

3
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,567
just to save this worthless bastard?

4
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,029
My revenge is meaningless?

5
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,033
Then, what's the meaning
of sparing his life?

6
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:22,540
What do I get out of forgiving
Min-ji and Treasure's murderer?

7
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,709
Mr. Ma!

8
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,002
No!

9
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,606
Ha-na.

10
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,459
The evil spirit has become more powerful.
We need to catch him.

11
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,169
We must.

12
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,225
Mr. Ma.

13
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,440
I warned you not to get in my way.

14
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,279
I told you it was my final warning.

15
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,495
I begged you.

16
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,331
I begged you to stop.

17
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,209
I begged and begged.

18
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,795
But now, you've left me with no choice!

19
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,824
Are you happy now?

20
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,869
Do you feel better
now that you killed him?

21
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,668
No. I've only just begun.

22
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,143
Those who stabbed Min-ji…

23
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,112
Those who ate away at her…

24
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,459
And those who tormented her…

25
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,341
I will kill them all.

26
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,425
Every single one!

27
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,821
Ma Ju-seok has gone ballistic.

28
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,323
I knew it.

29
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,160
I knew modifying Mr. Park's memory
would pay off.

30
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,833
You should remember

31
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,086
that you killed that woman, right?

32
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,174
Let's go over there
before the others come.

33
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,093
I'll consume that bitch.

34
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,345
And you'll consume that bastard.

35
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,774
Who do you think killed your wife?

36
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,070
Was it Mr. Park who brutally murdered
your pregnant wife?

37
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,326
Or was it Baekdu Planning & Construction
that tormented her for over two years?

38
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,123
Sadly, you haven't arrived
at the end of the truth. No.

39
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,251
You're nowhere near it.

40
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
How could you believe that bastard?

41
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,208
You're right.

42
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,293
Like you said…

43
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,923
there's no going back now.

44
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,661
How does it feel to see
that your savior is now an evil spirit?

45
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,539
He's my masterpiece.

46
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,833
Ma Ju-seok.

47
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,754
You bastard.

48
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,483
Right.

49
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,319
Is he nothing but an evil spirit

50
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,782
that you need to kill?

51
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,034
Come on. You're boring me.

52
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,118
Huh?

53
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,712
Don't worry.

54
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,673
I'll take your eyes.

55
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,347
Mr. Ma.

56
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,560
Mr. Ma.

57
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,521
Mr. Ma!

58
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,859
It's you

59
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,653
who should worry.

60
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,408
I'm not alone, unlike you.

61
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,955
Damn it!

62
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,543
Ha-na!

63
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,752
Ha-na!

64
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,172
Ha-na!

65
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,391
Hwang Pil-gwang.

66
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,310
-Where the hell is he?
-Ha-na!

67
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,980
-Ha-na!
-Ha-na.

68
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,189
Ha-na!

69
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,232
Ha-na!

70
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,400
-Ha-na!
-Ha-na!

71
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,825
Ms. Chu.

72
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,164
EPISODE 7

73
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,580
We finally meet.

74
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,625
You haven't consumed a soul in a while.

75
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,960
It must've been so sweet.

76
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,465
Are you in full control now?

77
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,050
No.

78
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,511
Ma Ju-seok's willpower
is still too strong.

79
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,974
His desire for revenge must be stronger.

80
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,436
His rage needs to be more merciless.

81
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,481
We need to provoke him.

82
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,566
That way,

83
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,527
I can do

84
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,155
as you wish.

85
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,408
His desire for revenge?

86
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,577
His rage?

87
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,215
What?

88
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,341
Ha-na…

89
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,135
will be okay, right?

90
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,430
She'll be fine.

91
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,183
Su-ho.

92
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,403
Ms. Chu is overexerting herself
trying to heal Ha-na.

93
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,030
Ma Ju-seok.

94
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,784
He dealt the Counters a huge blow
after committing just one murder.

95
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,871
The evil spirit within him is
rapidly becoming stronger.

96
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,667
Their voices have become one.

97
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,420
His desire for revenge
triggered the murder.

98
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,714
But he will take
many innocent lives at this rate.

99
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,841
Wait.

100
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,594
Then shouldn't we tell him
the truth at all costs?

101
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,557
We must make him believe us
and separate him from Mr. Hwang.

102
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,769
No. Ma Ju-seok shouldn't find out
about the truth now.

103
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,687
What?

104
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:17,027
If he finds out the truth
and confronts Mr. Hwang,

105
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,905
it won't matter who wins.

106
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,533
If the two evil spirits become one,

107
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,036
a complete evil spirit could arise.

108
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,164
A complete evil spirit?

109
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,835
As in those who can absorb
the territory's power like the Counters?

110
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,547
If that's true, the territory
won't only benefit the Counters.

111
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,924
The territory that Mun summons

112
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,801
could work against him.

113
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,643
-The answer is obvious.
-Are you okay?

114
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,314
Whether Ma Ju-seok finds out
the truth and confronts Mr. Hwang

115
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,484
or lets the latter control him
while being in the dark,

116
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,903
both situations are dangerous.

117
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,614
We need to summon them
as soon as possible.

118
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,910
We're seriously
running out of time now, Mo-tak.

119
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,633
-Good work.
-Thank you.

120
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
Thank you.

121
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,762
No worries. She'll be okay.

122
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,818
Mr. Ma…

123
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,156
fell for that bastard's lies.

124
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,742
He said his revenge had just begun.

125
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,246
"Just begun"?

126
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,376
And those who tormented her…

127
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,881
I will kill them all.

128
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,136
He's not just after Mr. Park.

129
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,557
He's after all the scammers.

130
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,435
By the way Mun, are you sure
you couldn't capture Ma Ju-seok

131
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,566
because Mr. Hwang interfered?

132
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,987
Those wounds.

133
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,532
He may have been different
from the other evil spirits,

134
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,076
but I doubt you're weaker than him.

135
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,494
Did you let up…

136
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,664
because it was him?

137
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,339
Don't ever hesitate again.

138
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,050
He is an evil spirit.

139
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,719
So we must summon him

140
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,180
at all costs.

141
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,559
He was a good man.

142
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,563
Mr. Ma…

143
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,863
I've always believed my job was saving
good people from these evil spirits.

144
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,866
However…

145
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,620
if even good people

146
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,247
can become evil spirits,

147
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,335
then who are we actually saving?

148
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,924
What in the world…

149
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,054
are we doing?

150
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,023
WORTHLESS ANIMAL

151
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,107
SEE YOU IN HELL

152
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,025
BAEKDU CONSTRUCTION

153
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,740
I know.

154
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,284
It isn't a happy place for you, right?

155
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,871
I'm sure you have many questions

156
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,416
about why I brought you here,

157
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,378
what I want from you,

158
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,755
and…

159
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,342
why I chose you.

160
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,186
I lost everything to Baekdu Planning
& Construction just like you did.

161
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,192
At first, I just wanted to take revenge
on those who took everything from me.

162
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,236
Just like you.

163
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,572
But you see,

164
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,036
I found out that there were those
who were against that.

165
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,832
They could care less about my pain.

166
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,003
They were unhappy that I had this power.

167
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,505
You'll soon realize that as well.

168
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,549
If we want our revenge,

169
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,093
we'll need to kill them.

170
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,723
They said you killed my wife.

171
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,852
Oh, is that why
I'm urging you to take revenge?

172
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,565
If I truly did kill your wife,
you would've wanted to kill me.

173
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,566
So why'd I urge you?

174
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,403
You're wrong.

175
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,532
They just want us to be gone.

176
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,159
Stop your nonsense.

177
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,412
Tell me. What is this truth you know of?

178
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,956
He's alive.

179
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,418
The one who opened the gates of hell.

180
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,006
President Lee Chung-jae of Baekdu.

181
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,009
What?

182
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,846
That bastard Mr. Park is dead?

183
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,599
Yes, sir. His body was found
in the Baekdu apartment complex.

184
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,395
-Where is his funeral?
-Are you going to attend it?

185
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,987
How can I go when I'm dead, you idiot?

186
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,281
Don't you remember that I'm dead?

187
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,787
By the way, was his name Ma Ju-seok?

188
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,581
He's really something.

189
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,876
How did he escape from prison?

190
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,045
I agree. He sure is incredible.

191
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,090
He killed Mr. Park
just two days after escaping from prison.

192
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,174
He's something else.

193
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,635
Don't praise him.
This is bad for us, you idiot.

194
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,678
What if he finds out about us?

195
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,140
Forget it. Wrap up Jungjin Sector Three.

196
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,352
Beat the shit out of those
who refuse to sign the consent form.

197
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,603
Got it?

198
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,606
Right.

199
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,943
Have you still not located
Pil-gwang and that crazy bitch?

200
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,402
No, sir.

201
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,113
No? Jeez.

202
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:41,078
I should've killed those two off ages ago.

203
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,588
This is video of the suspect
entering the police station.

204
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,675
He was arrested for murdering…

205
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,302
-Why did you abandon Wong?
-…at least five women…

206
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,430
I didn't abandon him.

207
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:06,770
I'm not alone, unlike you.

208
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,021
Ha-na!

209
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,773
-Ha-na!
-Ha-na!

210
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,275
Damn it!

211
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,234
Hwang Pil-gwang.

212
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,653
Where the hell is he?

213
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,200
I just didn't see the need to save him.

214
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,208
Pil-gwang.

215
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,088
So you've abandoned me too?

216
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,136
Do you guys want to get fired?

217
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:43,640
We couldn't stop him from escaping prison.
And now, he's committed murder!

218
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,603
PARK SEONG-UK
DEAD

219
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,938
We're searching motels on the outskirts

220
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,398
and the mountains as well.

221
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,275
Motels? Mountains? Why?

222
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,277
-Isn't it obvious?
-What do you mean?

223
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,571
-He had a grudge.
-So?

224
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,782
What do all perpetrators do
after taking revenge?

225
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,867
What?

226
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,495
We might find him
before he commits suicide.

227
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,415
Might? You, come over here.

228
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,834
-Not again.
-Is this a joke to you?

229
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,920
Do you investigate based on assumptions?

230
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,171
And hope you're right?

231
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,797
You better watch what you say!

232
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,884
Tell me if you want to quit!
I'll put in a word for you.

233
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,844
Let me go. Go back to your seat.

234
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,890
Who said he was done taking revenge?

235
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,727
Isn't it over
now that he killed his wife's murderer?

236
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,437
There's no one else.

237
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,690
Who knows? Maybe he wants
to kill everyone on this board.

238
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,858
Mo-tak.

239
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,694
Why would you suddenly say
something so chilling?

240
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,739
Then why didn't you investigate properly
from the get-go?

241
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,535
This only happened
because people were victimized.

242
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,287
Do you still not get it?

243
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,706
If we want to stop Ma Ju-seok,

244
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,167
we need to solve this case.

245
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,586
WHERE'S THE 120 BILLION?
SHOCKING HOUSING FRAUD

246
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,880
We shouldn't have swept it under the rug.

247
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:57,923
Okay?

248
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,429
Put it back on.

249
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,266
What is this?

250
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,559
It's what you asked for the other day.

251
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,022
Why does he look so familiar?

252
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,405
Make sure you behave out there.

253
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,370
-How may I help you?
-Me?

254
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,247
-I'm an attorney.
-Sorry?

255
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,711
Just believe what I say, you bastard.

256
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,238
Why is an attorney suddenly here?

257
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,450
I don't need one.

258
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,040
How is it behind bars?

259
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:15,959
No.

260
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,046
I don't know you.

261
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,718
I killed

262
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,346
all the pretty girls.

263
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,729
Before leaving,

264
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,734
I came here to set you free.

265
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,278
I can't abandon you as well.

266
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,199
No.

267
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,494
I like this place.

268
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,586
I need to stay here
so I won't kill anymore.

269
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,090
What's the point of living like this?

270
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,304
See you in hell, Wong.

271
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,031
Look at you.

272
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,452
And Wong? Did you send him off well?

273
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,206
You abandoned him.

274
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,875
So why are you suddenly interested?

275
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,297
Everything is going as planned.

276
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,466
What's the problem?

277
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,509
Problem?

278
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,803
What problem?

279
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,100
There's no problem.

280
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,021
You have your path, and I have mine.

281
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,193
You should've expected this much
when you left me behind

282
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,696
and fled with Ma Ju-seok.

283
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,218
Do you really think

284
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,013
that I left you?

285
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,724
You had never planned to fight.

286
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,978
That's why you threw me at them as bait
and saved Ma Ju-seok instead.

287
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:40,896
Right?

288
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,025
No, I gave you a chance to help me.

289
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,402
You're safe and sound, aren't you?

290
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,996
Stop pretending to be laid-back.

291
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,041
I know you're scared.

292
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,628
"Hwang Pil-gwang was the one
who killed your wife and baby."

293
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,715
"After he takes advantage of you,
he's going to throw you away as well."

294
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,927
If I said this to Ma Ju-seok…

295
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,018
there would be no way for you

296
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,940
to beat So Mun by yourself.

297
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,500
We still have so much…

298
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,462
we need to do.

299
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,307
Then who are we actually saving?

300
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,268
What in the world…

301
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,522
are we doing?

302
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,113
Ha-na!

303
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,239
Hey.

304
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,910
Are you all right? How are you feeling?

305
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,161
I'm all right.

306
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,707
I'm sorry that I failed
to do my job properly.

307
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,461
Don't say that. I wasn't the only one
who was sent flying.

308
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,422
You were, too. So don't be sorry.

309
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,840
Goodness.

310
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,509
Are you finally awake?

311
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,718
Are you okay?

312
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,678
You should still be resting.

313
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,432
-Did I wake you up?
-Goodness, you're okay.

314
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,438
You're only awake because it's you.
Others would've still been unconscious.

315
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,190
I'm all better now.

316
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,444
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

317
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,781
Don't say that.
I wasn't the only one who suffered.

318
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,909
You suffered more than I did.
So don't be sorry.

319
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,247
Goodness!

320
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,960
Look at this! My hunches are never wrong.

321
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,255
I knew you'd all be awake by now.

322
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,590
Come here.

323
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,968
Let's eat some good food.

324
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,220
Call Jeok-bong too.

325
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,638
-Okay.
-Jeok-bong!

326
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,432
Nice timing. Come on out.

327
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,642
Where's Jeok-bong?

328
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,103
JUNGJIN SECTOR 3 APARTMENT
SLATED FOR CONSTRUCTION

329
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,605
An apartment complex
in Jungjin Sector Three?

330
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,822
Why, hello. You're a resident here, right?

331
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,117
You look familiar. Sir.

332
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,995
Those darn scammers.

333
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,875
CENTRAL FIGURE

334
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,126
I see.

335
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,961
-So you want to sign up?
-This way.

336
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,213
JUNGJIN SECTOR 3 PREMIUM APARTMENTS
5,000 UNITS

337
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,675
As for the payments, the first is
30 million won, second is 34 million,

338
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,385
and third is 70 million.

339
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,344
In addition…

340
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,098
-Yes.
-Jeok-bong.

341
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,559
You can come out now.

342
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,103
-Okay.
-Wait.

343
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,813
-Mr. 200 cows?
-What?

344
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,731
-Am I right?
-I…

345
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,983
I like your suit. Have some coffee.

346
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,444
-But I--
-It's okay.

347
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,945
Sit down. Be careful.

348
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,617
I heard many young farmers
were successful nowadays, and look at you.

349
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,619
Running a big business at a young age.

350
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:51,539
I wouldn't exactly call it a business.

351
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,794
I should own an apartment unit
if I want to get married.

352
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,004
How did you know we have only one left?

353
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:00,924
Only one?

354
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,426
Do you want two units?

355
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,511
I'm just kidding.

356
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,221
Mr. Lim,

357
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,432
which unit is left again?

358
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,143
In Building G,
Unit 708 on the royal floor, right?

359
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,770
-Bring it to me.
-Okay.

360
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,729
Listen carefully.

361
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,856
The building and units are at random.

362
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,027
But if you sign up today,
I'll let you pick one.

363
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,281
But another group
is coming later to sign up.

364
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,366
Tell them to wait.

365
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:27,992
One minute.

366
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,746
This is the layout. Type 84. Here you go.

367
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,209
Hello, ma'am.
Yes, we still have some left.

368
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,378
You can pick one first.

369
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,630
She can pick one first? No.

370
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,259
Then can I discuss this
with my father first?

371
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,511
-I can't guarantee…
-You're insane.

372
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,263
-…that it won't be sold out.
-Hey.

373
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,139
Many people are calling, Jae-youl.

374
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,850
What should we do?

375
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,769
Why don't you sign up today
and pay the down payment?

376
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,230
How much would that be?

377
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,482
-Jae-youl, bring it.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,067
Take a look at the floor plan.

379
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,236
-Can I trust this?
-Of course.

380
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,489
-Jeok-bong, get out of there!
-I don't have a fixed income…

381
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,493
You little punk.
You should only do what you've been told.

382
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,913
How could you
let them play you, you idiot?

383
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,332
A PERFECT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY

384
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,884
If Ma Ju-seok continues
his pursuit of revenge like Mun said,

385
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,637
that means he wants to punish
everyone related to the scam.

386
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,393
They're probably
after President Lee Chung-jae.

387
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,605
Mr. Hwang and his crew know
that Lee Chung-jae is still alive.

388
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,482
Plus, Lee took the 120 billion won.

389
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,320
Just like how Mr. Hwang did with Mr. Park,

390
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,489
he'll urge Mr. Ma
to kill Lee Chung-jae as well.

391
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,659
That's why we need to find Lee first.

392
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:57,457
The lead we have on him is Lim Jae-youl,
number 37 of the Red Roses Gang.

393
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,044
I looked into him and--

394
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,379
I was the one who did all the work.

395
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,966
I was the one who saved
your family from going broke.

396
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,597
Anyway, look at this.

397
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,557
This person.

398
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,351
Let me talk with him first.

399
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,395
Goodness. I'm glad you're here.

400
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,274
The head of the local housing association
is working with Lee Chung-jae.

401
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,319
When Hano Planning committed
housing fraud four years ago,

402
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,488
he was the one in charge of the funds.

403
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,532
It's the same guy.

404
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,745
As the association's head,
he should represent the people.

405
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,374
How could he side with Lee Chung-jae?

406
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,086
He provided Lee with money
they received from the allotments.

407
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,172
From land purchasing
and promotion fees to broker's fees,

408
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,425
the poor victims just spent
all of their money.

409
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,510
What is this?

410
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:54,639
Stealing 120 billion wasn't enough,
so they're scamming people again?

411
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,933
Those disgusting money-grubbers.

412
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,602
Why aren't they behind bars already?

413
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,731
They haven't scammed anyone yet,
so the police won't investigate.

414
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,400
She's right.

415
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,945
In any case, our top priority as of now
is locating Lee Chung-jae.

416
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:13,116
We must find out if any of his men
know about his whereabouts by reading

417
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,535
-their memories--
-And to stop the scam too.

418
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,204
Mr. Ma… No.

419
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,580
Ma Ju-seok was the same.

420
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,960
He was an ordinary man
who lost all his money in a housing scam.

421
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,795
He then lost his wife and baby.

422
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,339
And in the end, he became an evil spirit.

423
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,886
We don't know
how such a kindhearted man became one.

424
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,014
But I know one thing for sure.

425
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,934
We shouldn't let those scammers
victimize more people like him.

426
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,646
This is just as important

427
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,648
as catching Lee Chung-jae.

428
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,817
We found the answer.

429
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,611
Okay. Let's do that.

430
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,990
Let's stop them

431
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,658
and prevent any future victims.

432
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,535
Let's go.

433
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,204
Hold on.

434
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:06,002
Will the Yung people reprimand us
for interfering with human society?

435
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,003
Jeez.

436
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,964
Jeok-bong.

437
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,882
Yes?

438
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,887
Didn't you say

439
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,058
that you smelled something
back at the office?

440
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,517
I did?

441
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,853
No, I never--

442
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,937
Jeok-bong.

443
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,816
I believe you said that.

444
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:33,571
Right. You're right.

445
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,740
-I smelled dung.
-Right?

446
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,575
Yes! The stinky evil spirits smell.

447
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,036
-Was it bad?
-It reeked!

448
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:40,953
Oh, dear!

449
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,081
-That's bad.
-Did you hear that?

450
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,415
We're on our way then.

451
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,084
Let's go.

452
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,216
Seo-a.

453
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,011
Here.

454
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,933
-I said I quit playing the piano.
-Please don't give up.

455
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,937
-Don't worry about the fee for now, so--
-Mr. Park.

456
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,980
-Ma'am, we must hurry.
-I'm done for good.

457
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,190
You're the last one.

458
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,443
Not just anyone can win
the national competition.

459
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,736
We've got great units.

460
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,613
You must hurry before they run out.

461
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,698
Will everyone be there?

462
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,034
The owner of the sewing factory
is there too.

463
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,452
Can you believe that?

464
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,870
You should go.

465
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,124
My mom and I need to go to the fair soon.

466
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,042
We need to vacate the house too.

467
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,085
The fair?

468
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,338
What kind of fair?

469
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,882
BADMINTON CLUB

470
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,384
FREE GIFT EVENT

471
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,848
Recording is forbidden
so give me your phones.

472
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,599
Thank you.

473
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,059
Put it in, please.

474
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,854
Come this way.

475
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,858
Jae-youl, why aren't you done yet?

476
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,318
We're running out of time.
Get them all seated.

477
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,987
-I'll do that.
-Okay.

478
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,239
All right. Close the door.

479
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,074
Show this old gentleman his seat.

480
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,464
It's over here.

481
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,758
Hurry up.

482
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,010
This way.

483
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,638
JUNGJIN SECTOR 3 ASSOCIATION OFFICE

484
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,142
It's locked.

485
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,352
Where is everyone?

486
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,771
Hey!

487
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,857
Who are you guys?

488
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,235
Make way.

489
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,486
-Okay.
-Get out of the way.

490
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,280
We're here because…

491
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,827
Oh, my.

492
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,622
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

493
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,457
Where is everyone?

494
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,627
There were a bunch of them earlier today.

495
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,295
The indoor badminton court nearby.

496
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,131
-Let's go.
-How dare you break down the door?

497
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,925
We're done distributing the units.

498
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,760
You can go. I'll take care of them.

499
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,970
-I'll leave you to it.
-Go back to bed.

500
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,888
Who are you?

501
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,309
Bring it on.

502
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,854
Those who own a house or a patch of land

503
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,981
should sign the sales agreement right now.

504
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,608
Those who own neither can sign

505
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,152
a memorandum saying
you'll move out in three days.

506
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,529
Where are we supposed to go
on such short notice?

507
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,739
Be quiet.

508
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,366
-It's my house.
-Shut up!

509
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,618
How could you do this to us?

510
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,119
-Enough.
-Be quiet.

511
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,288
We're doing this for your sake!

512
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,539
All right.

513
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,874
Everyone.

514
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,378
They'll demolish this area
and build an apartment complex.

515
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,297
You should cooperate
if you want to save up a bit more.

516
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,342
Trust me and stamp those papers, okay?

517
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,929
I've been living here
for nearly three decades.

518
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,764
So where can I possibly go?

519
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,723
Sit down.

520
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,102
Just wait.

521
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,065
Block the back door!

522
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,403
Hey!

523
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,407
Be quiet.

524
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,993
Hey!

525
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,870
Why is it so noisy in here?
Can't we work out today?

526
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,623
No, you can't play here today.

527
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,375
Didn't you lock the door?

528
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,004
What the hell
are you losers doing in here?

529
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,338
Answer me.

530
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,383
Jeok-bong, record their faces.

531
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,886
Okay, look here.

532
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,180
-Come on.
-Look here.

533
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,518
Who are you?
Who are you to take photos of us?

534
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,729
Who are you to do this?

535
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,565
They don't want this.

536
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,027
Who do you think you are
to take their homes from them?

537
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,655
What a load of shit.
We're not taking them for free.

538
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,950
We agreed to compensate them.
Do you still not get it?

539
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,413
Do you work out or something? Hold on.

540
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,708
Stay back!

541
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,671
Hold on! That hurts!

542
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,964
Do you think…

543
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,676
you can take the houses
if they're old and shabby?

544
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,845
For some, it's their entire life.

545
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,307
To provide a home
to live in with their family,

546
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,393
they worked tirelessly their entire lives.

547
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,104
You have no right
to take it from them, got that?

548
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,023
Ms. Chu.

549
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,526
Everyone, please come this way.

550
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,534
Come here! Hey!

551
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,292
Are you going to just watch?

552
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,627
-Get them!
-Go!

553
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,133
Gosh, was that a wind blast?

554
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,718
That was a wind blast.

555
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,100
We can't reason with you scumbags.

556
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,095
It's okay.

557
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,346
You can just relax.

558
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,848
Sit down and relax.

559
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,395
All right.

560
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,149
Let me make this clear.
I didn't hit you guys.

561
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,068
You're the ones who hit yourselves.

562
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,778
Got it? Okay.

563
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,576
Now, from the left.

564
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,082
What the hell are
they doing to each other?

565
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,752
Now, you'll hit…

566
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,505
your stomachs!

567
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,180
I wasn't aiming there.

568
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,848
But since you've already done it…

569
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,229
All right.

570
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,814
That's good enough.

571
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,274
-No.
-I forgot about you guys.

572
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,275
It's okay.

573
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,736
It'll be fun. You won't remember it.

574
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,533
Gosh.

575
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,619
They're dancing.

576
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,664
It's okay.

577
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,792
That little punk.

578
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,841
Hey!

579
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,510
You little…

580
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:56,889
You…

581
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,939
With our video
and the witnesses' testimonies,

582
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,442
you can charge them
with confinement and blackmail, right?

583
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,777
Yes, sure thing.

584
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,322
By the way, Mun,
you should've been gentler.

585
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,365
You're right.

586
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,284
I think Mun is having trouble
controlling his power lately.

587
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,827
We all took part…

588
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,122
Ms. Chu, we all agreed on…

589
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,833
I'm sorry.

590
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,002
It's okay. That's fine.

591
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,171
-There?
-Yes.

592
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,673
It sounded fishy.

593
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,763
They have no memory of Lee Chung-jae.

594
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,974
But we saved all the residents.

595
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,767
Everyone, let's not get discouraged.

596
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,519
Okay.

597
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,063
Who is that?

598
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,193
-Ha-na.
-Ha-na?

599
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,822
Isn't he the claw machine guy?

600
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,534
-What claw machine?
-Be quiet, Jeok-bong.

601
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,327
What?

602
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,997
Look at that.

603
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,998
Are you two…

604
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,833
Welcome!

605
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,211
GINKGO TREE CHICKEN SOUP

606
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,921
Here. Eat up.

607
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,006
Thank you.

608
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,221
By the way, about your father…

609
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,348
What does he do?

610
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,184
Come on. Don't be so old-fashioned.

611
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,102
Please understand.

612
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,606
This is the first time
Ha-na introduced a guy to us.

613
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,565
It's not like that.

614
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,066
Sure, whatever you say.

615
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,318
This is tasty.

616
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,321
Thank you.

617
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:42,036
May I ask
what your relationship with Ha-na is?

618
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,667
We're her…

619
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,377
family.

620
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,879
We're her family.

621
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,840
Family.

622
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,175
-We're family.
-Of course.

623
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,302
We're the epitome of a family.

624
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,846
Right? We're family.

625
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,306
We're family.

626
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,933
-Family.
-Yes.

627
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,685
Drink up.

628
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,066
Speaking of which, what do you…

629
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,071
-What do you like so much about her?
-Goodness!

630
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,073
Come on.

631
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,576
First, she's kind.

632
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,913
She is.

633
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,915
Ha-na is kind. Of course.

634
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,124
What else?

635
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,125
And…

636
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,961
-she's warmhearted.
-Warmhearted!

637
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,006
-Gosh.
-Come on.

638
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,342
-Do-hwi, let's go.
-No.

639
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,719
Fine, we'll stop. All right.

640
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,222
We're just playing around.

641
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,766
Forget it.

642
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,268
-What?
-I'll leave instead.

643
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,688
Ha-na,

644
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,523
don't feel sorry for me.

645
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,440
Me?

646
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,944
You don't need to avoid him because of me.

647
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,321
-Mun.
-Yes?

648
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,489
Don't stop me.

649
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,158
-I said, don't stop me!
-I didn't.

650
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,954
I need some time.

651
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,998
Are you crying?

652
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,335
-What's wrong with him?
-Am I supposed to stop him?

653
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,378
Did I do something?

654
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,133
He left because he's full.

655
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,134
He's just full.

656
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,302
Eat up.

657
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,805
You were handsome then and still are.

658
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,765
Have some food too.

659
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,856
He's throwing up. He seems pretty drunk.

660
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,900
He must've felt uncomfortable
while eating.

661
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,153
Why did you make him drink so much?

662
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,737
You're not Ha-na's dad.

663
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,281
It wasn't my fault.

664
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,575
Mo-tak was the one who spewed nonsense.

665
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,868
Come on.

666
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,077
Honey.

667
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,121
No, let me explain.

668
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,664
This is all Jeok-bong's fault.

669
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,291
He was eating just fine

670
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,419
but then decided
to get all melodramatic for no reason.

671
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,587
Where is he by the way?

672
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,298
What should we do?
Should we take him to the hospital?

673
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,299
I'll go then.

674
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,717
Hey.

675
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,635
-What is it?
-Wait.

676
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,804
Ha-na, you should wait for him.

677
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,931
-We'll go first.
-I'll stay with her.

678
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,766
-Come on!
-No!

679
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,226
-Just go!
-No!

680
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,603
Good luck!

681
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,647
-Go!
-Where are you guys going?

682
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,782
Come on!

683
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,955
I feel better
after getting some fresh air.

684
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,125
You sure you don't need any more medicine?

685
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,002
I'm good.

686
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,880
I rarely get indigestion.

687
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,965
As you already know,

688
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,009
I'm pretty healthy.

689
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,597
You still have the same jokes.

690
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,603
I reached out to you many times.

691
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,855
Right.

692
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,151
I've been quite busy lately.

693
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,903
I see.

694
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,325
Tell me about it next time.

695
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,120
I'm curious about what you do as well.

696
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,542
But of course,
only tell me if you feel like it.

697
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,377
No pressure.

698
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,003
Just tell me…

699
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,498
You're hiccupping now.

700
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,624
Are you really okay?

701
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,209
I'm fine.

702
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,170
Pinch your nose.

703
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,464
-What?
-Pinch your nose.

704
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,382
Okay.

705
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,175
Then stick your tongue out.

706
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,220
Just trust me on this.

707
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,263
Hold your breath.

708
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,563
Look.

709
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,232
I know it's funny but look at you.

710
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,567
-It stopped, right?
-What?

711
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,777
Right? It really works.

712
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,738
-You're right.
-I told you.

713
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,657
-I can't believe it.
-It looks a bit silly, right?

714
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,161
Look. Can you make time for me tomorrow?

715
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,622
Tomorrow?

716
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,333
Sure.

717
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,546
What?

718
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,797
This is annoying.

719
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,466
-Is it your turn now?
-Hold on.

720
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,595
-Follow me. Pinch your nose.
-I got it from you.

721
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,639
Then do this. Pinch your nose.

722
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,223
-Pinch my nose.
-Spread your arm.

723
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,308
-Okay.
-Like this.

724
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,019
-You've got to be kidding me.
-Is this right?

725
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,357
Must be nice since you're not alone.

726
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,401
You were teasing me, right?

727
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,987
No, the inner ear…

728
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,078
Su-ho.

729
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,915
Yes, Mom.

730
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,337
How long have I been a Counter for?

731
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,260
It's already been over nine years.

732
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,974
You're thinking about him, aren't you?

733
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,645
Hey!

734
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,772
You little…

735
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,029
Is it weighing on your mind a lot?

736
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,282
I truly believed…

737
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,911
that he'd grow up into a great man.

738
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,082
When I first saw him…

739
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,461
You should run!

740
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,379
Hurry!

741
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,006
He reminded me of you.

742
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,302
The smile he showed me that day

743
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,807
helped me get back on my feet
whenever I was struggling.

744
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,439
It's not too late.

745
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:27,941
He still has

746
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,193
a long life ahead of him.

747
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,661
So…

748
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:44,332
I spent all that money
on the office and the banners,

749
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,960
and I got nothing in return.

750
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,421
I'm sorry, sir.

751
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,633
Hwang Pil-gwang made 120 billion won.

752
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,303
But I couldn't even make a single penny…

753
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,390
Am I wrong?

754
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:05,228
Since I have his money,
does that mean I'm better than him?

755
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,025
-Hey, come here.
-Yes, sir.

756
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,111
Just die, you idiot.

757
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,491
-Sir.
-What?

758
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,119
All of your men got caught, except one.

759
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,373
What? I didn't know we had
such a competent man. Who is he?

760
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,375
His name is Lim Jae-youl.

761
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,337
He ran errands for you from time to time.

762
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,340
You mean that guy
that the cops were tailing?

763
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,466
Yes, sir.

764
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,843
A cop named Ga Mo-tak
arrested all our men.

765
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,887
I heard he was after Jae-youl before.

766
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,641
Maybe Jae-youl colluded with him.

767
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,477
How dare he join hands with a cop?

768
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,064
Then we should get rid of him.

769
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,399
Scumbags like him

770
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,986
should be killed off, right?

771
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,333
Why do you live like this?

772
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,046
Are you talking to me?

773
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,050
Don't litter, you scumbag.

774
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,847
Aren't you from the badminton court?

775
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:30,856
How could you of all people
join a gang and hurt others?

776
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,399
You little scumbag.

777
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,318
What are you saying? Are you insane?

778
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,028
Follow me.

779
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,281
Let me go.

780
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,000
It's getting cold. Dig in.

781
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,794
Jeez.

782
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,256
Hey lady, who are you?

783
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,717
A former cop?

784
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,012
Why are you doing this to me?

785
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:02,929
Wait. Are you

786
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,806
in love with me?

787
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,855
I have my preferences, you know.

788
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,566
Eat if you want to go home.

789
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,443
I'll let you go once you finish it.

790
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,196
You won't cause trouble if you're full.

791
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,115
But why do I have to eat with--

792
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,479
Have some meat too.

793
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,826
GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY, LEE CHUNG-JAE.
CRIMINAL COMPANY

794
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,415
He's alive.

795
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,794
The one who opened the gates of hell…

796
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,339
President Lee Chung-jae of Baekdu.

797
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,259
We denounce
Baekdu Planning & Construction!

798
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,220
-We denounce it!
-We denounce it!

799
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,472
President Lee Chung-jae
of Baekdu should take

800
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,473
TWO YEARS AGO

801
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,684
responsibility and compensate his victims.

802
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,018
-Compensate!
-Compensate!

803
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,441
Damn it. What was that?

804
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,028
Damn it. Don't touch me.

805
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,446
Jeez.

806
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,949
Let's go.

807
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,954
Damn it. They don't know
how much this cost.

808
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,001
Don't laugh.

809
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,919
Don't let them see you laugh--

810
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,505
Damn it.

811
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,007
I'm sick of this.

812
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,842
Hey, just go.

813
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,844
It's okay. It's all right.

814
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,887
Jeez.

815
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,890
Sir.

816
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,559
Move, lady.

817
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,061
-Move.
-Please give us back our money.

818
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,689
My husband risked his life to earn it.

819
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:18,982
I'm begging you.

820
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,443
-Lady, come on. Enough.
-Please, sir.

821
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,485
Damn it!

822
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,570
Seong-uk.

823
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,947
Don't be so harsh on her. Come on.

824
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:27,991
Bring me my umbrella.

825
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,326
Please. I beg you.

826
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,871
-That's all the money we have.
-All right.

827
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,206
-Hey, lady.
-I beg you.

828
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,000
Goodness. Hey, lady.

829
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,838
What are you doing out in the rain?

830
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,339
You're getting drenched.

831
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,300
Goodness.

832
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,384
What are you doing?

833
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,386
You're getting wet.

834
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,096
It's…

835
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,557
It's raining?

836
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,558
Yes.

837
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,688
There it is.

838
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,028
Hey.

839
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,157
Did I ever force you
to give me your money?

840
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,535
You were the ones who frantically came
to us with your money.

841
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,373
Here.

842
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,209
Take this.

843
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,961
For your husband's life.

844
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,714
Happy?

845
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,176
Hey, hold the umbrella up properly!

846
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,053
You're getting drenched!

847
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,554
You assholes!

848
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,933
What the hell are you doing to her?

849
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,559
Min-ji, are you okay?

850
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,436
Damn it.

851
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,730
Do you have a death wish?

852
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,317
That's enough. Let's go.

853
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,028
-Jeez.
-Jeez.

854
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,635
Min-ji.

855
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,888
Are you okay?

856
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,057
Ju-seok.

857
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,686
Is it raining?

858
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,230
What?

859
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:29,988
It's okay.

860
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,824
It's okay, Min-ji.

861
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,076
It's okay.

862
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,797
President Lee Chung-jae of Baekdu

863
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,925
is still breathing the same air as you.

864
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,429
You and your wife's hard-earned money

865
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,766
is part of the 120 billion won
that he stole.

866
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,809
Don't lie.

867
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,396
That bastard…

868
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,274
is definitely dead.

869
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,776
Check for yourself then.

870
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,695
Find out who's lying.

871
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,949
Them or me.

872
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,293
Why are you being so kind to me?

873
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,961
-At least, tell me why.
-Go home.

874
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,922
-See you next time.
-Next time?

875
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,009
-Have you truly gone insane?
-Just go to bed.

876
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,180
She's crazy.

877
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,723
Jeez.

878
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,784
Did you have a good meal?

879
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:58,910
You startled me!

880
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,620
How did you know…

881
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,458
Did you recognize him too?

882
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,961
How could I forget him?

883
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,549
He was the first victim that you saved.

884
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,469
Jeez, he had it rough growing up.

885
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:20,139
He was raised by his grandmother.
He quit school after she passed away.

886
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,685
He worked part-time and got his GED.

887
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:28,356
But then he got into an assault case
and ended up in juvie.

888
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,987
Is that when things went awry?

889
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,162
Excuse me.

890
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,169
No, let's just go.

891
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,754
I was distracted. Let's go.

892
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,256
No, that's not why.

893
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,593
There was a rose tattoo on his neck.

894
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,018
What a strange day today was.

895
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,647
Why are you here?

896
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,774
I hear cops are tailing you.

897
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,360
How much did you tell them?

898
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,446
What do you mean?

899
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,282
I told you that I lost them.

900
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,367
You lost them?

901
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,793
You threw away your last chance.

902
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:39,927
Are you okay?

903
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,515
Did you just kick me, lady?
Have you gone insane?

904
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,898
-Are you all right?
-Nice.

905
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,956
PIL-WON

906
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,838
Where the hell are you?

907
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,216
Check this out.

908
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,552
Why haven't you been picking up?

909
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,595
How did it go?

910
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,431
Nice shot, sir.

911
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,474
Golf?

912
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:27,809
He's playing golf.

913
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,144
Keep listening.

914
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,064
-How did it go?
-Hey, answer me.

915
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,358
President Lee is asking.

916
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,361
By "president,"

917
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,613
he meant Lee Chung-jae.

918
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,575
Rumor has it that he's an avid golfer.

919
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,286
If he knew that the police
were tailing Jae-youl,

920
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,080
he may have wanted Jae-youl dead.

921
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,206
It makes sense.

922
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,209
That bastard is playing golf
amid everything.

923
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,252
Mun.

924
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,338
-That's not what's important right now.
-What?

925
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:02,176
So have you located the place?

926
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,139
What? Well, you see…

927
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,893
Since I didn't reply back to him,
he just hung up.

928
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,729
Jeez. Come on.

929
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,939
"Jungjin Century Club."

930
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,191
"Jungjin Sunshine Hills."

931
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,443
There's one more.

932
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,736
"Jungjin CC"?

933
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,113
Wait.

934
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,324
What is it?

935
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,535
-Did it set foot?
-Yes.

936
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,621
-It's Ma Ju-seok.
-What?

937
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,879
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

938
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:40,423
Honey, I'm heading home now.

939
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,885
Our daughter must be excited to have
so many tasty dishes today.

940
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,345
Okay, see you later.

941
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,055
Bye.

942
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,199
CHOI SEONG-HUN

943
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,618
DEATH CERTIFICATE
LEE CHUNG-JAE

944
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,077
CHOI SEONG-HUN

945
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,331
He said that'd be enough money
to start a clinic of your own.

946
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,041
This is where my job ends.

947
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,876
Lee Chung-jae is a dead man.

948
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:18,961
Lee Chung-jae.

949
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,841
You were alive after all.

950
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,638
Help me.

951
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,097
Help me.

952
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:31,891
Help me.

953
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,019
Help me.

954
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,189
Hey!

955
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,273
Hey, wake up.

956
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,942
Sir.

957
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,109
Help me.

958
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,196
Please don't kill me.

959
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,615
You should've checked with your own eyes.

960
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,575
You should have checked

961
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,661
with your own eyes!

962
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,044
Mun.

963
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,340
This man

964
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,176
performed Lee Chung-jae's autopsy.

965
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,348
We were right. Lee Chung-jae
was Ma Ju-seok's next target.

966
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,854
Jeok-bong can't smell him
around the hospital anymore.

967
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,689
We lost him.

968
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:20,857
Ma Ju-seok.

969
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,276
He's becoming more vicious.

970
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,362
If he kills Lee Chung-jae as well…

971
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:29,615
We need to locate Lee Chung-jae
before he does.

972
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,450
We have to find him.

973
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,887
PARK DO-HWI:
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY? I'M HERE!

974
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,193
Ha-na!

975
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:17,788
Gosh.

976
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:21,834
It's been a long time.

977
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:25,838
This feels surreal.

978
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,132
Nothing here has changed.

979
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:31,636
You're right.

980
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:35,222
What?

981
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,728
These stairs…

982
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,606
Do you remember cleaning them?

983
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,399
You were late,

984
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,401
so our PE teacher made you clean them.

985
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,570
You're right. I did.

986
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,988
These…

987
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,115
You were cleaning them with me.

988
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:57,787
The piano room is up there.

989
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,581
I saw that you got caught,
so I let him catch me too.

990
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,166
I wanted to do it with you.

991
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:06,671
After that day,
I waited in front of my house

992
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,548
for ten minutes before coming to school,

993
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,175
so I'd be late too.

994
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:15,388
Me too.

995
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,391
What?

996
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,893
I did the same thing.

997
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,398
I purposely came here late
since we cleaned the stairs together.

998
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,109
Ha-na, does that mean…

999
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,528
Are you saying that…

1000
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:35,282
We've made many memories, haven't we?

1001
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,576
You're right.

1002
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,828
I'm glad we came here.

1003
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,623
You think the tteokbokki place
across the street still exists?

1004
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:43,958
Let's go there next time.

1005
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,964
Let's not, Do-hwi.

1006
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,216
Do you not like tteokbokki?

1007
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,970
Something else then?
I've been researching good restaurants--

1008
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:56,929
No.

1009
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,516
Let's end it here.

1010
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,811
Our memories…

1011
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:07,982
began here.

1012
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,234
So let's…

1013
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,739
end it here as well, Do-hwi.

1014
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,784
Did I do something wrong?

1015
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,205
Did these flowers remind you
of when you were sick?

1016
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:27,334
I'm sorry. I was reluctant at first, but…

1017
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,669
Do-hwi.

1018
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,589
It was nice seeing you.

1019
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,258
Ha-na.

1020
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,981
Are you alone today?

1021
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,194
And I doubt he'll be of any help.

1022
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,904
What are you…

1023
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,740
I'm the one you want.

1024
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,492
Let him go.

1025
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:04,330
He's so noisy. What do you say?

1026
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,998
Should we get rid of him first?

1027
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:07,833
No!

1028
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:14,840
Yes.

1029
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,634
You should come to his rescue.

1030
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,901
Listen to me and just give up.

1031
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,694
Okay?

1032
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,821
Who knows?

1033
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,407
I might be in a good mood
after consuming your soul.

1034
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:44,036
And I might let him go.

1035
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,859
How does it feel?

1036
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,945
Doesn't losing your vision feel like shit?

1037
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:25,494
You can do it.

1038
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,997
Just like you did before…

1039
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,378
feel her movements.

1040
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,849
Ha-na, run!

1041
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,018
No!

1042
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:07,286
You shouldn't have closed your eyes!

1043
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,469
Do-hwi.

1044
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,599
Run.

1045
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,100
Do-hwi.

1046
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,576
Just you wait.

1047
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,162
It's my turn now.

1048
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:35,499
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

1049
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,837
Isn't it a good thing
that he and Gelly are fighting?

1050
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,088
Ha-na!

1051
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,840
Please save Do-hwi!

1052
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:44,550
It's unlike me

1053
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:48,012
to let go of an evil spirit.

1054
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:48,929
Don't tell me you…

1055
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,222
Did Lim Jae-youl

1056
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,850
hand you over to them?

1057
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:57,271
I'm smelling something near the hotels!
Never smelled this intense smell before!

1058
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:00,983
I want to know how to get rid of them.

1059
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,568
So you've come all this way.

1060
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:06,864
I'm going to put an end to you
and that bastard Hwang Pil-gwang today.

1061
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:14,580
