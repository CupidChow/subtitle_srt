1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,727
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,978
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,212
What will you do now?

4
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,673
I've become even stronger,

5
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,010
and it's now time for you to give up.

6
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,934
Says who?

7
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,651
Says who?

8
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,739
Who the hell says
it's time for me to give up?

9
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,195
Mun.

10
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,866
Let's get that asshole first.

11
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,901
We were both doomed to be alone
with no family.

12
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,069
Do we have to finish each other off?

13
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,155
Don't you dare compare me to you!

14
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,061
Damn it.

15
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,907
We've known each other
for seven awful years.

16
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,577
It's time to put this behind us,
you asshole.

17
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,727
Mun!

18
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,188
-Mun!
-No!

19
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,155
Ms. Chu...

20
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,115
Ms. Chu.

21
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,825
Ms. Chu.

22
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,201
Ms. Chu!

23
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,244
Old man.

24
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,287
Ms. Chu.

25
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,664
-Please keep her safe. Mun.
-Yes?

26
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,873
-Ms. Chu.
-Ha-na needs us.

27
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,168
I'm fine.

28
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,586
-I'm okay.
-Are you?

29
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,187
You're still breathing?

30
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,872
I'm summoning…

31
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,249
this evil spirit.

32
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,390
EPISODE 15

33
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,391
I'm sorry.

34
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,976
It's my fault. The staffs…

35
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,603
I'm sorry.

36
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,106
I know

37
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,942
you did your best, given the situation.

38
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,821
It's a shame that the staffs are broken,

39
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,490
but even after the barrier disappeared,

40
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,284
we put up a good fight against Shin.

41
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,995
If we work as a team

42
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,788
and stay as a team,

43
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,040
we can catch him.

44
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,168
We can do this.

45
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,420
You're right.

46
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,464
Ha-na had Baek Hyang-hui summoned,

47
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,216
so we only have Shin Myeong-hwi left.

48
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,968
That's right.

49
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,512
All that's left is the biggest asshole.

50
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,475
And Mun's getting better
at using his abilities.

51
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,478
Summoning our territory
is a piece of cake now.

52
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,897
The rocks.
You all saw him lift them up, right?

53
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,107
This kid has no limits.

54
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,610
Sounds as if his power is yours.

55
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,780
You always point these things out.

56
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,115
But, still, be careful.

57
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,993
It won't be easy
to go up against pure evil.

58
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,414
We have five days left.

59
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,585
Before these souls
held captive by the evil spirit perish,

60
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,629
we must get this done.

61
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,173
Yes, of course.

62
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,051
We'll make Shin pay for his crimes,

63
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,220
get Mo-tak's revenge,

64
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,556
then summon the evil spirit
to save Cheol-jung.

65
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,810
And Mun should get to see his parents too.

66
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,944
Meeting's over. Good work.

67
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:48,903
Let's go.

68
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,782
-Follow me.
-What?

69
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,991
-Come on.
-Why?

70
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,785
-Mom.
-Yes?

71
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,037
Are you all right after that attack?

72
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,414
I'm totally fine. I was barely injured.

73
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,512
You don't need to worry about me.
Just go on home.

74
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,472
Goodness, great work today.

75
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,599
Get plenty of rest so you don't get sick.

76
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,809
You get some rest too.

77
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,312
The old man got home safely too.

78
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,523
It must've taken its toll on him,

79
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,858
being out in the field
for the first time in ages.

80
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,735
Yes.

81
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,989
Mun.

82
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,284
You might feel a lot of pressure

83
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,453
as you continue to find
all kinds of powers you didn't have.

84
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,499
And because you want
to rescue your parents quickly,

85
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,709
you might feel rushed.

86
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,006
But this isn't just your fight.

87
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,175
It's also a task…

88
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,637
for all of us as Counters.

89
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,931
So…

90
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,434
don't put all the pressure on yourself.

91
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,270
Okay.

92
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,816
Come to the training room
by six in the morning tomorrow.

93
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,401
Okay.

94
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:11,986
What?

95
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,864
Hasn't it been a while?

96
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,367
That makes no sense.

97
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,704
Why in the world would I turn myself in

98
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,706
when I should be fleeing abroad?

99
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,583
I didn't say you turned yourself in.

100
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,835
You were sleeping in front of the station.

101
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,380
Yes, so why would a fugitive
be sleeping in front of a police station?

102
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,010
I don't remember.
I have no recollection at all.

103
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,055
Well, in any case,
you're back where you belong.

104
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,598
That's what matters.

105
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,142
Hey, wait.

106
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,187
Then what happened to my face?
Who did this?

107
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,316
-Hey! Something is seriously wrong!
-Hey!

108
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,489
Be quiet, will you?

109
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,496
Who's this bitch?

110
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,924
Damn you.
I'll step on you and break your neck.

111
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,399
He's getting stronger and stronger.

112
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,609
We need to kill him.

113
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,777
We need to kill him

114
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,362
before he gets even stronger.

115
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,917
Mr. Mayor?

116
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,548
Mr. Mayor, it's you.

117
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,091
Mr. Mayor.

118
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,686
PART-TIME JOBS WITH ACCOMMODATION

119
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,855
RESULTS FOR PART-TIME JOBS
WITH ACCOMMODATION

120
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,282
You know your dad has changed.

121
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,243
You've seen those eyes too.

122
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,886
I can't believe you invited me in.

123
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,888
This is such a huge honor.

124
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,389
Don't mention it.

125
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,599
Let's go inside.

126
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,641
Sure.

127
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,228
This way, please.

128
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,096
EONNI'S NOODLES

129
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,991
I have to move much faster than I do now

130
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,035
if I want to catch him.

131
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,048
Mun.

132
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,467
Ha-na.

133
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,094
Take a seat.

134
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,641
Oh. I'm fine, really.

135
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,402
I saw my family yesterday.

136
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,531
Baek Hyang-hui strangled me yesterday,

137
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,157
and I saw them…

138
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,702
for a split second.

139
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,083
Ha-na. Hey, Ha-na.

140
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,752
Ha-yeong.

141
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,421
Ha-na.

142
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,097
Ha-na.

143
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,892
You have to go back.

144
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,852
Mom.

145
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,520
They're all waiting for you.

146
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,315
Dad.

147
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,325
It might've been a dream.

148
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,752
Normally…

149
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,048
it's tough for me
when I'm reminded of my family.

150
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,217
I hate it.

151
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,640
But…

152
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,851
I guess I missed them.

153
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,063
When I got to see them,

154
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,859
it was great.

155
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,036
I'll help you meet them.

156
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,122
I'll make sure you get to say that thing…

157
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,045
you have to tell your parents.

158
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,488
You know, you used to throw people off
just for brushing up against you.

159
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,491
-What's going on?
-This?

160
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,412
You're doing it again.
Man, I'm sick of this.

161
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,622
What?

162
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:43,877
Love prevails even when people
are in the middle of war. Of course.

163
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,007
Stop trying to play Cupid.
It'll make things awkward. Man.

164
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,466
Why are you suddenly leaving?

165
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,510
To make breakfast! Happy?

166
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,724
We're here to train.

167
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,934
Let's go.

168
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,480
EONNI'S NOODLES

169
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,491
EONNI'S NOODLES

170
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,537
Goodness.

171
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,539
How can you call yourselves a family?

172
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,584
You should check in with each other.

173
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,753
Keep it down.

174
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,047
Who called this old man here?

175
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,842
Ms. Chu, you have to see a doctor.
Why won't you listen to me?

176
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,511
I don't need to see a doctor.
Can't you tell?

177
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,221
I'm just suffering from fatigue.

178
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,557
Stop making a fuss
and get back to business.

179
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,976
Are you sure you're okay, Ms. Chu?

180
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:46,023
You heal us when we get sick,

181
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,816
but when you're sick…

182
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,612
there's nothing we can do for you.

183
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,656
-I need to lie down.
-Okay, go ahead.

184
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,006
-Come here.
-Hey, wait, whoa!

185
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,800
My gosh, hey!

186
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,884
Come here.

187
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,221
Why? What?

188
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,556
Tell us. What else can you do?

189
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,142
You walk, run, and now you can fly.

190
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,605
Wait, did I forget to erase your memories?

191
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,526
I knew it. He's been erasing our memories.

192
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,904
No, I was just mumbling to myself.
Don't take it too seriously.

193
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,448
Forget it. Anything we can do to help?

194
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,743
Oh, anything you can do? No.

195
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,582
It feels like you've been out there doing

196
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,168
something amazing
with these powers you suddenly got.

197
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,255
I can't believe my friend is a hero.
Everything is swell now.

198
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,756
-Get a grip.
-Okay.

199
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,633
So anything we can do to help?

200
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,512
Ask away. We're totally ready.

201
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,195
Level two.

202
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,823
Guys, I'm sorry.

203
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,869
It's a level two.
Near Jungjin Intersection.

204
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,390
Hi.

205
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,310
What do you want?

206
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,730
You're putting on a good act.
Are you an actress?

207
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,607
Which one? The evil spirit or the host?

208
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,791
It's frightening
to have you right behind my back.

209
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,046
Hey, your feet stink through your shoes.

210
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,840
I'm busy, so I'll make it quick.

211
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,434
Sir, are you okay?

212
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,353
You must be in shock.

213
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,104
But just one second, please.

214
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,942
Who's this? Are you a Counter?

215
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,986
Wait, who are… A Count… What?

216
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,154
Hey, Mun.

217
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,365
Hey, Mo-tak!

218
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,285
"Mo-tak"?

219
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,830
"Mo-tak"?

220
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,209
Sorry. I thought I was still in Singapore.

221
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,502
Mr. Ga,

222
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:54,962
sir.

223
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,261
Hey, Jeong-gu! Jeong-gu.

224
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,096
Jeong-gu!

225
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:09,268
Man, Jeong-gu. What's going on?
Why are you here? When did you get back?

226
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,103
You two know each other?

227
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,729
-This guy.
-Jeong-gu!

228
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,899
What are you doing here?

229
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,360
Why didn't you get here sooner?
I sent you a plane.

230
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,530
But you only chartered a plane.
You should've sent a limo too.

231
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,115
I took a bus all the way here!

232
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,450
Wait, who's this guy?

233
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,370
Oh, this guy is…

234
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,040
Hey. Who's this?

235
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,418
Peace.

236
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,671
This is Mr. Oh Jeong-gu.

237
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,089
This is Mr. Choi Jang-mul.

238
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,468
Mr. Oh became my new partner
after you retired.

239
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,553
I see.

240
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,680
There aren't many Counters
who end up retiring, but…

241
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,516
Why not? Because they all die?

242
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,393
What's he saying?

243
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,687
Even after retirement,

244
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,315
your powers and responsibilities
as a Counter remain.

245
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,109
So I decided to have a little meeting.

246
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,654
Man, you're going to make me slave away
just for bringing me back to life.

247
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,533
Anyway, hey.

248
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,786
My man, I have a question.

249
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,707
I heard the Jangmul Group
has been sponsoring Counters.

250
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,624
Is that true?

251
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,542
What?

252
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,627
So it's true!

253
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,049
Yes! This means
I won't ever have to worry about money.

254
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,967
I like that about this job.

255
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,303
Wow, listen to this rude punk.

256
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,305
How can this guy be a Counter?

257
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,016
It's tough to find one these days.

258
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:36,104
Jeong-gu is a special agent
who'll be dispatched

259
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,273
to Singapore, Asia's hub.

260
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,483
Dong-pal.

261
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,695
I can already tell
how hopeless this kid is.

262
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,864
If you keep working with him,

263
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,408
you'll end up dying
before your time is up.

264
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,535
This guy is clueless.

265
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,787
I didn't want to do it.

266
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,372
I have no regrets in this world.

267
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,584
-I'm not doing it.
-What a rude little brat.

268
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,505
What will you become when you're older?
Where are your manners?

269
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,508
We're both working for the afterlife.
It's better to be casual.

270
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,553
Okay. That's that.

271
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,932
-I'd like to make a deal with you.
-A deal…

272
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,519
Why don't you have the Jangmul Group
release my album?

273
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,396
Hey, Dong-pal.

274
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:23,777
Don't ever make me sit here again
with this brat. Got it?

275
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,822
Why not? You don't like rock music?

276
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,698
I can sing trot songs.

277
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,909
Shush. I'm leaving.

278
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,204
Hey, wait! There will be
a huge trot music fad soon!

279
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,668
Stop complaining. Once we're there,

280
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,419
just make sure you heal Ms. Chu.

281
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:46,091
I should've known something was fishy
when you offered to release my album.

282
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,844
Stop the car over there. I'm leaving.

283
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,263
So he's a singer?

284
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,598
A former aspiring singer.

285
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,976
He ran out once or twice
to go to an audition

286
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,645
when he was training under me,

287
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,313
but he never made it and came back.

288
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,692
Don't say that. He'll think it's true.

289
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,612
I made it to the final round
of the last audition I went to,

290
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,783
but Ms. Chu came for me saying
Counters shouldn't become well known.

291
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,828
Said Jeong-gu to Ms. Chu
to keep the story straight,

292
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,372
but Ha-na read her mind,
so we all found out.

293
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,713
Ha-na looks like
she'd be good at keeping her mouth shut.

294
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,174
Anyway, did you two introduce yourselves?

295
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,968
This is the Korean ace, So Mun.

296
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,095
Hello, I'm So Mun.

297
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,182
Oh, you're Cheol-jung's replacement.

298
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,768
And this guy works in Singapore.

299
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,980
He's a Counter.

300
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,733
He can also heal people like Ms. Chu.

301
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,070
Wait, so he's an ace,

302
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,655
but I'm just a Counter?

303
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,992
Drop me off right here. I'm going home.

304
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,911
Just stick around for a bit, Jeong-gu.

305
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,538
I'll promote the heck out of your album.

306
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,540
You'll be a K-pop star.

307
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,501
So just heal Ms. Chu, and…

308
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,713
I'm sorry, but I've been low on energy.

309
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,089
I bleed when I blow my nose.

310
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,885
It'll be faster
if you contact the guy in Hong Kong.

311
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,969
Mr. Oh.

312
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,391
I saved your life back there.

313
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,646
What?

314
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,939
He's right.

315
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,108
You almost got beaten
to death by that evil spirit,

316
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,110
but Mun saved your ass.

317
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,279
Then you should pay him back
for saving you.

318
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,406
Or you can go ahead and die here.

319
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,992
Your choice.
Do you want to get beaten to death?

320
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,744
Jeong-gu.

321
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,789
Mun can be scary when he gets mad.

322
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,963
I'm scared.

323
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,259
This place isn't for me.

324
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,636
Man, I'm so out of place.

325
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,732
The rumors were true.

326
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,026
He can control the territory.

327
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,697
So you've heard the rumors about Mun?

328
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,574
Okay.

329
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,911
Relax. I'll get started.

330
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,823
Goodness, that feels much better.

331
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,075
Darn it. I might die.

332
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,202
Goodness, thank you.

333
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,288
So, Mr. Oh.

334
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,748
Yes? What?

335
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,584
Why is your hair still black?

336
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,336
What?

337
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,008
Mae-ok, you should dye your hair.
What is that?

338
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,179
I can't believe you came this far
to do me this favor.

339
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,057
Of course. I should be here
if you aren't well.

340
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,060
Forget that chartered plane.
I would've swum here.

341
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,687
Anyway,

342
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,440
will you make me some noodles?

343
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,317
Yes, of course, I will.

344
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,568
A double serving at that.

345
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,320
No, don't do that. I'll get fat.

346
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,114
Make enough for one.

347
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,534
Okay.

348
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:45,747
Man, I got on the plane and flew here…

349
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,291
to eat these noodles.

350
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,881
It's good.

351
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,675
Sorry.

352
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,430
I couldn't come back right away
after hearing Cheol-jung's news.

353
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,643
I heard you've been busy
going here and there to provide support.

354
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,480
But we have to summon that evil spirit

355
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,148
and meet Cheol-jung again.

356
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,487
Anyway, thanks for your help, Jeong-gu.

357
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,239
Thanks for making the long trip.

358
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,700
Well, of course, I should be here.

359
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,161
Anyway,

360
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,793
I won't say anything to your team
since you asked me not to,

361
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,047
but you know as well as I do
what your condition is like.

362
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,007
You won't last long.

363
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,052
You can't be out in the field.
You need to rest.

364
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,055
You might die first
while trying to save someone.

365
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,767
Such a nag.

366
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,021
I hope you behave
and don't get any odd ideas.

367
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,111
So? Will he really help you
release your album?

368
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,863
Why would I do that at this age?

369
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,657
I'm leaving on the first flight.

370
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,827
I feel much more refreshed thanks to you.

371
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,370
Thank you so much.

372
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,540
Eat well before your flight.

373
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,126
Goodness, let me get you more soup.

374
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,194
CCTV IN OPERATION

375
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,739
Hyeok-u.

376
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,508
Three exits. The garage,
the front and the back gates.

377
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,343
We will

378
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,845
make sure we catch him
before it's too late.

379
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,971
I'm ready.

380
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,851
Then let's get going.

381
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,853
How's Hyeok-u doing, Ms. Chu?

382
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,939
He seems quite startled.

383
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,816
He'll calm down in time.

384
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,068
Are you feeling…

385
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,945
I mean, how's your condition?

386
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,489
What do you take me for? Let's head over.

387
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,907
Let's get back before dinner.

388
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,866
Okay.

389
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,707
-Jeong-gu.
-Jeong-gu.

390
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,708
What about your flight?

391
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,794
You can stay and make dinner.

392
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,837
I'll go.

393
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,047
What are you talking about?

394
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,132
She just got better,

395
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,634
so I'll go in Mae-ok's place.

396
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,010
Don't you get it, Mo-tak?

397
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:46,928
Come here.

398
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,014
Why should you go?

399
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,349
I'll tell them everything.

400
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,308
You little…

401
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,811
I didn't feel at peace.

402
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,437
I was worried about you.

403
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,607
And the noodles were great too.

404
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,533
So Mr. Oh, are you sure you'll be okay?

405
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,577
We've fought him a few times, so we know.

406
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,995
But this guy is…

407
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,121
Man.

408
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,459
Mo-tak, will you tell him?

409
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,087
Do I have to get disciplined
by a baby who's just started?

410
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,756
That baby is our best guy,

411
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,966
so you better listen.

412
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:29,304
I've been on a business trip
in the Philippines with his team before.

413
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,723
Jeong-gu is pretty good.

414
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,766
He just tries to spare himself too much.

415
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,102
No, I think his talent level
is the problem.

416
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,271
He didn't seem all too useful that day.

417
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,231
He didn't seem that good.

418
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,190
He took a blow.

419
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,317
A big one.

420
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,902
Hey. Goodness.

421
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,446
Are you talking about that incident?

422
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,573
When I was still jetlagged from my flight

423
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,908
right after I landed.

424
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,328
Of course, you were jetlagged.
There's an hour difference with Singapore.

425
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,163
There's no way you'd be fine.

426
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,833
Goodness, what a pathetic excuse
to make to your junior.

427
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,877
Mun, you're good, so just let it slide.

428
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,878
Okay.

429
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,423
Ga Mo-tak is the problem around here.
It's that punk.

430
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,383
"Punk"?

431
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,679
You must have missed my punches
while you were away.

432
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,059
Stop it.

433
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,603
He has never hit me before.
What are you talking about?

434
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,647
I gave you special treatment.

435
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,482
Anyway, let's make this work.

436
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,817
Okay. Let's do this.

437
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,945
I'm a bit nervous, though.

438
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,831
You're up.

439
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,210
How are you feeling?

440
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,170
I'm fine.

441
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,382
So you're Mun's friend, right?

442
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,550
You must be hungry.

443
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,969
I'll make you some noodles.

444
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,138
Thank you.

445
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,519
That happens once in a blue moon.

446
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,035
Something seems weird.
I can't detect anything.

447
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,329
Has he run off already?

448
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,790
It is what it is. Let's come back later.

449
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,667
Jeong-gu.

450
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,878
The house is a ways away.

451
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,339
Our territory may not be there.

452
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,674
Let's try going in.

453
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,078
Mo-tak.

454
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,747
Is he here?

455
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,831
Be quiet.

456
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,585
Damn it.

457
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,966
Why won't he move?

458
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,011
Something's weird.

459
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,723
I can't detect the evil spirit.

460
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,641
What?

461
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,809
Shin Myeong-hwi's dead?

462
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,813
He's not dead either.

463
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,899
He's still breathing softly.

464
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,742
-The restaurant.
-No way.

465
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,245
-There's an evil spirit at the restaurant.
-What?

466
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,038
-Ms. Chu. Ms. Chu?

467
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,791
-She won't answer.
-She's in danger!

468
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,751
It went into Hyeok-u. Hurry.

469
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,877
Wait.

470
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,463
Even if the evil spirit changed hosts…

471
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,758
there has to be a reason why
it left him alive.

472
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,385
-What?
-The evil spirit…

473
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,762
might return to him.

474
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,806
-Then…
-Ha-na.

475
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,683
We'll wait here.

476
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,019
If the evil spirit ends up
returning to Shin Myeong-hwi…

477
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,773
I'll finish him.

478
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,115
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

479
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,700
Most people say it's good.

480
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,662
I hope they're doing okay.

481
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,502
Where is everyone?

482
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,173
Oh, they had something to take care of.

483
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,050
Did they head over to kill my dad?

484
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,221
Hyeok-u.

485
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,348
He deserves to die.

486
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,603
A guy like him should die.

487
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,861
But there's no use in killing him now.

488
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,572
What?

489
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,785
Weren't you all looking for me?

490
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,507
You.

491
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,316
Please spare me, Dad.

492
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,569
I told you we should've killed him.

493
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,695
Wait.

494
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,367
Let's use him…

495
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:29,205
and kill them one after the other.

496
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,537
Fine.

497
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,455
Let's do this.

498
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,419
Come at me, you evil spirit.

499
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,119
You…

500
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,379
Ms. Chu.

501
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,346
You cowardly evil spirit.

502
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,889
I'll kill you!

503
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,873
Come out. Come out of Hyeok-u's body,
you damned evil spirit!

504
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,783
Mo-tak, he escaped again.

505
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,118
How's Ms. Chu?

506
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,411
Thankfully, she's fine.

507
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,937
It's time!

508
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,439
I'm summoning this evil spirit.

509
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,849
That blow completely woke me up.

510
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:17,892
Jeong-gu.

511
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,936
He's at the final level.
They're completely united.

512
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,606
Spare yourself as you always do
and get behind me.

513
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,025
Come on, don't make me lose my spirit.

514
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,318
I never back out.

515
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,360
You stay behind me.

516
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,361
Come on.

517
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,033
Damn it.

518
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,881
Did you say you wanted to end
our seven awful years?

519
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,090
Then is this the end?

520
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,175
I'm the one…

521
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,719
who's going to
put an end to this, asshole.

522
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,362
Mo-tak! Our territory is disappearing.

523
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,615
We have to run. It's way too dangerous!

524
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,325
Hurry!

525
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,165
Mo-tak!

526
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,710
Mo-tak, are you okay?

527
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,258
Hey, what is it? What's wrong?

528
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,344
Jeong-gu. Jeong-gu!

529
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,554
Jeong-gu!

530
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,390
Jeong-gu!

531
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,016
Jeong-gu, it's okay.

532
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,309
Jeong-gu.

533
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,435
Come on, man...

534
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,020
Jeong-gu.

535
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,778
I'm…

536
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,448
I'm disappearing. Aren't I, Wi-gen?

537
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,335
Jeong-gu.

538
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,339
Stay with me.
Stay with me just a bit longer.

539
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,508
Mo-tak.

540
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:18,095
I feel so bad for Dong-pal.

541
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:25,603
Jang-mul once said Dong-pal would
die early because of me.

542
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:29,106
Hey, man. Stop talking.

543
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,942
You have to make your album too, kid.

544
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,738
Yes, I'll release an album.

545
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:41,744
I'm on top of the world

546
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,330
With people who love me

547
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,124
Stay still. Stop singing and stay still.

548
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,584
Stop singing.

549
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,339
Jeong-gu.

550
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,549
Hey, Jeong-gu. Jeong-gu!

551
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,594
Hey, man. Keep singing.
Just sing, you punk.

552
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,595
Jeong-gu.

553
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,014
Wi-gen.

554
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,645
What happens after Yung?

555
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,914
Jeong-gu.

556
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,503
Mun, summon our territory.

557
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,545
We need it now.

558
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:37,841
Although we can't see him,
I'm sure his partner from Yung is here.

559
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,511
We need our territory.
Without it, his partner…

560
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,347
Jeong-gu!

561
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,454
Mr. Oh.

562
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,043
I'm sorry.

563
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,757
I can't… I can't breathe.

564
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:20,968
It's my fault.

565
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,680
It's… It's my…

566
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:28,475
Wi-gen, how did you survive this?

567
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,608
What's going on?

568
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,758
What in the world...

569
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,726
Don't die.

570
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,187
Not a single one of you.

571
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,274
Mun.

572
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,987
I don't want…

573
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,990
anyone to die from this moment on.

574
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,659
What…

575
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,620
What's going on?

576
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,335
I'm alive. I'm alive!

577
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,591
I'm alive.

578
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,553
It wasn't just me.

579
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:57,606
He's a little door for us.

580
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,152
He's a bridge between…

581
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,197
the world and Yung.

582
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,079
EONNI'S NOODLES

583
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,736
I was a detective…

584
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,656
then a Counter.

585
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,034
I've seen numbers of people die.

586
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,037
But how is this…

587
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,333
never easy for me?

588
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,586
Not even once.

589
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,508
Mo-tak.

590
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,430
I thought Cheol-jung would be
the last one.

591
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,100
But then there was Jeong-yeong
and Jeong-gu...

592
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,997
Once you finish that…

593
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,707
go and get some rest.

594
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,501
Jeong-gu…

595
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,504
saved me…

596
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,466
then left the world.

597
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,636
He ended up doing that.

598
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,932
How will I ever repay him?

599
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:01,271
Jeong-gu has arrived safely at Yung.

600
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,941
He's been wanting to rest,
so he said it's great.

601
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,903
Also, you shouldn't get any weird ideas.

602
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,655
That's what he said.

603
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,659
Shin Myeong-hwi…

604
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,203
and that evil spirit.

605
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:18,955
I'm catching them.

606
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,084
I'll make sure I catch them…

607
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,380
if it's the last thing I do.

608
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,050
No matter what.

609
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,847
POLICE

610
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,153
Listen up, Son.

611
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,822
I don't care who it is.

612
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,783
If anyone tries to stop me,
I'll kill them all.

613
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,118
So…

614
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,912
if it's too tough
to cause no trouble at school…

615
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,417
let me know now.

616
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,846
I'll take it to your room.

617
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:58,972
Sure.

618
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:19,326
I'm sorry. Please let me out.

619
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,244
I'm sorry, Dad.

620
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:35,300
You must have a lot of memories…

621
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,594
you wanted to forget.

622
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,452
What...

623
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,082
You're up.

624
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,044
What is this?

625
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,296
Why was I asleep in this shithole?

626
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,217
Come on out. Let's eat.

627
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,803
Have you gone insane?
Why would I eat with you?

628
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,888
Is your friend up too?

629
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,183
Mun, I'm done making breakfast.

630
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,894
Come on out.

631
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,662
Hey, grab a seat.

632
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,131
All right.

633
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,635
It's his first time here, right?

634
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,137
It is.

635
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,556
Hello.

636
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,183
Gosh, you're handsome.

637
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,730
Let's eat, then.

638
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,856
Let's eat.

639
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,524
Eat up.

640
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,947
Eat up.

641
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,538
Grandpa, this looks great.

642
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,956
-Grandma, eat up.
-What? Okay.

643
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,127
-You too, Grandpa.
-What?

644
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,588
You eat the big piece.

645
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,560
You can stay longer.

646
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,442
What the heck are you doing?

647
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,653
You came to see me.

648
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,822
Do you seriously think I brought you here?

649
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,120
I don't know what happened…

650
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,873
but leave me alone.

651
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,292
Got a place to go?

652
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,463
Hey, don't you know who I am?

653
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,509
My house can't be compared to this place.

654
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,219
Worry about yourself.

655
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,974
You don't want to go back
to that awesome house.

656
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,022
You don't want to see your father.

657
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,275
What do you know?

658
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,319
That's why you came here yesterday.

659
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:46,074
You needed to stay somewhere
away from your father.

660
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,625
Thanks for coming.

661
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,295
Only because you asked me for help.

662
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,217
You know his family runs
a vacation villa, right?

663
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,349
If you need a place to stay,
you can stay there for a while.

664
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,402
Today is the last day.

665
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,738
Don't strain yourself…

666
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:08,948
and stay calm.

667
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,827
I will make sure
I summon that evil spirit.

668
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,297
Ms. Chu, will you be all right?

669
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,518
Don't say that.

670
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,563
Do you expect me to back out
after Jeong-gu died like that?

671
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,066
I can't do that.

672
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,361
We all promised Mun…

673
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,239
that we'd help him see his parents.

674
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,585
You're right.

675
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,712
We have to make him smile.

676
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,050
And I owe one to Detective So Gwon.

677
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,073
STRIKE AGAINST DEMOLITION

678
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,463
That looks perfect.

679
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,383
Sorry?

680
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,845
It's time to put an end to this…

681
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,807
-for both you and me.
-For both you and me.

682
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,436
Do you realize who I am now?

683
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,523
Who are you? What are you doing?

684
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,862
Oh, I'm sorry.

685
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,072
I must have fallen asleep. Sorry.

686
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,961
Something like that happened?

687
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,925
This is where
Shin Myeong-hwi wanted to meet.

688
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,719
It's near my grandparents' church,
so I know the area.

689
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,555
The former residents recently moved out
for the redevelopment.

690
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,890
If we stay in the grounds,

691
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,850
no one else will get hurt.

692
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,268
And look.

693
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:54,489
Let's make sure we win today.

694
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,951
Let's meet your parents today, Mun.

695
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,498
Anyway, Mun's a big boy now.

696
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,795
In the past, he would've thrown a fit

697
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,673
then left to fight him alone
without telling us.

698
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,509
Not just that.
He would've been gone by now.

699
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,013
I've grown a bit, haven't I?

700
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,143
Okay, then. Shall we get going?

701
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:25,937
Let's go.

702
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,149
Old man, you can stay here.

703
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,859
What are you talking about?

704
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,988
I need to be there to protect Ms. Chu.

705
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,322
We need…

706
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,325
someone who can…

707
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,787
welcome the new Counters.

708
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,125
What is this guy talking about?

709
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,294
Wait here.

710
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,004
Once I get back…

711
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,048
we can go for a drive or whatever.

712
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,844
Gosh, Ms. Chu.

713
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,639
Why don't we take a picture?

714
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,600
A picture sounds good.

715
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,040
STRIKE AGAINST DEMOLITION

716
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,833
STOP THE DEMOLITION RIGHT AWAY!

717
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,307
REVEAL THE TRUTH
AND PUNISH ALL THOSE RESPONSIBLE

718
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,559
I won't let anyone get hurt.

719
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,103
I won't let anyone die.

720
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,440
I will make sure I protect everyone.

721
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,568
As long as evil spirits prevail…

722
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:00,740
more people will continue
to lose the ones they love.

723
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,076
More people will experience sorrow.

724
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,087
I will make sure I win today.

725
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,803
So I'll see you today.

726
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,264
Mom.

727
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:27,517
Dad.

728
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,362
In the very end, we may not be with you.

729
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,782
You thought you could handle me
when you were this weak?

730
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,701
Get up and fight, no matter what.

731
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,619
Is this some kind of system error?

732
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,329
-Let's try one more time.
-How...

733
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,622
Then this must be…

734
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,665
How long has it been?

735
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:37,378
Will Mun's parents recognize Mun?
He's 18 now, you know.

736
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:38,921
Thank you.

737
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,174
No problem.

738
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,680
