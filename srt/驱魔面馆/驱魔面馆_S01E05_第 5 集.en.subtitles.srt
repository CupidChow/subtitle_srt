00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,021
RECENTS

4
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,733
The last person I spoke to…

5
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,944
Did I ask this person to save me?

6
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,825
Or was I trying to tell him
something important?

7
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,913
That last call…

8
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,207
was with So Gwon.

9
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,338
Mun's father?

10
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,923
Yes.

11
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,592
But…

12
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,094
for some reason,

13
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,721
his number looks familiar.

14
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,934
I don't recall anything, but his number…

15
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,645
I recognize it.

16
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,230
SO GWON

17
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,825
Hello?

18
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,453
Hello?

19
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,013
Hey, Mun.

20
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,100
It's me.

21
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,568
Gosh. What's this number?

22
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,611
My old number.

23
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,829
Anyway, is something going on?

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,081
No.

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,749
Nothing is going on.

26
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,503
How did you handle this phone?

27
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,005
It's all scratched and cracked.

28
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,008
I used to be a detective too.

29
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,759
Really?

30
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,511
Yes.

31
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,267
Just like your mom and dad.

32
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,438
Wow, what are the chances?

33
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,815
Let's open up.

34
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,862

-Yes.

EPISODE 5

39
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,985
And can you pick this up on your way back?

40
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,904
It has to be that cake.

41
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,740
APPLE MANGO CHIFFON CAKE

42
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,452
Gosh, my dear son!

43
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,206
To what do I owe the pleasure?

44
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,749
APPLE MANGO CHIFFON CAKE

45
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,543
The apple mango chiffon cake, please.

46
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,544
Sure.

47
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,050
How many candles do you need?

48
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,343
It's for a 9-year-old.

49
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,136
One second, please.

50
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,226
-Can you ring me up?
-Of course.

51
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,669
Goodbye.

52
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,110
-Honey, I'm home.
-Hey.

53
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,155
How long do you plan to live?

54
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,865
You never skip a day of exercise.

55
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,994
How does brunch sound?

56
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:28,995
Great.

57
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,259
I need to wash up.

58
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,720
Okay. Go ahead.

59
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,390
-No, you can't have that.
-What?

60
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,934
I put in peanuts.

61
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,977
Come on.

62
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,646
Sorry.

63
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,190
I'll fix you something next time.

64
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,082
So will you really die if you eat peanuts?

65
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,462
Hey, sometimes
you ask the weirdest questions.

66
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,465
Well, I'm just curious.

67
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,555
-At first, I'd cough a little.
-Okay.

68
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,474
-And then my throat would swell up.
-Okay.

69
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,643
Then, I'd have trouble breathing…

70
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,479
So I…

71
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,774
It'd be tough to…

72
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,818
breathe…

73
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,446
What's wrong?

74
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:27,905
I can't breathe.

75
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:36,914
My pills.

76
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,961
Why? Do you feel like you're going to die?

77
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,131
Because of the peanut butter
I put in your juice?

78
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,181
Sure. I love you too.

79
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,724
You… No!

RECEIVED FROM JI HYEONG-U

84
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,024
-Eat.
-What do you want?

85
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:45,983
Do you want this?

86
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:48,819
Oh, you like it.

87
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,477
Hey, great work.

88
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,105
Grab a bite in the kitchen and go.

89
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,861
Father.

90
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,992
I made a mistake.

91
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,541
You idiot.

92
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,815
You asshole.

93
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,984
No one asked you to do that.

94
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,579
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,374
Why did you do it?

96
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,714
I wanted to kill him.

97
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,497
Can you see me?

98
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,165
Who are you?

99
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,002
Who are you?

100
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,296
Stab me.

101
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,881
You like doing that.

102
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,425
You've always wanted to do it.

103
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,135
Who are you?

104
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,681
A friend who knows you very well.

105
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,519
A friend who makes you feel like
you can do anything you want.

106
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,729
You finally realized I'm here.

107
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,148
You never noticed before
when I called out to you.

108
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,276
The voice in my head.

109
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,488
I thought I was hearing things.

110
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,036
And we killed that jerk together.

111
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,331
That's how we finally got to meet.

112
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,335
That disgusting jerk.

113
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,839
A jerk like him deserves to die.
Don't you think?

114
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,173
Right?

115
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,176
He totally deserves to die.

116
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,102
Since when have you been inside me?

117
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,895
Since the day

118
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,024
you killed your first husband.

119
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,654
Don't ever leave me.

120
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,656
You crazy brat.

121
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,878
Thank you. We enjoyed it.

122
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,549
Thank you. Come again.

123
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,848
Gosh. Mun, that poor thing.

124
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,020
One day, he'll find out
that his parents were murdered.

125
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,190
How is he going to live with that?

126
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,070
Shouldn't we tell him?

127
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,615
Don't be so rash.
Mo-tak said he'll look into it.

128
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,617
Let's tell him after we find something.

129
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,911
After we find the murderer.

130
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,787
That's when. Let's tell him then. Okay?

131
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,416
-You told me not to.
-Yes, you're right. We can't.

132
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,792
No, we can't.

133
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,587
Goodness, it's such a dilemma.

134
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,635
Whoa…

135
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,762
It's our territory.

136
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,056
Wow.

137
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,524
Wow.

138
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,529
My gosh.

139
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,699
EONNI'S NOODLES

140
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,794
You can't do it, Mo-tak.

141
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,962
Forget what's right.

142
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,755
This is a matter of keeping order.

143
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,591
It's about the boundaries and order
of afterlife and earth.

144
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,093
Right or wrong,

145
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,344
order or not,

146
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,555
I wouldn't care
if this were your business.

147
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,974
Even more so if it were Ha-na's.

148
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,269
Hey, why do you make me seem so cheap?

149
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,355
You only say we're family.

150
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,031
What's he doing?

151
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,826
How is he doing that?

152
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,926
What's he doing?

153
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,470
Hey.

154
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,689
Our territory opened up.

155
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,983
-What's with him?
-It just opened up.

156
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,610
Get inside. Go on.

157
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,487
Wait, what's wrong?

158
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,200
-How did you just do that?
-Do what?

159
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,537
You touched and played with our territory.

160
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,663
So what?

161
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,583
Am I not supposed to do that?

162
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,752
It's not that we aren't allowed to,
we can't.

163
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,171
Is it such a big deal?

164
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,467
So this is why
you were specially appointed.

165
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,722
I've never seen our territory
shift like that.

166
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,902
I think he can summon the Yung territory.

167
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,571
-Summon?
-Summon?

168
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,616
Did you summon the territory

169
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,951
when you fought those kids?

170
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,285
Oh, that day?

171
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,998
How can you summon that? That's nonsense.

172
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,834
Well, I also thought it was kind of weird.

173
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,796
So you really opened up the territory?

174
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,590
I'm not 100 percent sure.

175
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,009
Hey, go get changed.

176
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,552
Let's try this. Come on inside.

177
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,595
Come inside.

178
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,889
Get changed.

179
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,892
Do it.

180
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,604
Mun.

181
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,024
If you can summon the Yung territory
at will,

182
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,776
we'll never have to get hurt

183
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,069
or die.

184
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,282
We can pop out those evil spirits
like a vending machine

185
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,284
and send them to the afterlife.

186
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,161
So much pressure.

187
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,248
What's "pressure"?

188
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,499
You idiot.

189
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502
It's all right. It's okay.

190
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,296
Don't feel burdened. Relax.

191
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,382
Relax and try it out.

192
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,219
I'll give it a try.

193
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,871
Was that it?

194
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,554
Who wants ice cream?

195
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,475
Are you kidding me?

196
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,810
I want a popsicle.

197
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,646
I have no idea how I did it.

198
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,690
It's okay. Do you want ice cream?

199
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,859
-Yes.
-All right. Let's go, pumpkin.

200
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,987
My gosh. Goodness, you punk.

201
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,572
-I'm sorry. It's a habit.
-Why…

202
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,657
-Heal me.
-Okay. You'll be fine.

203
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,555
Wait.

204
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,270
-What is this?
-That's enough.

205
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,315
We stepped on one.

206
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,151
JUNGJIN DUTY FREE

207
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,196
Jungjin Department Store.

208
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,948
You caught that, too?

209
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,408
Am I right? No way! Man, I caught…

210
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,410
What's its level?

211
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,620
I wouldn't know that.

212
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,830
Level three.

213
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,997
Remember that feeling.

214
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,415
-Three?
-Level three?

215
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,586
The one that killed Cheol-jung
was level three.

216
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,174
I won't get worked up. I'll do a good job.

217
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,094
We'll have to travel by car.

218
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,930
I hope she shops there for a while.

219
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,931
Get changed.

220
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,812
So level three spirits have two voices?

221
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,690
Yes, the evil spirit and the host
can communicate.

222
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,527
We can hear the evil spirit's voice,
but ordinary people can't.

223
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,821
At level three, they can use psychokinesis

224
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,322
and read minds.

225
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,616
Some can bewitch people.

226
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,368
Bewitch people?

227
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,453
They make you lose your mind.

228
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,206
They found one in France
that could switch hosts.

229
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,333
I learned French as a second language.

230
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,462
I'm just nervous.

231
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,008
Hold yourself together like Ha-na.

232
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,345
Like raindrops falling down quietly
at a temple.

233
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,763
I think of pork belly.

234
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,558
The sound of its fat on charcoal.

235
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,018
Pop, crackle.

236
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,728
It calms me down.

237
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,689
You picture pork belly?

238
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,443
We're scared, too, Mun.
We get scared every single time.

239
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,696
Our territory isn't there, is it?

240
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,448
No, it's gone.

241
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,452
You don't have to catch her.
Don't get hurt.

242
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,372
Pop. Crackle.

243
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,958
-Pop. Crackle.
-Crackle.

244
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,169
-Pop. Crackle.
-Pop. Crackle.

245
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,254
-Pop. Crackle.
-Pop. Crackle.

246
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,468
PARKING ENTRY

247
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,097
I'll take the first floor.

248
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,850
I'll take the third and the fourth.
Be careful.

249
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,519
I'll start on the fifth.

250
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,773
Mun, can you really do this alone?

251
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,066
I still feel uneasy.

252
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,402
Did you already forget my fight
against the 17 kids?

253
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,905
Evil spirits aren't the same as people.

254
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,198
I have a bad feeling about him.

255
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,575
Come on, don't worry.

256
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,744
Anyway, she was a woman.
Is it okay to hit her?

257
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,871
She's not a woman.

258
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,331
She's an evil spirit.

259
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,590
What else do you want?

260
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,509
Pardon?

261
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,929
I wasn't talking to you.

262
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,602
Really?

263
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,689
She wants that necklace.

264
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,731
Pardon?

265
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,734
I was talking to you.

266
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,363
Ma'am.

267
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,166
Emergency at Le Freres Shop, 12th floor.

268
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,169
Over there.

269
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,645
I found her.

270
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,023
What?

271
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,067
Which floor?

272
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,611
Mun, don't do anything.

273
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,095
I'm going down from the 12th floor
by elevator.

274
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,348
I'll cut off the camera.

275
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,524
I'm running to the elevator.

276
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,777
She might go to the parking lot,
so I'll be there.

277
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,904
Lure her to a place
where there are no people.

278
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,197
Safety is our priority.

279
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,309
Who are you?

280
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,270
What?

281
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,856
Are you talking to me?

282
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,860
Why are you following me?

283
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,949
Do you like me?

284
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,035
Oh, no. It's not that.

285
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,956
Then why are you following me?

286
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,131
-Ha-yeong…
-Ha-na…

287
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,635
No, please…

288
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,972
How does it feel
to have survived all alone?

289
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,391
Your mom died,

290
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,268
your dad died,

291
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,896
and even your sister was about to die.

292
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,400
What?

293
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,028
Wake up, Ha-na!

294
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,325
EMERGENCY STOP

295
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,426
Over there!

296
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,886
In front of the elevator! Over there!

297
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,682
-Jeez, what a hassle.
-Over there! In front of the elevator.

298
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,393
Over here! Some help, please.

299
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,854
What?

300
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,605
Yes, this is Mr. Ji Hyeong-u's wife.

301
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,357
Take her away.

302
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,698
-Sir, what's going on?
-Yes?

303
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,366
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

304
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,535
-Sir, please come with us.
-I really should.

305
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,287
Yes, all right. Okay.

306
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,789
I really hate leaving a scene like this.

307
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,041
Do you know that feeling?

308
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,335
You're at a restroom
trying to do a number two,

309
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,544
but you have to stop.

310
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,504
How does that feel?

311
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,008
How does it feel?
Doesn't it feel incomplete? Incomplete.

312
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,888
-Keep up the good work.
-That little…

313
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,979
Are you both all right?

314
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,360
Young kids these days are way too weak.

315
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,447
Can you stand on your feet?

316
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,668
Hurry up and get in.

317
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,967
Darn it, I could've summoned it out.

318
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,929
If the kids are fine, that's good enough.

319
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,520
Can we really leave like this?

320
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,563
We couldn't summon the evil spirit.

321
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,856
We have no choice.

322
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,982
There were too many people.

323
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,318
Since she already got arrested,

324
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,653
it won't get too dangerous.

325
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,154
This happens from time to time.

326
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,699
Before we get a chance to summon them,
the police arrest them

327
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,077
or they get locked up in prison.

328
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,413
Don't worry.

329
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:27,997
We know who she is,

330
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,499
so we'll plan this out again.

331
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,091
Ha-na, take a seat.

332
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,300
Let me see your wound.

333
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,343
I'm fine.

334
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,722
What's with her?

335
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,056
Is something going on?

336
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,599
Her pride must be hurt

337
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,852
after taking a blow from a level three.

338
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,313
Mun, you need to pull yourself together.

339
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,232
They'll get you if you lose your focus.

340
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,362
I think I finally understand

341
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,489
what you meant before, Mo-tak.

342
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,867
You told me to increase my threshold.

343
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,334
They both seem odd today.

344
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,099
How does it feel
to have survived all alone?

345
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,521
Your mom died,

346
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,482
your dad died,

347
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,110
and even your sister was about to die.

348
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,664
I'll kill you if you tell anyone.

349
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,351
What are you doing?

350
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,204
Just so you know,
I'm not good at comforting people.

351
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,040
I've only been comforted.
I haven't done it myself.

352
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,000
I didn't ask you to.

353
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,463
I'm just saying.

354
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,803
Why are you grilling meat in here?
Go eat out there.

355
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,930
You can just listen to the sound.

356
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,889
I'll do the eating.

357
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,976
But it'd be great if you could join me.

358
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,326
Darn you.

359
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,623
Ha-na.

360
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,959
When I was younger,

361
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,169
there was this jerk who threw rocks at me.

362
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,006
After he threw one,

363
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,174
he'd run away by that much.

364
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,969
He knew I couldn't catch him
because of my leg.

365
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,058
He'd keep a pile of rocks in his pocket,

366
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,477
throw one at me, and then run off.

367
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,898
I'd run after him and fall down.

368
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,234
One day, I just kept running after him.

369
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,236
I was going to kill him.

370
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,865
I ended up following him to his house

371
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,867
and putting an end to that punk.

372
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,953
That's not a bad ending.

373
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,372
That's not all.

374
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,417
You got beaten up again, didn't you?

375
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,753
Come on.

376
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,048
Hey, flip it over.

377
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,634
So this is how you like it.

378
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,181
That kid

379
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,726
who threw rocks at me was Ung-min.

380
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,563
Ung-min?

381
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,315
Your friend?

382
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,275
Yes, exactly.

383
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,199
Ha-na.

384
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,665
I also saw my mom and dad pass away
before my eyes.

385
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,502
My mom and dad passed away…

386
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,755
because of me.

387
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,802
I needed to spend just one more day
at my grandma's place to see them,

388
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,681
but I wouldn't listen.

389
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,769
I said, "I miss you so much.

390
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,729
You have to pick me up."

391
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,108
I threw a huge fit.

392
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,697
That was the day of the accident.

393
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,787
Goodness, you're going to burn these.

394
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,248
Sit.

395
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,090
Come on, kid.

396
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,051
Is it good?

397
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,534
-Hello.
-Hello.

398
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,163
Hey.

399
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,040
I'm a little late.

400
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,084
Something came up.

401
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,336
I'm used to seeing you run late.

402
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,005
Seven years is a little too long though.

403
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,466
I'm always on time.

404
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,092
Wasn't I like that before?

405
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,344
You need to remember.

406
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,512
Don't ask me.

407
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,895
A disappearance case
isn't for the Violent Crimes Unit.

408
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,773
I wonder why you took this on.

409
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,454
Could she have been killed?

410
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:45,458
We still haven't found any traces of her
to this day, so probably.

411
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,877
Her body was probably put in a car
and thrown away.

412
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,170
Let's find her.

413
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,381
HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY, KIM YEONG-NIM

414
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,801
Let's head over to Kim Yeong-nim's place.

415
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,512
Let me grab something to eat.
I'll finish your food.

416
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,109
Was I your immediate senior?
You mark the evidence envelope my way.

417
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,401
You forgot the crucial stuff,

418
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,904
but you still remember
all the trivial details.

419
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,365
You have a feisty way of talking.

420
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,533
Do you always do that?

421
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,368
My senior didn't teach me properly.

422
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,662
Why was my junior clueless
about her senior's case?

423
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,080
You didn't share it with me.

424
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,873
Did I not trust you?

425
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,500
You probably wanted to protect me

426
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,085
because I could've gotten hurt.

427
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,628
That's my take, anyway.

428
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,463
That must be it.

429
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,507
I would've done that.

430
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,510
Look at how he's showing off
with his dimples.

431
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,804
How's Su-ryong doing?

432
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,181
How is he? Is he a department head now?

433
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,643
You remember Su-ryong?

434
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,815
I remember things that are very old…

435
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,943
But why?

436
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,909
You're done, right?

437
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,456
You get the check.

438
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,042
Are you okay?

439
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,924
EONNI'S NOODLES

440
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,906
YEONGGWANG

441
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,660
FIFTH NOTICE

442
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,453
NOTICE OF FORCED REAL ESTATE TRANSFER

443
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,838
Someone lived here after Kim Yeong-nim.

444
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,423
They lived here until a year ago.

445
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,235
I'm sorry.

446
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,529
For what?

447
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,657
For not remembering you.

448
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,915
I wonder what we can find here.

449
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,303
Bloodstains never go away.

450
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,805
If they wanted to get rid of it,
they would have.

451
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,182
Someone else lived here too.

452
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,395
What are you doing?

453
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,858
No matter how good they are,

454
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,653
they can't clean up every drop.

455
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,792
I'm getting agitated.

456
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,671
I can't believe
I let such a sloppy guy stab me.

457
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,090
She was stabbed over seven times.

458
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,385
With something the size
of a kitchen knife.

459
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,636
With this much blood,

460
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,889
she probably died here.

461
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,143
Ms. Kim Yeong-nim.

462
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,855
I'm sorry I got here too late.

463
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,056
We were a couple.

464
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,517
You and I.

465
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,643
What?

466
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,646
We were what?

467
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,442
If you find anything about your cases,
share it with me.

468
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,196
Don't show up covered in blood
like you did seven years ago.

469
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,364
Then did you… Hey, wait!

470
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,494
Have you…

471
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,498
been waiting for me…

472
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,334
for the past seven years?

473
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,588
Not anymore.

474
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,223
Hello?

475
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,183
Yes.

476
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,477
Okay. I'll head over right now.

477
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,942
-A new case?
-Yes.

478
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,153
Do you know any blood testing centers?

479
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,781
I can't send this to the NFS.

480
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,032
I do.

481
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,076
I'll text you the number.

482
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,710
Keep up the good work.

483
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:47,356
"I won't eat you
if you give me a rice cake!"

484
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,817
"What should I do?

485
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,903
I've run out of rice cakes."

486
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,656
"What did you say?

487
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,283
If you don't have a rice cake,

488
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,201
I'll eat you, you, you,

489
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,578
and you too!"

490
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,832
I'll eat you!

491
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,834
-Me too!
-Eat me too!

492
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,753
Mr. Shin, Chairman Jeon is dead.

493
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,941
Everyone ditched me to go eat,

494
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,443
and that's when this came in.

495
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,236
It's your first case.

496
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,195
Yes.

497
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,163
Who was the initial witness?

498
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,831
It was me. We got a report saying

499
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,166
they heard someone screaming.

500
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,240
This is Kim Jeong-yeong.

501
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,867
It's a murder case.

502
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,036
Please send some people to 49 Hajin-dong.

503
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,999
And, Mr. Kang, can you come
and run the postmortem exam yourself?

504
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,920
Yes, it's a special case.

505
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:40,844
Ms. Kim.

506
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,199
Mom.

507
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,368
Goodness, you're home.

508
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,621
My gosh.

509
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,664
I had a rough day.

510
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:51,665
-Did you?
-Yes.

511
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,624
That's not good.

512
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,834
What's for dinner?

513
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,252
-Kimchi stew.
-All right!

514
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,826
You said I was the prettiest before.

515
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,244
No, I lied.

516
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,454
But it's true!

517
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,663
No way!

518
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,623
No?

519
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,835
Fine, I'll tie your hair again.

520
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,884
But it's true. I wasn't lying.

521
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,177
Right? I'm the prettiest.

522
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,345
-Yes.
-Okay.

523
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,064
Is anybody here?

524
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,572
-What the…
-What's going on? Why? What is it?

525
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,784
I knew you were following me.

526
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,164
What's wrong? Don't cry.

527
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,418
Dan-bi, don't cry. I'm sorry.

528
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,588
Hey. Don't you go to my school?

529
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,346
Have you two been living here?

530
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,973
Did you run away from home?

531
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,767
We won't go to a children's home.

532
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,060
Please don't report us.

533
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,022
Please don't send us to our dad's place.

534
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,281
Don't cry.

535
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,084
Goodness.

536
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,837
Hello, gentlemen.

537
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:07,968
Get out.

538
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,012
Jeez, man.

539
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,014
-Sang-pil, you should go.
-No, wait.

540
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:12,973
Please leave.

541
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,058
Damn it.

542
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:17,811
I'm sorry.

543
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,818
Hey, man.

544
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,362
Wasn't that too sudden and rude?

545
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,032
Sang-pil, let's go inside. Let's go.

546
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:30,991
Go inside.

547
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,160
Damn it.

548
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,789
Why did you kill our second boss?

549
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,876
So why did they get into a fight
in the first place if they're a crew?

550
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,629
Is that it?

551
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,130
Hey.

552
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,674
Tell him to come and apologize.

553
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,468
I'm not handing it over before then.

554
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,678
Sang-pil, don't be like that.

555
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,138
-Damn you.
-Don't do this.

556
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:58,894
Damn it.

557
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,609
Cheong-sin isn't a kid
who usually makes mistakes.

558
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,365
I wanted to kill him.

559
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,705
That horrifying punk.

560
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,582
You can teach him a lesson.

561
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,335
How?

562
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,087
By giving him to the police?

563
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,129
You idiot.

564
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,465
What if he spills our story to the police?

565
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,218
You can get rid of him some other way.

566
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,261
If you can't do it yourself,

567
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,681
use one of our kids.

568
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:42,938
You don't get any say
in how I deal with my crew.

569
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,193
Chief Choi is here.

570
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,029
You two can have a talk.

571
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,121
That cheeky asshole.

572
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,513
REAL ESTATE GIFT DEED

573
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,390
DONOR: JEON GI-HWAN

574
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,477
Right,
I need to have this document notarized.

575
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,396
But that old man went six feet under.

576
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,231
Get it notarized.

577
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,900
I can do that with the papers,

578
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,820
but his son will come back to Korea
for his funeral.

579
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,198
He's a kid who'll look for the deed

580
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,533
before he visits his dad.

581
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,368
Come to think of it,

582
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,121
this is only good for him.

583
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,460
-He's in the States, right?
-Yes, sir.

584
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,919
Lock him up at the airport.

585
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,129
He's a druggie.

586
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,714
Tell the prosecution

587
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,508
and hold him down
until we're done with the procedures.

588
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,886
-Yes, sir.
-Right.

589
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,223
It looks like
we need Chief Choi to make sure…

590
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,059
everything ends smoothly.

591
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,145
He says he's taken action.

592
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,025
Mr. Noh, you better do this right.

593
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,986
The closer is especially important
in this case.

594
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,613
Find the best troubleshooter.

595
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,324
Tell him to come in.

596
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,658
We can grab a drink.

597
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,203
EMPTY HOUSE

598
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,788
NO OUTSIDE VEHICLES ALLOWED

599
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,248
-Hey, Mun.
-Mo-tak.

600
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,251
Could we let two kids sleep over
at our restaurant?

601
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,419
Kids?

602
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,588
They live in a neighborhood
that'll be demolished soon.

603
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,090
A neighborhood that's getting demolished?
Wolhwa-dong?

604
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,845
-You're here?
-What?

605
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,806
Where are you?

606
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,869
-Give me the list.
-Yes, sir.

607
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,496
DAJEONG ENC

608
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,748
We have a lot to do.
It'll be a busy night.

609
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,668
-Jae-cheol.
-Yes, sir.

610
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,503
Let's finish this in three days.

611
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,462
Okay, sir.

612
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,548
He told us to work damn hard.

613
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,799
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

614
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,008
-Let's go!
-Go.

615
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,510
-Move it, you idiot.
-Let's go.

616
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,860
Is your daughter doing well
studying abroad?

617
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,074
I'll take good care
of Chairman Jeon's case.

618
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,617
Goodness.

619
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,244
All right, now.

620
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,166
You should get a new car
for your daughter.

621
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,544
She lives in a dangerous neighborhood.

622
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,170
Have a drink.

623
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,676
You know that you have my trust, right?

624
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,557
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

625
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,267
Take a look outside.

626
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,319
What's going on? Who called the NFS?

627
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,529
Man, is it Kim Jeong-yeong again?

628
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,906
Is it? Guys!

629
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,660
Hey, Jeong-yeong!

630
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,828
Hey, Han-ul, come here.

631
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,788
Wait, you punk!

632
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,874
-Han-ul!
-Stop him.

633
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,751
-Darn you!
-Han-ul, open the door, punk.

634
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:33,960
Damn it!

635
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,298
This call cannot be connected…

636
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,008
Chief Choi won't pick up.

637
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,888
Damn it, man.

638
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:47,807
Han-ul.

639
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,101
They can take this case any minute now.

640
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,563
We need to make sure
we get the present condition,

641
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,690
the truth, the facts, and even lies

642
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,192
before they take the case away.

643
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,109
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,168
Ms. Kim. Did a person…

645
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,046
really do something like this?

646
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,841
You'll soon find out…

647
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:26,513
that people are the devil.

648
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:33,144
Wasn't it scary living here
all by yourself?

649
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,398
We were fine.

650
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,777
The thugs, right?

651
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,783
We can just pretend like we aren't here
for a moment.

652
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,287
Dan-o, I can't poop.

653
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,747
Dan-bi, please!

654
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,750
DAJEONG ENC

655
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,628
Hey, mommy, come on out.

656
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,922
Your kid says she can't poop.

657
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,674
Take your hands off of her.

658
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,851
-What?
-Jae-cheol!

659
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,395
Darn it.

660
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,607
Mun, you only got beaten up
this afternoon, didn't you?

661
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,609
Man, you're brutally honest.

662
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,903
Darn you!

663
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,547
This is too frustrating.

664
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,677
Who do you think you are?

665
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:50,847
Hey.

666
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,391
You're their boss, aren't you?

667
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,602
What?

668
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,812
Look at this guy.

669
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,814
Ga…

670
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:01,858
Ga…

671
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,735
Mo-tak.

672
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,779
Do you…

673
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:08,990
know me?

674
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,092
Hey, wait.

675
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,595
I clearly remember seeing you dead.

676
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,808
You already died, you asshole.

677
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,439
For an officer,
you're not bad with a knife.

678
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:45,860
Take that!

679
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,115
You asshole!

680
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,079
He's awfully persistent.

681
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,540
Just get lost, will you?

682
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,463
I'm going to remember

683
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:10,093
what you look like.

684
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,346
So what if you remember?

685
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,189
You might have hurt me,

686
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,943
but I'm not going to let some thugs
take my life.

687
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,279
Hey. Hey, man. Hey.

688
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,241
Get down.

689
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,621
You crazy asshole!

690
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,389
Was it you?

691
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,686
Did you stab me?

692
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,508
An evil spirit?
The suspect is an evil spirit?

693
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,467
Let's find him.

694
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,970
It makes sense that Taesin is involved.

695
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,388
Stop glaring at me, will you?

696
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,890
Who's that lady?

697
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,391
-This is my girlfriend.
-What?

698
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,727
You said there were
other detectives who died.

699
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,395
Were they my parents?

700
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,357
Unleash the memory!

701
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,067
You wanted to forget
so you blocked it out.

702
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,568
Is there a problem?

703
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,529
Mun's parents never ascended.

704
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,656
It's him. Mun, we have to get out of here.

705
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,032
You must be that kid.

706
00:58:56,115 --> 00:59:00,078
