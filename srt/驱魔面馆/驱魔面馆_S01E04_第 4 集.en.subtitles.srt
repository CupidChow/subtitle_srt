1
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,564
So you're that punk's besties?

2
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,318
Why are you all scared?

3
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,821
Relax and tell us.

4
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:13,948
Where is he now?

5
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,413
Please, don't do this. Can you…

6
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,457
please let us go?

7
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,376
-Hey.
-Jeez.

8
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,419
Ju-yeon!

9
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,842
Hey, Ju-yeon. Open your eyes!

10
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,760
Ju-yeon!

11
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,845
Jun-gyu will go to jail at this rate.

12
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,806
Hyeok-u, this is wrong.

13
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,600
Ju-yeon!

14
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,477
Ju-yeon…

15
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,567
Call that prick.

16
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,028
Then you two will live.

17
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,825
I can't call him.

18
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,536
Leave Mun alone!

19
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,663
Jeez, why don't you get it?

20
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,665
You moron!

21
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,427
No.

22
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,597
No!

23
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,394
EPISODE 4

24
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,647
A video call?

25
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,648
UNG-MIN

26
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,776
Hey, Ung-min.

27
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,991
-Mun…
-Ung-min.

28
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,909
Mun…

29
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,202
UNG-MIN

30
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,955
-Mun…
-Hey, Ung-min. What's wrong?

31
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,506
Ju-yeon. Lim Ju-yeon.

32
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,258
Ju-yeon!

33
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,514
Where are you?

34
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,726
You'd better get here before we kill them.

35
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,519
I asked you where you are now!

36
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,065
The school's abandoned factory.

37
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,539
Ju-yeon.

38
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,750
Ung-min, where are you?

39
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,795
Ung-min, answer me! Where are you?

40
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,217
Mun.

41
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,136
Don't fight.

42
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,180
Ju-yeon. Ung-min!

43
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,765
Let go. Get off me! Hey.

44
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,267
Ung-min, stay with me!

45
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,064
Yes! Now, we're talking.

46
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,777
A high-rise will go up on top of you
after we bury you guys here today.

47
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,988
Your epitaph will be "Taesin Apartment 5,"
you son of a bitch.

48
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,829
How could you do this?

49
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,625
How…

50
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,543
You can run, right?

51
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,212
Run.

52
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,548
How…

53
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,885
Why?

54
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,981
-Gi-ran, would you like some?
-No, thanks.

55
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,148
I can't taste anything.

56
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,654
Super spicy tteokbokki.

57
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,198
I want something spicy enough
to burn my tongue.

58
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,035
-You too, right?
-I want fries.

59
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,047
What's wrong, Wi-gen?

60
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,632
So…

61
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,093
So Mun.

62
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,261
Wi-gen.

63
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,684
Mun's in danger.

64
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,729
-Wi-gen.
-Get in touch with him.

65
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,856
Find him, quick!

66
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,399
He might kill someone.

67
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,237
Plus 840,000 won… It's gone up a lot.

68
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,369
Ms. Chu.

69
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,789
CLOSED

70
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,209
I've never seen
our territory shift like that.

71
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,378
My gosh.

72
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,011
Neither have I.

73
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,352
-Ha-na.
-Yes, U-sik.

74
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,856
What?

75
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,739
Mo-tak. Ga Mo-tak.

76
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,867
What's up?
I have a lot on my mind right now.

77
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,994
Go find Mun now. He's in danger.

78
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,496
Mun? What's wrong with him?

79
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,247
We can't get hold of him.

80
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,833
For some reason,
he can't control his emotions now.

81
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,585
Find him. Now.

82
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,921
Okay, I have to go.

83
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,885
Hey, Ha-na.

84
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,512
Mo-tak, did they contact you?

85
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,555
See the territory opening near the school?

86
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,556
He must be there.

87
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,326
I told you not to hurt my friends.

88
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,082
Is it that hard?

89
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,140
Let's end this.

90
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,934
Hey, end what?

91
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,065
You piece of…

92
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,740
Jun-gyu.

93
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,039
You piece of shit!

94
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,673
Hyeok-u!

95
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,477
I warned you that
you'd get it all back, twofold!

96
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,440
-Hey!
-Hands off! Let go!

97
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
-Let go!
-Hey!

98
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,320
-Hey.
-Mo-tak.

99
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,073
Calm down or you'll get into trouble.

100
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,575
Why did you do that?

101
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,414
I told them to stop.

102
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,209
I told them not to hurt them.

103
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,213
Okay, all right.

104
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,009
Hey, why are you crying?

105
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,470
You can get angry.

106
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,806
You can hit them.

107
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,060
I'm just trying to tell you
that you could've killed that punk

108
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,687
if you hadn't stopped.

109
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,107
Look, our territory has opened up.

110
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,569
This is why you need training,
you silly goose.

111
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,195
Okay?

112
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,331
What the…

113
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,669
See that?
Just throw little jabs like that.

114
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,380
Whack them without killing them.

115
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,553
Mun!

116
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,140
Mun!

117
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,060
What happened here?

118
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,896
Mun, did you do this?

119
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,773
I'm sorry.

120
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,655
Mun, this is wrong.

121
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,242
We cannot use our powers like this!

122
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,042
His nose is broken.

123
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,586
You hurt all these guys?

124
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,175
You punk! Did you even hit a girl?

125
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,885
No, he didn't.

126
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,181
These pricks hurt his friends badly.
That's why he lost it.

127
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,976
-My gosh.
-See those two?

128
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,521
That boy is Mun's crybaby bestie.
Get the picture?

129
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,191
Is that what happened?

130
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,110
I think his friends are okay.

131
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,696
They're beaten up pretty badly,
but no internal injury.

132
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,077
Ms. Chu, the cops are here.

133
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:04,955
Indeed.

134
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,208
Hey, Hyeok-u. Are you all right?

135
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,293
I told you that he's dangerous!

136
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,295
Hey, guys!

137
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,381
-This way. Come on.
-Crap.

138
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,263
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

139
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,641
Damn it. We're screwed, right?

140
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,109
What do we do?

141
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,821
We don't have time to heal them.
Let's erase their memory and run.

142
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,781
No, don't.

143
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:40,950
I'll just…

144
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,494
get punished for this.

145
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,247
-What?
-Why? Don't complicate things.

146
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,915
If I don't put an end to this now,

147
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,960
this will never end.

148
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,755
Mun.

149
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,632
Ung-min and Ju-yeon…

150
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,266
They're like parents to me.

151
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,310
They helped me overcome my aphasia

152
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,772
and walked by my side when I used to limp.

153
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,984
Yet they keep getting hurt because of me.

154
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,112
I won't let that happen anymore.

155
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,907
Things got out of hand,
so I'll be punished.

156
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,828
But I'll deal with it,
to end this for good.

157
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,580
Why should you be punished?

158
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,041
If you can't do anything
when your friends are hurt,

159
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,002
what are your powers for?

160
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,254
Well done.

161
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,840
You did the right thing, so stand tall.

162
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,760
Just let us sort this out, Mun.

163
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,306
Goodness gracious.

164
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,684
This reminds me of how my son
made me feel.

165
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,020
What? What do you mean?

166
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,229
He made me angry.

167
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,064
This reminds me of

168
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,942
what it's like to be a son.

169
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,028
What?

170
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,697
What it feels like to make Mom angry.

171
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,157
Gosh!

172
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,036
-We've got to leave.
-Hey!

173
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,746
-My gosh.
-Go on. Hurry.

174
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,915
-Mun.
-I'll be fine.

175
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,416
Gosh, what do I do?

176
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,426
My gosh.

177
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,887
Hey, wait. Hold on!

178
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,139
Wait, what about Mun?

179
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,766
Jeez!

180
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,935
Ju-yeon.

181
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,187
Ju-yeon, wake up.

182
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,232
Hey, Ung-min.

183
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,733
Ung-min.

184
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,319
Ung-min, wake up.

185
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,862
Ung-min!

186
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:45,950
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,576
It's my fault.

188
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,132
Over here.

189
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,261
Could you please call an ambulance?

190
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,478
What if he gets expelled from school?

191
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,063
He said he'll take responsibility

192
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,065
and deal with it, so have faith in him.

193
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,359
Deal with it all on his own? How?

194
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,860
He doesn't have parents.

195
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,905
Kids' fights are no different.

196
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,491
Rich kids get away with anything.

197
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,410
The poor ones always take the fall.

198
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,705
That's not "dealing with it." It's unfair.

199
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,164
Then how about

200
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,500
we say we're his parents?

201
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,002
What? Us?

202
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,504
You and me?

203
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,091
As if that's going to help him.

204
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,056
-What?
-What is this?

205
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,267
Are we thinking the same thing?

206
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,561
He wants to put an end to it.

207
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,646
We need our boss.

208
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,190
Honey.

209
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,402
Did you pray for Mun's recovery?

210
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,321
Yes.

211
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,118
He should be home by now.

212
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,082
He'll know the moment he gets home
because of the yummy smell.

213
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,962
"Oh, I smell Grandma's burger.

214
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,968
She must be feeling alert today."

215
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,723
"I bet she went on a date
with Grandpa after making this burger."

216
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,479
Well, he should understand.

217
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,107
Honey.

218
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,611
You have to outlive me
even if it's just by a day.

219
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,491
If you die before I do
and leave Mun and me behind,

220
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,579
how's Mun going to look after me
all on his own?

221
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,725
Yes, sir. We brought them to school.

222
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,185
Five with broken noses.

223
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,062
Five of them are at the hospital now.

224
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,357
The police officers
are encouraging them to settle.

225
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,651
The one who hurt them?

226
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,570
What's your name?

227
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,407
I'm So Mun. Class 4 in 11th grade.

228
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,075
I'll explain everything, sir.

229
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,077
His name is So Mun. Yes, 11th grade.

230
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,664
But, sir.

231
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,667
Shin Hyeok-u is one of the students
who got hurt.

232
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,711
Shin Hyeok-u.

233
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,380
You know, the mayor's son.

234
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,798
Yes.

235
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,050
Where is the teachers' lounge?

236
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,135
Jun-ho!

237
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,220
-Dad!
-Mom!

238
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,430
Jun-ho!

239
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,098
My goodness! What's going on?

240
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,891
-Dad!
-There he is!

241
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,811
-Dad!
-My goodness!

242
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,105
Hey, what happened to your face?

243
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,523
-Who did this?
-My gosh.

244
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,941
Who hurt my son?

245
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,067
-Goodness.
-My gosh!

246
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,445
Who did this to my son?

247
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,239
Hello, sir. Please calm down.

248
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,490
I did it.

249
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,701
What?

250
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,994
Where are the others?

251
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,579
You're all dead meat!

252
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,040
Ma'am, the thing is…

253
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,459
Apparently, he did it alone.

254
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,668
What?

255
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,173
This scrawny little boy
beat up all of them?

256
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,300
Did you take boxing classes?

257
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,677
Then you deserve an extra penalty.

258
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,680
You little prick. Where are your parents?

259
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,059
He doesn't have parents.
His grandfather is looking after him,

260
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,186
but we can't reach him at the moment.

261
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,396
Gosh, figures.

262
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,566
You can always spot orphans
from a mile away!

263
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,485
My goodness.

264
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,947
We won't forgive you even if
your grandpa begs us, so brace yourself.

265
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,241
Why should my grandfather beg you

266
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,659
when they hurt my friends--

267
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,204
-How dare you. You little--
-Sir, please!

268
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,456
-Sir.
-Please calm down.

269
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,541
How dare you talk like that!

270
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,085
Sir, please don't do this.

271
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,837
Lock up this little beggar.

272
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,506
We won't settle this case, punk!

273
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,925
How dare you call him a beggar!

274
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,313
I bet you don't even have a trillion won.

275
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,608
Hey! Let's see who ends up behind bars.

276
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,653
Who the hell is this prick?

277
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,904
What? "Prick"?

278
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,241
I'm that boy's guardian, you prick!

279
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,910
Oh, you're his guardian?

280
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,372
Here.

281
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,082
Your nose is bleeding.

282
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,917
I've seen him before.

283
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,378
I'll tell you what really happened.

284
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,340
Those bullies beat up his friends,
and he saved them.

285
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,009
This boy is a righteous hero.

286
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,803
Isn't it a touching story?

287
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:02,349
My son can't even kill an ant.
And yet what? He's a bully?

288
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,727
You must be out of your mind.
Do you have any proof?

289
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,189
Proof? There's plenty, you little jerk.

290
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,110
-Gosh!
-My goodness.

291
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,445
-Oh, gosh.
-Look, officers.

292
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,075
Did we really have to collect
these weapons ourselves from the scene?

293
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,744
This piece of the puzzle.

294
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,790
It's crucial because
those sons of bitches left these there.

295
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,959
-What the…
-Unbelievable.

296
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,503
Retrieve the fingerprints from these

297
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,423
and compare them with those punks'.

298
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,135
You're all guilty of attempted murder,
and this boy

299
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,304
acted in self-defense, you idiots.

300
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,139
Did you say "attempted murder"?

301
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,934
Old man, are you trying
to ruin my son's future?

302
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
Don't you dare!

303
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,272
You know what? One more thing.

304
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,399
Look, his nose is bleeding.

305
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,027
So what? You'll punch me or something?

306
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,905
-I must get even with you.
-Punch me.

307
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,239
Punch me, then!

308
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,533
Shut your mouth,
or I'll cut off your tongue!

309
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,785
-Jeez!
-Honey!

310
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,288
-Are you all right?
-My gosh, honey!

311
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,706
-Honey.
-He really hit him.

312
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,124
-Gosh.
-This is ridiculous!

313
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,542
-Oh, I know!
-What?

314
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,169
-Jangmul Retail.
-Sorry?

315
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,587
Chairman Choi Jang-mul!

316
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,714
Jangmul Retail?

317
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,965
-How dare he.
-No!

318
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,759
-Old man!
-No, don't!

319
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,344
-No!
-Please don't.

320
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,179
No! Let go!

321
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,347
Please don't do this.

322
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,642
Sir, all they need to do
is sincerely apologize to each other.

323
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,936
That will resolve everything.

324
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,562
Right, Mun?

325
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,357
Good. Just apologize to each other and--

326
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,524
Mun!

327
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,320
-Don't apologize to them.
-Never!

328
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,989
You think it was just a prank?

329
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,991
Look what happened.

330
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,077
This is nothing.

331
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,538
Someone got 20 stitches
after getting beaten up by them.

332
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,831
A few even dropped out.

333
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,501
Hey, why did you leave the hospital?

334
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,378
-Go home. Go on.
-Hey! Stop!

335
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,005
What are you doing?

336
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,549
Are you really a teacher?

337
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,511
The positive change
this righteous boy brought

338
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,055
helped them muster up the courage
to step in like this.

339
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,058
How could you hurt their feelings
and tell them to leave?

340
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,601
What's your job?

341
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:14,398
As a teacher, you should listen
to your students and be impartial!

342
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,984
That's how you teach them
to become better.

343
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,698
Hey, officers. See these steel pipes
lying around at school?

344
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,866
-My gosh.
-And you're saying we should settle?

345
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,784
Answer me.

346
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,452
Oh, right.

347
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,707
I heard one of the bullies
is the mayor's son.

348
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,083
So you're playing it safe?

349
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,793
Is that it?

350
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,461
Yes?

351
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,339
You don't want to get on his bad side,

352
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,842
so you're ignoring this
and how bad things can get!

353
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,972
I'd like to make a formal request
as his guardian.

354
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,974
There are many victims!

355
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,935
Investigate every case.

356
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,189
Find all the bullies
who hurt other students

357
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,401
and reprimand them.

358
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,287
All right.

359
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,081
It must've been stressful for you.

360
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,601
About today…

361
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,103
Thank you.

362
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,274
No problem. Just focus
on doing your best as a Counter.

363
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,486
I'll clean up all the mess.
Do you understand?

364
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,738
Yes.

365
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,783
-Ha-na.
-Go on in.

366
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,451
They're waiting for you.

367
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,830
All right. Good night.

368
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,676
Mun!

369
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,638
What? You recognize me, Grandma?

370
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,723
What's wrong?

371
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,892
Gosh, you silly goose.

372
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:19,106
We just got a call from your school.

373
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,858
Your teacher said
you were involved in a fight.

374
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,862
Let me see. Look at me. Are you hurt?

375
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,282
What happened? Do your classmates

376
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,703
make fun of you and bully you?
Are they mean to you?

377
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,622
Not at all, Grandma.

378
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,833
-I'm totally fine, Grandpa.
-Gosh.

379
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,334
They didn't hurt your feelings?

380
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,046
-Of course not.
-Thank goodness.

381
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,842
-My gosh.
-Okay, good. I'm relieved.

382
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,510
-Thank goodness.
-Gosh.

383
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,805
Gosh, my dear. Stop worrying.
He says he's fine.

384
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,974
-Okay?
-My gosh.

385
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,768
Grandma, you must've been really worried.

386
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,562
-I'm sorry.
-My sweetheart.

387
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,230
You haven't eaten yet, right?

388
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,815
Come on. Let's get you some food.

389
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,400
-Let's go inside.
-Yes.

390
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,111
Let's go eat. You should have dinner.

391
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,822
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

392
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,449
Grandma, just a moment.

393
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,531
Honey, Mun is walking.

394
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,117
-Look.
-My gosh, Mun.

395
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,626
What did I tell you?

396
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,753
I told you about my dream!

397
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,129
I saw him walk in my dream.

398
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,049
-Gosh.
-Oh, my goodness.

399
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,719
My gosh, what happened?

400
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,473
Oh, my.

401
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:22,229
I'm so happy for you.

402
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,814
My sweetheart.

403
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,983
My goodness.

404
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,821
-Oh, my.
-Thank God.

405
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,200
My gosh.

406
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,118
Gosh.

407
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,005
What is it?
Is this making you miss your family?

408
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:49,965
No, it's not.

409
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,424
Let's go.

410
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,772
EONNI'S NOODLES

411
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,280
Someone's up already?

412
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,743
What?

413
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,961
Why are you working out
first thing in the morning?

414
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,756
I feel frustrated.

415
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,717
Look at you. You're ripped.

416
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,427
What's the matter?

417
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,893
As I don't remember a thing,

418
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,605
I feel like a total idiot.

419
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,319
Why? That was out of the blue.

420
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,572
Someone killed me,

421
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,867
but I don't remember anything.

422
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,206
What kind of cases was I working on
at the time?

423
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,667
Who did I mess with to go through that?

424
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,253
I'm fuming mad,

425
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,927
but I don't know
who to direct my anger to.

426
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,765
By the way, what happened?

427
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,934
You went to the police station yesterday.

428
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,320
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

429
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,738
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY
SO GWON

430
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,281
What is this?

431
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,203
"Gyeonggi Nambu Police Agency, So Gwon"?

432
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,747
Hey, isn't this Mun's father?

433
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,419
When I woke up in the hospital
seven years ago,

434
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,380
I found it inside my pocket.

435
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,967
Mun's father's business card?

436
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,135
Seven years ago?

437
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,471
Life's a mysterious beast, isn't it?

438
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,891
Hold on. This means…

439
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,019
Does this mean you and Mun's father

440
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,480
knew each other?

441
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,360
Maybe we just exchanged business cards.

442
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,821
Or, maybe we were close.

443
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,699
I don't remember.

444
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,120
But on the same day in Jungjin,

445
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,748
both he and I

446
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,959
got into a mysterious accident.

447
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,551
Then it can't be a coincidence.

448
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,762
And the way the police
dealt with both cases…

449
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,182
I'm thinking the bastard who attacked me

450
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,435
and the person who killed Mun's parents

451
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,105
could be the same person.

452
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,317
Gosh. Oh, dear.

453
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,201
A kid who was only 11 back then

454
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,411
lost his parents
because of this case you covered up.

455
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,164
Can you really

456
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,708
take responsibility for this report?

457
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,753
You know who I am.

458
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,173
But you're pretending not to know me.

459
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,218
What are you hiding?

460
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,554
What made you do something like this
to your colleague

461
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,973
who was on the verge of death

462
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,601
after getting attacked?

463
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,521
What can you do now?

464
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,399
You suddenly vanished from the hospital.

465
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,610
Why show up now?

466
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,990
You lost your memory.

467
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,078
Just keep living like that.

468
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,374
No, I refuse.

469
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,878
I've been living like that,

470
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,173
but no more.

471
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,888
You guys found my stuff at the scene.

472
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,182
My phone.

473
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,102
I'll come to collect it tomorrow.

474
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,146
If you say you lost it
or try to bullshit me,

475
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,107
I'll barge in there and make a big scene.

476
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,819
So find it.

477
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,040
Where is Lieutenant Kim Jeong-yeong?

478
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,500
Over there.

479
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,678
Hello, ma'am.

480
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,806
I'm Kang Han-ul,
here on probation as of September 18.

481
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,311
Which team?

482
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,188
I was told you will be
my supervisor, ma'am.

483
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,531
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT 2

484
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,081
Shall I accept you as my assistant or not?

485
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:01,711
I have to say, I'm grateful and concerned
at the same time.

486
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,048
-Pardon me?
-They totally ignored me when I asked them

487
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,382
to send help.

488
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:07,967
Oh, I see.

489
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,472
Hey, sit down.

490
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,684
Where should I sit?

491
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,312
Anywhere. It's all empty.

492
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,147
I see.

493
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,660
Where's everyone else on the team?

494
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,536
-There's no one else.
-Pardon?

495
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,289
Did you hear anything about me?

496
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,167
I'm an outcast here.

497
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,711
Oh.

498
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,383
A suspect in the karaoke rape case.

499
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,051
We arrested him last night.

500
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,553
We'll interview him again later today.
Go over it.

501
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,471
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,267
You heard the news, right?
They'll investigate all the bullies.

503
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,645
There are so many cops outside.

504
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,773
I heard Mun took them down in just a day.

505
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,274
-There's something else.
-What?

506
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,653
Mun's adoptive father is
Choi Jang-mul at Jangmul Retail.

507
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,904
-Really?
-That's not true.

508
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,280
-He's his heir.
-Seriously?

509
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,116
-Yes. Isn't it him?
-Isn't that Mun?

510
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,033
It's him.

511
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,119
It's definitely him.

512
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,662
You're his heir?

513
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,205
Seriously?

514
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,291
Did you report everything to the police?

515
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,004
We did. Nothing scares us anymore.
Jangmul Retail has our backs.

516
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,214
Don't change the subject. You're his heir?

517
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,341
-We said we'd ask no questions.
-Please!

518
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,135
-What?
-I'm sorry, guys.

519
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,263
It's okay. It's all good, buddy.

520
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,849
Gosh. You keep acting like a stranger.

521
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,729
Is it okay for you to walk around
without your cane?

522
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,731
The kids will see you.

523
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,316
-Isn't it interesting?
-What is?

524
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,653
Now that everyone thinks I'm a rich heir,

525
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,240
no one suspects anything even when
they see me walking fine.

526
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,159
No one's even fascinated.

527
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,453
I know. Does it not hurt?

528
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,788
No, it's totally fine.

529
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,125
Look, they're sealing off
the bullies' hangout.

530
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,379
Is it really

531
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,173
all over now?

532
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,550
Yes, it is.

533
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,928
The police will interrogate all those guys
including Jun-gyu and Hyeok-u.

534
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,847
We no longer have to

535
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,308
put up with their beatings?

536
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,979
Ung-min.

537
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,774
I can't believe it.

538
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,616
They dragged me here
and beat the crap out of me.

539
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,409
It hurt. It was so unfair.

540
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,038
I felt so useless and worthless.

541
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,124
I was miserable.

542
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,380
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know you suffered so much.

543
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,634
You were always smiling,
so I didn't think it was a big deal.

544
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,054
-I'm really sorry.
-Hey, stop crying.

545
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,639
-I'm not crying!
-He's not crying!

546
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,601
You're both crying now. Hey!

547
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,980
Hey, mister. Look here.

548
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,362
Jeez, what's with that grumpy face?

549
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,206
GOT ARRESTED, MY DAD'S SO SCREWED

550
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,963
NEW POST

551
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,590
You're done?

552
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,718
This isn't the time to bluff.

553
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,638
Do you know how important today is
for Mr. Mayor?

554
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,266
Even a single news story
containing your name

555
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,476
could ruin key projects for Jungjin.

556
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,189
-You can get going now, ma'am.
-All right.

557
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,150
What a life.

558
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,986
I want to be in deep shit but can't.

559
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,824
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE FOR OUR SAFE NATION

560
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,120
The third redevelopment
will affect an area surrounding

561
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,164
Wolhwa-dong that measures 450,000 pyeong.

562
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,001
The key of this project
is incorporating nature

563
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,128
into our homes and workspaces.

564
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,381
While keeping the ecosystems intact,

565
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,217
we will build various cultural,
entertainment, health,

566
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,304
and recreational facilities
in this eco park.

567
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,099
Just like Central Park in New York
and Hyde Park in London,

568
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,645
I'm confident that it will become
a world-famous park.

569
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,647
This project will create 80,000 jobs.

570
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,942
Our yearly revenue goal
is 90 trillion won.

571
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,486
Want to make some money?

572
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,073
I'll take good care of you,

573
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,911
so come to Jungjin!
That's what I want to say.

574
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,916
Thank you! Yes.

575
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,376
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT

576
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,340
Hello?

577
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,050
Ma'am. It's me, Han-ul.

578
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,844
About Lim Jae-cheol,
the suspect in the karaoke rape case.

579
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,513
I was told to let him go.

580
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,349
Who said that?

581
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,227
Mr. Pyo.

582
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,313
Damn it.

583
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,107
Keep him there. I'll be there in five.

584
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,151
Keep him there at all costs!

585
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,584
What the hell?

586
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,420
I'd rather deal with drug
or robbery charges.

587
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,924
-That was embarrassing.
-I'm sorry.

588
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,885
I take care of everything for you
on that front.

589
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,305
Come on, man. That's…
That's no fun, you know?

590
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,725
I'm starving.

591
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,813
-Shit!
-Jeez. What's she doing?

592
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:54,730
Get out.

593
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,565
Lim Jae-cheol, get out!

594
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,026
-That smarty-pants detective.
-Detective?

595
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,654
-She's hot!
-I said, get out!

596
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,572
Get out of the way, will you?

597
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,825
Honk! You think you're it
because you're pretty?

598
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,704
-Jeez, my goodness.
-Gosh, that smarty-pants.

599
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,621
Get out!

600
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,040
Hey! Damn it!

601
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,252
CIVIL PETITION OFFICE

602
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,223
My gosh, why are you so upset?

603
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,683
Did you get dumped?

604
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,642
-Hey.
-Ma'am.

605
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,439
CHIEF'S OFFICE

606
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,356
Chief.

607
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,191
CHIEF CHOI SU-RYONG

608
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,777
I sent you a helping hand
because you kept pestering me.

609
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,780
What now?

610
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,867
Is our station one where thugs
can complain and get what they want?

611
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,410
Care to elaborate?

612
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,746
They let Lim Jae-cheol go.

613
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,748
Why aren't you doing anything about it?

614
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,416
Who is Lim Jae-cheol?

615
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,091
Look. They're dating, Lieutenant Kim.

616
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,594
He didn't rape her.
They're seeing each other.

617
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,637
A fling, okay?

618
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,598
One of you should get out.

619
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,267
I'll take that as my cue.

620
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,698
You may outrank him,
but his position is higher.

621
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,118
Without his approval, your cases

622
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,412
can never make it to my desk.

623
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,623
That's why you're using him.

624
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,169
He accepted bribes and got suspended,
but you brought him back just to do that.

625
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,004
So he can cover up all cases

626
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,507
that involve thugs
before they make it to your desk.

627
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,424
Kim Jeong-yeong!

628
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,968
What was it, sir?

629
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,680
The case that you covered up
along with Mo-tak's case.

630
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,598
What was it?

631
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,647
Those thugs have been keeping you
on a tight leash since that day.

632
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,775
That's when it all began, right?

633
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,070
Or…

634
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,200
Are you trying to embark
on a new chapter of your life?

635
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,202
Is that it?

636
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,870
Why? Do you want a promotion?

637
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,873
-Chief!
-You are free to keep

638
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,959
that holier-than-thou attitude.

639
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,129
Right, I admire you
for trying to maintain your integrity.

640
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,298
But don't make a fuss
about others not doing the same.

641
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,517
You guys found my stuff at the scene.

642
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,144
I'll come to collect it tomorrow.

643
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,819
Mo-tak.

644
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,237
Sir. Sir?

645
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,739
Mo-tak, no…

646
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,740
What happened?

647
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,286
Are you his guardian?

648
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,997
Please double-check his chest X-ray.

649
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,046
OPERATING ROOM

650
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,659
PHOTO OF EVIDENCE

651
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,578
PHOTO OF EVIDENCE

652
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,508
It needs to be restored.

653
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,552
It wasn't possible back then,

654
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,055
but it may be possible now.

655
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,307
I didn't think you'd give it back.

656
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,019
You said you'd barge in and cause a scene.

657
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,480
That scared you?

658
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,776
Don't come to the station again.

659
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,445
For your own sake.

660
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,241
What will you do with this?

661
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,538
I want to reconnect with my past.

662
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,207
My forgotten past.

663
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,584
Who did I speak to?

664
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,045
What kinds of text messages did I send?

665
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,925
What did I see and feel?
What made me angry?

666
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,097
What did I wish for
while working on the cases?

667
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:39,890
All of it.

668
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,235
Contact this forensics expert.

669
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,529
The police don't know him.

670
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,618
You're confusing me here.

671
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,748
You don't look like the type
to cut deals to cover up for assholes.

672
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,127
We were a couple.

673
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,005
You and I.

674
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:17,803
What?

675
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,681
We were what?

676
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,726
If you find anything about your cases,

677
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,893
share it with me.

678
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,189
Don't show up covered in blood
like you did seven years ago.

679
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,400
Then did you… Hey, wait!

680
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:37,906
Have you…

681
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,369
been waiting for me

682
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,123
for the past seven years?

683
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,879
No. Not anymore.

684
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,672
Anyway, call me.

685
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,139
ICT VALLEY,
WHERE WORK, LIFE, AND NATURE COEXIST

686
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:07,770
Hey.

687
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,022
I'm here.

688
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,106
TAESIN GROUP

689
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,735
My, Taesin vision.

690
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,029
They cleaned this office very well.

691
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,201
Where's the boss? Did he step out?

692
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,078
I came to say hello now that I'm out.

693
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,872
What the heck?

694
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,749
I told you not to be such a thug.

695
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,960
And you'd better watch what you say.

696
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,046
"Boss"?

697
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,341
Okay, fine.

698
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,510
Mr. Chairman.

699
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:40,761
You prick.

700
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,764
If you do drugs one more time,

701
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,058
I will finish you off myself.

702
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,060
Just return to work.

703
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,770
You should earn your keep.

704
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,688
What's going on?

705
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,982
The redevelopment isn't completed yet?

706
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,235
You guys can't function without me.

707
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,320
It's been such a headache.

708
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,114
Hey.

709
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,866
Remember that detective?

710
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,368
Detective?

711
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,789
Oh, him.

712
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,167
He had an unusual name.

713
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,711
What about him?

714
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,921
I saw his look-alike.

715
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,927
What are you saying?

716
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,679
That bastard died years ago.

717
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,347
I said, his look-alike.

718
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,819
ANCHOVIES

719
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,782
Gosh, Mun. You need to remove the guts.

720
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,742
Goodness.

721
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,415
Yes, Su-ho.

722
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,376
Kwon Su-ho.

723
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,003
He's her partner in the afterlife.

724
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,048
What did you say?

725
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,634
They'll strip Mun of his rights
as a Counter.

726
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,720
The team is discussing it now.

727
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,637
What?

728
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,015
I'll be in touch.

729
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,312
Call Mo-tak.

730
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,152
He lost it and hurt civilians!

731
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,030
He clearly violated his contract.

732
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,532
He can't control his emotions.

733
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,951
That's a huge flaw as a Counter.

734
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,038
He's emotionally unstable.

735
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,832
We must get rid of him.

736
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,375
It doesn't have to be Mun.

737
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,878
We can find another partner.

738
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,926
We should give him a chance to explain.

739
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,851
This isn't just about us and the Counters.

740
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,521
It's directly related to the lives
of innocent civilians.

741
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,278
What's up? What's going on?

742
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,740
"Do not use the powers
to get your revenge."

743
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:07,783
He violated the rule.

744
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,451
To get his revenge?

745
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,496
Because he beat up those punks?

746
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,706
They came at him with steel pipes.

747
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,084
Should he have warded them off
with a cross?

748
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,378
I can't lose my job as a Counter.

749
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,672
She promised me

750
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,049
I'll meet my parents if I do well.

751
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,426
Wi-gen said that?

752
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,096
That's what she promised you
in return for taking the job?

753
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,724
Yes, that's why I can't get fired.

754
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,187
When will this meeting end?

755
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,690
Are we going to wait
until they've decided?

756
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,734
I'll go up there and figure it out.

757
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,406
-Hey!
-Hey!

758
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,285
An anti-bullying committee? Up there?

759
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,578
How creative.

760
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,246
This isn't good.

761
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,415
I should go up there too.

762
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,500
How dare they talk about firing my baby?

763
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,002
I'll go with you.

764
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:01,795
Gosh!

765
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,549
Why are they all going up there?

766
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,050
Jeez.

767
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,180
Mun.

768
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,688
That boy is Mun?

769
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,279
Hold your head high.

770
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,991
I'm here too.

771
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,296
It's been years, and he still
hasn't gotten the hang of it.

772
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,259
Get down.

773
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,596
Go on.

774
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:05,609
For Mun's case,
shouldn't we just wait and see?

775
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:09,071
It was so urgent that Wi-gen
jumped the gun without persuading him.

776
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,366
It's not right to just give it to him
and take it back.

777
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,288
Can you guarantee he won't lose it again?

778
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,125
Counters' mistakes can cost us our lives.

779
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,879
If they let their emotions
get out of control and kill someone,

780
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,422
we'll die too.

781
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,927
Wi-gen nearly died because of him.

782
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,970
You saw that.

783
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,308
You're hurting our feelings here.

784
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,019
We also risk our lives to do this.

785
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,230
So what's your point?

786
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,108
Did Mun make a mistake? Did Wi-gen die?

787
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,360
Are we dead? Are you dead?

788
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,029
As you can see, no one's dead.

789
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,990
We're all alive. That's what matters.

790
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,827
Cheol-jung died

791
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,286
while working for you.

792
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,040
We lost him less than two weeks ago.

793
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,751
But we're still working!

794
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,211
While risking our lives.

795
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:10,215
Wi-gen, you can't do this to Mun.

796
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,884
Even if he's in the wrong,

797
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,846
you should take his side
and stand up for him at least once.

798
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,139
He saved you.

799
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,227
Gosh.

800
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,938
Must you be so cruel to a kid?

801
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:25,897
Jeez.

802
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,024
If he kills someone,

803
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,901
it'll cost you your lives?

804
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,903
You're all coldhearted.

805
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,616
Have you ever thought
that he might save your lives?

806
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,910
That's what I've observed about him.

807
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,204
I should go in. The kid is…

808
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,249
Mun.

809
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,168
This boy… You saved his life.

810
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,382
Mun! Get him!

811
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,807
-Unbelievable!
-Wow!

812
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,353
He's adaptable, brave, and decisive,

813
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,772
and he has sound judgment.

814
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,109
All you do is
gather around this table and talk.

815
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,361
I cherish him a lot more than you guys.

816
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,743
Have we ever complained
about anything you told us to do?

817
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,162
Even when

818
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,831
we were hurt and injured on the job,
no one complained!

819
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,751
You may have hired us,

820
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,796
but we're doing everything in our power

821
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,091
to save more lives
and capture more evil spirits.

822
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,894
I guess we didn't need to come up.

823
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,687
Ms. Chu is standing up for all of us.

824
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,107
Because she knows that we have her back,

825
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,362
she can let it all out and fight for us.

826
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,074
Don't cry. Counters must not cry.

827
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,119
I will repay you.

828
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,538
For what?

829
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,373
The kindness you showed me today.

830
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,461
Wi-gen, I heard you promised Mun

831
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,464
that he'll meet his parents
if he does well.

832
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,968
Then you must protect him to the end.

833
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:23,056
At least we got our lives back
in return for working as Counters,

834
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,683
but what did he get?

835
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,518
He gets to see…

836
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,647
his parents just once?

837
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,316
But that is his only wish.

838
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,112
You have to keep your promise, right?

839
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,325
You must protect him until then!

840
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,501
CLOSED
JUNGJIN TENNIS COURT

841
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,519
JUNGJIN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT

842
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,397
Stop trying so hard.

843
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,358
Why are there so many assignments?

844
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,735
Are all colleges like that?

845
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,614
I just wanted to make
some new connections and get a degree.

846
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,490
Oh, boy.

847
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:27,871
Mr. Noh.

848
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,956
See that tennis court

849
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:34,085
and that driving range next to it?
The whole lot used to be mine.

850
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,837
There was a cattle shed.

851
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,547
What's Chairman Jeon doing here?

852
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,716
Back then, I had

853
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,218
a farmhand named Shin

854
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,764
who used to feed the cows
and clean their poop.

855
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,475
And that man

856
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,269
had a son.

857
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:56,274
You see, that boy was incredibly smart.

858
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,277
And he became successful.

859
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,696
Big-time.

860
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:03,949
Well…

861
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,368
He spent the city's budget

862
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:07,953
buying the land

863
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,581
where his father
used to work hard to clean cow poop.

864
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,499
Look at this!

865
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,793
This area is his playground now.

866
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,252
See that?

867
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,007
Oh, my.

868
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,927
It's been a while, Mayor Shin.

869
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,649
Hello, sir.

870
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,402
How have you been, sir?

871
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,903
I read in the newspapers that

872
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,114
you're very busy these days.

873
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,409
I hear that you're planning
to build a park on my land.

874
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,285
Without my permission.

875
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,416
You went ahead and announced the plan.

876
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,461
Does it mean I should just shut up
and do nothing about it?

877
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,505
Of course not, sir.

878
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,633
Thanks to me, you good-for-nothing
can live a decent life now.

879
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,471
It's only natural for me
to expect something in return.

880
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,558
Those who don't repay kindness

881
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,435
are no better

882
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,854
than lowly animals.

883
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,272
Sir.

884
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,818
My company is renting the land
from you anyway,

885
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,528
for the next 50 years.

886
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:25,947
What did you guys

887
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,533
bury in that land?

888
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,578
Did you bury someone?

889
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:40,628
You see, I heard some stories.

890
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,257
What do you mean, sir?

891
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,801
If it bothers you that much,

892
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,971
the city will buy it from you.

893
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,190
Even so,

894
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,819
I want you to do the math again
and bring me a revised plan.

895
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,572
Or you'll have to deal
with utter humiliation.

896
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,503
What? What about Chairman Jeon?

897
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,422
Jeez, okay.

898
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,341
All right.

899
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:32,889
Why start a family feud?
This is ridiculous.

900
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,519
Hey!

901
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,148
-Where's Sin?
-On the crane!

902
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:23,731
Kill him?

903
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,236
Well, that's not necessary.

904
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:35,326
Jeez, I have a bad feeling about this.
Damn it.

905
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,244
What's wrong?

906
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,830
Dad, will this put you
in a difficult position?

907
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,582
What?

908
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,834
Why would it put me
in a difficult position?

909
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,921
The only thing I'm guilty of

910
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,507
is working way too hard. That's all.

911
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:55,013
Also, I have you right by my side,
so I have nothing to worry about.

912
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,473
Right?

913
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,894
This old man must know

914
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,230
something about the reservoir
to act up like that.

915
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,149
Find out what he knows.

916
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,651
LAND PURCHASE AGREEMENT

917
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,655
And can you pick this up on your way back?

918
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,368
It has to be that cake.

919
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,286
APPLE MANGO CHIFFON

920
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,705
Apple mango chiffon cake. Got it?

921
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,253
Gosh, my dear son!

922
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:28,963
What's up?

923
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,760
Oh, you liked the seaweed soup?

924
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:38,890
Great. I'll buy you a nice dinner.
Meet me at the restaurant, okay?

925
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,893

926

00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,857
Oh, it's working.

00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,916
Wow, she's totally my type.

931
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,256
Sorry.

932
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,883
Let's see this one.

00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,929
YEONGGWANG VILLA

HAPPY 22ND BIRTHDAY, KIM YEONG-NIM

00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,688
Kim Jeong-yeong speaking.

936
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,439
Kim Yeong-nim.

937
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,192
Date of birth, March 4, 1992.

938
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,485
Check your case files.

939
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:39,325
The address is 37-2 Wolhwa-dong.

940
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,163
SEARCH FOR CASES

941
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,915
NO CASE FOUND

942
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,000
No case found.

943
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,210
Of course they deleted everything.

944
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,838
I'll look up the name.

945
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,674
SEARCH FOR INDIVIDUALS

946
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,635

KIM YEONG-NIM

948
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,055
DECEASED

949
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,098
It says "deceased."

950
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,350
What's the date?

951
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,477
September 16, 2018.

952
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,146
Did you say 2018?

953
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,232
Registered as dead
five years after going missing.

954
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,653
What?

955
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,115
I see. It was a missing person case.

956
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,867
September 16, 2013…

957
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:23,911
I'll call you back.

958
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,831
This. Can you zoom in?

959
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,880
And the call history?

960
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,882
I recovered it, but it's pretty bare.

961
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,195
It was clever of you to call Ms. Chu.
Good call.

962
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,697
Gi-ran was so adamant about it.

963
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,783
I figured you could use some help.

964
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,870
But I'm not sure if I made
the right decision.

965
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,373
I keep thinking of Jang Cheol-jung.

966
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:13,044
I hope I didn't throw Mun into danger.

967
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,630
What about me? I pushed my mom into it.

968
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,843
Since we both feel responsible for it,
how about

969
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,512
we cheat a little?

970
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,103
Find out where they reside now.

971
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,730
Are you really doing this?

972
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,940
It's against the rules.

973
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,483
You could be reprimanded.

974
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:48,204
It's also against the rules
to keep things from the other realm.

975
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,557
Year 2013.

976
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:09,934
So Gwon.

977
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,979
So Gwon.

978
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,901
Year 2011.

979
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,862
2011, 5 DEATHS

980
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:23,156
Year 2012.

981
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,117
Year 2014.

982
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,034
2014, 8 DEATHS

983
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,914
There's no 2013.

984
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,058
HAPPY 22ND BIRTHDAY, KIM YEONG-NIM

985
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,277
Yeonggwang Villa, Dongnam Mart?

986
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,570
It's Wolhwa-dong.

987
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,072
You know this neighborhood?

988
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:07,867
What is all this?

989
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,661
A case he worked on seven years ago,
apparently.

990
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,372
You found it?

991
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,415
Oh, right.

992
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,795
We could use this.

993
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,506
This is the phone I had
when I got attacked.

994
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,841
You can see my past through this, right?

995
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,802
You can see who whacked me.

996
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:30,139
No, it won't work
because your memory is gone.

997
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,520
In other words, there is no data to read.

998
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,525
Was it a homicide case?

999
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,069
Probably.

1000
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,404
I'll start investigating it.

1001
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,572
Don't.

1002
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,493
You found leads, and that's good enough.

1003
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,744
Hand it over to the cops.

1004
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,539
It's their job, not ours.

1005
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,499
But it's about me and Mun.

1006
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:57,834
Is it not our job?

1007
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,253
It's about Mun?

1008
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,005
It's not about catching evil spirits.

1009
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:07,385
You saw Mun being summoned and scolded.
Have you forgotten about it?

1010
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:11,055
How could you try to meddle
in human affairs as if nothing happened?

1011
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,273
These bastards are worse
than evil spirits.

1012
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,486
They murdered a little girl,

1013
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:27,989
whacked me,

1014
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,241
and killed Mun's parents.

1015
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,996
After completely destroying
so many people's lives,

1016
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,206
they can still sleep,

1017
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,835
eat good food, laugh with their families,

1018
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,421
and have a blast.

1019
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,300
Do you want to get fired?

1020
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:52,138
If the heavens let us go,
we'll revert back to a vegetative state.

1021
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,266
We managed to help Mun keep his job,

1022
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,268
but this is different.

1023
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,103
Gi-ran won't let this slide.

1024
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,063
You're right.

1025
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,065
You two stay out of it.

1026
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:04,609
Mo-tak!

1027
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,324
The last person I spoke to…

1028
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,618
RECENTS

1029
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:14,619
SO GWON

1030
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:21,000
Did I ask this person to save me?

1031
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,881
Or was I trying to tell him
something important?

1032
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:30,885
That last call

1033
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,387
was with So Gwon.

1034
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,518
Mun's father?

1035
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,187
Yes.

1036
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,524
But for some reason, his number…

1037
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:47,860
looks familiar.

1038
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,613
I don't recall anything,

1039
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,239
but his number…

1040
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:54,825
I recognize it.

1041
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,410
SO GWON

1042
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,339
Hello?

1043
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:13,344
Hello?

1044
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,537
Hey, please…

1045
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,916
You punk. Hey! What are you doing?

1046
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,919
Hey! Stop!

1047
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,012
I…

1048
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,847
I was too greedy.

1049
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:02,059
Don't kill me. I swear,
I'll never bring it up again!

1050
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,769
I won't tell anyone.

1051
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,856
I signed the contract!

1052
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:07,898
Spare my life.

1053
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,942
I really… Don't kill me!

1054
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:14,321
Don't kill me. I won't tell anyone.

1055
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,532
I really mean it!

1056
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,303
There was a territory shift out front.

1057
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,850
You know...
I think he can summon Yung's territory.

1058
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:07,935
Summon the territory?

1059
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,937
Now's your chance to clamp down on him.

1060
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,105
Why'd you do it?

1061
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:12,940
Because I wanted to kill him.

1062
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:14,692
Even if you're a pro,

1063
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:16,569
you're bound to leave a drop behind.

1064
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,695
I spotted one.

1065
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,822
At Jungjin Department Store.

1066
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:20,990
-I found it.
-What?

1067
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:23,075
-Which floor?
-Remember, safety first.

1068
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,745
I'll go.

1069
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,040
