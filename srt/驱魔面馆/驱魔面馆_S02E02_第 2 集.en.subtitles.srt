1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,186
You'll feel refreshed
once you get some sleep.

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,942
I hope things will start
looking up for them now.

4
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,236
Me too.

5
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,990
Jun-hui's starting school next year,
so I'm worried.

6
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,826
He's been hurt emotionally,

7
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,621
so opening up won't be easy.

8
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,629
I know some people.

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,841
They're the best
at opening people's hearts.

10
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,177
A part-time job? What kind?

11
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,096
Ms. Lim, at your service
for part-time jobs.

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:39,974
What's the job?

13
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,436
You just need to play with a kid
and teach him Korean.

14
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,855
-It's pretty simple.
-I see. What's the hourly pay?

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,107
Does it matter?
You're still preparing for college.

16
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,068
In any case, he can't do it. No way.

17
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,611
But I'm in college, so I can.

18
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,279
Pick me.

19
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,656
You ate so much already.

20
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,702
Let go.

21
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,455
I know you've been eating
only the fish cakes.

22
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,706
Because they're the best.

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,583
-Let go? Over my dead body.
-What?

24
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,293
-You're trying to eat them all.
-Hey.

25
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,336
I was saving them.

26
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,839
We can just order more.

27
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,356
What? What is it this time?

28
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,984
You two.

29
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,277
What's going on?

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,570
What?

31
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,988
Your lipsâ€¦

32
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,990
Did you two kiss?

33
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,449
Are you two dating?

34
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,660
I told you not to tell him!

35
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,620
When did I ever tell him?

36
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,997
Stop moving those lips!

37
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,333
How could this happen among family?

38
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,377
You see, we're not family by law--

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,171
Forget it. I'm not giving you the job.

40
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,422
-Never.
-We can do it.

41
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,715
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

42
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,218
EPISODE 2

43
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,139
Where am I?

44
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,767
The police station, you idiot.

45
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,313
I told you I don't remember!

46
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,321
This is nice, isn't it?

47
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,324
So these heinous bastards

48
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,076
engaged in illegal gambling,
gave out predatory loans,

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,037
and even trafficked organs.

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,205
But these same terrible guys

51
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,001
were lying on the floor
after fighting each other,

52
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,295
and Mo-tak just happened to find them

53
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,048
while looking for the toilet?

54
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,591
Yes, that's correct.

55
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,634
Right.

56
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,969
God, I'm sweating.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,893
-Han-ul.
-Yes, sir?

58
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,813
What's your take on this entire situation?

59
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,775
He's outstanding at his job.

60
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,152
But I just don't understand.

61
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,196
Is it just me?

62
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,826
Let's just do what we can
and provide better toilet paper, sir.

63
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,037
Right?

64
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,288
Something better.

65
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,000
Better toilet paper.
We should do that, right? Let's do that.

66
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,129
EONNI'S NOODLES

67
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,256
You saw it, right?

68
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,299
Right in front of Jun-huiâ€¦

69
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:23,096
Bam! I stopped that shining blade.

70
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,016
That's what a hero does.

71
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,185
At the most critical moment,

72
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,187
bam!

73
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,441
I knew something was odd.

74
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,901
You could all do it.

75
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,611
It was odd how only I couldn't, right?

76
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,740
I was subconsciously waiting
for this very moment.

77
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,325
-I, Ga Mo-tak--
-All right.

78
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,578
We get it, so enough gloating
and help us with these anchovies.

79
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,622
Must we

80
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,374
do this

81
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,875
with our hands?

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,253
Let me use my psychokinesis.

83
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,796
Watch carefully.

84
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,093
It won't even budge.

85
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,347
It's time to rise, anchovies.

86
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,186
Your nose is bleeding.

87
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,731
What? My nose is bleeding?

88
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,150
You can't use psychokinesis so recklessly.

89
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,570
No, I have to make it work. I can do this.

90
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,529
-I can.
-Sure.

91
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,407
Don't we have more than enough stock?

92
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,700
Is there a group reservation?

93
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,744
I think Min-ji has morning sickness.

94
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,496
The only thing she could stomach
was our noodles.

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,166
I'm hoping this will help her
regain her appetite.

96
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,085
Mr. Ma's going to be eternally grateful.

97
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,840
Don't stare. Just let him be.

98
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,341
He'll be at it for a while.

99
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,385
-I give a couple days.
-I say longer.

100
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,305
We're working hard,
and he's hardly working.

101
00:05:55,855 --> 00:06:00,068
As you already know, Sosun,
the mart lady is all-knowing.

102
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,862
She even knows the number
of silkworms in the field.

103
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:07,492
So my blind date will definitely be
my soulmate, right?

104
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,248
Goodness.

105
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,168
Good.

106
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,669
You're healthy, all right.

107
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,258
All right. Keep it up.

108
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,762
I can see you're rooting for me.

109
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,306
Go ahead. Poop some more.

110
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,975
Let's both work hard.

111
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,771
We'll both muster up our energy
and meet our soulmates.

112
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,064
What do you say?

113
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,149
All right.

114
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,818
Good luck to both of us, okay?

115
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,820
Eat up.

116
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,572
I'll be back.

117
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,928
Is that really him?

118
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,597
What kind of app does he use?

119
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,349
Is it even the same guy?

120
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,852
I should just leave.

121
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,980
Su-min, over here.

122
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,982
It's me, Jeok-bong.

123
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,069
Su-min, thank you for the coffee.

124
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,739
I've never met a guy who only brought
his bus pass to a blind date.

125
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,657
That was new.

126
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,911
I thought lattes were sweet,
but this is bitter.

127
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,580
They must use bad cow milk.

128
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,039
-Cow milk?
-Yes.

129
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,416
I see. Cow milk.

130
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,586
We don't need to cut grass
or feed them fodder anymore.

131
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,795
HE'S THE WORST

132
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,880
What?

133
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,381
So you don't need to worry.

134
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,508
Wait, I'm cursing out the one
who introduced us.

135
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,469
Why is cow dung so thick?

136
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,428
Cow dung?

137
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,971
I stepped in it today. Sorry.

138
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,767
You can use cow dung to cook rice,
make medicine, and even build houses.

139
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,686
Anyway, cow dung is--

140
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,646
I'm really sorry.

141
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,275
But since you kept mentioning
cow dung, I really need to poop.

142
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,860
I need to use the restroom.

143
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,489
Talking about cow dung
is making my gut react.

144
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,574
I'll need a couple days to poop.

145
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,617
-Bye.
-But--

146
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,785
Su-min, the toilet is over--

147
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,829
Su-min.

148
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,377
Su-min!

149
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,714
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION, CAPTAIN KIM

150
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,758
I said I'm on my way.

151
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,386
Can't you do anything without me?

152
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,765
What theâ€¦

153
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,058
Hey.

154
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,310
Su-min, hold on!

155
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,562
Su-min.

156
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,731
Su-min.

157
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,526
Su-min, watch out for the truck!

158
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,047
Administer 200 ml. Where is it? Hurry.

159
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,674
My goodness.

160
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,925
Jeok-bong,

161
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,511
it's all my fault.

162
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,847
I'm a worthless father.

163
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,808
I'm the one to blame.

164
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,143
Jeok-bong.

165
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,354
Jeok-bongâ€¦

166
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,448
Jeok-bong.

167
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,617
Jeok-bongâ€¦

168
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,999
With a noble self-sacrificing attitude,
he risked his own life to save another.

169
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,091
He also seems to be
an immensely devoted son.

170
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,012
I've found him.

171
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,973
A Counter.

172
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,475
The right man for the job.

173
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,958
Sosun?

174
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,560
Where in the world am I?

175
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,330
Is that a person?

176
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,959
Excuse me!

177
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,755
Over here!

178
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:33,567
Goodness, what's that?
Is she from Greek mythology or something?

179
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,830
Na Jeok-bong?

180
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,958
You can speak Korean.

181
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,043
What?

182
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,796
But how did you know my name?

183
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,258
This is Yung.

184
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,389
You're in a coma right now.

185
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,646
A coma?

186
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,064
What is that?

187
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,192
You probably don't remember the accident.

188
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,405
But while saving someone's life,

189
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,283
you sacrificed your own.

190
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,542
Does that meanâ€¦

191
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,713
You're in a vegetative state.

192
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,591
You're residing between life and death.

193
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,011
I am?

194
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,097
Butâ€¦

195
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,642
I've never had a girlfriend yet.

196
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,269
I haven't done much in life.

197
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,982
I'm going to die after cleaning up
cow dung my entire life?

198
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,196
Then, is this heaven?

199
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,368
But if you sign up to become a Counter,

200
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,788
we can wake you up from your coma.

201
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,874
Countâ€¦

202
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,793
What's that?

203
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,547
Follow me.

204
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,359
What? There's a door.

205
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,611
You want me to catch evil spirits?

206
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,285
Do you think I can do it?

207
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,621
I'm not even a good runner.

208
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,040
Cleaning up cow dung is all I can do.

209
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,419
What if I only get in the way?

210
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,547
Saving humans from evil spirits

211
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,924
is not easy to do.

212
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,260
You could get hurt.

213
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,263
Perhaps,

214
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,308
you could even die.

215
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,524
Sure, being strong is important
to become a Counter.

216
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,902
But the most important thing is

217
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,863
being dedicated to saving lives.

218
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,407
And that's you.

219
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,374
You don't need to give me
an answer right now.

220
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,794
You can think about it.

221
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,921
By the wayâ€¦

222
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,882
If I do become a Count,

223
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,886
will I be able to go home after work?

224
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,306
You seeâ€¦

225
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,603
Sosun doesn't eat if I don't feed her.

226
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,066
Then, there's my father
and the village youth group.

227
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm quite busy since I'm the only one
who can take care of them.

228
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,529
No, I can't.

229
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,700
Right, how are the working conditions?

230
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,244
Are the four major insurances guaranteed?

231
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,501
COURT

232
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,478
Sir.

233
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,813
Move, lady.

234
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,899
-Move.
-Please give us our money back.

235
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,944
My husband risked his life
while earning it.

236
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,570
-I'm begging you.
-Lady, come on.

237
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,364
-Please, sir.
-Enough.

238
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,574
-Damn it!
-Seong-uk.

239
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,702
Come on.

240
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,619
Jeez.

241
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:42,334
Case number 2022,
Criminal 273, third trial.

242
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,880
This court will announce its ruling
on the Baekdu Dynasty housing fraud case.

243
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,553
We sentence the defendant,
Park Seong-uk, to two years in prison.

244
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,307
However, effective after this sentencing,

245
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,977
the defendant will serve
three years of probation.

246
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,649
This is not fair!

247
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,654
Order in the court!

248
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,283
Order in the court!

249
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,800
There he is!

250
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,135
You bastard!

251
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,068
TREASURE'S DAD

252
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,946
You bastard!

253
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,659
Wait, it's not him.

254
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,411
Where the hell is Park Seong-uk?

255
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,246
You're with him, aren't you?

256
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,597
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

257
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,100
Does this building have another exit?

258
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,267
Wellâ€¦

259
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,228
It's around that corner.

260
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,188
-Thank you.
-No problem.

261
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,402
Damn it.

262
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,865
Your body double will buy you enough time,
so don't worry too much.

263
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,159
The car is in basement floor three.

264
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,454
Can I have a smoke?

265
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,879
What was that?

266
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,714
Did you press something?

267
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,508
No, sir. Why isn't this working?

268
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,934
What the hell is going on?

269
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,436
Damn it.

270
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,109
Let's maintain our class.

271
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,003
How have you been, Mr. Park?

272
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,214
Who the hell are you?

273
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,109
Mr. Hwang.

274
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,321
Sir.

275
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,324
I had no idea you were still alive.

276
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,533
I was so worried.

277
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,620
I looked everywhere for you
after you suddenly vanished.

278
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,581
Where's my money?

279
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,375
I have absolutely no idea, sir.

280
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,502
President Lee had the money but suddenly--

281
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,340
He suddenly died.

282
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,637
Chung-jae died at the right time.

283
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,598
He fulfilled his duties.

284
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,226
But he couldn't have taken

285
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,938
that money to the afterlife.

286
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,441
It's the truth. I have no idea.

287
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,069
-I wouldn't dare lie to--
-Damn it!

288
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,780
You're quite the actor.

289
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,618
You could've fooled me with those eyes.

290
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,166
You've done your job
now that everyone's seen your face.

291
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,335
Both Chung-jae

292
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,129
and you.

293
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,842
First, why don't we get out of here?

294
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,135
Too many people are here.

295
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,887
Let me explain everything--

296
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,764
You talk too much.

297
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,182
Oh, God.

298
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,402
Iâ€¦

299
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,780
Why mess with our money, you little peon?

300
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,284
The crook Park Seong-uk
needs to be punished!

301
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,078
-Punish him!
-Punish him!

302
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,955
The heinous housing fraud
is killing the victims!

303
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,832
We deserve to be compensated!

304
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,709
-Compensate!
-Compensate!

305
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,630
Give us back the fortune
we saved our entire lives!

306
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,298
Calm down.

307
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,717
Calm down, sir.

308
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,802
Sir.

309
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,720
Please calm down.

310
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,894
-Please calm down.
-This is ludicrous!

311
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,146
We're the victims,

312
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,815
but they say no one's guilty.

313
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,025
Where?

314
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,820
Where is our money?

315
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,862
Sir.

316
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,698
Give me the lighter.

317
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,618
Why don't we talk it out?

318
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,411
Why would I talk to you?

319
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,332
Where are the bastards
who ran off with my money?

320
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,543
Why would I talk to you?

321
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,378
Sir, I understand how you feel.

322
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,130
It may be hard to believe,

323
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,217
but I was scammed too.

324
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,179
But we must stay strong.

325
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,350
Think about your families.

326
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,769
You see,

327
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,648
my family has left me.

328
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,152
I have nothing more to say.

329
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,863
You're a victim as well?

330
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,323
How do you carry on?

331
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,075
Iâ€¦

332
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,911
I can't do this anymore.

333
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,748
No.

334
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,333
Don't do it, sir!

335
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,423
Please calm down!

336
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,919
-Paramedics!
-Call an ambulance!

337
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,319
Hey, Ju-seok.

338
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,071
Go to the hospital right now.

339
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,822
Hey, I'm okay.

340
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,074
It's not about that.

341
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,786
I'm so sorry.

342
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,423
Fortunately, we saved her.

343
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,386
But she's unconscious
due to excessive bleeding.

344
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,974
The suspect Park Seong-uk
is also unconscious after harming himself.

345
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,227
We've yet to find out the motive.

346
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,196
Min-ji.

347
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,666
Defense wounds on her hands indicate
she instinctively covered her stomach.

348
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,086
I'm sorry to say that the babyâ€¦

349
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,259
I hope you're not cold.

350
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,764
Min-ji, aren't you cold?

351
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,060
She can't be cold.

352
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,398
I know how sensitive you are to the cold.

353
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,819
Min-ji, it's me.

354
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,279
Open your eyes.

355
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,826
Min-ji, I'm sorry.

356
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,288
I'm so sorry.

357
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,457
No, Min-ji.

358
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,292
Min-ji, hang in there. Hold on.

359
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,376
Doctor!

360
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,671
Doctor!

361
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,340
Doctor!

362
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,633
Please help her.

363
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,761
-Sir.
-My wife.

364
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,221
What's wrong with her? Please save her.

365
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,598
-Please save her!
-Sir.

366
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,640
Please wait outside.

367
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,558
Please save her.

368
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,143
Min-ji.

369
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,395
Min-ji!

370
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,981
No!

371
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,066
Mr. Ma.

372
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,655
Mun, is she going to be okay?

373
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,740
She'll be okay, right?

374
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,866
She'll be just fine.

375
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,619
Ms. Lee will be all right.

376
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,287
She'll be all right.

377
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,372
Please save her.

378
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,165
Please save her.

379
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,876
Please save her.

380
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:52,712
Noâ€¦

381
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,511
Mr. Ma.

382
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,069
All right.

383
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,705
Goodness.

384
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,016
Goodness.

385
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,770
I don't know what to say.

386
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,481
What about that man?

387
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,358
Did he live?

388
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,360
Fortunately, yes.

389
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,654
His wounds weren't severe thanks to you.

390
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,531
Why did he survive?

391
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,242
What?

392
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,788
Why did he live when he wanted to die?

393
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,628
And why did Min-ji die
when she was desperate to live?

394
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,800
Why did I have to save him

395
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,930
and send Min-ji off
without a proper goodbye?

396
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,723
Why?

397
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,683
Why?

398
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,227
Why?

399
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,732
Ju-seok, you need to calm down.

400
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,234
I understand how you feel but--

401
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,778
What's the point
of risking our lives to save others?

402
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,073
Who will console us?

403
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,370
I won't forgive them.

404
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,626
I'll never forgive the bastards
who did this to her.

405
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,839
I won't forget.

406
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,133
Ju-seok.

407
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,927
Mr. Ma, Iâ€¦

408
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,649
Wi-gen.

409
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,653
Yes, Mun.

410
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,450
Did Ms. Lee arrive there safely?

411
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:16,165
You know I can't disclose anything
unrelated to evil spirits.

412
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:26,134
I can feel your heart.

413
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,638
It's very heavy.

414
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,350
Because I can relate to his pain.

415
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,272
I know how it feels to lose your family
in the blink of an eye.

416
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,775
They're here one moment,

417
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,529
and then all of a sudden, they disappear.

418
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,283
I know exactly how that feels.

419
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,953
If they're both good people,

420
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,042
they will eventually meet again in Yung.

421
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,085
Right.

422
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,796
I'm relieved

423
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,092
that we have Yung to go to after we die.

424
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,763
And I'm glad Mr. Ma and Ms. Lee

425
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,933
will be reunited one day.

426
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,127
You can pay now for room service
with cash or card, or after.

427
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,212
What'll it be?

428
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,300
You'll pay for it.

429
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:54,347
We're technically not here, right?

430
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,349
If you don't take care of this properly,

431
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,310
you'll jump to your death.

432
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,062
Got that?

433
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,039
That's one, two, three,

434
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,291
four, five, six, sevenâ€¦

435
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,712
That's $90 millionâ€¦
How much is that in Korean won?

436
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,548
It's 120 billion won.

437
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,341
Yes!

438
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,510
And it's all ours?

439
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,053
That bastard didn't spend any.

440
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,347
One thing Mr. Park is good at
is managing money.

441
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,599
Mr. Park, I love you.

442
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,769
Hold on.

443
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,690
He wouldn't suddenly wake up, would he?

444
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,738
Are you sure you erased his memory?

445
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,951
Where did we first meet again?

446
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,164
What?

447
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,542
It wasâ€¦

448
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,675
You erased it?

449
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,305
You erased my memory?

450
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,931
I needed to practice.

451
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,267
Damn it! Still, how could you?

452
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,396
Fine, erase it.

453
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,982
Erase everything.
All the memories you want.

454
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,443
By the way,
how should we spend this money?

455
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,031
I'm not done talkingâ€¦

456
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,414
Gosh, they have those here too?

457
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:07,021
Does this mean those similar
to the ones we met in China are here too?

458
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,441
Perhaps.

459
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:14,028
I wonder what powers they'll give us.

460
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,700
No! Over my dead body!

461
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,079
How can I partner with someone
who cleans up cow dung?

462
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,123
He's obviously not right for this job!

463
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,542
For a Counter or a Yung person,

464
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,878
the most important factor is
the duty of catching evil spirits.

465
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,423
I have the strongest sense of duty.
Duty's my middle name.

466
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,092
No, forget about that.

467
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,719
Honestly, my fate is
in my partner's hands,

468
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,888
so I can't let just anyone be my Counter.

469
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,058
I need to be extremely meticulous. Okay?

470
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,310
Are you putting your safety
before everything else?

471
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,688
Watch what you say.

472
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,481
What do you take me for?

473
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,943
Our Chinese Counters were all killed.

474
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,279
The remaining Counters
have never felt such loss before.

475
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,241
Counters and the Yung people
have all put their lives at stake.

476
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,993
If you continue

477
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,620
to only care about your own safety

478
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,540
and refuse to pick your partner,

479
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,458
we will no longer

480
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,671
deem you fit to be one of us.

481
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,924
Hold on.

482
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,802
Come to think of it,

483
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,471
he has a very innocent side to him.
How do I put it?

484
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,724
I see a lot of potential in him.

485
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,475
Perhaps,

486
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,938
he may as well be my soulmate. Okay?

487
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,315
Okay?

488
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,274
Okay?

489
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,489
Okay, I'll be a Count.

490
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,493
It's "Counter," not "Count."

491
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,454
Counter!

492
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,749
Wait, you're really going to do it?
Seriously? Really?

493
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,710
Honey, you should reconsider.

494
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,628
Lookâ€¦

495
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,215
The evil spirits are
extremely vicious and scary.

496
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,758
You could die a second time.

497
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,343
Then, what'll happen?

498
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,012
You'd be a really terrible son.

499
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,389
Your father will be heartbroken
all over again.

500
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,392
Just go to Wi-gen
and tell her you won't do it.

501
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,310
I won't die.

502
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,938
I've died once, so I won't do it again.

503
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:16,150
I had to roll in cow dung
and get trampled by cows

504
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,027
to get these muscles.

505
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,155
-Grab onto me.
-What do you mean?

506
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,114
Just do it.

507
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,451
I was even a wrestling champion once.

508
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,996
I'm going to do it.

509
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,456
l'll do it no matter what.

510
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,208
What do you say? Shall we begin?

511
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,259
Why is there a steel door

512
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,594
in the middle of a grass field?

513
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,682
So much for being reincarnated.

514
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,727
What? What was that?

515
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,437
Fine.

516
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,690
You and I will be one from now on.

517
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,111
Your top priority from now on

518
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,447
-should be me.
-Why are you putting that on?

519
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,032
Me.

520
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,450
Me!

521
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,577
That looks too small for you.

522
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,371
It fits just right.

523
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,916
I can only live if you do.

524
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,834
Do you understand?

525
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,544
Don't you worry.

526
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,337
I'll become the best Count

527
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,799
through dedication
and a strong sense of responsibility.

528
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,759
Don't try too hard!

529
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,136
I said not to do that!

530
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,846
Come on!

531
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,939
What is this?

532
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,191
Jump!

533
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,443
What?

534
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,403
Jump inside!

535
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,363
I can't do that!

536
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,198
Come on!

537
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,409
What? Don't come near me!

538
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,202
But why?

539
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,456
What's with you?

540
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,294
What's the matter with you?

541
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,964
Tickle, tickle!

542
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,146
I did it!

543
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,745
Na Jeok-bong!

544
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,372
-Yes?
-Na Jeok-bong!

545
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,666
Your consciousness is up there!

546
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,505
And your body is lying down there!

547
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,215
All right! Hey!

548
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,096
I'll see you on the other side!

549
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,973
Please!

550
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,520
What are these?

551
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,189
Na Jeok-bong!

552
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,275
You better not die soon!

553
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,239
Hey, where are you going?

554
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,658
Where are you going?

555
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,057
What are these?

556
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,354
What?

557
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,737
I seem to be faster.

558
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,035
You don't make those sounds
with your mouth.

559
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,246
Who was that?

560
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,558
It's nice to meet you.

561
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:20,811
Put them down.

562
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,732
We have the same hairstyle.

563
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,402
Hello, I'm the new Count.

564
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,945
My name is Na Jeok-bong.

565
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,405
Curly hair.

566
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,576
Gosh, it's nice to see someone
with a pure soul.

567
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,745
It's nice to meet you. I'm Chu Mae-ok.

568
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,455
Hello, ma'am.

569
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,999
There's something old school about him.

570
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,295
Look at that height.
He'll catch those evil spirits all right.

571
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,964
Hello, I'm So Mun.

572
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,008
I'll consider you my older brother.

573
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,260
Gosh, but I'm a total newbie.

574
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,595
That's true.

575
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,598
But elders come first in Korea, right?

576
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,434
He knows our country's tradition.

577
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,645
Everyone knows the bonds
and virtues of Korea.

578
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,855
But age doesn't matter when we train.

579
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,607
Anyway, I have high hopes for you.

580
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,025
He's already intimidating him.

581
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:12,071
Okay. I'm sure you learned how important
our job is during your time in Yung.

582
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,073
Given the grave and dangerous situation,

583
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:19,912
you must prepare to undergo
arduous training as a newbie.

584
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,792
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

585
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,252
Brace yourself, okay?

586
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,087
Right.

587
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,880
That's Obnoxious Doâ€¦

588
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,007
I mean Do Ha-na.

589
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,719
She'll be your mentor.

590
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,014
You're the same age,
so I hope you become friends.

591
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,558
Watch out. Provoke her,

592
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,226
and she'll bite.

593
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:49,275
Goodness, how could a lady like you
take on such difficult tasks?

594
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,988
Ms. Do, let me do the cleaning
from now on.

595
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,950
But should we talk casually
if we're the same age?

596
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,368
We're pretty much friends.

597
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,538
Give that to me. Let me do it.

598
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,130
Goodness. Okay, everyone.

599
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,049
We have a new addition
to the family, so let's take a photo.

600
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,887
Ms. Chu used to be a photographer.

601
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,307
Man, no wonder why
she seemed so professional.

602
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,310
He has a good eye.

603
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,482
Okay, let's make our promises.

604
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,778
Everything will work out
since we have a new member.

605
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:42,036
Everyone in this photo
will be alive until the end.

606
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,205
Three, two, one.

607
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,378
One more. Like friends.

608
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,625
Ju-seok.

609
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,295
I made some kimchi jeon, your favorite.

610
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,922
At least have some of this.

611
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,548
Ju-seok.

612
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,806
Okay,

613
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,308
I'll leave this in front of the door.

614
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,310
Feel free to have some.

615
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:56,443
I'll be awake,
so let me know if you need anything.

616
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,821
Okay?

617
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,246
THE LATE LEE MIN-JI

618
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:14,253
Gosh, that was so close.

619
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,465
Ju-seok, what do you think
about "Treasurel"?

620
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,093
Hold on.

621
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,345
What? Where are you going?

622
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,931
Didn't you want some water?

623
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,142
No, I asked you about the name.

624
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,396
Babies listen, so we should have
a nickname for them before we name them.

625
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,606
So what do you think? "Treasure."

626
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,816
What are you talking about?

627
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,576
They say babies need
nicknames to be healthy.

628
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,245
Min-ji.

629
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,457
Are you serious?

630
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,046
Oh my gosh! Really?

631
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,423
Thank you so much.

632
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,133
Thank you, ma'am.

633
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,510
Let me bow to you, ma'am.

634
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,680
-Min-ji.
-Oh, come on.

635
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,807
You're not lying, are you?

636
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:33,874
Min-ji.

637
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,422
Don't forgive me.

638
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,593
Don't ever forgive me

639
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,223
or those bastards.

640
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,852
Okay?

641
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,527
After having been arrested for fraud,

642
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:06,240
Park stabbed Lee, who was
one of the victims of the fraud case.

643
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,033
Suffering from serious wounds,

644
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,702
Lee was taken to the ICU for treatment,

645
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,329
but she passed away.

646
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,583
Meanwhile, the suspect has woken up
from a coma after harming himself.

647
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,378
The police believe
the suspect will be able

648
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,547
to provide them with answers to this case.

649
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,845
STOP THE CONSTRUCTION NOW

650
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,931
CON MAN

651
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,120
Don't be such a baby.
It's just a broken leg.

652
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:59,084
I'll fix that for you.

653
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,842
All right. Let's go
one floor higher this time.

654
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,137
Please don't kill me.

655
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,388
Please show some mercy.

656
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,598
That's what I'm doing.

657
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,646
This is so fun.

658
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,940
This is so much fun!

659
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,242
Those things.

660
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,703
What are they?

661
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:39,958
Okay, come at me.

662
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,918
Okay, I hope we get along.

663
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,556
-First period's over.
-Goodness.

664
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,725
This is making me nostalgic.

665
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:57,893
Jeok-bong.

666
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,144
You need to get up.

667
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,521
Holyâ€¦ Do I look like I'm okay?

668
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,482
I thought he was swearing.

669
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,526
You're dead meat.

670
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,736
That's good!

671
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,947
Back then,

672
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,950
Mo-tak did something
and knocked me out. How did he do it?

673
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,913
Man, this grip feels nice.

674
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,375
-Tap!
-Hey, you can't tap out in real fights.

675
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,292
Got it?

676
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,426
Let go!

677
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,429
How could you do this to him?

678
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,597
Tell me about it.

679
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,224
Remember how hard it was to recruit?

680
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,184
I just did what I was taught.

681
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,560
He can't be a Counter.

682
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,561
Why not?

683
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,146
What do you think? He's too stupid,

684
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,482
-slow, and weak to be a Counter.
-Right.

685
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,400
Come on.

686
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,277
He's just placid, thoughtful, and humble.

687
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,279
Did you just laugh?

688
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,865
People like him tend to be a bit slow.

689
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,034
A mentor should be patient.

690
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,786
-Then, you do it.
-What?

691
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,122
You can teach him since you like him.

692
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,207
I can't waste my time teaching him.

693
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,211
Look at how she talks.
No wonder she's called Obnoxious Do.

694
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,339
She only says things that are right.

695
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,424
-Right?
-Yes.

696
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,341
Right.

697
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,218
Jeok-bong, are you okay?

698
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,302
Hey, stand up.

699
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,220
It set foot.

700
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,138
-What?
-What?

701
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,265
A level three evil spirit. We should go.

702
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,641
An evil spirit?

703
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,767
Stay seated.

704
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,104
Jeok-bong, you stay here.

705
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,451
He's wearing a yellow hoodie.

706
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,040
I think he can see the territory.

707
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,418
He keeps stepping in and out of it.

708
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,087
So he's at least as strong
as Ji Cheong-sin.

709
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,299
I hope the victim can hold out.

710
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,050
If he can see the territoryâ€¦

711
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,636
He couldn't be one
of those evil spirits from China, right?

712
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,972
Sit tight.

713
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,029
This is it?

714
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:17,699
Wasn't Min-ji scammed
into buying an apartment here?

715
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,243
-Mun, summon the territory.
-Okay.

716
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,995
It's a pretty large complex.

717
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,416
Your territory may be powerful
but it's too narrow.

718
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,877
Are you sure this is it?

719
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,337
Yes.

720
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,757
-But there are too many apartments.
-We need to hurry. Let's spread out.

721
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,884
Mo-tak, don't strain yourself.

722
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,344
-Be alert.
-All right.

723
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,555
What did he just say to me?

724
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,576
I found the victim.

725
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,371
We came in the nick of time.

726
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,087
What's wrong, Ms. Chu?

727
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,092
He broke the bones and then mended them.

728
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,594
He did it numerous times.

729
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,559
I think the evil spirit healed him.

730
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,532
I found him.

731
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,826
He's at a nearby abandoned parking lot.

732
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,371
You little bastard.

733
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,645
Ms. So?

734
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,277
Did you kill Ms. So?

735
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,404
Ms. So?

736
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,324
Was that her name?

737
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,744
I see. So you can read memories too.

738
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:26,661
Right?

739
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,567
Mo-tak.

740
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,197
Hey.

741
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,366
Are you a strong one?

742
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,941
Hey, you're not so bad yourself.

743
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:39,818
Butâ€¦

744
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,362
what a shame.

745
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,656
I'mâ€¦

746
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,119
immortal.

747
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,332
He killed Ms. So in China.

748
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,668
He's fast and strong.

749
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,045
This is great.

750
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,048
I didn't know
how I was supposed to find them.

751
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:04,926
Bring it on.

752
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,220
You're dead meat.

753
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,901
Ha-na!

754
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,365
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay so go.

755
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,367
Wait here until Ms. Chu comes.

756
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,078
You bastard!

757
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,122
Come out!

758
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,499
Come out, you bastard!

759
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,253
Come out!

760
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,672
Come out!

761
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,290
Mo-tak!

762
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,584
Damn it!

763
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:27,133
Those who go out of their way
to help others always meet the same fate.

764
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,718
Just like the ones in China.

765
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:36,851
You just don't learn, do you?

766
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,752
Are you okay?

767
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,962
Mun.

768
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,217
That lunatic.

769
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,646
Enough playing around,
you goddamn evil spirit!

770
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,109
Ha-na!

771
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,081
Mo-tak!

772
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,419
Damn it!

773
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,051
They beat him.
You're not going to do anything about it?

774
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,555
Bring Wong here.

775
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,823
Mo-tak, are you okay?

776
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,243
Mun, why did you dodge it?

777
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,787
I thought you'd do the same.

778
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,249
Put me down. I'm mortified.

779
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,585
-Pretend you didn't see that.
-Okay.

780
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,670
Be gentle.

781
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,755
-Okay.
-Be gentle.

782
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,174
-No one saw you.
-No? They better not.

783
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,385
Pretend that I'm treating you.

784
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,141
EONNI'S NOODLES

785
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,561
He was fast and definitely much stronger
than he looked.

786
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,980
This must mean the other two

787
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,066
are in Korea as well, right?

788
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,527
I'd say it's highly likely.

789
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,447
He'll avoid the territory from now on
since that's how he met us.

790
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,492
It's going to be harder to catch them.

791
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,869
My wrath is overflowing.

792
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,579
Take me with you next time.

793
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,457
I'm going to break the bastard's wrists
for what he didâ€¦

794
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:10,755
Your wrath?

795
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,756
It's overflowing?

796
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,883
Do you have to talk like that?

797
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,886
Ms. So wasn't the only victim
I saw in his memories.

798
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,180
What do you mean?

799
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,266
I also saw Min-ji.

800
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,602
He definitely met her.

801
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,187
Ms. Lee?

802
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,814
But why?

803
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,983
It was a vague memory.

804
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:30,942
However,

805
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,986
it was definitely her.

806
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:38,199
And she was pleading for her life.

807
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,284
What?

808
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,163
She was begging him to spare her?

809
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,417
Didn't the police point out

810
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,252
her killer?

811
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,753
They even had the CCTV footage.

812
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,172
Yes, you're right.

813
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,800
Didn't they say that crook woke up?

814
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,937
Thank you.

815
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,902
Jeez!

816
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,948
Why you littleâ€¦

817
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,923
-Let's begin.
-Okay.

818
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:26,057
-What?
-Who are you guys?

819
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,320
Evil spirits?

820
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,451
Someone erased his memory.

821
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,411
Are they the ones from China?

822
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,955
I'm not sure.

823
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,667
You need to find out
what happened that day.

824
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:47,054
I must retrieve his memory.
Mun, I need more territory.

825
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,415
It's him.

826
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:17,877
This meansâ€¦

827
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:43,319
Min-ji.

828
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:50,868
No.

829
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,088
We have a surprise guest.

830
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,506
What should we do?

831
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,220
Guests

832
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,430
are always welcome.

833
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,516
What should we do? Kill them both?

834
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,643
There's no need for that.

835
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,534
You'll do it yourself.

836
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:08,779
Don't do this, Mr. Hwang. Please don't.

837
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,697
Mr. Hwang!

838
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,326
-Mr. Hwang!
-Please don't kill me!

839
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,202
-Let me go!
-Don't do it!

840
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,621
No!

841
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,955
I'm carrying a baby.

842
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:19,749
I'm pregnant,

843
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,626
so please don't kill me!

844
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:22,585
Please!

845
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,878
No.

846
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:25,755
No.

847
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:26,756
Please.

848
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,616
All of this is their doing?

849
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,375
Mr. Hwang is the leader.

850
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,459
He uses psychokinesis.

851
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:07,046
The guy we met has healing powers,
and the woman probably controls memories.

852
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,840
Those bastards deserve to die.

853
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:19,892
Mun.

854
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,231
Those crazy bastards.

855
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,400
Ms. Lee was pregnant,

856
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,694
but they didn't even hesitate to kill her.

857
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,029
Plus, they enjoyed it.

858
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:33,948
Let's pay them back.

859
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,325
We have to.

860
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,996
Let's avenge the Chinese Counters
and Ms. Lee.

861
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:45,292
I'll never forgive
those damn evil spirits.

862
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,544
Of course.

863
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,670
Those bastards

864
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:51,048
will regret setting foot
into this country.

865
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:52,842
The battle has begun.

866
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,094
We've identified them.

867
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,054
It's possible that they could flee.

868
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,391
Mo-tak, tell all your colleagues
to stay alert

869
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:01,976
so they can't escape.

870
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:03,978
You too, Ha-na.

871
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,440
I need you to be focused on catching them.

872
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,702
Damn it!

873
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,222
How did they find you?

874
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,476
Does that matter right now?

875
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,519
How could you just watch?

876
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,189
They totally shattered my arm!

877
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,485
The dark lights that rise from the ground.

878
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,406
They bring them to us.

879
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:02,536
Andâ€¦

880
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,793
That guy summons them.

881
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,337
He was stronger

882
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,923
than Mr. Hwang.

883
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,640
He was much stronger
than those Chinese ones.

884
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,366
Should I be glad?

885
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,249
No, he had smaller eyes.

886
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:49,750
His mouth was wider.

887
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,672
-Like this?
-Yeah.

888
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:10,146
You say you're always busy
when drawing new characters.

889
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,730
Jeez, what's that?

890
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,442
Hey, he's handsome.

891
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,278
How is that good-looking?

892
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,654
He's pretty handsome.

893
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:19,697
-Don't be absurd.
-Hey.

894
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,033
Enough with your lovers' quarrel
and go finish your food.

895
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,034
-Hey.
-Hey.

896
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:27,788
Are you twoâ€¦

897
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,207
dating?

898
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,417
-What?
-No.

899
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,918
-No.
-Yes.

900
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,503
Since when?

901
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:36,922
When did you start?

902
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,424
Everyone knows but me?

903
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,925
-No.
-You littleâ€¦

904
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,304
-Let's do better.
-Jun-hui.

905
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,931
Do you want to draw with us?

906
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:47,725
Let's talk later.

907
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,353
Feel free to do so whenever you want.

908
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,313
Okay?

909
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:53,647
Didn't you know, Mun?

910
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,316
Jun-hui is a great artist.

911
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,194
She's right.

912
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:03,490
Maybe we should kick you out
and recruit Jun-hui as our new member.

913
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:04,742
No, thanks.

914
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,745
No? Why?

915
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,622
Don't you know he dislikes you?

916
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,373
Why would he? Iâ€¦

917
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,877
That's not true, is it?
You like me, right?

918
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,171
He likes pork cutlet, not you.

919
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,757
Right?

920
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,219
Goodness, you look more handsome
after getting a haircut.

921
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,637
Eat up.

922
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,555
Where's Jeok-bong?

923
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,182
He's training with Mo-tak.

924
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,185
What did you draw?

925
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:33,687
Goodness, that's impressive.

926
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,648
That looks delicious.

927
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:36,690
Right?

928
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,276
-Hello.
-Come in.

929
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,028
Look at who's here!

930
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:42,071
Yeah, who are they?

931
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,156
Right. Come on in.

932
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,449
Do you have a kids' menu too?

933
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:46,492
Of course.

934
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,910
Kids love our noodles.

935
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,161
Come on in.

936
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,120
Sit here.

937
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,247
You can sit there too.

938
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:53,832
-Take a seat.
-Jun-hui.

939
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,376
You have friends now.

940
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:56,961
Okay? Say hi.

941
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,796
-Hi.
-Good girl.

942
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,051
Say hi, Jun-hui. "Hi."

943
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,803
"Hi."

944
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,638
Can you help over there?

945
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,683
I'll cook the noodles now.

946
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,810
Ten banquet noodles
and three pork cutlets.

947
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,603
The cutlets are on the house.

948
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,802
Rock, paper, scissors.

949
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:47,970
Rock, paper, scissors.

950
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:49,722
Rock, paper, scissors. Yes, I won!

951
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:41,982
Youâ€¦

952
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:28,278
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

953
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:29,822
Youâ€¦

954
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:33,826
You have so many people to protect.

955
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,244
Hey!

956
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:38,705
How could a human

957
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,708
kill another human?

958
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,544
What's this smell?

959
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:44,545
Don't tell me

960
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,047
you can smell evil spirits?

961
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:48,632
If we want to catch them,

962
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:51,009
we must be faster and stronger than this.

963
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,429
There's an evil spirit!

964
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:54,346
Go straight!

965
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,307
-Ms. Chu.
-Ms. Chu!

966
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:58,809
Run!

967
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:07,818
