1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:00:55,054 --> 00:01:00,060
JUNGJIN PENITENTIARY

3
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,721
Mr. Ma?

4
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,021
He's a hindrance. We need to kill him.

5
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,273
An evil spirit.

6
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,860
You've become…

7
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,864
an evil spirit?

8
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,121
What's going on?

9
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,456
What are you--

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,917
-Mun.
-What's with all that blood?

11
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,878
-What is going--
-I told you.

12
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,090
I can't go back to the past.

13
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,677
Nothing can ever be the same again.

14
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,638
It's just that…

15
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,892
I can't understand what's going on.

16
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,978
What do you think you are doing?

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,521
See?

18
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,107
He's a hindrance like I said.

19
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,317
He's going to ruin
your chance for revenge.

20
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,236
If you don't kill him right now,

21
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,491
he will keep following you around
and become a nuisance!

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,870
It's because of the evil spirit.

23
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,873
We just need to remove it.
Let me help you. I can do it.

24
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,958
The evil spirit is the reason why you--

25
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,504
You're wrong.

26
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,007
It's not because of anyone else.

27
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,301
I don't know who you are, Mun,

28
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,595
or what you're trying to do.

29
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,972
But this is my revenge.

30
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,851
So don't get in my way.

31
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,520
You can't leave like this!

32
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,115
Don't move, or I'll shoot!

33
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,745
Mr. Ma!

34
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,414
Stop!

35
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,717
Mr. Ma.

36
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,469
Mr. Ma!

37
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,346
Mr. Ma.

38
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,107
He finally came to his senses.

39
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,822
He's definitely something else
judging by how he escaped from prison.

40
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:49,956
So does this mean it's the end
for that So Mun and his friends?

41
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,793
No.

42
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,630
This is only the beginning.

43
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,219
The real beginning.

44
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,814
Ha-na!

45
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,526
Repeat what you said. Who has become what?

46
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,652
Mr. Ma…

47
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,407
Mr. Ma's been possessed by an evil spirit.

48
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,325
What?

49
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,410
What are you saying?

50
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,454
I don't know what's going on.

51
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,918
But this I know for sure.
He just escaped from the penitentiary.

52
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,923
Then, where should we go now?

53
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,260
We need to find Mr. Ma
before it's too late.

54
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,227
Let's go to the treatment facility
where Mr. Park is.

55
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,105
We need to hurry
before Mr. Ma gets to him first.

56
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,649
NATIONAL TREATMENT FACILITY

57
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,119
I couldn't smell anything on my way here.

58
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,287
You couldn't?

59
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,330
No.

60
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,998
Mun, summon the territory.

61
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,124
Okay.

62
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,218
I can't sense the evil spirit.

63
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,054
Mr. Ma definitely said he'd get revenge.

64
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,098
Mo-tak, let's check on Mr. Park first.

65
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,643
-Okay, let's split up. Jeok-bong.
-Okay.

66
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,478
Open it.

67
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,414
I…

68
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,173
I don't think Ma Ju-seok came here.

69
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,759
There are no signs of a break-in.

70
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,636
What's going on?

71
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,597
If he's not here, where could he be?

72
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,142
This isn't working.
We'll look somewhere else.

73
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,106
He escaped from prison?

74
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,993
I'm sorry to tell you this.

75
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,953
If you see Ma Ju-seok…

76
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,914
I mean…

77
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,543
If your son comes here,
you must tell us right away.

78
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,173
That way, we'll be able to
at least give him some help.

79
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,924
I doubt he'll come here.

80
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,970
-Sorry?
-He didn't even want me to go see him.

81
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,391
He refused to see me

82
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,060
because he didn't want me
to see him in that state.

83
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,022
He could be on the run

84
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,192
and have nowhere to go,

85
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,196
but he still won't come here.

86
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,785
You think he'll come here?

87
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,330
He might, so let's just wait.

88
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,123
We'll be here all night.

89
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,333
Let's keep an eye out.

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,126
-Okay.
-Let's go.

91
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,354
Mother.

92
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,662
What happened to your face, my son?

93
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,040
Let me get you some ointment.

94
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,419
I came here to see you.

95
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,506
See me?

96
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,592
What for?

97
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,180
Why would you come to see me at this hour?

98
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,558
You fool.

99
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,233
My son.

100
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,406
My kind-hearted son is here.

101
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,120
Why are you doing this?

102
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,621
Why?

103
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,096
I always wanted to be like you.

104
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,604
But I never could.

105
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,563
You're wrong.

106
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,571
You're the spitting image of me.

107
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,783
You're full of love.

108
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,371
You're softhearted.

109
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:34,675
It's not too late to turn yourself in
and ask for forgiveness.

110
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,846
I'll apologize to them too.
Let's talk with them.

111
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,891
Or…

112
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:43,893
why don't you

113
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,063
just stay here with me?

114
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,398
Don't go anywhere and just stay with me.

115
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,027
Ju-seok.

116
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,073
I'm craving your kimchi jeon.

117
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,495
Okay, let's have some.

118
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,249
Let's have some kimchi jeon.

119
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,172
It won't take long.

120
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,133
Wait here.

121
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,408
Please look after yourself, Mom.

122
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,142
Hello, sir.

123
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,228
We're still on standby.

124
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,438
He's not here.

125
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,274
This is an emergency.

126
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,653
A vehicle stolen near the penitentiary
has been located near Ma Ju-seok's house.

127
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,113
A vehicle stolen near…

128
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,286
Ma Ju-seok?

129
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,579
Hey! Stop there!

130
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,082
Get on your knees
and put your hands above your head!

131
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,005
I understand what you're going through.

132
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,467
But this isn't right.
This will only make things worse for you.

133
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,137
Getting revenge won't change anything.

134
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,601
Wouldn't it help the deceased
let go of their resentment?

135
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,312
And help those left behind

136
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,732
with their sadness…

137
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,781
What's going on?

138
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,714
Ma Ju-seok.

139
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,184
No!

140
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,562
Please, stop! No! Please!

141
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,231
Please!

142
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,866
We shouldn't let them
run their mouths ever again!

143
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,330
How dare these ignorant fools spew
nonsense claiming to understand you?

144
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,415
You don't need to hear that!

145
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,751
Don't you agree?

146
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,795
Please, stop!

147
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,500
Ju-seok.

148
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,632
No.

149
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,551
Don't go.

150
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,511
Ju-seok.

151
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,266
Ha-na, over here!

152
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,314
Are you all right?

153
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,358
Are you all right?

154
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,735
Ju-seok.

155
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,241
Ma'am!

156
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,994
Are you okay, ma'am?

157
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,581
I can't let you leave like this…

158
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,751
-Ju-seok.
-Ma'am.

159
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:22,963
It set foot.

160
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,381
What?

161
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,637
In a tunnel within a 2 km radius.

162
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,180
It's Mr. Ma.

163
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,570
It can't be.

164
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,447
What's wrong?

165
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,533
He's looking at me.

166
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,371
Through the territory.

167
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,709
Is this what you use to watch me

168
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,087
and to chase me?

169
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,174
That's right. I told you
they'd constantly get in your way.

170
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,636
-Mr. Ma.
-Both Mun and you.

171
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,055
I don't know what you guys are,

172
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,726
but this is my final warning.

173
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,897
Don't get in my way.

174
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,109
Your mother has collapsed.

175
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,778
You still have her.

176
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,657
You must stop for her sake.

177
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,242
If you stop here--

178
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,493
I'll atone for my sins

179
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,454
with my life.

180
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,374
Mr. Ma!

181
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,925
Then, he disappeared.

182
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,302
In the blink of an eye.

183
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,266
There have been evil spirits before
who could see the territory.

184
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,643
But none could ever sense us through it.

185
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,479
I still don't get it.

186
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,943
Evil spirits only possess those
who are similar to them.

187
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,489
That's why all the hosts we've captured
were evil as well.

188
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,825
It's his rage.

189
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:21,457
Unlike the others, Ma Ju-seok's blind rage
attracted the evil spirit.

190
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,834
Hold on.

191
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,711
Fine.

192
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,006
Let's say that's how he was possessed.

193
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,133
How could he be so powerful

194
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,428
when he hasn't killed anyone yet?

195
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:39,558
He has to be at least a level three.
This is just incomprehensible.

196
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,228
This isn't the first time
something incomprehensible has happened.

197
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,440
So Mun.

198
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,945
We couldn't understand
how his body accepted me.

199
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,864
She's right.

200
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,868
He wasn't in a coma
when he took Wi-gen in.

201
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:02,289
And his power surpasses all of ours.

202
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,541
Does this mean that evil spirit…

203
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,920
I mean, that man…

204
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,466
Does this mean Ma Ju-seok could be
an extremely powerful evil spirit?

205
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,759
Just like Mun?

206
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,843
-Hey.
-What?

207
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,803
Be quiet.

208
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,097
He doesn't mean
that Mun is an evil spirit.

209
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,101
Anyway, this just means
that Ma Ju-seok is unpredictable.

210
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,811
We must consider all possibilities.

211
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,522
He may be different
from the other evil spirits

212
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,817
the moment he becomes
a complete evil spirit.

213
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,569
Most of all,

214
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,030
we must stop him from committing murder.

215
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,993
We don't know what could happen
if he takes even one life.

216
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,163
Right now, the best thing we can do is

217
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,791
to summon the evil spirit within him

218
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,544
as fast as possible.

219
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,928
JUNGJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

220
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,473
Ha-na.

221
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,020
The others went to the treatment facility.

222
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,567
Nothing's happened so far.

223
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,027
How is she?

224
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,114
She hasn't woken up yet.

225
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,492
They said she may need surgery.

226
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,622
She must've been very shocked.

227
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,458
She witnessed something
she had never imagined.

228
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,712
He probably went there
to say his farewell.

229
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,214
Once Mr. Ma

230
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,134
gets his revenge,

231
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,803
he won't be able

232
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,472
to see her anymore.

233
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,059
Still,

234
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,478
we have time.

235
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,983
No one at the penitentiary

236
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,989
and none of the detectives in front
of his house were severely injured.

237
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,036
He could've killed them all
given his power.

238
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,249
That means the evil spirit
isn't in control of him yet, right?

239
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:17,466
And that means
he's still acting of his own free will.

240
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,444
NATIONAL TREATMENT FACILITY

241
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,114
Your mother has collapsed.

242
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,784
You still have her.

243
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,412
You must stop for her sake.

244
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,540
Ju-seok.

245
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,213
Ju-seok.

246
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,883
Jeez, are you totally out of it?

247
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,468
I mean…

248
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,012
All that work to escape
and you're still here?

249
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,556
What's wrong? Feeling indecisive?

250
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,318
What?

251
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,447
You can already see them?

252
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,826
Gosh.

253
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,578
You really are different.

254
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,663
Gosh.

255
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,209
You'll be even more incredible
once you kill Mr. Park.

256
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,964
So what are you doing here?

257
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,592
You could easily snap his neck
if you wanted to.

258
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,262
Hey.

259
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,266
You can find out that truth
you so desperately want.

260
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,395
Yes.

261
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,022
So…

262
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,443
Go in there right now. Okay?

263
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,571
You came all the way here
because you want revenge.

264
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,948
Right?

265
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,783
Right?

266
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,454
Shit! You're so annoying.

267
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,456
Fine.

268
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,960
Then, should I go in there instead
and kill him?

269
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,340
Should I kill him
so you'll never know the truth?

270
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,800
I see.

271
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,430
You must not care
about your wife or Treasure.

272
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,317
You crazy bastard.

273
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,204
Insult my family again,

274
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,749
and I won't hold myself back.

275
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,520
Damn it. Is this right?

276
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,815
Or are we just helping him grow stronger?

277
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,067
Damn it.

278
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,153
Is he crazy or what?

279
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,867
Did you see that?

280
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,121
He dodged the lights.

281
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,083
How can he see them?

282
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,085
That's not all.

283
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:52,931
That guy…

284
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,855
can read them.

285
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,776
He's more than just incredible.

286
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,154
So what?

287
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,157
He doesn't listen to us.

288
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,954
It's been a while since he broke out,
but he hasn't done anything yet.

289
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,040
He definitely won't kill Mr. Park.

290
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,336
He's become soft
after meeting his damn mother.

291
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,551
Then, we should help him stay strong.

292
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,056
That's what teammates do.

293
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,196
All right.

294
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,406
Let's go have some porridge

295
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,742
Let's go have some porridge

296
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,036
It's red bean porridge

297
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,458
Are you cooked or not?

298
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,879
It tastes better
when it's cooked in a cauldron though.

299
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,382
Hopefully this pressure cooker will do.

300
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,259
Jeez, that's hot.

301
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,938
When do you think
the evil spirit possessed him?

302
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,315
It was probably after the murder attempt.

303
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,320
He probably was able to stop
due to the goodness in his heart.

304
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,574
But guilt and rage
must've consumed him afterward.

305
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,535
And that must've been
when the evil spirit approached him.

306
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,412
Come to think of it,

307
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,206
Mr. Ma seemed

308
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,668
a bit different during the trial.

309
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,880
I could've stopped him had I known then.

310
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,091
None of us could've imagined this.

311
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,510
However,

312
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,388
why do you think

313
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,683
his rage suddenly erupted?

314
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,659
What was that?

315
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,663
Hey, Jeok-bong.

316
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,206
Jeok-bong.

317
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,209
What happened here, Jeok-bong?

318
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,627
What…

319
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,463
What happened here?

320
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,600
Jeok-bong…

321
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,560
Your face…

322
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:51,776
I wanted Mr. Ma's mother
to try some porridge after her surgery.

323
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,281
And you haven't eaten anything either,
so I decided to make some.

324
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,994
Who knew this pressure cooker
would explode?

325
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,204
You did well. You're incredible.

326
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,206
Listen, Mun.

327
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,584
Can I leave a bit later?

328
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,545
-You see…
-Gosh.

329
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,131
My face really burns.

330
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,968
Sure, you can continue
what you were doing.

331
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,053
-Thanks.
-Sure.

332
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,349
You don't need to go
to the hospital, right?

333
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,435
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

334
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,520
Where could Ma Ju-seok be?

335
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,439
I told you. I don't know.

336
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,358
Why not?

337
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,485
I got an earful from the higher-ups.

338
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,112
The toilet. At least go to the toilet.

339
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,031
-Why haven't you been going lately?
-Damn.

340
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,700
I'm probably constipated.

341
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,618
Constipated?

342
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:50,085
Listen, none of the guards remember
how Ma Ju-seok escaped from prison.

343
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,504
How does this make any sense?

344
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,966
He erased their memories
in that short time?

345
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,678
That penitentiary seems fishy.

346
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,139
I can tell.

347
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,809
They must be hiding something.

348
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,604
-Hiding?
-Didn't you hear?

349
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:15,193
All CCTV footage from the week
prior to his escape was erased.

350
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,654
You know what that is.

351
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,740
It's a sign
that something bad will happen.

352
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,744
It's like mice jumping off a boat
or birds flying away in a forest--

353
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,662
Hold on.

354
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:30,208
No CCTV footage?
Are you saying all the footage was erased?

355
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,002
-Yes.
-Not on the day of the escape but before?

356
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,173
Tell me the exact date.

357
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,016
This feels strange.

358
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,437
I know we have to summon Ju-seok,

359
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:55,525
but I just can't bear to face him
while he's possessed.

360
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,490
I can't imagine how Mun
must be feeling right now.

361
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,828
Goodness. I guess this is what it means

362
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,581
to feel distraught.

363
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,043
But given that Mr. Ma
hasn't made a move yet,

364
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,423
maybe he's wavering.

365
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:24,387
It'd be a great relief
if he was swayed by his mother.

366
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,600
Did you say her surgery was today?

367
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,269
Yes. Mun said he'd get there on time.

368
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,859
Then…

369
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,944
What if…

370
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,198
Just what if…

371
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,618
If he was swayed by his mother…

372
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,704
What if…

373
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,665
Just say it.
Why are you beating around the bush?

374
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,875
Then what?

375
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,376
In that case,

376
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,964
maybe he'll show up at the hospital.

377
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,091
Who?

378
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,470
-Mr. Ma?
-Ju-seok?

379
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,680
Yes.

380
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,141
Mun, are you at the hospital?

381
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,270
No, we're still on our way.

382
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,605
Why aren't you there yet?

383
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,982
Well…

384
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,735
By the way, why did you call?

385
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,987
Is he…

386
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:28,743
No, nothing's going on here.
We just thought that maybe Mr. Ma

387
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,121
could show up at the hospital.

388
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,081
At the hospital?

389
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,749
Wait.

390
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,169
Hold on. Come to think of it,

391
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,089
I think there's a faint smell.

392
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,174
-Is it Mr. Ma?
-Wait.

393
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,850
No. This is a familiar smell.

394
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,060
What do you mean by familiar?

395
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:54,978
Mun.

396
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:56,938
I'm here, Mo-tak.

397
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,985
Someone visited Ju-seok at the prison
the day after he ruined his trial.

398
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,070
What do you mean?

399
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,490
But CCTV footage is gone
and there are no records of it.

400
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,869
The supervisor and the guards
don't remember anything either.

401
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,205
Also, someone broke in here
the day before his escape

402
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,249
and left without a trace.

403
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:20,295
That's when they found him unconscious.

404
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,964
What's going on here?

405
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,343
Are you saying he was approached
by an evil spirit?

406
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,263
The only evil spirit
who's strong enough to do that is…

407
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,557
Mr. Hwang.

408
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,976
Mr. Hwang?

409
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:35,935
If it was them,

410
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,898
they could've planned
Ju-seok's escape from prison.

411
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,860
Why do you think
his rage suddenly erupted?

412
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,988
Ma Ju-seok didn't commit murder.

413
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,325
So what could've triggered him?

414
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,665
It's them!

415
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,418
This familiar and bad smell!

416
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,961
JUNGJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
2 KM

417
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,297
The smell is getting closer!

418
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,382
They're at the hospital.

419
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,427
The hospital? Why would they go there?

420
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,514
Mr. Ma's mother is in danger. Hurry!

421
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,819
Are her vital signs okay?

422
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,863
Heart rate, 59. Oxygen saturation, 98.

423
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,366
Blood pressure is 121 over 81.
She's stable.

424
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,700
Let's begin the surgery.

425
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,452
Scalpel.

426
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,294
Who is that?

427
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,381
No one's allowed in here!

428
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,882
I'm sorry. Please leave.

429
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,983
You all must be exhausted.
You should get some rest.

430
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,659
You only had two family members.

431
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,953
But one of them died,

432
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,415
and the other is an escaped convict.

433
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,961
I know everyone's life
is a living hell, but yours is…

434
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,839
just utterly pitiful.

435
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,800
She can just think she died for her son.

436
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,389
Her son came all the way here
to get revenge,

437
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,350
so she shouldn't get in his way.

438
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,186
By the way,

439
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,898
would killing his mother
make him have a change of heart?

440
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,778
He'll resent himself.

441
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,534
He'll also be angry with himself.

442
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,247
And once all that rage erupts…

443
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,669
That's all we'll need.

444
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,694
What the…

445
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:33,988
Damn it.

446
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,282
It's him.

447
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,409
Before he comes…

448
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,870
We agreed to kill her.

449
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,580
-You can't leave her alive!
-Wait.

450
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,958
Ma Ju-seok can read those lights.

451
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:51,047
If we do anything right now,
he'll know that we killed his mother.

452
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,924
Shit.

453
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,509
Shit!

454
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,271
That bastard.

455
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,153
What the heck?

456
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,083
Mun, let's check on Mr. Ma's mother first.

457
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,802
Ma'am.

458
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,845
Ma'am!

459
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,056
No, hang in there.

460
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,475
Wake up, ma'am!

461
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:49,188
Ms. Chu! Over here!

462
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,860
It's okay. She will live.

463
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:58,239
I can save her. She'll live.

464
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,116
Please.

465
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,578
Please. You need to live.

466
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,746
Please.

467
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,717
Please.

468
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,495
She'll be okay now.

469
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,290
Let's wake them up too.

470
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,459
She still needs surgery.

471
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,004
Well done, Ms. Chu.

472
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,886
Okay, Ms. Chu.

473
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,554
Great job.

474
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,098
How's Jeok-bong's nose?

475
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,016
Detective…

476
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,768
Ga Mo-tak?

477
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,313
Wait there. One minute.

478
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,232
Talk to you later.

479
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,233
Okay.

480
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,445
What is the great Detective Ga doing here?

481
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,822
Are you seriously back in here?

482
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,867
I've told you many times
to get your life straight, punk.

483
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,827
Who are you to give me advice?

484
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,045
Thirty-seven? Is that it's number?

485
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,422
What's this?

486
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,509
Where did you get this tattoo?

487
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:45,054
Let me go.
This is a violation of human rights.

488
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,764
What is this tattoo?

489
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,352
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

490
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,853
IN JUNGJIN PENITENTIARY

491
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,649
They're Lee Chung-jae's men.

492
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,569
I didn't know he was in a gang.

493
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,989
Yes. That rose tattoo.

494
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,448
That's the RRG's symbol.

495
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,367
The Red Roses Gang.

496
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,744
That's ridiculous.

497
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:14,333
I didn't know there was another gang
in Jungjin other than Cho Tae-sin's gang.

498
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:19,255
They didn't originate here. They used to
oversee hotels outside the capital.

499
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,590
But after Cho Tae-sin's downfall,

500
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,885
Lee Chung-jae suddenly got

501
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,220
in the construction business,

502
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,055
and that's how his gang came here.

503
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,182
Look. The stars show the rank.

504
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,310
The number shows their position.

505
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,021
Four stars and "number one."

506
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,023
How childish.

507
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:43,904
Behind the money launderer
was the late Lee Chung-jae's henchman.

508
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,741
He has one star and the number 37.

509
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,659
He must be one of the small fries.

510
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,661
That's right. Most of the gang members

511
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,872
were jailed for involvement
in the scam case.

512
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,207
Not many of them are left.

513
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,919
Is that good?

514
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,134
-Where's this tattoo parlor?
-Right.

515
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,263
It's an illegal parlor
inside Lee Chung-jae's hotel.

516
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,349
You came prepared.

517
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,558
You know it.

518
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,312
"Tommy" and "David."

519
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:28,532
Do I look like new money
who wanted to get a rose tattoo

520
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,202
but was too scared
so she brought her friend?

521
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,788
Yes, and I'm your bodyguard.

522
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,873
-This is so itchy.
-Hold on.

523
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,004
Listen.
I don't actually have to get one, right?

524
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,590
Nothing scares me more
than having my skin pricked.

525
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,759
Don't worry. I'll quickly look around.

526
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,260
-Okay.
-First…

527
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,554
There are two managers.

528
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,393
Tommy and David.
I just need to read their memories

529
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,186
and identify who's number 37.

530
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,357
Then we can reveal that Mr. Hwang and his
group were involved in the scam.

531
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,483
Okay, let's go.

532
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,611
Let's summon and arrest them.

533
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,363
Stop scratching.

534
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,873
Piggy's Mom?

535
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,294
-That's right.
-Come on in.

536
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:23,921
Piggy…

537
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,174
Sit here.

538
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,555
A jerk reported our parlor, so we decided
not to receive new customers for now.

539
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,933
Let's say I'm Piggy's Mom.

540
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,476
He could've sent us away.

541
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,189
You wanted to get it done by Tommy,
but he's doing something urgent.

542
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,732
-I see.
-It's just a touch-up.

543
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,900
Can I do it instead?

544
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,861
-Yes.
-I'm better than him.

545
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,780
Which one of you is Piggy's Mom?

546
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,452
It's me.

547
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,370
Then who are you?

548
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,539
Piggy?

549
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:06,505
You want to retouch the pig's smile
on your right butt cheek, right?

550
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,050
Take off your underwear.

551
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,053
Take off what? My right what?

552
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,306
-Is it on your left side? Put this on.
-I'll take it.

553
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,606
You're not my type.

554
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,065
So what?

555
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:33,908
I think I should wait
until Tommy finishes.

556
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,784
When will he be done?

557
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,203
Sir?

558
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,621
-David.
-Yes?

559
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,039
Tommy.

560
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,044
You sure we can remove his tattoo?
I think his gang got dismantled.

561
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,587
What's it to us?

562
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,548
Better for us.
We won't have to see them again.

563
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,842
Piggy's Mom is here.

564
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,513
Bong-pal?

565
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,014
You're Kim Bong-pal, right?

566
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,601
Long time no see. I love your tattoo.

567
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,520
I'm not Bong-pal.

568
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,109
I need to come back next week?

569
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,570
Why does it take so long?
Can't you be quicker?

570
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,781
What's going on?

571
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,243
You came to remove your tattoo?

572
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:20,996
Nice to meet you.

573
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,040
Red Roses Gang number 37.

574
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,375
That's you, right?

575
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,137
What the…

576
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,639
-Why are you running away?
-What…

577
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,266
And why are you getting it removed?

578
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,019
What's it to you?
I can remove my tattoos if I want.

579
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,355
Yes. As long as your memory
is still in there.

580
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,861
That boy…

581
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,154
Lim Jae-youl.

582
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,782
He's a typical thug.

583
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,494
He extorted money from arcades
for Lee Chung-jae

584
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,329
and participated in the scam.

585
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,297
I went to the laundromat, sir.

586
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,592
-Why aren't you talking properly?
-You're mistaken, sir.

587
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,218
I don't think I am.

588
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,306
You're not snitching, right?

589
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,350
Lee Chung-jae.

590
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,603
Are you saying he's alive?

591
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,230
Yes, it was him.

592
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,189
DEAD

593
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,107
Lee Chung-jae.

594
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:34,320
His body was found inside a burnt vehicle.

595
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,032
They must've failed
to identify him properly due to the burns

596
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,826
or the autopsy report
could've been forged.

597
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,080
I see. He faked his own death all along.

598
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,209
That filthy bastard.
He did all that just for the money.

599
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:54,632
He wanted to stay under the radar
and steal the cash after it was laundered.

600
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,801
He probably didn't know
that Mr. Hwang would interfere.

601
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,096
But in the end,
Lee Chung-jae took the money.

602
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,184
He acts as if the money belongs to him.

603
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,520
Hundreds lost their entire savings.
Dozens committed suicide.

604
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,190
Then, there are the family members
and acquaintances.

605
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,025
The number of victims in this case…

606
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,736
Damn it. He's no different
from the evil spirits.

607
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,571
They're all scumbags.

608
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:21,116
In any case,
he tried to deceive the evil spirits.

609
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:26,622
He'll be dead meat if they find out.
So we need to hurry and--

610
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,581
No.

611
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,376
They already know that he's alive.

612
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,462
I escaped from the police

613
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,715
and went to see the others
while waiting for your call.

614
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,814
You don't know either?

615
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,076
Where's Lee Chung-jae? Where's my money?

616
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,622
I said I'd let you live if you tell me.

617
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,290
How does that make any sense?

618
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,961
How could a single crazy bitch
wipe out all the boys?

619
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,797
What should I do, sir?

620
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:22,094
What do you think?
Lie low until I call you.

621
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,305
And remove that tattoo.

622
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,643
They read the money launderer's mind
before he died

623
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,646
and are looking for Lee Chung-jae now.

624
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:36,024
We need to find him before they do.

625
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,864
First, we should look into
number 37, Lim Jae-youl.

626
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:45,993
He was told to remove his tattoo and wait.
It means they'll meet again.

627
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,911
Right, Ms. Chu?

628
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,914
Ms. Chu?

629
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,375
Ms. Chu!

630
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,002
Yes?

631
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,629
It's unlike you to be distracted.

632
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:04,428
We should get going. Mun and Jeok-bong
must be waiting at the treatment facility.

633
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:09,266
I'm meeting Mun back at the hospital.
Mr. Ma's mother will be discharged today.

634
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,351
All right. Take her home safely.

635
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:15,772
I should see how
the new hospital ward is doing.

636
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,035
NUMBER 37 LIM JAE-YOUL

637
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,920
9 YEARS AGO
CHU MAE-OK'S FIRST ASSIGNMENT

638
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,135
Mom, what's wrong? Are you all right?

639
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,680
Yes. I'm fine.

640
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,729
Do you really think I can do this?

641
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,026
Mo-tak, how far are you?

642
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,986
I'm almost there. It won't take long.

643
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,499
Hey, move.

644
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,834
Stop!

645
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,882
You better stop.

646
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,218
What's with this old lady?

647
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,345
Help me.

648
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,514
Don't worry.

649
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,808
I'll save you.

650
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,519
Hey, lady.

651
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:37,896
Just go on your way.

652
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,648
Okay?

653
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,692
I said go.

654
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,364
Damn it.

655
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,450
What?

656
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,468
No!

657
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,804
-Don't!
-You should run!

658
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:11,722
Hurry!

659
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:13,974
No!

660
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,031
Come here.

661
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,454
Why, you punks?

662
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,497
Why are you doing this?

663
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,832
Come here.

664
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,376
Come here.

665
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,007
Hey, lady. I mean, Ms. Chu.
Are you all right?

666
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,635
I'm fine, but that kid…

667
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,012
-That kid…
-Calm down.

668
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,847
He got hurt instead of me.

669
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,771
Oh, no! What do I do?

670
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:01,855
What should I do?

671
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,701
Ms. Chu.

672
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,330
Do you have the power to heal?

673
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,167
Hey, kid.

674
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,127
Please.

675
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:25,796
Please.

676
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:27,673
Please stay alive.

677
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,633
Please.

678
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,719
Please.

679
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,073
Thank you.

680
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,036
No, thank you.

681
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,621
Thank you.

682
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,707
Thank you for not dying.

683
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,131
Mo-tak.

684
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,216
Yes, Ms. Chu?

685
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,052
I'll do my best.

686
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,598
I'll do my best

687
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,017
so that good people

688
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,228
won't get hurt.

689
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,606
Okay.

690
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,531
Even the sky is blessing us.
The snow is so pretty.

691
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:42,748
"Lim Jae-youl."

692
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,376
Thanks, Jae-youl.

693
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,337
Thank you.

694
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,134
NUMBER 37 LIM JAE-YOUL

695
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,361
We should go too.

696
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,613
About Lee Chung-jae…

697
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,701
He's our chance, right?

698
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,914
He's the only one who can tell us
who Mr. Hwang is.

699
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:28,210
He must know what a heinous man
Hwang Pil-gwang is.

700
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,420
If we can catch Lee Chung-jae…

701
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,841
We can stop them
from getting close to Mr. Ma.

702
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,887
We must find Mr. Ma at all costs

703
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:43,934
before the evil spirit within him
grows even stronger.

704
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,685
Let's save him at all costs.

705
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:47,729
Okay.

706
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,231
I will save him

707
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,025
no matter what.

708
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,569
Of course.

709
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,796
Darn it.

710
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,593
Jeok-bong, are you keeping watch?

711
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,932
Yes, I'm keeping

712
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,142
-my eyes peeled.
-Jeok-bong.

713
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,646
Ms. Chu and I will be arriving soon.
Aren't you hungry?

714
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,897
What do you want to eat?

715
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,111
It's okay.

716
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,322
I don't want to be distracted
by the smell of food.

717
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,240
Are you sure?

718
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,743
I was going to buy some dumplings,
your favorite. Never mind then.

719
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,203
Wait!

720
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,121
I knew it.

721
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:47,789
Meat or kimchi?

722
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,002
Meat or kimchi, you punk?

723
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,837
-That smell…
-Jeok-bong.

724
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,714
-I can smell it.
-Jeok-bong.

725
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,677
The treatment facility!

726
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,356
Long time no see, Mr. Park.

727
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,401
Who are you?

728
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,202
THE LATE LEE MIN-JI

729
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,677
Have you forgiven him?

730
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,020
We should let him go
if you've given up on revenge.

731
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,939
He's innocent after all.

732
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,440
Right?

733
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,651
No.

734
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:02,280
Just hand him over to me.
I'll have some fun before I kill him.

735
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,993
You see, Ma Ju-seok…

736
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,455
Forget about yourself.

737
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:17,212
Do you think your dead wife
has also forgiven him?

738
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,301
Hold on.

739
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,729
They stepped into the territory
with Mr. Park.

740
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,981
It's definitely a trap.

741
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,816
And it's not just for us.

742
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,653
They're going to lure Mr. Ma in.

743
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,740
We still need to go there.
We need to stop Mr. Ma.

744
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,826
We can't let them toy with him.

745
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,565
Has it finally begun?

746
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,904
All right, you scumbags. Let me see you
fight the ones you care about.

747
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,200
I should be there too.

748
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,829
I don't like being just a spectator.

749
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,665
We're not being just spectators.

750
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,625
Then?

751
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,502
We're the conductors.

752
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,221
Where am I?

753
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,942
You…

754
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,864
Please don't do this!
I don't know anything!

755
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:12,535
I really don't! I can't remember anything!
I'm telling you the truth!

756
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,788
I can't remember anything, I swear.

757
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,295
The defendant will serve probation.

758
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,015
I'm pregnant.

759
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:38,311
Please!

760
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,355
So it was you.

761
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,483
You killed Min-ji.

762
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:48,488
I should've killed you…

763
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,325
a long time ago.

764
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,218
Mr. Ma!

765
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,769
Mr. Ma.

766
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,479
This revenge is meaningless.

767
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,315
He wasn't the one who killed Ms. Lee.

768
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,650
What?

769
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,736
It was the man who approached you.

770
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,116
He used Mr. Park to kill Min-ji.

771
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,452
It was Mr. Hwang's doing.

772
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,288
They're lying! It's nonsense!

773
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:43,042
They're just lying to try to stop you.

774
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,628
Please trust us.

775
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,090
The evil spirit inside you
is manipulating you.

776
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,759
We just need to get rid of it. Then--

777
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,428
Nonsense!

778
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,348
He's telling you
to give up on your revenge.

779
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:03,396
Ma Ju-seok, this is your final chance.

780
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,107
Final!

781
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,611
You have to trust us.

782
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:14,365
Please don't kill me.

783
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:19,787
Please don't kill me.

784
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:24,083
Please don't kill me!

785
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,169
Min-ji said the same thing.

786
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,797
She begged him not to kill her.

787
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,258
Mr. Ma.

788
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:39,891
And yet, you dare to get in my way
just to save this worthless bastard?

789
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,561
My revenge is meaningless?

790
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,941
Then, what's the meaning
of sparing his life?

791
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:55,448
What do I get out of forgiving
Min-ji and Treasure's murderer?

792
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,617
Mr. Ma!

793
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,535
No!

794
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:21,849
Ha-na.

795
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:32,610
Mr. Ma.

796
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,279
No.

797
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:56,551
The evil spirit has become more powerful.
We need to catch him. We must.

798
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,857
Mr. Ma.

799
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:18,114
I warned you not to get in my way.

800
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,327
I told you it was my final warning.

801
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,836
I begged you.

802
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,757
I begged you to stop.

803
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,760
I begged and begged.

804
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,472
But now,

805
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,142
you've left me with no choice!

806
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:39,362
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

807
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,157
Do you feel better
now that you've killed him?

808
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,994
How does it feel to see
that your savior is now an evil spirit?

809
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,914
I'll take your eyes.

810
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,876
We finally meet.

811
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,462
See you in hell.

812
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,714
Tell me.

813
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,382
What is this truth you know of?

814
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:00,842
Ma Ju-seok.

815
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,136
He's becoming more vicious.

816
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,930
Are you alone today?

817
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,391
I'm the one you want. Just you wait.

818
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,440
