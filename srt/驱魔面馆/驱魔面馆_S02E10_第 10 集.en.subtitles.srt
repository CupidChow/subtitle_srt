1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,013
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,820
Hey, Mun.

3
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,363
-Mun.
-He'll wake up.

4
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,076
Mr. Ma?

5
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,536
Yes?

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,788
Who are you?

7
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,626
Thank you. I'm truly grateful.

8
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,505
Grateful for what?

9
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,967
You saved my grandmother.
You're my savior and hero.

10
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,010
I see.

11
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,640
You must be So Mun.
She told me a lot about you.

12
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,934
But I was just doing my job.

13
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,229
No. I promise to repay you.

14
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:49,025
I will protect you no matter what.

15
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,488
That's my job. Your job is to study hard.

16
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,908
-Thank you.
-Hold on.

17
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,536
Hold on. I need to get ready.

18
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,964
This is where we part ways.
Lee Chung-jae got caught.

19
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,757
I just need to kill him.

20
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,594
I just need to get my revenge.
Nothing else.

21
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,389
You're right.

22
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,559
Your revenge is all that matters to you.

23
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,812
You were always the same.

24
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,315
The one who has changed completely…

25
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,193
is me.

26
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,239
Now that Mun has lost his power,

27
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,206
my desires have changed.

28
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,723
What are you doing?

29
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,017
Come to think of it,

30
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:09,480
their powers were nothing
compared to yours.

31
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,318
You can read and erase memories.

32
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,279
You can see the territory
and interact with it.

33
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,614
But even with those powers,

34
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,367
you can't use them to their full extent.

35
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,246
You and I will be one.

36
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,501
Then, I will truly become invincible.

37
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,243
How did it go with Mun?

38
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,296
Mun.

39
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,392
What's going on?

40
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,853
Did he wake up?

41
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,441
All the more reason

42
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,486
to absorb your power.

43
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,525
You can absorb the territory's power

44
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,986
like them.

45
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,405
Ma Ju-seok.

46
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,825
What are you?

47
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:30,496
One thing is certain. I'm not like you.

48
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,757
You're different from me?

49
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,596
Is getting revenge
the only desire you have?

50
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,847
Is that it?

51
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,724
Can you even do it?

52
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,977
Mun is back.

53
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:59,150
In any case, without my help,

54
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,570
you'll never get your revenge.

55
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,488
No.

56
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,284
I don't need your help anymore.

57
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,055
Why?

58
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,308
Why you?

59
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:39,690
Why did you have to be
the one to get that power?

60
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,152
Why?

61
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,615
Why not me?

62
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,868
Why you?

63
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,730
What was that immense power just now?

64
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:26,863
I was able to move under my own free will.

65
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:32,076
It was only for a brief moment,
but I could control Ma Ju-seok's body.

66
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,796
-Wi-gen!
-Wi-gen! Seriously!

67
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,469
We missed you, Wi-gen.

68
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,596
How are you feeling?

69
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,434
You must've gone through a lot
while I was gone.

70
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,228
You must've been so shocked.

71
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:04,525
What happened?
Did Mun sign the Counter contract again?

72
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,610
No.

73
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:11,240
He didn't need to do that.

74
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,327
He didn't need to do it?

75
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,081
Are you saying he came back
without even signing the contract?

76
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,256
Mun.

77
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,300
Your hair…

78
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,427
You didn't sign the contract.

79
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,846
Our relationship goes far beyond

80
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,099
a simple contract.

81
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,946
He's a child

82
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,700
who can do uncanny things with ease.

83
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,545
Gosh, I didn't have time
to make my own kimchi.

84
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,880
I hope this is good.

85
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,436
EPISODE 10

86
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,897
-There you go. Eat up.
-Have some kimchi too.

87
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,903
My goodness, look how he eats.
Mo-tak, serve him another bowl of soup.

88
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,405
Sure thing.

89
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,073
-I want more meat.
-All right.

90
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,119
Koreans need kimchi
to stay strong, you know?

91
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,621
Eat up and take your time.

92
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,041
You must've been famished.

93
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,005
It's so crunchy.

94
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,007
What is this? Did you make it?

95
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,924
What?

96
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,178
That's the chef's secret.
Have some water too.

97
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,307
No, drink warm water instead.
It'll help you digest.

98
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,184
Mun, try this.

99
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,749
Thank you for protecting me.

100
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't be absurd!

101
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,714
I will never again

102
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,760
abandon my family and run away.

103
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,139
Thank you for being patient
and believing in me.

104
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,517
We're not helpless without you.

105
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,188
If we had more time, we would've summoned
Hwang Pil-gwang and Ma Ju-seok.

106
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,316
Of course. Hey, Mun.

107
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,068
You should've been there.

108
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,113
I flew in the air and landed a punch--

109
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,449
It was all thanks to me,

110
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,535
because I showed up
with my huge submachine gun.

111
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,538
And Hwang Pil-gwang ran!

112
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,916
I even cleaned up the mess afterward.

113
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,087
That hotel probably looks
like a seven-star hotel by now.

114
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,342
Hey, let me take some credit too.

115
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:21,555
You have to know that I played
a big role in capturing Gelly.

116
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,265
I already know.

117
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,560
You told me many times already.

118
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,230
You could hear us?

119
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:33,192
I told you to take turns to care for him.
Were you boasting all that time?

120
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:37,071
I just thought I'd entertain him
while he was asleep.

121
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,781
Me too. I thought he'd be bored.

122
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,158
Me too.

123
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,160
So…

124
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,578
Well…

125
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,831
What happened to Ma Ju-seok?

126
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,960
Mun, you just woke up.
Let's take it slowly, okay?

127
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,962
No, I'm okay.

128
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,425
Do you think Ma Ju-seok
and Hwang Pil-gwang have teamed up?

129
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:58,884
No.

130
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,053
He will never side with Hwang Pil-gwang.

131
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,808
When Mun woke up,
the territory opened up wide.

132
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,601
It covered the entire city.

133
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,689
Did you see anyone?
Hwang Pil-gwang? Ma Ju-seok?

134
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,775
The area was so large
that I couldn't locate them.

135
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,363
But Hwang Pil-gwang was trying
to stab Ma Ju-seok with a piece of glass.

136
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,159
Don't tell me
he's planning to kill Ma Ju-seok

137
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,119
and consume his power?

138
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,120
Maybe.

139
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,540
He probably thought
he couldn't absorb Mun's power.

140
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,001
Then, what we were fearing the most
could actually happen.

141
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,463
The evil spirits could become one.

142
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:40,384
It'd be our first time facing
a fully-formed evil spirit.

143
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,845
It's a risky situation,
but it's also an opportunity.

144
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,891
We can summon Ma Ju-seok while he's alone.

145
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,437
We may not know Pil-gwang's plan,
but we know where Ma Ju-seok is headed.

146
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,356
Lee Chung-jae.

147
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,944
What's going on?

148
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,699
Does Ma Ju-seok really know
about our hideout or not?

149
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,580
Ma Ju-seok knows where we are? How?

150
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,000
There's one more thing you should know.

151
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,586
What is it?

152
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:23,552
I think Ma Ju-seok met your grandmother
while you were unconscious.

153
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,724
Why would he?

154
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,026
She's been like this since yesterday.

155
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,571
She tells me to go away
whenever I come near.

156
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,616
She keeps clamoring for me
to call her darling.

157
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,286
By the way, how was the contest?

158
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,206
You must be exhausted from the trip.
You should rest.

159
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,792
I'm okay, Grandpa.

160
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,383
Grandma.

161
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,260
Darling.

162
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,222
Oh. Darn it.

163
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,934
What are you doing up here?

164
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,564
Darling. Call my darling.

165
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,276
Get up.

166
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,071
Why are you out in the cold?

167
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,532
Don't do this. He's gone!

168
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,202
Darling!

169
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,584
Play with me.

170
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,502
Play with me.

171
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,964
Let's play.

172
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:50,264
You said Mun-yeong told you
to play with me.

173
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,685
You said she told you that.

174
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,355
Mun-yeong is gone, ma'am.

175
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,773
What?

176
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,983
I was lying.

177
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,487
Min-ji is gone too.

178
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,781
Treasure is gone as well.

179
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,409
Everyone is gone.

180
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,621
That's not true.

181
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,416
Mun-yeong is here. She's there.

182
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,752
She's over there.

183
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,300
Then can you ask her a question?

184
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,887
Can you ask her

185
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,432
if Min-ji is doing well up there?

186
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,486
Jeez!

187
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,030
My darling isn't gone.

188
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,908
He said he'd come.

189
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:59,375
He promised to come back
if I stayed healthy and ate well.

190
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,629
Ma Ju-seok.

191
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,425
Punish Lee Chung-jae!

192
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,386
Punish him!

193
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,098
Don't try to solve it with compensations
and investigate all his crimes!

194
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,849
Investigate all his crimes!

195
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,768
Punish Lee Chung-jae!

196
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,853
Punish him!

197
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,524
Don't try to solve it with compensations
and investigate all his crimes!

198
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,401
Investigate all his crimes!

199
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,361
Punish Lee Chung-jae!

200
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,823
Is everything ready?

201
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,784
Yes, the Regional Investigation Unit
is here to back us up.

202
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,952
But…

203
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,247
will Ma Ju-seok really show up?
He hasn't made a move yet.

204
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,002
He would never miss a chance
to get his revenge.

205
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,088
So let's stay alert.

206
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,881
Yes, sir.

207
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,967
I hope nothing bad happens.

208
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,095
Investigate all his crimes!

209
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,972
Punish Lee Chung-jae!

210
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,306
Punish him!

211
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,516
JANGMUL NURSING HOME

212
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,894
With Lee Chung-jae's arrest,
it appears inevitable that the police

213
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,274
will reopen the housing fraud case
against Baekdu Planning & Construction.

214
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,277
It's been revealed that some politicians
are also involved.

215
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,487
The authorities are now on alert

216
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,782
and will investigate the source
of the retrieved 120 billion won.

217
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,242
They will also discuss…

218
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,201
Min-ji.

219
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,828
…how to help the victims…

220
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,246
Ju-seok.

221
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,214
-Do you accept the charges against you?
-Anything to say to the victims?

222
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,549
Do you feel no guilt?

223
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,553
Damn it.

224
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,388
You devil!

225
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,141
That crazy…

226
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,353
Damn it. Let me go.

227
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,566
Are you sure my safety is guaranteed?
Do your job!

228
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:06,293
I heard you haven't caught Ma Ju-seok yet.
Are you sure I can be seen in public?

229
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,879
You scared?

230
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,803
You better keep me safe.

231
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,598
Do you really think
I was the mastermind behind this fraud?

232
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,601
I was a thug
who never went to high school.

233
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,773
I'm just a pawn.
The mastermind is someone else.

234
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,572
Are you finally ready
to talk about Mr. Hwang?

235
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,911
Keep me safe

236
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,871
if you want to get what you want.

237
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,082
Who knows?

238
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:49,419
The mastermind could be scheming
something else as we speak.

239
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,298
Let's go.

240
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,427
DEATH PENALTY FOR LEE CHUNG-JAE

241
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,972
YOUR DEATH CAN'T MAKE UP
FOR ALL THE VICTIMS' DEATHS

242
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,098
Worthless scum!

243
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,182
You bastard!

244
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,351
Lee Chung-jae deserves the death penalty!

245
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,563
You deserve to die, you devil!
Give me back my money!

246
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,234
ATONE FOR YOUR SINS

247
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,278
Nothing?

248
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,115
My nose is telling me
that everything is fine so far.

249
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,242
All right. I hope your nose works.

250
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,957
JUNGJIN PENITENTIARY

251
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,296
Mun, how's everything there?

252
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,839
It's quiet so far, Ha-na.

253
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,014
JUNGJIN PENITENTIARY

254
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,943
I can smell it.

255
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,572
I'm sure of it. I smell Ma Ju-seok.

256
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,033
What? Ma Ju-seok?

257
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,618
Where are you?

258
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,831
What?

259
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,251
What?

260
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,759
What's going on?

261
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,305
What's wrong?

262
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,223
It can't be.

263
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,433
Mo-tak, what's going on?

264
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,476
Mo-tak.

265
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,271
Something's wrong with the vehicle!

266
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,648
-Move.
-Yes, sir.

267
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,942
Hey, what's going on?

268
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,947
Damn it.

269
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,177
Ma Ju-seok.

270
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,638
Hold on.

271
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,057
What's the matter?

272
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,940
Oh, no!

273
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,027
Ma Ju-seok.

274
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,722
Mo-tak.

275
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,641
Is everyone okay?

276
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,868
Stop or I'll shoot!

277
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,558
Ma Ju-seok took the bus.

278
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,768
What?

279
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,818
-The tires…
-Mun!

280
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,903
-Mo-tak!
-Mo-tak!

281
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,003
Mr. Ma.

282
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,297
Where are you taking me?

283
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,299
This is a crime.

284
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,717
You're committing a crime!

285
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,763
Mr. Ma, I'm begging you.

286
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,682
Just let me go.

287
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,060
Mr. Ma!

288
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:01,481
LATE LEE MIN-JI

289
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,030
Min-ji.

290
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,243
They caught those scammers.

291
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,998
It all seems meaningless now.

292
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,584
But I hope you can let go

293
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,461
of your resentment now

294
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,549
and feel better.

295
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,553
Ju-seok.

296
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,516
What should I do with him?

297
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,771
He listened to you more than anyone else.

298
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,694
Who will stop him

299
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,031
now that you're gone?

300
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,338
Damn it.

301
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,052
Get out.

302
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,845
I don't want to hurt you.

303
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,975
Hey! Don't leave! Where are you going?

304
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,101
Come back, you bastard!

305
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,360
Yes. Feel free to take your revenge now.

306
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,071
Once you kill him, I'll become…

307
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,200
Damn it!

308
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,122
Don't come near me!

309
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,500
Back off, you devil!

310
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,751
That's right.

311
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,545
You turned me into a devil.

312
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,006
I became one to kill you.

313
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,800
That's why

314
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,594
both of us must die.

315
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,597
What? What are you talking about?

316
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,695
What's that sound?

317
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:17,284
What are you doing?
Damn it! What the hell are you doing?

318
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,296
Over there.

319
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,298
Turn left here.

320
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,181
MEMORIAL PARK

321
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,267
Wait, this is the way to…

322
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,476
The memorial park?

323
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,481
He's near Ms. Lee's columbarium.
He's taking Lee Chung-jae there.

324
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,031
Damn it!
You're gonna kill me, you lunatic!

325
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,532
What is this?

326
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,534
This is the place.

327
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,911
This is where Min-ji lies.

328
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,330
What?

329
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,337
You can make it up to her by dying.

330
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,173
And I will also pay

331
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,926
for my sins with my death.

332
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,727
Ma Ju-seok! What are you doing?

333
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,107
No.

334
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,445
Mr. Ma, I'm begging you.

335
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,654
Don't kill me!

336
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:41,868
If you let me live, I'll repent
and beg for forgiveness…

337
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,913
You bastard! Don't do this!

338
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:50,585
I don't know what's going on.
The bus moved on its own.

339
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,088
I'm telling you it's the truth!

340
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,506
Yes.

341
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,300
Lee and Ma Ju-seok
are the only ones inside.

342
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,843
I don't know what he's up to.

343
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,179
-Ju-seok?
-I think the bus is going to explode.

344
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,894
Are you trying to kill us?

345
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,854
Ju-seok!

346
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,024
It's dangerous!

347
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,609
You need to get out of there!

348
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,112
Ju-seok!

349
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,078
Get out of there.

350
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,080
You need to get out of there!

351
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,665
Mother, it's dangerous.

352
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,916
Ju-seok!

353
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,509
Ju-seok!

354
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,348
Don't come near me!

355
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,351
Stay away!

356
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,731
No, Ju-seok.

357
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,692
Control your anger. Let's try.

358
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,737
It's all over now.

359
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,864
Move aside, Mother.

360
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,742
Please, Ju-seok.

361
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,912
I can't lose you again.

362
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,498
No.

363
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,961
If you still want to go, kill me first.

364
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:20,258
What's the point of living like this?
How could I go on living?

365
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,937
Why did I…

366
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,565
What's wrong with me?

367
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,401
What's wrong?

368
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,238
Are you confused that you can't control
your own body?

369
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,325
I'll show you

370
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:51,080
that this body
doesn't belong to you anymore.

371
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,291
No!

372
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,850
Lee Chung-jae!

373
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,519
-Come here.
-Lee Chung-jae!

374
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,854
-Go away!
-Jeok-bong! Where is he?

375
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,022
Over there!

376
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,322
Aren't you tired of running?

377
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,491
-Don't be such a baby.
-It really hurts.

378
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,784
Where's Ma Ju-seok?

379
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,743
Over there.

380
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,208
No.

381
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,585
Kill her!

382
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:43,132
You were annoyed by the old hag too.

383
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:49,180
She's just another obstacle

384
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,807
in the way of your revenge!

385
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,769
No.

386
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,983
No.

387
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,901
No. Mom.

388
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,201
No. Mom.

389
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,206
No!

390
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,380
That crazy bastard,
How could he hurt his mother?

391
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,759
Ms. Chu! Ma Ju-seok's mother is hurt!
Hurry up!

392
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,274
Yes, this is it.

393
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:45,028
My body feels so much lighter.

394
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,586
Don't tell me
you can absorb the territory's--

395
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,854
Die!

396
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,779
Something…

397
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,073
Something's wrong.

398
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,534
Mr. Ma.

399
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,625
Mr. Ma!

400
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,299
Mr. Ma.

401
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,759
Mun!

402
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,678
-Mr. Ma!
-Mun!

403
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,595
Mr. Ma!

404
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,681
Hey! What happened?

405
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,684
Snap out of it! What's going on?

406
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,644
Something's wrong.

407
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,021
The evil spirit absorbed
the territory's power.

408
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,106
What?

409
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:15,076
Didn't you say only a complete evil spirit
could absorb the territory's power?

410
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,288
That's why we had to stop Hwang Pil-gwang
and Ma Ju-seok from joining forces.

411
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,542
The fact he could read the territory
was already inexplainable.

412
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,877
He had that power.

413
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,879
What does this mean?

414
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,842
Does it mean Ma Ju-seok gets stronger
whenever Mun summons the territory?

415
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,510
Yes.

416
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,346
The territory no longer belongs
to just the Counters.

417
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,435
Summoning the territory recklessly
could make the evil spirit stronger.

418
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,187
A bigger problem is
as it absorbs the territory's power,

419
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,860
the evil spirit within Ma Ju-seok
takes more control over him.

420
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,947
He didn't hesitate
to harm innocent people.

421
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:59,412
Even his mother, of all people.

422
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:04,542
Will Ma Ju-seok
eventually be consumed by the evil spirit?

423
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,586
Something…

424
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,129
Something's wrong.

425
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,547
Mr. Ma.

426
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,259
He wanted to stop.

427
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,055
It's true that the evil spirit
had a tighter grip on him,

428
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,723
but he did want to stop.

429
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,602
He knew something was wrong
and hurt himself to stop it.

430
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,395
He regretted what he did.

431
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,566
That means we still have a chance.

432
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,195
It means he still has the will to resist.

433
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,112
Right?

434
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,793
Mun, you shouldn't have let him go
like that today.

435
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,505
He shouldn't have gotten away.

436
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,299
Before he goes completely out of control,

437
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,385
we should've caught him today.

438
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,304
What do you mean?

439
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,266
Did you deliberately let him go?

440
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,353
He wasn't an evil spirit

441
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,815
in that moment.

442
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,317
No. He has always been…

443
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,445
an evil spirit.

444
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,586
Exhausted already? Come on.

445
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,213
Try harder.

446
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,632
Try to fight back harder.

447
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,261
Get out

448
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,389
of my body.

449
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:46,102
That's impossible now.

450
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,896
Your rage summoned me.

451
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,608
And I made your rage erupt.

452
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:57,655
As much as your rage has grown,
so has my power.

453
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,559
I told you.

454
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,855
Without my permission now,

455
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:36,235
you can't even die, Ma Ju-seok.

456
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,404
This isn't it.

457
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,657
This isn't what I wanted.

458
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,202
Then what?

459
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,414
Did you think everything would end
with your sweet revenge?

460
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,670
Don't be too upset though.

461
00:36:55,671 --> 00:37:01,219
I will get you your revenge
no matter what.

462
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:06,140
Against Lee Chung-jae, Mun, and also…

463
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:11,812
your lonely mother.

464
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,816
I will kill them all!

465
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,537
Okay.

466
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,916
So, did Mo-tak go straight
to the police station?

467
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,252
Yes.

468
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,169
I see.

469
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,047
Will Ma Ju-seok's mother be okay?

470
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,594
I hope the memories I erased today
won't haunt her in her dreams.

471
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:48,099
Of course not. You took good care of her.

472
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:52,603
She left without a single wound.
Mun is going to look after her tonight.

473
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,023
I'm worried about him too.

474
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,485
So much has happened
right after he woke up.

475
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,364
My God. I know.

476
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:09,036
But I agree with Mo-tak.
The evil spirits keep getting stronger.

477
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,164
We can't be soft on them.

478
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,461
Can't we just try fighting him
without the territory?

479
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,424
We did a great job last time at the hotel.

480
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:25,219
And this time, Mun will join us.
And the evil spirits are split.

481
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,429
You're right.

482
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,223
He wouldn't just sit still like this.

483
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,475
What?

484
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,771
If Mr. Hwang failed to kill Ma Ju-seok
just because of the territory,

485
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,399
he wouldn't give up on taking his power.

486
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,860
He'd try to get it one way or another.

487
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,071
So why hasn't he made a move yet?

488
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,574
You're right.

489
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,830
JANGMUL NURSING HOME

490
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,179
Are you awake?

491
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,142
I didn't know you were here.

492
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,270
When did I fall asleep?

493
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,651
I went to see Min-ji today.

494
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,821
You did?

495
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,616
Yes.

496
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,369
Now that the scammers have been caught,

497
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:39,752
she can now be at peace in heaven.

498
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,089
I needed to tell her that.

499
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,467
You did well.

500
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:52,681
I was hoping that Ju-seok…

501
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,728
would return.

502
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,982
But he won't, right?

503
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:10,074
Even though the scammers
have all been caught,

504
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,619
he still has no desire
to come back, right?

505
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,334
I had a dream.

506
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,087
In the dream,

507
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,841
Ju-seok was a little boy.

508
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,803
And he was sitting alone on top of a hill.

509
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,765
When Ju-seok

510
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,310
first came to the orphanage,

511
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,522
for the first few months,

512
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,486
all he ever did was sit on this hill
that overlooked the fences.

513
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,490
He said his mother would return,

514
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,452
and he said he was waiting for her.

515
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:04,003
It was Min-ji who helped him
come down from that hill.

516
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,052
Ju-seok…

517
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,724
is waiting for her now.

518
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:24,064
Who will help him now that she's gone?

519
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,665
I asked you to protect me.

520
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:46,295
How can you call yourselves the police?
You call that protecting and serving?

521
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,884
We're not here to protect and serve you.

522
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:01,143
I should've let that bastard kill me
so you'd all get fired.

523
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,898
Is this why you wanted to see me?
Just to talk nonsense?

524
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,443
If you can't catch Ma Ju-seok,
at least catch Mr. Hwang.

525
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,904
Ma Ju-seok needs to know

526
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,157
that Mr. Hwang is the person
he should go after, not me.

527
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,121
You're leaving? Fine.

528
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,542
Then I'm going to go public
with the evidence that I have.

529
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,756
Evidence?

530
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,554
About the housing fraud
and Mr. Hwang being the mastermind.

531
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:42,017
I might die because of your incompetence.
So I should at least reveal the truth.

532
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,477
Is this all a joke?

533
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,232
You took the fall for him two years ago.

534
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,610
And now, you're blaming Mr. Hwang
for everything?

535
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:55,698
What are you talking about?
It was his scheme to begin with.

536
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,367
I was just his pawn!

537
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:04,331
Do you want me to sit still
and wait for Ma Ju-seok to kill me?

538
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,377
He escaped from jail,
so what makes you think he can't break in?

539
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,096
Do you really have any evidence?

540
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,269
Are you intrigued now?

541
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,607
Promise you'll get me out
and put me in witness protection.

542
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,985
Promise me you'll hide me
where he can't find me.

543
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,071
Where is the evidence?

544
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,158
2 YEARS AGO

545
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,098
It's 120 billion won.

546
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,852
You're going to take it all
behind my back?

547
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,355
You're quite ambitious for a pawn.

548
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,982
Did you think I'd be your pawn forever?

549
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:17,321
You're finished, you bastard.
You're out of this game.

550
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,531
At the end of this game…

551
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,910
you're the one who dies.

552
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,956
What a heinous devil.

553
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:32,920
Now that we have proof,
we can put him behind bars.

554
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:38,008
With this proof, he'll rot in jail.

555
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:44,556
But once people find out about this video,
they will also know

556
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,017
that Hwang Pil-gwang was behind the fraud.

557
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,604
Then Ma Ju-seok will go after him.

558
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,359
He will make Hwang Pil-gwang pay
for deceiving him.

559
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,986
This is a huge problem.

560
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,656
Ma Ju-seok is a ticking bomb right now.

561
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:04,201
But we can't hide this forever.

562
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:09,164
We must summon him
before the video goes public.

563
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,417
We need someone

564
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,421
who can bring him down from the hill.

565
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,844
What if we just try…

566
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,682
to persuade him?

567
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:29,852
Persuade him?

568
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,897
I was able to wake up from my coma

569
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,817
because you were all waiting for me
and supporting me.

570
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,446
I wouldn't be here right now
if it wasn't for you all.

571
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,363
Mun.

572
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,699
What's gotten into you this time?

573
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:48,454
Maybe Ma Ju-seok is the one
who's desperate to put an end to this.

574
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,374
If we can persuade him
while he still has a will of his own--

575
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,459
Mun.

576
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,175
Do you think the evil spirit is like you?

577
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,261
Plus, how will we persuade him?

578
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:09,349
There's no way to find him now,

579
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,144
except to just wait
for him to go after Lee Chung-jae.

580
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:17,983
The territory.

581
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,986
Why don't we use the territory?

582
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,571
The territory?

583
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,491
He can read it.

584
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:30,120
Mun can summon it and talk to him.

585
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:35,250
If he can accept the fact that summoning
the evil spirit is his only way out…

586
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,668
Yes.

587
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:41,798
We'll be able to summon him
without getting anyone else hurt.

588
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,387
Plus, we are out of time and options.

589
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,932
The human part
of him is being swayed right now.

590
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:54,603
This could be our last chance
to persuade him.

591
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:12,829
Hey, Doctor.

592
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,374
Did the detective call you?

593
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,586
We don't receive any calls.

594
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,756
It could be urgent.
You should be more flexible.

595
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,008
Hey!

596
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,637
Ask the guard if I got any calls.

597
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,599
Go back to your cell if you feel better.

598
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,017
Damn it.

599
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,067
He should give me a call
if he saw the evidence.

600
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,485
Why is he not calling?

601
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,497
This won't do.

602
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,125
Hey, Doctor, let me make one phone call--

603
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,045
Mr. Hwang!

604
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,092
What's happening?

605
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,762
I doubt you've been locked up.

606
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,267
Did you just walked through the wall?

607
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,688
Damn it. Are you guys ghosts or what?

608
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,324
Mr. Hwang.

609
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,785
I was never going to rat you out.

610
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,662
So…

611
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,706
Let me explain what happened.

612
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,710
No. You did well, Chung-jae.

613
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:46,214
You can't hide it forever.
The truth should always come out.

614
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:47,758
What?

615
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:53,805
I'm just thankful that you're still alive

616
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,184
in this important moment.

617
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,108
JANGMUL NURSING HOME

618
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,401
Mr. Ma.

619
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,695
Mr. Ma.

620
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,989
Can you hear me?

621
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,329
Fortunately,

622
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,249
your mother is okay.

623
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,130
Ms. Chu took good care of her.

624
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,259
And she erased all the bad memories.

625
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:18,932
If we had got there just an instant later,

626
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,894
she wouldn't have made it though.

627
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,442
No.

628
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,068
No, Mom.

629
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:33,822
However,

630
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,283
it's okay.

631
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,745
I know…

632
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:46,793
that this isn't what you wanted.

633
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,173
I know that you wanted to stop.

634
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,134
And I also know…

635
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,431
that it's not too late.

636
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,435
No.

637
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,938
It is too late.

638
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,570
I can't go back now.

639
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,492
Come down from that hill, Mr. Ma.

640
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,746
I'll make everything right.

641
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:25,957
So…

642
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,419
you should…

643
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,256
return to your old self

644
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,510
when you see Ms. Lee again.

645
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,014
I hope our baby takes after you.

646
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,229
I hope our baby
has your cute face and kind heart.

647
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:52,067
Thank you so much
for always protecting me.

648
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,028
Min-ji.

649
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,448
Will I be able

650
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,160
to see you again?

651
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,872
Let's not give up.

652
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:13,547
I won't give up on you either.

653
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,343
Come back, Mr. Ma.

654
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,645
Mun.

655
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,567
I need to meet him.

656
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:48,248
No. Don't do this, Ma Ju-seok!

657
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,797
Put your hands up!

658
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,425
Don't move.

659
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:46,056
I just want to talk. Okay?

660
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,184
About that guy.

661
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,811
About how Lee Chung-jae died.

662
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,482
And the truth
about the Baekdu housing fraud.

663
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,402
Things like that.

664
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,487
Hold on.

665
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,716
So…

666
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,718
Do you think Ma Ju-seok will come?

667
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,970
He will.

668
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,972
I know he will.

669
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:30,725
He'll come.

670
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,104
We were confident
that Mun would wake up too.

671
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:38,274
Let's believe that he'll come.
He was someone we trusted.

672
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:45,031
He should be here by now
if he was really persuaded.

673
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:50,787
Hey, Han-ul.

674
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,374
-What?
-What is it?

675
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,334
Okay, I'm on my way.

676
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,756
Damn it. Lee Chung-jae has disappeared.

677
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,800
Was it Ma Ju-seok? Did he do something?

678
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,846
What is this? Damn it.

679
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,226
Hwang Pil-gwang.

680
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,688
Stay here in case Ma Ju-seok comes.

681
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,941
-The rest of you, let's go find Hwang.
-Okay.

682
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,276
-Mo-tak.
-An unidentified man

683
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,445
has barged into a broadcasting station.

684
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,779
We found Hwang Pil-gwang.

685
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,490
This unidentified man claims
he wants to reveal the truth

686
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,201
-about the Baekdu housing fraud.
-Hwang Pil-gwang.

687
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:33,204
-What's she saying?
-He voluntarily came to the press.

688
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,331
Let's hear our reporter.

689
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,419
Where should I begin?

690
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,297
MAN TO REVEAL THE TRUTH
ABOUT BAEKDU HOUSING FRAUD

691
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,843
I doubt you're interested
in the deaths of nameless individuals.

692
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,180
Then how about me killing Lee Chung-jae?

693
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:51,973
Or,

694
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:57,520
should I talk about how I'm the mastermind
of the Baekdu housing fraud?

695
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:03,359
If not, then how about…

696
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,113
how I killed…

697
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:09,866
Ma Ju-seok's wife.

698
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,661
MAN CONFESSES TO MURDERS

699
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,705
That bastard.

700
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,125
It was in here, Ma Ju-seok.

701
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,920
The truth behind your wife's death.

702
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:29,177
You won't get your revenge
without my help.

703
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,721
Who do you think killed your wife?

704
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:35,058
Was it Mr. Park who brutally murdered
your pregnant wife?

705
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:40,939
Sadly, you haven't arrived
at the end of the truth. No.

706
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,275
You're nowhere near it.

707
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,626
Why are you suddenly
confessing to everything?

708
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,008
Because I…

709
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,306
had to find you.

710
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,477
-It's Ma Ju-seok!
-That's him?

711
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,854
Ma Ju-seok.

712
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,302
I'm pregnant, so please don't kill me!

713
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,141
-No!
-No!

714
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,058
No!

715
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,195
Congratulations.

716
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,365
You've finally discovered the truth.

717
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,245
Yes. It was me.

718
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,583
I am responsible for the deaths

719
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,337
of your wife and baby.

720
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:32,884
So all this time, that rage of yours…

721
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,555
should've been directed at me.

722
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,896
Die.

723
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,455
Yes. That's it, Ma Ju-seok.

724
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,293
I will live inside you…

725
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,047
forever.

726
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,435
No.

727
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,605
Does Ma Ju-seok

728
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,399
no longer exist now?

729
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:35,608
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

730
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:39,445
Ma Ju-seok killed Hwang Pil-gwang
after all.

731
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,906
He should be eliminated on sight.

732
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,074
You want us to kill him?

733
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:46,077
He will find you through the territory.

734
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,620
-There's a dead body…
-No!

735
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,664
-Han-ul!
-We still have a chance.

736
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,833
We can summon him and save everyone.

737
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,334
That's enough!

738
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,794
I will kill him.

739
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,921
You evil spirit!

740
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,549
Hurry and run!

741
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,217
-Mun!
-Mun!

742
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,385
I'll end this fight.

743
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,637
Thank you for everything.

744
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,686
