1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,791
EONNI'S NOODLES

3
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,669
Rock, paper, scissors.

4
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,587
Yes, I won!

5
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,848
You…

6
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,576
Kids are always so cheerful.

7
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,705
They still think the world is beautiful.

8
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,250
They don't know that it is hell

9
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,253
and it can end in the blink of an eye.

10
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,213
How pitiful.

11
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,467
Pretty good.

12
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,636
What do you want?

13
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,929
What do I want?

14
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,473
That's right.

15
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,268
That's the first question
everyone asks me.

16
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,604
But all they can offer is

17
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,105
money…

18
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,734
or their lives.

19
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,320
What about you?

20
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,032
What is it that you want
to be hiding in a place like this

21
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,117
while coming after us?

22
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,873
We catch and punish evil spirits like you.

23
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,835
We also save the innocent souls
trapped inside you.

24
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,420
That's what we do.

25
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,089
"Punish"?

26
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,886
And…

27
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,555
you're confident you can do that?

28
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:25,974
What about you?

29
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,520
Did you really come here
because you were confident?

30
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,565
And not because of your fear
of how strong I'd be?

31
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,665
Okay, I'll do it for you.

32
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,584
Rock, paper, scissors.

33
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,589
Do you want some water?

34
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,260
Ice? Do you want some ice?

35
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,348
It's him.

36
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,607
Ha-na.

37
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,859
Brace yourself.

38
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,320
No matter what happens,

39
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,280
let's protect the kids.

40
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,616
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,003
That power of yours…

42
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,799
Where in the world do you get it from?

43
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,303
But you use that power
to protect these useless things?

44
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,180
Why?

45
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,182
Just shut it.

46
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,936
You must think you're invincible
after absorbing our powers,

47
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,106
but you're all bound to go to hell.

48
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,222
Are you okay?

49
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,765
Yes.

50
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,489
You have

51
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,825
so many things

52
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,328
you need to protect.

53
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,219
Mun.

54
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:34,889
Damn it.

55
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,049
EPISODE 3

56
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,682
He came to us willingly, but I let him go.

57
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,353
I should've punished him
for murdering Ms. Lee.

58
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,192
You had no choice.

59
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,611
You had to protect the kids.

60
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,534
How in the world

61
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,078
did they find us here?

62
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,747
This may actually be for the best.

63
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,166
They can see the territory.

64
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,587
Unless they make a move first,

65
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,797
there's no way to locate them.

66
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,009
We have to find them at all costs.

67
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,885
We need to find

68
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,013
and catch that bastard.

69
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,565
JUNGJIN FIRE STATION

70
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,363
Have you tried calling Ju-seok?

71
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,574
-He isn't picking up, right?
-He's not.

72
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,451
He must be devastated.

73
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,828
He might not even return to work.

74
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,747
-He will.
-We're still getting ready.

75
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,373
Just a minute.

76
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,792
Hey!

77
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,502
Hey, stop!

78
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,673
What the hell?

79
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,634
What was that?

80
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,386
-Did we get a call?
-I didn't hear anything.

81
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,440
Two years ago,

82
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,901
I was the one who helped the young So Mun

83
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,654
grow to become
the uncanny Counter that he is today.

84
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,948
It was me, Ga Mo-tak.

85
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,993
That means you

86
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,914
can also become an uncanny Counter
who could surpass him.

87
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,499
Me?

88
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,336
Do you think I can do it?

89
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,922
You have to.

90
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,967
Your father was so delighted
when you woke up.

91
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,677
You can't fall back into a coma.

92
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,556
-Of course not. I need to be a good son.
-The green is Ms. Chu.

93
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,141
The red is Ha-na.

94
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,520
And do you see
the yellow handprint way up top?

95
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,397
The one handprint

96
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,108
that is much higher than the others.

97
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,567
I, Ga Mo-tak,

98
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,820
made that legendary jump.

99
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,281
How did you jump all the way up there?

100
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,700
But one handprint's missing.

101
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,828
There are only three.

102
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,745
Exactly.

103
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,248
Where could Mun's be?

104
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,126
The moment you find his,

105
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,253
we'll accept you as a true Counter.

106
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,297
-Jeok-bong.
-Yes?

107
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,095
Let's fly.

108
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,555
Okay.

109
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,190
I love your expression.

110
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,152
It's okay if your first jump's bad.
You can get better.

111
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,987
Nice. Are you ready, Jeok-bong?

112
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,697
Now, let's jump!

113
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,407
For the future

114
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,577
You can do it!

115
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,564
Gi-ran.

116
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,024
It's me, Mo-tak.

117
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,903
About that guy, Na Jeok-bong…

118
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,821
Are you sure he's connected with Yung?

119
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,532
Could you check for me?

120
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,701
This is pretty bad.

121
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,871
Okay, sure. Bye.

122
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,332
-Hello?
-Mo-tak.

123
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,084
A fire truck has been stolen.

124
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,713
What kind of lunatic
steals a fire truck? Who was it?

125
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,256
The thing is…

126
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,592
The thief is a firefighter.

127
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,219
A firefighter?

128
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,848
EMERGENCY ESCORT
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

129
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,947
What's that?

130
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,492
What's with that fire truck?

131
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,160
Did it break down?

132
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,376
I'll go check.

133
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,552
Excuse me.

134
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,178
Is there a problem?

135
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,223
Excuse me.

136
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,695
What's going on?

137
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,783
What the hell?

138
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,041
What in the world?

139
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,191
Shit!

140
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,362
Die!

141
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,916
Damn it!

142
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,500
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

143
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,961
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

144
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,887
Please don't kill me.
Why are you doing this to me?

145
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,305
Why?

146
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,222
"Why?"

147
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,725
Why did you kill her?

148
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,311
She tried to forget everything you did

149
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,565
and start living a new life,
so why did you kill her?

150
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,943
She was even pregnant!

151
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,736
It's driving me crazy too!

152
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,196
I mean it.

153
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,948
I really can't remember anything.

154
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,583
-You don't remember?
-No.

155
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,460
You said the same thing after scamming us.

156
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,462
"We don't remember."

157
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,757
I shouldn't have forgiven
bastards like you.

158
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,969
-Ju-seok.
-I should've just--

159
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,178
Ju-seok!

160
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,981
Ju-seok.

161
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,072
You're monsters.

162
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,158
How…

163
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,077
How could a human

164
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,414
kill another human?

165
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,506
How could they

166
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,092
kill another human being?

167
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,431
How?

168
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,729
Hi, Treasure.

169
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,106
I'm your mommy.

170
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,151
I'm your daddy. Nice to meet you.

171
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,452
Ju-seok!

172
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,966
Ju-seok.

173
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,513
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

174
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,688
The suspect Park Seong-uk
and the officers on site

175
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,732
thankfully weren't hurt too much.

176
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,526
Did he ask for an attorney?

177
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,945
He said he didn't want one.

178
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,656
He said he'll receive his punishment.

179
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,798
Your mother's really worried

180
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,884
since you're not accepting visitors.

181
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,096
She's doing well though.

182
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,934
She says you need to stay strong

183
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,645
and to not skip your meals.

184
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,653
And as for Ms. Lee…

185
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,575
We laid her to rest

186
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,703
in a nice place.

187
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,913
Thank you, Mun.

188
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,167
Mr. Ma.

189
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,212
You don't have to worry.

190
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,007
-No one was severely injured.
-That's good.

191
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,015
I also met someone two years ago.

192
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,148
The man who killed my parents.

193
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,899
At the time,

194
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,820
I wanted to kill him too.

195
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,156
So I know.

196
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,782
I understand

197
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,119
how hard it was for you
to make that decision.

198
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,956
You were angry and bitter.

199
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,792
But you held yourself back.

200
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,130
Others won't know, but I do. I understand.

201
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:35,966
I was a coward.

202
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,677
What?

203
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,222
I was afraid.

204
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,558
Yeah.

205
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,602
I was just scared.

206
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,481
The bastard who killed
Min-ji and Treasure…

207
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,985
I wanted to kill him

208
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,280
a thousand times over with my own hands.

209
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,660
But as I was about to,

210
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,580
I became afraid.

211
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,209
I tried to kill him but I couldn't.

212
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,503
Like a fool.

213
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,423
Mr. Ma.

214
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,219
Right now,

215
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,182
I hate myself for hesitating to kill

216
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,395
that worthless scumbag.

217
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,192
Why do you keep saying such things?

218
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,611
-You're a good person--
-I'm not a good person.

219
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,574
So don't think of me that way.

220
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,828
And don't come back.

221
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,625
Mr. Ma.

222
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,642
WE ARE CLOSED

223
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,894
I can't believe it's happening.

224
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,354
I knew one day it would but still.

225
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,023
What can we do?

226
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,650
They know where we are now.

227
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,986
Here are your noodles.

228
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,280
Noodles.

229
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,038
Our last bowls of noodles.

230
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,581
Ms. Chu.

231
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,376
Other noodles won't taste
as good as these, right?

232
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,258
Is Mun not here yet?

233
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,884
Sorry I'm late.

234
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,761
-Come on in.
-Come and sit.

235
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,388
-Come on in.
-Eat up.

236
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,223
This looks good.

237
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,610
Mun.

238
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,737
Yes?

239
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,158
I won't ask you
to stop training on your own.

240
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,702
So just let me know if you ever get hurt.

241
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,122
You trained again today?

242
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,625
You really don't listen, do you?

243
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,545
It won't do you any good.

244
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,422
So you're the only Counter?

245
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,090
You'll catch them all yourself?

246
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,009
No.

247
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,052
That's not why.

248
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,221
I just have a lot on my mind.

249
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,809
The evil spirits can see the territory,
so we can't find them.

250
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,519
I just feel

251
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,898
very anxious and frustrated.

252
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,613
-Sorry?
-What?

253
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,239
Isn't that your motto?

254
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,409
Ms. Chu, the evil spirit hunter.

255
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,162
We're not in sync.

256
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,542
Mun.

257
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,504
If you feel anxious, we do too.

258
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,340
And if you can do it,
then we can do it too.

259
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,300
That's us.

260
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,221
Our job's never been easy.

261
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,890
But we'll still get it done
no matter what.

262
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,518
And we'll succeed.
Isn't that what you said?

263
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,395
Mun…

264
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,774
Once you see our new hideout,

265
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,484
you'll have a change of heart.

266
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,444
You should be excited.

267
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,531
I made sure to pick the best spot.

268
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,950
What?

269
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,953
Judging by what you said,
it must not be a noodle shop.

270
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,539
What do you mean?

271
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,543
I thought we were moving
to another noodle shop.

272
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,547
You see, my body digests
rice better than flour.

273
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,259
So I was hoping for a pho shop.

274
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,635
-Jeok-bong.
-Yes?

275
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,387
You want to train or eat noodles?

276
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,430
The latter…

277
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,225
-I should eat the noodles.
-Of course.

278
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,102
-Eat up, Jeok-bong.
-Eat up.

279
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,450
Welcome, everyone.

280
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,702
Come this way.

281
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,380
-Is this it?
-What do you think?

282
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,718
This is his company?

283
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,635
That's right.

284
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,220
That's awesome.

285
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,556
Goodness.

286
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,099
It's humongous.

287
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,982
You're the chairman,
but why aren't they greeting you?

288
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,859
We're invisible to them.

289
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,485
And so are the others.

290
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,322
No one will take notice of us here.

291
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,491
Come on, Mo-tak.

292
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,453
I didn't mean it literally.

293
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,122
I told them to act
like they don't notice us.

294
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,665
-Come on.
-Watch out.

295
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,753
Ms. Chu, how was that?

296
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,046
-Don't say my name.
-Ms. Chu.

297
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,924
Why is it so deep inside?

298
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,140
So this is our new hideout.

299
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,017
Close your mouths. You're drooling.

300
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,855
This place is awesome.

301
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,942
There's a shiny new kitchen too.

302
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,693
This place is huge.

303
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,946
If we put in soil to plant
lettuce and vegetables here,

304
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,572
they'd be so nice to have for lunch.

305
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,824
You're dead meat
if you bring soil in here.

306
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,034
I mean that.

307
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,954
You should've brought us here sooner.

308
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,205
Jeok-bong, come on!

309
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,289
Do you like it?

310
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,832
Stop roughhousing!

311
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,960
What's that?

312
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,670
There's a bunch of fun stuff.

313
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,339
What is this?

314
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,675
A jukebox.
Ms. Chu, there's even a jukebox.

315
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,010
Ha-na, the kitchen looks incredible.

316
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,303
What is this?

317
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,638
What is it?

318
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,767
I give up!

319
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,270
Gosh, look at these clothes.

320
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,854
Do you like it?

321
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,898
It's my housewarming gift.

322
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,734
Now, this is more like it.

323
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,194
Is this bulletproof?

324
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,570
Should we test it out?

325
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:13,947
Bang!

326
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,365
What about our rooms?

327
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,075
There are four in total.

328
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,035
Mo-tak, yours is on the far right.

329
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,453
-Thank you.
-Then, Ms. Chu.

330
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,122
-Yours is the second one.
-Okay.

331
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,040
You can use that one.

332
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,336
You two can share the last room.

333
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,254
-What?
-What?

334
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,631
-He's new.
-He doesn't need a room.

335
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,466
It was comfortable outside, right?

336
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,010
Come on. I'm still older than you.

337
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,136
I have seniority.

338
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,888
Be quiet. Change into your gear
and meet at the ring.

339
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,973
Okay.

340
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,687
I like how stretchy this is.

341
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,564
It's certainly lighter.

342
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,982
It fits perfectly.

343
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,452
What was that?

344
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,038
No way. An ambush drill?

345
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,539
Am I okay?

346
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,082
-No, you're dead.
-You too.

347
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,500
I think I'm still alive.

348
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,336
-Your nose.
-You're dead too.

349
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,837
My goodness.

350
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,964
You're keeping us on our toes.

351
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,384
I understand we're all excited
about moving to a new hideout.

352
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:21,264
But I thought all of us, including me,
shouldn't let our guard down.

353
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,976
My speed just now was
how fast the evil spirit was on that day.

354
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,521
And Mr. Hwang is probably even faster.

355
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,900
You're saying those evil spirits
are really this fast?

356
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,109
He's right.

357
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:38,740
If we want to catch them,
we must be faster and stronger than this.

358
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,201
They likely have
a rough idea of how strong we are.

359
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,286
So in turn, we must be prepared too.

360
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,664
If that marker was a knife,
you'd be all dead.

361
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,877
You should train harder
and with purpose from now on. Got it?

362
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,464
Do you think we can dodge them?

363
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,510
Why didn't you tell us about this before?

364
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,137
We must've looked like slowpokes.

365
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,807
Well, the reason is

366
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,060
I know we'll all improve and grow--

367
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,561
Stop.

368
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,855
What are you saying?
You took it easy on us?

369
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,273
So we wouldn't feel hurt?

370
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,442
He's looking down on all of us.

371
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,610
Just you wait.

372
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,737
Okay, today…

373
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,364
Let's fight, you punk.

374
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,742
All right. From this moment on,

375
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,496
I'm not Mun, but a complete evil spirit.

376
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,705
-You evil spirit!
-Get him!

377
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,706
Hold on!

378
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,583
This evil spirit talks too much.

379
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,586
-I wasn't done talking!
-You evil spirit!

380
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,588
I've heard a lot about you!

381
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,258
That's it!

382
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,261
That's it! Great job!

383
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,016
Let me go!

384
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,457
At this rate,

385
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,001
Mun is going to kill all…

386
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,464
Are you all okay?

387
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:21,009
-We'll end today's session here.
-Where do you think you're going?

388
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,844
You're not done?

389
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,513
Fine, Ha-na. You win.

390
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,057
You've become stronger and faster.

391
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,102
-What else? More powerful.
-He's right. Ha-na…

392
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,937
-Let's stop here.
-Right.

393
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,897
Let's stop.

394
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,231
Goodness, Ms. Chu.

395
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,108
Are you tired?

396
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,487
If you want to end it, then knock me out.

397
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,324
All right, Ms. Do.

398
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,746
You asked for this.

399
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,706
Jeez, he talks so much.

400
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,376
All right.

401
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,260
If you use your eyes, you'll be too slow.

402
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,770
You need to feel it.

403
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,095
I finally landed a punch!

404
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,978
The evil spirit has been summoned!

405
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,106
Ha-na…

406
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,112
Good work, Ha-na.

407
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,489
You're our only hope.

408
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,285
Heal us.

409
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,871
Heal us, Ms. Chu.

410
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,291
You sure are a relentless one, Ha-na.

411
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,009
-Good job.
-Good job.

412
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,512
Oh, no.

413
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,931
-The ball hit you by accident.
-Yeah.

414
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,308
Sorry about that.

415
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,311
You should've kicked it better.
We're all terrible at it.

416
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,982
He totally ignored you.

417
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,483
Sir.

418
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,278
Looks like he's the plucky type.

419
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,282
It's him.

420
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,452
He tried to kill his wife's murderer
and was sent to prison.

421
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,494
Right?

422
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,540
You're holding yourself back pretty well.

423
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,918
You're not mad?

424
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,462
Are you a pacifist? Are you?

425
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:08,760
We can only react once you get mad.

426
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:13,348
No wonder you couldn't protect your wife
or have the guts to kill her murderer.

427
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,515
You idiot.

428
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,601
And this is still okay?

429
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,644
Is it?

430
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,228
Is it okay, you shit--

431
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,651
Let go of me!

432
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,739
Damn it!

433
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,633
Min-ji. Treasure.

434
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,844
I'm sorry

435
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,555
I couldn't protect you.

436
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,975
I'll be there soon.

437
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,728
It won't take long.

438
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,399
I'm sorry, Mom.

439
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,495
I can feel it.

440
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:04,751
Your deep-seated rage is calling me.

441
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,922
The excruciating pain.

442
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,134
This is it.

443
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,388
This is why you could summon me.

444
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,352
Your sadness. Your rage.

445
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,316
You're different.

446
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,032
Ju-seok.

447
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,159
You want to die?

448
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,661
Min-ji.

449
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,122
Why would you do that?

450
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,959
You're not the one who deserves to die.

451
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,295
Don't die.

452
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,882
Let me help you.

453
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,469
I'll ignite that rage of yours.

454
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,890
All you need to do now is accept me.

455
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,077
What is it?

456
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,955
The Yung people told me
to do everything I can.

457
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,251
I can do anything if you're by my side.

458
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,635
Ha-na! Wait up!

459
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,931
Ha-na.

460
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,016
Did you know?

461
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,726
What?

462
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,856
We've been running for the past
six hours and seventeen minutes.

463
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,815
So?

464
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,737
I could die at any moment,
so let me ask you for a favor.

465
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,656
Please.

466
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,994
Can I have a nice, cold ice cream bar?

467
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,413
I'm begging you.

468
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,042
Fine.

469
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,169
Really?

470
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,838
Others may not know it, but I do.

471
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,091
You're an angel deep down.

472
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,885
-I changed my mind.
-You're an angel!

473
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,554
Where are you going?

474
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,848
I saw a convenience store over there!

475
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,684
There's one here too!

476
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,274
I just don't like him.

477
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,320
DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO
CLASSIC PIANO ACADEMY

478
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,819
Mr. Park, someone's here.

479
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,529
She must be your girlfriend.

480
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,077
-No, I'm not.
-Hey.

481
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,246
How could you pair this old lady
in a tracksuit with Mr. Park?

482
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,666
Hey, I'm not old.

483
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,014
Do Ha-na.

MUSIC ROOM

485
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,467
Why did you suddenly stop playing?

486
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,970
-Why are you only playing the do note?
-Wait. Do?

487
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,221
Hey, Do-hwi.

488
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,640
-Do Ha-na?
-It's her, right?

489
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,518
-He's always shy when we talk about her.
-It's not like…

490
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,145
that.

491
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,647
Me?

492
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,898
All right, Do-hwi.

493
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,484
Hey…

494
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,778
Good luck.

495
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,322
-What's wrong with you?
-Good luck!

496
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,618
Hi.

497
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,246
Hi.

498
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,547
You're Ha-na, right?

499
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,925
No, I'm not.

500
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,012
It's me, Do-hwi.

501
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,638
Park Do-hwi.

502
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,352
I'm not Ha-na.

503
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,188
Ha-na.

504
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,194
So it is you.

505
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,030
I missed you, Ha-na.

506
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,073
What?

507
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,117
What's with this strange vibe?

508
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,704
Come here for a second.

509
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:42,791
Hey.

510
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,752
Are you okay?

511
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,045
-Hey.
-Are you all right?

512
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,510
Your nose is bleeding.

513
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,221
I'm okay. I'm totally fine.

514
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,599
But that's not important right now.
Who is he?

515
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,518
-Well…
-Take this.

516
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,685
What?

517
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,357
By the way, what's this smell?

518
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,531
Hey, what are you doing?

519
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,823
-Hey.
-Hold on.

520
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,283
-What's wrong?
-Jeok-bong.

521
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,579
What's this smell?

522
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,791
Sorry. What's the matter with you?

523
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,001
I've never smelled
anything like it before.

524
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,463
Hey. Hey!

525
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,006
He's okay.

526
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,424
-Hey!
-We should treat him.

527
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,218
We should stop the bleeding.

528
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,511
I'm sorry.

529
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,139
This way.

530
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,141
Can you please calm down?

531
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,395
I'll go to the pharmacy.

532
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,648
There's a piano repairman inside.
Tell him to wait once he's done.

533
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,899
Okay.

534
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,318
What medicine does he need?

535
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:55,447
Dad, I'm going to die!

536
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,657
I'm on my way!

537
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,538
Hey, what smell?

538
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,956
What was it?

539
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,709
You better not be lying
or you're dead meat. Got that?

540
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,337
I've smelled all sorts of dung
like cow and dog dung.

541
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,880
But I've never smelled this before.

542
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,465
What dung?

543
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,677
Hey!

544
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,099
It's impossible to explain in words.
It's the worst smell ever.

545
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,434
Hey.

546
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,775
Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry, sir.

547
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,611
You must be the repairman.

548
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,071
What do I do? Jeez.

549
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,414
An evil spirit?

550
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:50,836
Close the door.

551
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,230
She's awesome.

552
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,428
-Help me!
-Move aside.

553
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,389
-Help me!
-Move!

554
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:55,859
Help me.

555
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,446
Just give up. Don't be foolish.

556
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,989
You better not be foolish.

557
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,451
Unless you want to see me eat her alive.

558
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,204
Move.

559
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,330
Move!

560
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,624
Hey!

561
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,836
Move!

562
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,894
Just a minute.

563
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,315
Hey.

564
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,151
Don't tell me

565
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,446
you can smell evil spirits?

566
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,210
Did they leave?

567
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,630
I didn't get to ask for her number.

568
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,476
Jeok-bong discovered his power.

569
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,937
He could be our only hope in locating
the evil spirits who avoid the territory.

570
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,108
You got that special power
after smelling cow dung all your life?

571
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,736
I've never heard of such a power before.

572
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,070
So you gained the power

573
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,990
since your nose got busted, right?

574
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:25,908
Yes.

575
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,243
You're incredible, Jeok-bong.

576
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,704
You found the evil spirit
without the territory.

577
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,707
I didn't do anything special.

578
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,751
How should I put it?

579
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,794
I didn't need to try,

580
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,756
so it's like an innate talent.
Gosh, I'm blushing.

581
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,466
You still have a long way to go.

582
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,177
You can't even pinpoint
the origin of the smell.

583
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:46,887
Jeok-bong.

584
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,598
Can you even tell
the smell apart from cow dung?

585
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:55,354
I think you've yet to understand
this innate gift of mine.

586
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,440
I don't throw up
just because I smell dung.

587
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,527
In that case,
I would've thrown up my entire life.

588
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,613
Hey, that actually makes sense.

589
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,533
You have a blessed nose. You do.

590
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,911
Anyway, I did catch the evil spirit,

591
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,496
thanks to you, so well done.

592
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,081
I always knew

593
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,874
you were our ace in the hole.

594
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,710
Don't you get that vibe from him?

595
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,712
You sure have a good eye.

596
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,092
-This is so fascinating.
-Tell me about it.

597
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,678
Be careful with my nose.

598
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,137
Goodness.

599
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,226
Goodness, how refreshing.

600
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,734
The top bunk is the best
when it comes to bunk beds.

601
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,070
But you know I let you have it, right?

602
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,197
We can switch if you want.

603
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,448
That's okay.

604
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,369
We even played rock, paper, scissors
before deciding.

605
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:56,039
Goodness, this is nice.

606
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,668
Jeok-bong.

607
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,837
Yeah?

608
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm so grateful and relieved

609
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:07,217
to have you by our side.

610
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,973
The battle is just around the corner.

611
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,227
If you use your power to catch them--

612
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,154
Who's the scumbag

613
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,782
that upset you?

614
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,828
You weren't asleep?

615
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,539
How could I with all that noise?

616
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,793
Has it…

617
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,422
already been

618
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,341
ten years as Counters for us?

619
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,927
Already ten years?

620
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,389
Time sure does fly.

621
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,725
How many years

622
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,894
did Jang-mul work before retiring?

623
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,607
Why do you suddenly ask?

624
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,609
Is moonlighting too tough?

625
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,613
That's not why.

626
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,742
I'm worried I'll be a hindrance.

627
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:42,080
It doesn't seem like I'm helping
our team that much.

628
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,625
It feels like selecting Jeok-bong

629
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,587
was my final task.

630
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,465
I think…

631
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,304
it might be time for me to step down.

632
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,365
That hurts. I'm going through a lot here.

633
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,992
Were you talking about me?

634
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,535
About not being helpful to the team?

635
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,871
Of course, you're helpful.

636
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,625
If it wasn't for you,
everyone here would've been long dead.

637
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,837
Who will mend our bones
when we catch evil spirits

638
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:31,922
if you're not here?

639
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,716
That's right. And I've treated you,
so I know best.

640
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,886
You have no idea
how much stronger your bones are.

641
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,931
Jeez. Don't act like a baby.

642
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:43,892
Time goes by

643
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,144
so quickly.

644
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,106
You know…

645
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,192
I used to…

646
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:58,323
never feel exhausted.

647
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,583
Want some noodles?

648
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,003
Noodles?

649
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:16,174
When you're feeling down,
nothing picks you up

650
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,968
like my famous noodles.

651
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,182
Thanks, Ms. Chu.

652
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,855
But I don't know if it'll have
that same taste though.

653
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,064
This isn't my old kitchen.

654
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,483
-By the way, about those noodles…
-Yeah?

655
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:37,821
-Can you make them just for me?
-Sure. I'll cook some only for you, kiddo.

656
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,665
I think you're filled to the brim.

657
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,398
It's okay. They're on our side.

658
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,573
Is that fun?

659
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,328
Let me join you.

660
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,671
He's having a blast.

661
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,309
By the way, what's your plan?

662
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,562
There is no plan.

663
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,401
We're just going with the flow.

664
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,413
I can't believe Jeok-bong.

665
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,456
Look at this.

666
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,666
What's that?

667
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,667
Pore strips.

668
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,085
Hey, you little punk.

669
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,379
-You just bought some but you got--
-They're here?

670
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,630
You can put them over there.

671
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,256
What? You little…

672
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,302
By the way, what's this smell?

673
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,389
Ms. Chu is making soybean paste stew,
your favorite.

674
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,140
Goodness!

675
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,811
It's best not to stimulate
my nose on a daily basis.

676
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,980
Look.

677
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,065
Let me tell you something about the nose.

678
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:40,151
It can easily become dull to smells.

679
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:43,738
If you really want it
to be effective in critical situations--

680
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,532
Enough with the nonsense.

681
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,449
Jeok-bong.

682
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,370
Let's set the table.

683
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,414
Ha-na.

684
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,290
We'll leave you to it.

685
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,054
What is it this time?

686
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,639
-It stinks.
-What?

687
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,142
It reeks!

688
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,271
There's an evil spirit!

689
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,817
-Turn left!
-Hurry! Turn the wheel now!

690
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,694
-Hurry up!
-I am hurrying!

691
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,696
-Go straight!
-Go straight!

692
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,114
Keep going straight.

693
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,615
Go straight then turn right!

694
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,659
-Turn right.
-Go straight then turn right!

695
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,578
To the right.

696
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,955
Jeez, why is he going back and forth?

697
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:35,957
Turn left!

698
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,584
Turn left.

699
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,501
Turn left.

700
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,462
How many lefts do we have to take?

701
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,714
This is the tenth left.

702
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,591
Stay focused!

703
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,800
It's here!

704
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,635
-Turn right!
-Turn right!

705
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,845
Turn right!

706
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,848
-Make a U-turn!
-A U-turn?

707
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,188
Turn right!

708
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,190
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

709
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,191
You little--

710
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,904
You're doing well, Jeok-bong!
Keep it up! Good job!

711
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,197
Go straight.

712
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,657
-Go straight!
-Go straight!

713
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,077
The smell's getting closer!

714
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,704
We're the ones getting closer, you…

715
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,247
You idiot.

716
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,750
Go straight!

717
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,472
This way.

718
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:55,912
You sure it's here?

719
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,164
I think it's the wrong place.

720
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,959
You said you could differentiate smells.

721
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:06,506
Goodness, no wonder
it smelled kind of familiar.

722
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,924
You punk.

723
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,052
I have high blood pressure now,
thanks to you.

724
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,887
Jeok-bong, you…

725
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,890
You've been way too cocky lately.

726
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:20,311
I better not see you
using those pore strips ever again.

727
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,147
I was sure it was an evil spirit.

728
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,274
I'm sorry.

729
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,110
Come on. He just discovered his power.

730
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,237
Don't get too discouraged.

731
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,531
-Let's go home.
-Let's go.

732
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,200
It set foot.

733
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,536
What?

734
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,495
Is it them?

735
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,625
It's a big one, but not one of them.
It's a level three.

736
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,628
It has a knife, so it must be a burglar.

737
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,755
But that's all I can see.

738
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,133
-Where is it?
-In the reeds next to the outer roads.

739
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,802
-Isn't that far from here?
-Let's hurry.

740
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,263
Hold on.

741
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,015
What is it, Ha-na?

742
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,560
It's an art museum.

743
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:03,938
It's in a black hoodie.

744
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,774
It's not one of Mr. Hwang's group either.

745
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,651
So they set foot at the same time?

746
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,070
The art museum one
at Mount Dongin is small. A level one.

747
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,405
Small?

748
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,199
-Let's split up then.
-Sure.

749
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,533
We need to save the victims.

750
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,785
Ms. Chu and I can take care
of the smaller one.

751
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,788
I bet the leaves
at Mount Dongin are beautiful.

752
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,000
You'll be going for
a nice drive on your way there.

753
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,337
Even during war, there's love--

754
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,130
Stop embarrassing yourself and just drive.

755
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,673
We'll join you guys soon.

756
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:31,799
-Stay safe.
-Okay.

757
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,052
Are you coming or what?

758
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,603
What lovely weather.

759
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,271
Don't you agree?

760
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,818
It's a shame I can't take you
anywhere nice on a day like this.

761
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,487
What is it?

762
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,406
Does it excite you to put
the uniform on once again?

763
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,287
There seems to be
more evil spirits nowadays.

764
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,372
They're more vicious too.

765
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,873
Tell me about it.

766
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,252
Those darn evil spirits
are like cockroaches.

767
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,921
No matter how many you catch,
they keep popping up.

768
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:12,674
What's wrong?

769
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,884
Why do you look so tense?

770
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,511
Why worry when I'm here?

771
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,975
Focus on getting there quickly.

772
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,741
THE MUSEUM IS CLOSED FOR THE DAY

773
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:03,600
Is that him?

774
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,602
You little bastard!

775
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,021
Stop right there!

776
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,233
Are you okay?

777
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,287
Hey, you punk.

778
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,832
What's the matter with you?
You're distracting me.

779
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,376
It's nothing.

780
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,672
Jeok-bong.
You have something to say, right?

781
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,299
What?

782
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,384
It's okay. Feel free to say it.

783
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,220
It's only natural
for your new power to be unstable.

784
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,391
To be honest,

785
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:50,396
the smell seems worse toward the west.

786
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,190
West?

787
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,858
That's toward Mount Dongin.

788
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,069
Wasn't that a level one?

789
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:59,489
Yes. The art museum had a level one.
The reeds had a level three.

790
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,992
Na Jeok-bong, stop making us anxious.

791
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,205
That's why I didn't want to say anything.

792
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:10,291
But this smell keeps…

793
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,586
Seriously…

794
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,054
Please let me go.

795
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,764
I did everything you asked.

796
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,015
So please spare--

797
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,276
There are two of you.

798
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,863
Does that mean there are four left?

799
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:42,782
You little…

800
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,870
What if…

801
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,540
Jeok-bong is right?

802
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,167
Maybe it didn't step on our territory.

803
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,462
Mun, don't say such things.
You're making me nervous.

804
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,848
Looks like the weakest ones came here.

805
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,603
You little…

806
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,107
It's only natural

807
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,651
for the weakest ones

808
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,570
to die first.

809
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,920
This won't do. Ms. Chu.

810
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:39,380
Ms. Chu?

811
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:40,965
Ms. Chu!

812
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,509
I can't get in touch.

813
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,553
Na Jeok-bong, get it straight!

814
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,263
-What?
-Which one's the stronger one?

815
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,681
I…

816
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,100
I think it's the one at the art museum.

817
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,352
Wait. Is it the one in the reeds?

818
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,980
I'm sorry. I don't know.

819
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,398
I really don't know.

820
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,067
We have no choice.
Jeok-bong and I will go to the reeds.

821
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,275
Smile.

822
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,155
Damn it.

823
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,534
-Jang-mul.
-My arm isn't what it used to be.

824
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,246
But… once I eat your souls,

825
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,915
it'll get stronger, right?

826
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,168
There we go.

827
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,547
Did you eat some wild ginseng, old man?

828
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,466
Then, you should've had better ones!

829
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,885
Jang-mul!

830
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,103
Ms. Chu!

831
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,606
Run! Get away at all costs!

832
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,419
Jang-mul, are you okay?

833
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,921
We won't die here.

834
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,009
We won't.

835
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,473
You think you can hold out?

836
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,350
You could die from your organs bursting.

837
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,024
Don't fight it, Ms. Chu.

838
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,444
Just strike me down.

839
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,988
You can

840
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:55,034
just fix me up later.

841
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:56,911
No…

842
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,580
No!

843
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,082
Please…

844
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,209
Ms. Chu.

845
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,968
Well, isn't this heart-wrenching?

846
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,803
Mun.

847
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:02,768
So it was you.

848
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,645
Right.

849
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,858
This was eventually going to be our fight.

850
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:11,652
What a shame.

851
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,031
I didn't want to kill you

852
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:16,991
so soon.

853
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,377
Thanks.

854
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,424
I wanted to see you for one last time.

855
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,764
This is the end for you, you asshole.

856
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,905
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

857
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:39,156
The smell!

858
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,908
It's getting closer.

859
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:42,743
I made a promise.

860
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:43,994
I promised

861
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,454
to catch you at all costs.

862
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,626
Among the memories
of that bitch from the reeds,

863
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,294
that woman was there.

864
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,588
Do you know what you've done?

865
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,299
Do you know what kind
of people you've destroyed?

866
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,344
To my warehouse family.

867
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:03,347
I realized how powerless I was.

868
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,268
In all my life, I've never met
a Counter who ran away like you.

869
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,606
Does Jeok-bong attract evil spirits
or something?

870
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,489
