1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,727
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,978
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,065
You'll be stripped of your rights
as a Counter

4
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,318
and also lose your life.

5
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,031
We're aware.

6
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,951
-Now, we'll wrap up the hearing--
-Before we wrap up…

7
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,831
I'd like to say something.

8
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,550
Regardless of the number of warnings,

9
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:37,013
I believe Counter 1543 So Mun…

10
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,767
should be dismissed.

11
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,914
Based on my observations,

12
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,418
I've concluded that he does not qualify
to work as a Counter.

13
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,838
-Wi-gen.
-What?

14
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,214
-He's not qualified?
-Why?

15
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,382
Why would you say that?

16
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,425
-What are you saying?
-Silence!

17
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,013
This isn't a place to argue.

18
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,932
Tell me why I should be dismissed.

19
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,562
He has difficulty
controlling his emotions,

20
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,482
so we had to reevaluate
his qualifications as a Counter.

21
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,861
I took time to reflect on what I did
and I deeply regret it.

22
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,907
You were able to keep your job
as a Counter thanks to Ms. Chu.

23
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,829
But you haven't changed at all.

24
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,665
Mun, you can't do this alone.

25
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,292
The others will be there soon.

26
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,418
Join them.

27
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,131
No. We may never catch Ji Cheong-sin
if we lose him this time.

28
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,137
Say it again.

29
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,098
What did you do to my parents?
You disgusting bastard!

30
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,313
He failed to control his emotions

31
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,482
and endangered his life

32
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,194
as well as Yung.

33
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,531
Mun!

34
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,783
Ha-na.

35
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,827
It's okay, Mun. You'll be okay.

36
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,288
-Wi-gen!
-Wi-gen!

37
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,625
Contact the Counters

38
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,295
and tell them to go find Mun.

39
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,008
Things like this never happened
before he joined us.

40
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,844
Respect for each other's lives

41
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,514
and a sense of partnership
were the basis of our relationship.

42
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,266
All right. Okay, Gi-ran.

43
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,436
We'll be more careful from now on.

44
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,104
I agree

45
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,691
that Mun should be stripped
of his rights as a Counter.

46
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,697
Had he waited for his teammates,

47
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,493
we wouldn't have lost Ji Cheong-sin.

48
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,578
Since we kept losing our targets,

49
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,793
evil spirits had chances
to learn enough about Counters.

50
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,170
This is it.

51
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,965
This is how you suddenly become so strong.

52
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,802
Hazy like smoke.

53
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,388
It feels like a cold fog.

54
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,312
That evil spirit…

55
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,817
now knows how to avoid Yung's territories.

56
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,152
That bastard killed his parents.

57
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,573
I'm older, but I would've had a hard time
staying calm and collected too.

58
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,244
Think of how he must've felt
at that moment.

59
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,538
Can you please try putting yourself
in his shoes?

60
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,375
He's really trying
to put his emotions in check.

61
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,710
You see, Mun is…

62
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,171
He's really trying his best.

63
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,466
His vengeful thoughts are the problem,
Ms. Chu.

64
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,693
I warned you that you'd get it all back,
twofold!

65
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,574
-Hey!
-Hands off! Let go!

66
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,998
Mun has occasionally exhibited
the urge to murder.

67
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,377
No.

68
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,547
I never… That is not true.

69
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,506
Mun.

70
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,925
The emotions that you feel,

71
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,761
I feel it all too.

72
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,597
You admit it, don't you?

73
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,190
I'm holding back my emotions.

74
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,734
You know that I didn't kill anyone!

75
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,819
My contract said nothing
about my emotions.

76
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,237
-Am I wrong?
-Mun.

77
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,075
I'll announce our decision.

78
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,578
The committee has decided

79
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:14,582
to dismiss Counter 1543 So Mun
from his position.

80
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,754
What do we do?

81
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,217
Wi-gen, go ahead and terminate
your contract with So Mun.

82
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,019
Come forward, Mun.

83
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,082
I…

84
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,751
cannot

85
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,087
accept this decision.

86
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,257
You're right.

87
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,594
Wi-gen, I didn't think I'd end up
putting you in danger. I'm sorry.

88
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,179
I'm really sorry,

89
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,516
but can you please give me
one more chance?

90
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,352
My mom and dad…

91
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,273
are locked inside Ji Cheong-sin's body.

92
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,317
My parents…

93
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,903
are locked inside that bastard.

94
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,114
They've been locked in there
for seven years.

95
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,702
I don't know
when their souls will dissipate.

96
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,538
I must save my parents
with my own two hands.

97
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,791
And until the day I save them,

98
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,168
I…

99
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,629
I cannot quit this job.

100
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,804
With the powers bestowed upon you
by the heavens,

101
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,849
if you feel the urge to kill,

102
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,062
you're no different from an evil spirit.

103
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,940
Wi-gen.

104
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,826
-Mun!
-Mun!

105
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,328
-Mun!
-Mun!

106
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,746
Hey, Mun!

107
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,664
-Hey, Mun.
-Mun!

108
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,999
-Mun!
-Mun!

109
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,125
Mun!

110
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,004
What's with him?

111
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,466
Mun…

112
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,634
-Mun.
-What's wrong?

113
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,885
Mun.

114
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,471
Mun. Don't tell me
he's relapsed into a coma.

115
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,223
He won't die, right?

116
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,183
Mun, wake up. Mun!

117
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,267
Mun.

118
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,287
Mun.

119
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,134
My goodness! What's wrong with him?

120
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,386
Hey, what's going on?

121
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,349
He is…

122
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,102
no longer a Counter.

123
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,812
What?

124
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,313
How did that happen?

125
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,357
What did you guys do up there?

126
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,076
Ha-na, erase Mun's memories.

127
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,160
What?

128
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,164
What's wrong? What are they saying now?

129
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,959
Why?

130
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,044
Why must we erase his memories?

131
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,799
It's not like he'll tell people about us!

132
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
Then you'll all get a warning,

133
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,471
which means
Ha-na will automatically be dismissed.

134
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,850
Try to understand
the gravity of the situation.

135
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,442
I'll do it.

136
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,747
I understand that you guys
don't want to erase Mun's memories.

137
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,167
The memories of working together
while risking your lives.

138
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,211
But…

139
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,340
must it be done?

140
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,720
I must track down the person
who killed my parents, you know.

141
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,599
And I have to remember
what my fellow Counters look like.

142
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,726
You must forget everything, Mun.

143
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,856
We have no choice.

144
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,573
Wait, just a second.

145
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,075
Please, wait…

146
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,716
All right.

147
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,719
Goodbye, Mun.

148
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,037
Oh, dear.

149
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,624
I found him passed out
in front of the house.

150
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,584
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

151
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,129
Hold on. The nearest hospital is…

152
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,922
No, he'll be fine.

153
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,341
He just needs some rest.

154
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,218
He'll feel better soon.

155
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,136
My gosh.

156
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,139
Is he ill?

157
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,433
Gosh.

158
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,944
Honey, Mun is walking.

159
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,240
My gosh, Mun.

160
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,788
Gosh, I'm so happy for you.

161
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,631
Both of you are incredibly kind
and warmhearted.

162
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,176
No wonder

163
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,721
Mun's grown into such a purehearted,
wonderful boy.

164
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,300
-He's here.
-Do you think I can do a good job?

165
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,805
Wake up, Ha-na!

166
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,433
For your information,
I'm not good at comforting people.

167
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,519
I've only been comforted.
I haven't done it myself.

168
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,772
Is it good?

169
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,945
We won't lose anyone in this photo.

170
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,571
I promise you that.

171
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,325
Let's try that again.

172
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,923
JI CHEONG-SIN, SO GWON, HA MUN-YEONG

173
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,221
That's enough.

174
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,726
At this rate, I'll lose you…

175
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,061
JI CHEONG-SIN

176
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,145
…and even Ha-na…

177
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,105
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

178
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,314
…before we catch them.

179
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,524
CHO TAE-SIN

180
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,026
Mun can…

181
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,113
still get through his life, but for us…

182
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,908
It'll be the end of us, Mo-tak.

183
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,256
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

184
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,466
These rats are the problem.

185
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,762
On the day that Mr. Mayor
declared his candidacy?

186
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,515
Why show up suddenly

187
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,517
after playing dead all this time?

188
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,770
Was he waiting for the right time
to get revenge?

189
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,981
It doesn't look like he'll give up easily.

190
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,900
Ga Mo-tak is determined

191
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,987
to find Kim Yeong-nim's corpse
in the reservoir no matter what.

192
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,826
Kill him.

193
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,871
Well…

194
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,956
Sir, the thing is…

195
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,251
There's something you should see.

196
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,220
Who are these freaks, really?

197
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,362
You can't come in here.

198
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,574
Hey, who are you?

199
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,459
What's going on outside?

200
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,382
Anyone outside?

201
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,093
You can't let in all sorts of riffraff!

202
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,346
Who are you?

203
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,811
What the hell do you want?

204
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,862
-Ji Cheong-sin?
-How dare you?

205
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,072
Stop.

206
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,701
You may leave.

207
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
We need to talk.

208
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,337
You can't catch those rats
without my help.

209
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,007
Get me off the wanted list,

210
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,009
and I'll take care of it.

211
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,141
You want to strike a deal?

212
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,436
Hand over the ledger first.

213
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,733
Mr. Bae's ledger,

214
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,776
hand that over first.

215
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,758
Rather than getting you off the list,

216
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,219
how about you just get caught?

217
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,765
If you get caught and cause a stir,

218
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,061
my approval rating
will probably bounce back.

219
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,909
Let's do that, okay?

220
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,412
"Cause a stir"? How big of a stir?

221
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,699
Mun! Are you up?

222
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,161
Yes. I'll be right out.

223
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,405
Oh, you're up! You little rascal.

224
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,032
Gosh, Grandma.
Did you have a good night's sleep?

225
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,451
Good morning.

226
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,079
Look what I have!

227
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,747
What? Grandma.

228
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,458
-That's mine.
-No, it's mine.

229
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,420
-Grandma, yours is in the bathroom.
-No, this is mine.

230
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,421
Give it back!

231
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,256
-It's mine!
-Mun.

232
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,757
Come and eat first.

233
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,217
I'll get you a new toothbrush.

234
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,221
-Gosh, Grandma.
-Hey.

235
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,557
An old man was here.

236
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,392
-An old man?
-Yes.

237
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,686
With a mustache like this and…

238
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,105
And with glasses.

239
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,482
-A mustache like this?
-Yes.

240
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,361
He said you're purehearted and wonderful.

241
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,279
What?

242
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,283
So this is mine, okay?

243
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,827
-No, give it back!
-No, it's mine.

244
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,162
-Grandma!
-No, it's mine!

245
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,039
-It's mine.
-Enough! Come and eat.

246
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,415
-Goodness.
-See?

247
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,167
-It's mine.
-Want it?

248
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,668
Snatch it if you can!

249
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,171
JUNGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

250
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,257
SHIN MYEONG-HWI
SHIN ON-AIR INCIDENT, CHO TAE-SIN

251
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,551
This is insane.

252
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,554
Mayor Shin is screwed.

253
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,224
You jerk. You're smirking?

254
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,726
How's Assemblyman Choi doing?

255
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,936
Great, Mayor Shin.

256
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,689
Hey, come here!

257
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,274
Come on, quick!

258
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,651
-What is it?
-Look, over there.

259
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,653
What's going on?

260
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,739
Look.

261
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,370
Why is that moron limping again?

262
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,287
Exactly.

263
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,342
What kind of show is this?

264
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,555
See? I told you.
This asshole's just doing this for show.

265
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,606
-Whoa.
-What's going on?

266
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,941
Hey, you were wrong.

267
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,404
I'm throwing this far away!

268
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,365
Hey, what the hell?

269
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,951
Act up all you want.

270
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,786
Go ahead and act up all you want.

271
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,961
Hey, Ung-min. Isn't this Mun's?

272
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,339
-Mun!
-Mun!

273
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:45,220
Jeez, calm down.

274
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,346
What happened to him?

275
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,682
Seriously? First thing in the morning?

276
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,641
Out of the way.

277
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,643
Move! Out of the way!

278
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,478
Why are you guys all here?

279
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,984
Hey, how did you fall?

280
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,402
Be careful.

281
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,746
He tripped and fell.

282
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,498
You guys are supposed to lie low. Go.

283
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,959
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

284
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,589
I got scared for no reason.

285
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,466
-Let's whack him soon.
-Sounds good.

286
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,179
What are you all doing? Go back inside!

287
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,265
Go back to your classroom. Now!

288
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,768
Go.

289
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,314
Are you all right?

290
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,816
Hey, what happened?

291
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,026
With what?

292
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,820
Your leg! It had healed.

293
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:45,989
Really?

294
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,242
My leg? That's impossible.

295
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,243
This is nuts.

296
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,706
Hey.

297
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,583
He doesn't have a fever.

298
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,419
Hey, you told us your leg had been healed.

299
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,670
And right here, you…

300
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,173
You walked like this right here.

301
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,299
What?

302
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,384
Mun.

303
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,302
My gosh.

304
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:24,861
Su-ho.

305
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,913
Here for Mun?

306
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,374
Yes, that's right.

307
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,793
Is there anything we can do?

308
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,212
Shall I file a complaint?

309
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,548
Can we appeal the decision?

310
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,007
Is there no way to revert it?

311
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,760
Wi-gen has already started meeting
with other candidates.

312
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,471
We'll hire his replacement soon, okay?

313
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,225
Good luck with that. You'll never find
anyone who's as good as him.

314
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,018
You threw away a huge asset.

315
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,895
You guys will regret it big time.

316
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,566
Come on, Ms. Chu.

317
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,902
You guys should take this
as an opportunity to set things right.

318
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,696
That secret Mo-tak spilled,

319
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,614
erase it when the spirit's summoned.

320
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,537
I feel so bad for Mun.
My heart breaks for him.

321
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,002
Su-ho.

322
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,379
You know what it's like.

323
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,798
It's devastating

324
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,093
for parents and their child
to be separated by death

325
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,180
when they aren't even ready.

326
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,476
We know how awful that is.

327
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,529
I miss you so much
even while looking at you like this.

328
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,449
That poor thing must be so sad.

329
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,165
Su-ho.

330
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:04,002
We must help Mun
so that he can meet his parents again.

331
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,671
Do something, please.

332
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:11,301
Gosh, Mom. Why are you crying?

333
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,638
Okay, I'll try to persuade the others.

334
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,805
All right.

335
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,727
And why do you have so much gray hair now?
It makes me sad.

336
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,609
Kang Se-hyeon also said no?

337
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,986
That's right. It's not easy, you know.

338
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,489
Everyone says no
upon finding out it's dangerous.

339
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,367
I have a huge respect for our partners
who said yes.

340
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,911
We should be grateful to our partners.

341
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,162
I already know that.

342
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,625
There's only one candidate left.

343
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:50,090
Su-ho, can you put together
another list of candidates?

344
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,219
Those who are physically fit for the job
were all on the list I gave you.

345
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,015
How about we give Mun his job back?

346
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,811
The level-three evil spirits
make me anxious every day.

347
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,731
Even if we find someone,
training a new partner will take a while.

348
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,191
No, not Mun.

349
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,697
OH HYE-MI

350
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,198
LEE SEON-HO

351
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,242
"Lee Seon-ho."

352
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:21,788
He fell into a coma after saving
a neighbor's kid when a fire broke out.

353
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,542
Kind and righteous.
He's an excellent candidate.

354
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,545
Let's meet him.

355
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,507
Eat up.

356
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,593
Excuse me! Can we get more kimchi?

357
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,678
It's self-serve…

358
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,180
KIMCHI IS SELF-SERVE

359
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,809
Sure, just a moment.

360
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,263
Mr. Lee Seon-ho?

361
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,016
Yes?

362
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,934
You are Mr. Lee Seon-ho,

363
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,479
the 55-year-old male
who lives in Jeonghan-dong?

364
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,814
How can I help you?

365
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,525
We're glad you made it here safely.

366
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,985
What? I came here?

367
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,113
All I did was answer
when you called my name.

368
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:42,535
That answer brought you here, Mr. Lee.

369
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,332
I was just

370
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,542
relaxing on the bench,

371
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,669
looking at the park.

372
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,590
This weather and this air.

373
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,968
I don't know
if I've seen and felt this before,

374
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,347
but I feel as if I've finally come
to the place I missed.

375
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:08,144
I'll be fine even if this day never ends.

376
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,314
Mr. Lee Seon-ho.

377
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,608
We have a favor to ask of you.

378
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,360
If you decide to do it,

379
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,154
we can wake you up right away.

380
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,701
You've been in a coma for a month.

381
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,912
You can't move at all.

382
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,331
Your family is having a really hard time.

383
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,791
If you decide to sign with us,

384
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,544
we can wake you up from your coma.

385
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,130
Coma?

386
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:45,223
Can't I just sit here and enjoy
the sounds of birds and the wind?

387
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,733
If you stay in your current state,
you'll die soon.

388
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,735
While working as a firefighter,

389
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,654
I jumped in headfirst to help others

390
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,741
and made my wife suffer.

391
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,118
Mr. Lee.

392
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,830
I'm exhausted.

393
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,333
Now, I want to be…

394
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,546
reunited with my wife in heaven

395
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,507
and rest in peace with her.

396
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,937
Seon-ho.

397
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:37,984
Seon-ho.

398
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,831
JUNGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

399
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,064
-Why hide?
-Gosh! Hey, you scared me.

400
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,442
You didn't do anything wrong.

401
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,652
When did you get here?

402
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,029
Jeez.

403
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,907
Why hide? You know he won't recognize us.

404
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,451
Oh, you're right.

405
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,411
He seems well.

406
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,163
Let's go.

407
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,209
Okay, let's go.

408
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,343
Come on out.

409
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,974
You'd better show yourself
before I lose it.

410
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,396
This prick…

411
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,150
Didn't you have an affair with my wife?

412
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,905
Now, you want to live
and don't even care about her?

413
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,869
Come out, you little shit!

414
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,792
I'll kill you.

415
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,806
Please… Don't kill me, please.

416
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,058
Please don't kill me.

417
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,437
Hey, please. Please don't…

418
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,563
Die!

419
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,665
There's no way it was done by a human.
It's impossible. Could it be…

420
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,542
That's right. It was an evil spirit.

421
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,004
This one is on Ji Cheong-sin's level.

422
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,505
Higher than level three.

423
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,635
Here's a suspect.

424
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,474
If he's on Ji Cheong-sin's level…

425
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,351
Does he also use psychokinesis?

426
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,852
That's possible.

427
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,063
Or pure physical strength.

428
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,107
We have to catch him soon,
or he'll cause big trouble.

429
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,277
Were they both killed by the same person?

430
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,570
Yes.

431
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,530
Are you sure?

432
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,075
The female victim is the suspect's wife.

433
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,078
She cheated on him with the male victim.

434
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,163
And they died at the same location.

435
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,207
Was the woman killed first?

436
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,418
Why do you ask? What is it?

437
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,295
The time gap between the two murders?

438
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,464
Five minutes?
I'd say, ten minutes at the most?

439
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,092
Based on the blood viscosity, that is.

440
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,223
Doesn't this look like it was done
by a level-one evil spirit?

441
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,058
-I'd say it's pretty ordinary.
-Yes.

442
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,895
Is it possible to level up like this
in just five to ten minutes?

443
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,735
This… wasn't done by the same spirit.

444
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,946
Two were involved.

445
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,747
Hey, Han-ul.

446
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:23,835
What?

447
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,136
Suspected serial killer Ji Cheong-sin
was found dead in a burnt-out vehicle,

448
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,806
which he had stolen while on the run.

449
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,891
When the police arrived at the scene,

450
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,019
the vehicle was completely burnt out,

451
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,563
and a burnt body was found
in the driver's seat.

452
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,274
-The police have stated that
-I'm home!

453
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,109
-the body was severely damaged.
-Hi.

454
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,528
The National Forensic Service

455
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,156
is carrying out an autopsy
to confirm his identity.

456
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,616
We'll have to wait for the results,

457
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,369
but the special task force
is convinced that

458
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,122
it is Ji Cheong-sin
based on the belongings and evidence

459
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,707
found inside the vehicle.

460
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,292
According to authorities…

461
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,293
No.

462
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,423
Grandpa, this can't be happening.

463
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,468
What's wrong, Mun?

464
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,096
Mom…

465
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,725
Footage from nearby surveillance cameras
and dashcams showed no evidence

466
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,520
that anyone else had been near
the burnt-out vehicle…

467
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,024
What? What's going to happen now?

468
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,026
Mun's parents.

469
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,987
This means their souls have dissipated.

470
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,240
No, that can't be.

471
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,285
These bastards are putting on a show.

472
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,913
Police are trying to determine
if additional crimes were committed.

473
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,372
That's not Ji Cheong-sin.

474
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,542
There's no way it's him.

475
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,796
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

476
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,348
What is it?

477
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,434
I think he's coming out.

478
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,936
What's he doing?

479
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,646
Here he comes.

480
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,980
Is it really Ji Cheong-sin?

481
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,482
-Are the results out?
-It's him?

482
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,566
Is the autopsy done?

483
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,693
-Do you have the results?
-Is it finished?

484
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,529
-Can you make a comment?
-No, not yet.

485
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,114
-Is it not finished yet?
-What is

486
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,741
-When will the autopsy be done?
-the cause of death?

487
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,368
-This is nuts.
-A comment, please.

488
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,161
I need to check something.

489
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,371
You can't go in.

490
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,289
-Please let me in.
-No, you can't go in.

491
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,083
-I'm the victim's family.
-Sorry.

492
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,126
I'll be quick.

493
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,211
-Please let me in just once.
-No, we can't.

494
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,258
Mo-tak.

495
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,641
Hey.

496
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,978
Do you remember everything?

497
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,939
Mo-tak.

498
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,358
Did you see Ji Cheong-sin's corpse?

499
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,443
Are you sure it's him?

500
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,337
We're ready for the briefing.

501
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,011
We've managed to cover up
the incident at the ceremony.

502
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,597
You now have nothing to worry about, sir.

503
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,390
You can just focus on your work.

SERIAL KILLER FOUND DEAD

IT'S SUICIDE

508
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,943
HE SET HIMSELF ON FIRE?

509
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,488
Thanks to Jungjin Police's
focused and extensive investigation,

510
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,492
we no longer have to fear
this evil serial killer.

511
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,077
Put your worries to rest.

512
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,748
I, Shin Myeong-hwi, can guarantee you
that everyone in Jungjin is safe now.

The police poured

514
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,253
Call the police chief and tell him

515
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,214
-this case.
-that I'll be interviewed.

516
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,300
-I'd like to sincerely thank them again.
-Yes, sir.

TAESIN GROUP

519
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,937
Ji Cheong-sin didn't leave
any DNA evidence at the murder scenes,

520
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,772
so we can't make a comparison.

521
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,401
Height, 181 cm. Shoe size, 275 mm.

522
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,070
No, I told you this isn't him.

523
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,822
He felt cornered by the cops,
so he killed himself?

524
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,450
-No way.
-I also find it hard to believe,

525
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,870
but the prints we lifted
from the belongings and glass shards

526
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,248
matched Ji Cheong-sin's fingerprints.

527
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,457
We found

528
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,085
the broken glass piece he used to hurt Mun

529
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,128
as well as DNA of the deceased officer.

530
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,422
No, I don't believe this.

531
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,633
How did this happen?

532
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,344
We have no evidence
to prove that he's not Ji Cheong-sin.

533
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,723
Jeong-yeong, can we check
for bone fractures?

534
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,434
His bones?

535
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,061
That day,

536
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,440
I broke his wrist and rib.

537
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,610
In the autopsy report…

538
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,612
Nothing about fractures.

539
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,948
Let's check the X-rays.

540
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,327
Jeez, those evil bastards.

541
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,747
They used someone else's corpse.

542
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,917
But this means
Ji Cheong-sin is still alive.

543
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,920
So I still have a chance
to find my parents, right?

544
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,967
But we're not sure if they did this

545
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,304
or if Ji Cheong-sin staged this
on his own.

546
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,305
It's obvious.

547
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,181
Those bastards staged this.

548
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,267
Mayor Shin has become a hero.

549
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,394
For taking down the serial killer.

550
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,063
And no one's talking
about the illegal dumping anymore.

551
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,606
Jeong-yeong.

552
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,651
You're investigating
the illegal dumping case, right?

553
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,279
We dug up the case
my dad was working on seven years ago.

554
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,364
It won't get buried again, right?

555
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,492
We're interviewing Noh Hang-gyu
as a witness

556
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,870
-at the moment, but…
-Just for formality's sake?

557
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,505
Hey, buddy.

558
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,673
Mun.

559
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:05,843
Mun.

560
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,891
Let's go have some noodles.

561
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,519
Ms. Chu misses you a lot.

562
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,438
When you…

563
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,275
and Ms. Chu came to my school,

564
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,860
I saw you guys.

565
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,664
You saw us?

566
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,337
What happened? How do you
still remember everything?

567
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,716
Chairman Choi left all the memories intact

568
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,220
so I could at least run away
if I were to run into Ji Cheong-sin.

569
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,306
Ji Cheong-sin…

570
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,642
We'll catch him.

571
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,020
-At all costs.
-Mo-tak.

572
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,482
Nothing has changed.

573
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,694
Those bastards aren't even hurt
after everything we did.

574
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,073
Ji Cheong-sin, who killed my parents,
is free now.

575
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,118
Cho Tae-sin owns one of
the top 50 companies, and the mayor…

576
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,329
he's running for president.

577
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:17,873
I feel like…

578
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,169
all of this is a big fat lie.

579
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,880
Why do you think nothing has changed?

580
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:26,966
You've changed.

581
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,759
And…

582
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,719
so have I.

583
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,391
Mo-tak.

584
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,810
Please don't tell Ha-na

585
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,770
that I remember everything.

586
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,313
If she gets another warning,

587
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,857
she'll be dismissed.

588
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,407
I'll also keep it from Ms. Chu.

589
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,951
Come by the restaurant.

590
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,663
I'll play dumb and give you extra food.

591
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,833
Bring your friends, okay?

592
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:12,845
As a cop,

593
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,806
you must be so embarrassed right now.

594
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,808
Right?

595
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,646
Let's go get the warrant.

596
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,231
Warrant?

597
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:29,153
We should at least put Noh Hang-gyu
behind bars.

598
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,206
"Ji Cheong-sin,"
"burnt corpse," "serial killer."

599
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,708
Keep pumping out articles
to make sure those keywords

600
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,001
keep trending.

601
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,087
As for the dumping site,
turn it into a real estate issue.

602
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,591
If ICT's phase-3 development
faces a problem, trillions of won

603
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,178
will be lost and companies will go bust.
The housing prices will also crash.

604
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,639
Interview angry homeowners
and run it as a headline.

605
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:00,935
And get some real estate experts
on the show and have them hype it up.

606
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,022
Jeez.

607
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,080
Hey, Chang-gyu.

608
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,706
Councilman Ham In-pyo.

609
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,668
How's it going?

610
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,298
All done.

611
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,425
We got something naughty for you.

612
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,095
Good, okay.

613
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,976
Sorry for the trouble. You can leave now.

614
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,187
Thank you, Chief.

615
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,904
Did the interview go well?

616
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,867
The thing is though…

617
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,539
I'm sorry, but we need you to stay here
for a bit longer.

618
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,541
What the heck is this about?

619
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,625
Hey, Jeong-yeong!

620
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,839
Mr. Noh Hang-gyu, you're under arrest
for abetting attempted murder.

621
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:12,756
ARREST WARRANT

622
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,550
Murder?

623
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,888
"Get Ga Mo-tak
and lock him in your warehouse.

624
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,728
I must see him breathe his last breath
with my own two eyes."

625
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,689
There, you wanted me dead.

626
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,818
You whacked me and buried me.

627
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,029
I warned you that you'd no longer

628
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,865
have it so easy.

629
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,951
This jerk is a councilman.

630
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,745
Maybe I should run for a seat too.

631
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,330
You, on the city council? Please.

632
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,831
Hang-gyu should do it.

633
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,625
He should run for a seat

634
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,959
in the National Assembly.

635
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,419
The city council's too small.

636
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,883
-Number one, Noh Chang-gyu.
-Number two, Lim Jae-cheol.

637
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,053
What the hell?

638
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,180
Noh Chang-gyu, Lim Jae-cheol.

639
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,935
You're under arrest for the attempted
murder of Ga Mo-tak and three others.

640
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,937
Cuff them.

641
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,274
-Hey, hold on.
-Look.

642
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,068
-Hey, that hurts!
-Wait, hold on.

643
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,736
-I don't know anything.
-Hold on.

644
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,862
-Hey.
-Wait.

645
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,907
Hey, are they gone?

646
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,326
Just said goodbye to all of them.

647
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,873
Do you have evidence?

648
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,834
We've also arrested Noh Chang-gyu
and Lim Jae-cheol.

649
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,670
They're on their way here now.

650
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,589
Will you make your brother take the fall?

651
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,341
Also,

652
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,135
we found this tracker

653
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,096
under the damaged vehicle.

654
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,225
And we verified it through the app
on Noh Chang-gyu's phone.

655
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,651
Here, Noh Chang-gyu's phone.

656
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,615
This will tell us…

657
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:07,371
what kind of things
you and your brother talked about.

658
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,500
You guys had been

659
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,878
way too confident.

660
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,654
The vehicle was completely burnt out,

661
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,782
and a burnt body was found
in the driver's seat.

662
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,284
The body was…

663
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,501
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
LEE JAE-HOON

664
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,173
PASSPORT
LEE JAE-HOON

665
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,017
As Ji Cheong-sin was suspected
of going on the run

666
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,102
after committing three serial murders,

667
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,272
police are trying to determine
if additional crimes were committed…

668
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,786
Goodness.

669
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,455
You're spilling it everywhere.

670
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,957
Do a better job if you want to get paid,
you moron.

671
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,793
-Okay.
-Jeez.

672
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,683
-Is it him?
-No.

673
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,060
It's that skinny one.

674
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,856
Our friend inside him hasn't woken up yet.

675
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,402
Who are you?

676
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,240
Hey, who are you?

677
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,036
Are you a cop?

678
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,496
No.

679
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,081
I'm your savior.

680
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,458
"Savior"?

681
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,835
What a nutjob.

682
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,836
Just be on your way.

683
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,797
Mind your own business.

684
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,257
And you, come with us.

685
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,177
-How dare you barge in here?
-I said, mind your own business.

686
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,195
You see it now?

687
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:49,032
What… What is this?

688
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,285
What we live on.

689
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,287
What we live on?

690
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,465
So, what do you say?

691
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,511
Will you come with me or just die here?

692
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,272
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

693
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,816
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

694
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,736
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

695
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,195
-Shin Myeong-hwi
-Thank you.

696
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,531
-for president!
-Thank you! Yes, thank you.

697
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,699
My gosh.

698
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,534
-Our president!
-Thank you.

699
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,328
Shin Myeong-hwi!

700
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:38,624
SHIN MYEONG-HWI RECEIVES
HIGHEST FAVORABILITY RATING

701
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,720
I'm sorry.

702
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,597
He's in a meeting now.

703
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,515
Tell him again

704
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,143
to call me when the meeting is over.

705
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,772
I may not be able to pick up,

706
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,690
so he can call Chief Choi.

707
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,234
Okay, I'll let him know.

708
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:17,954
Hey.

709
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,459
Send him some food.

710
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,377
Yes, sir.

711
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,551
What about the Ji Cheong-sin case?

712
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,014
Since the prime suspect is dead,
the case will automatically be closed.

713
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,810
So the murder case itself will be closed?

714
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,233
Chairman Jeon too?

715
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,527
Yes, sir.

716
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,780
Nice and easy.

717
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,201
I have to say, I think Mayor Shin…

718
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,496
is a genius.

719
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,591
MAYOR SHIN, WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU

720
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,719
WE SUPPORT SHIN MYEONG-HWI
NO MATTER WHAT

721
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:18,932
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

722
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,393
PLEASE PROTECT JUNGJIN

723
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,276
I was never interested…

724
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,113
in running for president.

725
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,240
Making Jungjin

726
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,119
the happiest city on earth

727
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,329
was my only wish and goal.

728
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,497
However,

729
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,294
dealing with all the nasty,
awful attempts to slander me…

730
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,338
has made me realize that…

731
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,134
their target isn't me.
They're trying to attack…

732
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,511
the innocent civilians who want peace.

733
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,139
For the citizens of our democratic nation,

734
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,932
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

735
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,311
I, Shin Myeong-hwi, have decided…

736
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,979
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

737
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,397
to run for president.

738
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,525
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

739
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,319
Shin Myeong-hwi!

740
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,739
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

741
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,783
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

742
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:25,040
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

743
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:28,335
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

744
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,296
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

745
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,424
Jeez, you were all excited
about your dad getting screwed over.

746
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,385
Hey, this isn't about
my dad becoming president.

747
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:41,348
I may become the next president's son.
That's what I care about.

748
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,767
So we're friends
with the next president's son?

749
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,144
Hey, the proper term is "yeongsik."

750
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,062
Yeong-sik?

751
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,605
In class four?

752
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,315
Oh, that guy? What?

753
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:54,528
No, it's the formal term
for a presidential son. You idiots.

754
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,530
-Oh!
-I see.

755
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,324
Hey, Yeongsik.

756
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,576
He's so childish.

757
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,912
He wants to brag about it like crazy.

758
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,373
Everyone's trying to get on his good side
these days.

759
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,624
I can't stand it.

760
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,044
If my dad wins the election,

761
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,797
I should tell him to pay more attention
to people with disabilities.

762
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,260
You know the thing they ride.
The electric-powered one.

763
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,304
-This one, right?
-We should have that at school.

764
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,889
Hey, Shin Hyeok-u--

765
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,517
What, bitch?

766
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,230
Don't swear at my friend.

767
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,818
Just get lost.

768
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:45,287
DONGHOE AUTO SERVICE

769
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:46,955
Come on.

770
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,457
Oh, hi!

771
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,758
Go easy on him.

772
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,598
With my upgraded social status,

773
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,559
I must set an example
when many are watching.

774
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,316
My school life has gone to shit
because of you, asshole.

775
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,568
Hey, keep acting up.

776
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,778
Keep messing with me, you little shit!

777
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,071
Damn you!

778
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,784
-Damn it!
-Hey, Hyeok-u. Enough, stop it.

779
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,036
-Stop.
-Goddamn it!

780
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,539
-Hey, enough.
-Fine, okay. I heard you.

781
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,138
Do you feel better
after letting your anger out like that?

782
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,598
What did you say?

783
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,892
You're still talking shit?

784
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,728
Your inability to control your emotions

785
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,730
will put you

786
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,816
and the people around you in danger.

787
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,945
Shut up, gimp.

788
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,327
This feels very familiar, doesn't it?

789
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,834
You're not the only one
who has to stay out of trouble.

790
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,087
You see,

791
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,923
I can kill you all right here,

792
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,263
but then I'd be no different
from you jerks.

793
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:46,866
Shin Hyeok-u.

794
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,662
We're still young, you know.

795
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,498
You still have a chance.

796
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,421
And the same goes for me.

797
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,763
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

798
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,474
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

799
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,227
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

800
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,896
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Let's pull over for a moment.

801
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,106
Shin Myeong-hwi!

802
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,859
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

803
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,570
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

804
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,197
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

805
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,534
-My gosh!
-Mr. Mayor, we're rooting for you!

806
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,953
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Thank you very much.

807
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,830
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor! Over here!

808
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,540
-My gosh.
-Congratulations, sir.

809
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,666
Thank you.

810
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,169
You have our support!

811
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,754
You can't become president.

812
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,964
-Who are you?
-Oh, it's okay.

813
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,134
JUNGJIN'S NEW HOPE

814
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:58,730
I should work even harder
to earn your support.

815
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,358
I'll take you down at all costs.

816
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,985
-Hey!
-What's your problem?

817
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,029
-What are you doing?
-Get lost, you punk!

818
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:09,407
-What's your problem?
-Everyone, please. It's okay.

819
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,409
Sir, we should get going.

820
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,292
-Mr. Mayor!
-We're rooting for you!

821
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,668
-Mr. Mayor!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

822
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,088
-You've got us!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

823
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,590
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

824
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,092
-Stay strong!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

825
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,134
Our president!

826
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,719
-Our president!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

827
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,025
WE'LL START THE JOB TODAY

828
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,324
EONNI'S NOODLES

829
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,868
I rarely spot evil spirits these days.

830
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,579
Don't you think it's odd?

831
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,832
Maybe your radar is broken.

832
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,376
No, it is really strange.

833
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,969
The vacation villa murder
Detective Kim told us about.

834
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:14,180
One was level one,
and the other one was level three.

835
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,432
Two evil spirits did it together.

836
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,976
Can they recognize each other?

837
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,481
Let's call the old man tomorrow
and ask him.

838
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,567
Okay.

839
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,907
Mun loves bulgogi.

840
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,910
But Mun's not here.

841
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,372
My goodness.
Talk about unrequited love, Ms. Chu.

842
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,999
Oh, boy.

843
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,878
Hey! I told you not to go that way.

844
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,673
What is it? Did you spot one?

845
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,508
Just the voice.

846
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,760
-Sounds like he's nearby.
-Where?

847
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,472
What is there?

848
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,099
I don't see anything.

849
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,810
There are two.

850
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,854
What level?

851
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,773
You don't see anything?

852
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,233
Here, look.

853
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,361
Hazy like smoke. It feels like fog.

854
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,739
"Hazy like smoke"?

855
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,033
Hazy like smoke.

856
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,702
It feels like a cold fog.

857
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,333
It's what Ji Cheong-sin said.

858
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,004
He must be gathering evil spirits.

859
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,172
What?

860
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,972
It's that bitch.

861
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,936
What did you just say?

862
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,064
I didn't say anything.

863
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,691
The woman who's tied up inside.

864
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,579
That bastard…

865
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,748
Is he here to get me out?

866
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,093
EMERGENCY CONVOY

867
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,627
No!

868
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,591
Are you all right?

869
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,055
Are you So Mun?

870
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,098
Sorry?

871
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,164
Don't come here, Mo-tak.

872
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,832
-Mun!
-Just wait a little longer!

873
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,877
Ms. Chu!

874
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,755
They're all dying because of me!

875
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,881
Don't do it!

876
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,176
It's the return of the prodigal son.

877
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,511
I'm getting scared now.

878
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,180
I think I might really become president.

879
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,600
My memories are back.

880
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,727
-Su-ho's soul could dissipate.
-What?

881
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,187
Shock!

882
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,147
Ms. Chu…

883
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,774
Ms. Chu!

884
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,151
