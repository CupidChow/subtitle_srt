1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,890
No…

3
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,392
No!

4
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,102
Please…

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,021
Ms. Chu.

6
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,438
Mun.

7
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,945
So it was you.

8
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,655
Right.

9
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,408
This was eventually going to be our fight.

10
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,411
What a shame.

11
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,957
I didn't want to kill you

12
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,000
so soon.

13
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,387
Thanks.

14
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,433
I wanted to see you for one last time.

15
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,773
This is the end for you, you asshole.

16
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,304
Jang-mul. Jang-mul.

17
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,809
My goodness.

18
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,103
It's exactly what I expected.

19
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,188
How exhilarating.

20
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,332
Hurry and go. Leave him to me.

21
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,249
Okay.

22
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,835
-Jang-mul.
-Mun…

23
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,836
Here.

24
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,722
Over there.

25
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,849
Be careful not to trip.

26
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,601
Goodness, she's flying around.

27
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,811
Gosh. Wait for me!

28
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,494
The evil spirit is dead?

29
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,248
What? Hold on.

30
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,791
The smell.

31
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,502
The smell!

32
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,128
-What?
-It's…

33
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,463
It's getting closer.

34
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,633
Which direction?

35
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,593
Over there.

36
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,178
No, wait!

37
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,555
Jeok-bong, calm down.

38
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,476
Hold on! It's getting closer!

39
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,186
Hold on!

40
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,107
I think it's coming from over there!

41
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,527
It's getting closer!

42
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,989
Where is it?

43
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,701
Ha-na, are you okay?

44
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,369
-Where is it?
-What?

45
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,537
Where's the evil spirit?

46
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,295
-Do you sense it?
-The smell keeps moving.

47
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,674
This way!

48
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,677
And now?

49
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,305
Where is it now?

50
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,182
At two o'clock!

51
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,158
What a happy couple.

52
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,452
Where are you going?

53
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,578
I'm right here.

54
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,091
Will you be okay by yourself?

55
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,302
Of course. I'm not a kid.

56
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,388
Go break his bones!

57
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,266
I won't be long.

58
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,911
That's it.

59
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,996
This is what I'm talking about!

60
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,081
Okay?

61
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,292
Aren't you glad we met too?

62
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,794
Aren't you?

63
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,714
You've finally met
a worthy opponent. Right?

64
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,303
I've never been glad
to meet evil spirits like you.

65
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,262
No?

66
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,512
You think killing people is a game?

67
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,223
Do you know what you've done?

68
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,017
Do you know what kind
of people you've destroyed?

69
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,542
Ha-na?

70
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,502
Ha-na.

71
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,753
Ha-na!

72
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,839
Ha-na!

73
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,845
Ha-na!

74
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,513
-Ha-na!
-No!

75
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,809
I'm sorry about that.

76
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,980
Jeok-bong.

77
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,857
Are you okay?

78
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,400
Yes.

79
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm all right.

80
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,113
Where's the evil spirit?

81
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,198
She's…

82
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,245
The smell…

83
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,247
Where did it go?

84
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,541
Can't you stay focused?

85
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,217
What? I can't smell her.

86
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,968
Damn it.

87
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,265
Oh, my gosh!

88
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,059
Ha-na! Oh, no!

89
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,560
You're bleeding!

90
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,646
What do I do?

91
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,855
Ha-na!

92
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,363
I let my guard down, so I let you hit me.

93
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,075
I'm not some pushover, old lady!

94
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,537
Mo-tak.

95
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,290
You can't leave me out
when you're catching this scumbag.

96
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,338
Ms. Chu.

97
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,591
How about we team up for old times' sake?

98
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,802
Sounds good.

99
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,722
I feel bad for him already.

100
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,682
Right?

101
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,016
Come here.

102
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,643
Come here!

103
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,485
Stay back!

104
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,420
Duck!

105
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:51,924
Duck!

106
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
Move!

107
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,024
This is exactly why
you shouldn't have provoked me.

108
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,276
Are you finally regretting it now?

109
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,741
Do you think you and I are any different?

110
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,203
No. You're wrong.

111
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,706
You test how strong you are

112
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,917
and crush your opponents.

113
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,420
And you enjoy it.

114
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,512
This is a shame.

115
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,434
I'll be so bored without you.

116
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,023
But once I consume you,

117
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,319
imagine just how strong I'll become.

118
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,916
Hey, I do have another secret.

119
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm going to be a father soon.

120
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,173
Ms. Lee was pregnant,
but they didn't even hesitate to kill her.

121
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,384
Plus, they enjoyed it.

122
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,802
I won't forgive them.

123
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,262
I'll never forgive the bastards
who did this to her.

124
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,181
We have to find them at all costs.

125
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,849
We need to find

126
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,519
and catch that bastard.

127
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,237
I made a promise.

128
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,572
I promised

129
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,449
to catch you at all costs.

130
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,440
Mun.

131
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,863
You'll never become stronger than me.

132
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,365
Because this is our territory.

133
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,242
And I'm definitely…

134
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,704
stronger than you.

135
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,296
This is the end for you, you evil spirit!

136
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,188
Don't you think

137
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,233
you have too many for this to be the end?

138
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,443
What?

139
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,112
All the people you need to protect.

140
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,213
No!

141
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,428
Mun!

142
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,476
-Mun!
-Chairman Choi.

143
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,728
-I'm okay.
-Mun!

144
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,660
Ha-na's getting hurt,

145
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,537
but I can't smell anything.

146
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,205
What do I do?

147
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,602
If you use your eyes, you'll be too slow.

148
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,817
You need to feel it.

149
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,070
I need to feel it.

150
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,866
I need to feel her movements.

151
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,911
I need to feel it.

152
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,442
You caught me?

153
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,736
Then, let me look deep inside you.

154
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,883
God damn it!

155
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,768
Damn it!

156
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,982
Ha-na.

157
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,943
You've been through so much, Ms. So.

158
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,242
We promised to meet
before this year ended.

159
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,953
But I didn't expect it to be here.

160
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,335
Thank you, Ms. Chu.

161
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,921
Don't thank me.

162
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,633
But it's such a relief we were able to

163
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,927
at least meet this way.

164
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,139
What about Papa and the others?

165
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,351
Don't worry.

166
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,478
We'll save them at all costs.

167
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,439
We'll make sure all of you

168
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,358
will be reunited again.

169
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,069
I give you my word.

170
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,575
I know it's shameless of me to say this,
but please let that happen.

171
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,467
Good work, everyone.

172
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,345
Thanks to you all,

173
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:03,475
Ms. So and all of the other trapped souls

174
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,311
were able to arrive in Yung
safe and sound.

175
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,439
What if…

176
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,027
What if we were the first ones who met

177
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,280
those evil spirits?

178
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,950
If we were defenseless as well,

179
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,454
we would've met the same fate.

180
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,182
Mun, are you crazy?

181
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,434
You can't take a bullet for me!

182
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,977
Are you out of your mind?

183
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,188
But sir…

184
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,440
Then, are you saying
I should've just done nothing?

185
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,441
Of course!

186
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,027
If anyone should die, it should be me.

187
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,821
If you die, what do you expect us to do?

188
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,408
But that makes no sense.

189
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,037
How could I just stand by
and let you get shot?

190
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,205
That's just absurd.

191
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,332
Hey! You little punk.

192
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,542
I can't believe how clueless he is.

193
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,169
You really don't get it?

194
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,380
If you're gone, we're all as good as dead.

195
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,632
Okay?

196
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,175
Don't you know who you are?

197
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,968
You're our pillar.

198
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,012
It's okay if I die.

199
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,849
But you must live on
even if the rest of us don't.

200
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,644
It's your job to catch
those evil spirits at all costs.

201
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,896
Did you really not know that?

202
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,482
Jang-mul.

203
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,984
I'm sure he knows.

204
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,404
I understand that you want to protect us.

205
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,323
However,

206
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,116
the moment you die,

207
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,494
we all die.

208
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,332
Okay? So, don't you ever do that again.

209
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,209
Understand?

210
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,588
No.

211
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,090
This brat still won't listen!

212
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,968
If the same thing happens again,
I'd still protect you.

213
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,804
I'll catch the evil spirits
and protect everyone as well.

214
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,598
I'll never die.

215
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,935
So we'll all survive until the end.

216
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,355
Chairman Choi,
you think I'll lose, don't you?

217
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,315
-You don't trust me, do you?
-No--

218
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,525
You don't trust me, right?

219
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,819
-That's not what I meant.
-Yes, it was.

220
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,779
I do trust you but--

221
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,198
I think you're the one being scolded now.

222
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,491
Exactly.

223
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,368
And you deserve it.

224
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,162
You should just thank him
instead of getting upset.

225
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,623
-She's right.
-You see…

226
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,001
You're right.

227
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,961
Well, that didn't work.

228
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,092
Ta-da!

229
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,677
What?

230
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,763
What's with this atmosphere?

231
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,931
Yes, keep it up.

232
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,230
We may have lost some evil spirits,
but we caught some too.

233
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,940
Why this song?

234
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,983
Why not?

235
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,403
-Should I loosen up for old times' sake?
-Why?

236
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,654
Oh, my gosh!

237
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,072
Look at you, Ms. Chu.

238
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,198
Wait here.

239
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,075
Where are you going?

240
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,995
Tango is my area of expertise.

241
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,914
-Chairman Choi.
-All right, let's do this.

242
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,209
Ms. Chu!

243
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,506
What are you wearing?

244
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:34,978
Ms. Chu!

245
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,148
Ms. Chu.

246
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,151
May I have this dance with you?

247
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,095
She's feeling it.

248
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,188
That was incredible.

249
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,282
Where's the evil spirit?

250
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,575
She's…

251
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,662
Can't you stay focused?

252
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,668
What? I can't smell her.

253
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,379
Oh, my gosh!

254
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,631
Ha-na! Oh, no!

255
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,175
You're bleeding!

256
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,643
That bitch…

257
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,438
I'm going to rip her to shreds.

258
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,899
With my own hands,

259
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,025
I swear

260
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,070
I'll tear her apart.

261
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,372
What will you do now?

262
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,213
Wong could've been right.

263
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,840
It's possible…

264
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:57,055
that bastard could be
much stronger than I am.

265
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,062
So? Are you saying we should run away
without getting revenge?

266
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,163
Let go of me.

267
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,164
I said let go.

268
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,583
Let go of me!

269
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,087
Damn it.

270
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,430
Let go of me. Now!

271
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,853
That's why I must…

272
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,317
take his powers.

273
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,652
Let go of me, okay?

274
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,113
I said let go!

275
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,368
A move that will put him down forever.

276
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,835
What could…

277
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,714
that move be?

278
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,224
For God's sake, let me sleep!

279
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,226
He's at it every goddamn night.

280
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,686
Shut up, you bastard!

281
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,638
Yes, I recognize this energy.

282
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,849
I found the right one.

283
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,477
You're one of a kind.

284
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,690
You're completely different
from the others.

285
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,820
You… What in the world are you?

286
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,240
Let's see.

287
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,743
If I must explain,

288
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,747
you could say I'm a friend

289
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,419
who can relate to your sadness
and rage the best.

290
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,339
No.

291
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,966
You're wrong.

292
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,217
Go away!

293
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,597
Why are you pushing me away now?

294
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,017
You were the one who summoned me.

295
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,019
When did I ever

296
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,480
summon you?

297
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,733
Have you forgotten them already?

298
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,653
The ones who turned you into this.

299
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,823
The ones who destroyed your life.

300
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:49,704
The ones who killed your wife and child.

301
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,835
That's it.

302
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,463
That gaze.

303
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,632
That rage.

304
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,761
That's what summoned me.

305
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:10,308
So don't resist

306
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:15,647
and just accept me, Ma Ju-seok.

307
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,441
Stop! No!

308
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,330
Am I…

309
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,834
Am I really going insane?

310
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,563
To my noodle shop family-- Wait.

311
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,148
To my warehouse family.

312
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,200
I, Na Jeok-bong,

313
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,161
moved to the city a month ago
for the sake of fame and prestige.

314
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:17,166
Through our shared joys and sorrows,
you've shown me unforgettable kindness.

315
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,211
But after a narrow escape
from those brutal evil spirits last night,

316
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:25,341
I realized how powerless I was
as a judge of right and wrong.

317
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,885
Therefore…

318
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,095
"Powerless as a judge of right and wrong"?

319
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,972
He thinks he's not fit for the job.

320
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,599
I knew that.

321
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,310
Is he saying he's scared
to fight the evil spirits?

322
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,103
He's just terrified.

323
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,897
Gosh, what a shame.

324
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,234
I can't believe how formal he is
even in this situation.

325
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,987
I understand his fear.

326
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,739
I was also like him at first.

327
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,535
If we want to catch the evil spirits
who can see the territory,

328
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,872
we must bring Jeok-bong back
at all costs. Understand?

329
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,999
We'll drag him back if he refuses.

330
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,752
What? He left a postscript.

331
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,882
"Please return the pore strips for me."

332
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,552
That little punk.
Even his beloved pore strips.

333
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,180
He must be that determined to quit.

334
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,975
As someone who's gone through
something similar before,

335
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,938
we'll need a good cop, bad cop strategy.

336
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,231
A good guy and a bad guy.

337
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,108
Just as you'd expect from a cop's son.

338
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,027
Yeah, that's the best way to persuade.

339
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,488
Ms. Chu and I will give the carrot

340
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,406
and you two can give him the stick.

341
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,950
Why are we the stick?

342
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:32,992
Why are you the carrot?

343
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,120
What did I just say?

344
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,246
Well done.

345
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,292
Goodness.

346
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,672
What kind of company lets you go
on leave after only a month?

347
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,758
You sure it's a good company
and not a lousy one?

348
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,510
It's not like that.

349
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,053
Darn it.

350
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,640
I should just sell all the cows.

351
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,394
Hold on. What do you mean?

352
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,188
You want to sell the cows?

353
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,903
Everyone, don't mind
what he just said. Okay?

354
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,780
They're our family.

355
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,033
I have to pay off the loan,
so what can I do?

356
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,744
You came back from the brink of death,

357
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,415
so you should be grateful
and work hard at your company.

358
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,919
Imagine how big of a nuisance
you are to them by not being there.

359
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,839
I'm only doing this so I wouldn't be one!

360
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,258
You have no idea.

361
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,301
What's gotten into you?

362
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,138
Jeok-bong.

363
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,598
Did something happen?

364
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:39,892
You little brat.

365
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,278
Jeok-bong!

366
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,489
Hey.

367
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,494
Smile. Just smile.

368
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,879
Goodness, you must've been so terrified.

369
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,173
Seeing them in dreams is scary enough.

370
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,009
But you came face to face
and fought with one,

371
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,844
so I completely empathize with you.

372
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,722
In all my life, I've never met

373
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,557
a Counter who ran away like you.

374
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,601
If the Yung people find out about this,

375
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,644
you'll no longer be a Counter.

376
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,771
-Understand?
-Enough.

377
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,316
You'll be back in a coma! Get it?

378
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,778
You'll be comatose again, you idiot.

379
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,529
Jeok-bong.

380
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,949
I'm sure the smell was wretched.

381
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,410
I had a tough time
just being near the cow shed.

382
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,747
You could only bear it,
thanks to your sense of responsibility.

383
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,041
That's just his power.

384
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,334
Hey, Jeok-bong.

385
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,628
Don't you know
how crucial your power is for us?

386
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,962
Are you a little kid?

387
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,756
Take your job seriously.

388
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,050
I can't smell them.

389
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,511
What?

390
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,137
Smell what?

391
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,891
I can no longer smell the evil spirits.

392
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,185
What do you mean?

393
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,687
Why all of a sudden?

394
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,523
Beats me.

395
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,900
My power appeared out of the blue.

396
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,903
And after the evil spirit
smacked my nose that day,

397
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,738
their smell just disappeared.

398
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,156
What?

399
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,492
Look, kid.

400
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,078
This is probably just temporary.

401
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,704
-Exactly.
-He's right.

402
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,582
You might not be used to your power yet.

403
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,709
-Exactly.
-What if you're wrong?

404
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,838
What will you do
if my power is gone for good?

405
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,760
What if I put all of you
in danger like last time?

406
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,679
Then, what will you do?

407
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,348
You're not the reason why I got hurt.

408
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,727
You're wrong.
I was never cut out for this job.

409
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,438
All I could do was sniff them out.

410
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,065
That power was so dear to me.

411
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,026
But now I've lost even that.

412
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,446
I can't stay with you
just so I can live.

413
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,658
I feel too guilty. I just can't do that.

414
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,035
Jeok-bong!

415
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,412
-Yes?
-Come here for a minute.

416
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,706
Jeok-bong, your father's calling you.

417
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,040
I'm coming.

418
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,418
Let me.

419
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,961
-Gosh, there's more.
-Gosh.

420
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,212
Hey, check this out.

421
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,256
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

422
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,717
Goodness.

423
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,677
My goodness.

424
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,014
I'm sorry
for not introducing myself earlier.

425
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,432
No, we should be sorry.

426
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,725
I'm Ms. Chu--

427
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,767
Our company director.

428
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,394
-Director Chu.
-Right.

429
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,854
An executive.

430
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,439
I'm Ga…

431
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,732
-An employee.
-Our employee.

432
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,525
Chief. I'm Chief Ga.

433
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,777
-It's nice to meet you.
-That's Assistant Manager So.

434
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,571
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

435
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,699
I'm sorry there's not much food.

436
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,909
This is a feast.

437
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,077
-Please enjoy.
-Okay.

438
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,955
I hope you'll like the food.

439
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,333
-Of course, we will.
-Then, I'll let you chat.

440
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,250
-Thank you.
-Okay.

441
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,003
Jeok-bong, you better act right.

442
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,130
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

443
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,925
Behave, you fool.

444
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,135
Thank you for the meal.

445
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,303
My pleasure. Enjoy.

446
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,555
Dad.

447
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,310
Jeok-bong.

448
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,937
Jeok-bong.

449
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,439
You're going to leave him
and go back into a coma?

450
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,983
That's a terrible thing to do as a son.

451
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,821
You should eat and go home
before it gets too late.

452
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,324
I'll pack you some sweet potatoes.

453
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,243
That's not important.

454
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,702
-Damn it.
-Jeok-bong.

455
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,773
The Yung people told me
to do everything I can.

456
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,069
I can do anything if you're by my side.

457
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,947
I just don't like him.

458
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,719
Jeok-bong discovered his power.

459
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,972
He could be our only hope in locating
the evil spirits who avoid the territory.

460
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,516
You have a blessed nose. You do.

461
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,583
Why are you doing this?

462
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,001
I said I didn't want to.

463
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,587
Come on. Stop trying to look your age.

464
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,173
Not even country folk
look like this these days.

465
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,426
Even the village head dyes his hair.

466
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,095
He wears a wig, you fool.

467
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,306
This is my natural hair.

468
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,600
In any case…

469
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,563
Don't worry about finding me a spouse
and focus on getting remarried.

470
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,733
Have you gone insane?
What nonsense is that?

471
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,234
You punk.

472
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,528
The bangs are what matter.

473
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,322
Focus on them.

474
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,615
All right.

475
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,033
That's it.

476
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,711
Dad.

477
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,256
You should

478
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,634
sell the cows.

479
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,676
What?

480
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,013
You should sell them and pay off the loan.

481
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,433
And eat some good food
with the remaining money.

482
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,851
Go travel too.

483
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,770
You've never been on a plane before.

484
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,315
You impudent, little brat.

485
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,360
Instead of earning your own money
to treat your father,

486
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,695
you want me to sell the cows and do what?

487
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,031
That wasn't what I meant.

488
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,574
Of course, it was.

489
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:15,746
Do you know why I always fail
to become the next village head?

490
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,498
It's the village head's son, Seong-sik.

491
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,751
His business in Seoul flourished,
so he threw a party

492
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,711
at the senior citizen center.

493
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,004
He installed an AC too.

494
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:29,468
I never asked you to get into
Hanguk University like he did

495
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,303
or buy me an apartment like he did.

496
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,014
I would've done the same if I could.

497
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,519
If you liked him that much,
you should've had him as your son instead.

498
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,732
Hey, you brat.

499
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,110
You're not done with my hair yet!

500
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,281
Why are his shoes so worn out too?

501
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,199
That little…

502
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,537
Gosh.

503
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,415
Do we really need to return these?

504
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,877
What did Yung say?

505
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,714
They said they respected his decision,
so I got mad at them.

506
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,924
They said they'll give us
an answer by today.

507
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,804
They say you always feel
the absence of someone who's gone.

508
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,225
I miss that folksy accent of his.

509
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,143
Darn it.

510
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,812
They respect our wishes
only in times like these.

511
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,523
They said it's hard to find a Counter.

512
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,401
But now, they're happy to let him go?

513
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,903
Going somewhere, Mun?

514
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,447
I'm going to bring Jeok-bong back.

515
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,283
I think I put
too much emphasis on his power.

516
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,036
I put too much pressure on him
when he just became a Counter.

517
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,288
I'll go and convince him.

518
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,165
I'll bring him back no matter what.

519
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,751
Yeah, he shouldn't give up so easily.

520
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,712
It wasn't his fault he lost his power.

521
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,215
We can't put him back into a coma.

522
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,508
You're right.

523
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,134
So what if he can't smell?

524
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,594
He has other skills too.

525
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,931
Okay? Well…
I'm sure he can do something else.

526
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,973
-Let's go.
-Okay.

527
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,392
No, I'll go alone this time.

528
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,146
He seemed a bit uncomfortable
to have us all there last time.

529
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,272
Let's go, Mun.

530
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,690
What?

531
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,484
You can't drive.

532
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,253
Everything will work out
since we have a new member.

533
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,550
Everyone in this photo
will be alive until the end.

534
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,559
No.

535
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,352
Don't look back.

536
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,815
I was bound to die anyway.

537
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,737
I should spend the time
I have left lying in peace

538
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,448
and then dying quietly.

539
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,119
It's the best for everyone.

540
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,208
Hey!

541
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,794
The persimmons have ripened well.

542
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:13,132
If you're not busy, take them
and some makgeolli to the village head.

543
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,260
Did you hear me?

544
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,930
That little…

545
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,613
PLAQUE OF APPRECIATION

546
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,740
Father.

547
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,200
Let me ask you one last time.

548
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,953
My answer won't change no matter what.

549
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,289
You really won't sell the site?

550
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,666
Stop making me repeat myself!

551
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,793
That will never happen.

552
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,963
Don't ever come back
if you're going to talk such nonsense.

553
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,990
What are you doing?

554
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,911
Do you think doing this crap
will make me sell our family's gravesite?

555
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,747
Put the knife down. Put it down!

556
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,290
No!

557
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,753
You need to sell it for my sake!

558
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,674
If not…

559
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,092
What's wrong with you?

560
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,552
-You can die for my sake.
-What are you doing?

561
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,138
Are you home, sir?
I brought some persimmons…

562
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,896
Sir!

563
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,439
Sir, are you okay?

564
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,901
Seong-sik, what have you done?

565
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:56,902
Are you crazy?

566
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,321
I pity you, Jeok-bong.

567
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:04,701
Come on.

568
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,662
He needs to die too.

569
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,539
An evil spirit?

570
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,041
How did you become

571
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,918
an evil spirit?

572
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,629
Seong-sik.

573
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:16,797
Seong-sik!

574
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:25,973
What's going on, Jeok-bong?

575
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,475
What's happening?

576
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,935
Seong-sik!

577
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,481
Jeok-bong.

578
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,608
What's going on?

579
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,237
Why are you doing this?

580
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,197
Get away from me! Seong-sik!

581
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,494
-No, Seong-sik! Stop it!
-Let go of me.

582
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,537
Seong-sik! Stop!

583
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,664
Seong-sik!

584
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,344
No!

585
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,226
Seong-sik!

586
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,270
Don't go!

587
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:18,192
I told you not to do anything.

588
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,488
Seong-sik…

589
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,872
Seong-sik!

590
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,364
Jeok-bong, that dimwit.

591
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,366
How could he forget the makgeolli?

592
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,827
Goodness, sir!

593
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,916
That little…

594
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,430
Dad.

595
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,266
Dad…

596
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,267
Jong-guk!

597
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,478
Jong-guk!

598
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,188
Ha-na.

599
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:39,856
Ha-na!

600
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,692
Oh, no. Please wake up.

601
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,664
We're almost there. We need to hurry.

602
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,458
Does Jeok-bong attract evil spirits
or something?

603
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,174
Help me.

604
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,718
That's why I told you

605
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,887
not to try…

606
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,227
too hard.

607
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,105
Jong-guk!

608
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,368
Jong-guk!

609
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:34,995
Jong-guk, wake up!

610
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:36,788
Jong-guk!

611
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,045
You won't be lonely, Father.

612
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,756
Mr. Na and Jeok-bong
will accompany you into the afterlife.

613
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,147
What?

614
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:03,940
What are you doing?

615
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,612
It's back.

616
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,785
That lovely smell is back!

617
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,999
That means I'm once again…

618
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,711
a Counter.

619
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,175
Nice.

620
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,594
Nice, Jeok-bong.

621
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,972
Who are you?
Are you really that fool Jeok-bong?

622
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,309
I'm no longer the fool I used to be.

623
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,352
Okay?

624
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,906
-More!
-More!

625
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,786
As a Counter,

626
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:03,750
I will make sure you pay
for being an awful son.

627
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,138
Mun, his father.

628
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,810
Are you okay?

629
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,353
-Not bad.
-Are you okay?

630
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,021
Thank goodness.

631
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,192
Sir. Are you all right?

632
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,611
Sir. Are you okay?

633
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,906
Help me!

634
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,285
Jeok-bong.

635
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,494
Sir.

636
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,164
You're dreaming right now.
You can go back to sleep.

637
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,676
All that dung…

638
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,136
Nice. That's right.

639
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,598
He's strong too.

640
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,647
His moves are old-fashioned.

641
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,608
He's much better than Mo-tak.

642
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,909
Here comes my finisher!

643
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,340
-Na Jeok-bong!
-Na Jeok-bong!

644
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,716
-Na Jeok-bong!
-Na Jeok-bong!

645
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,806
My goodness, Jeok-bong!

646
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,058
You were terrific! Come on.

647
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,770
-You were the best!
-What?

648
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,563
When did you get here?

649
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,065
We saw everything.

650
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,776
Did you? How embarrassing.

651
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,069
Right.

652
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,404
He and I…

653
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,114
I mean, this evil spirit--

654
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,951
-Be quiet.
-Right. I got my smell back.

655
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,245
Don't hit my nose!

656
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,747
Come on.

657
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,917
You caught that evil spirit.
So you should summon it.

658
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,126
What?

659
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:11,670
Summon?

660
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,798
Do you think I can do it?

661
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,010
Okay. Put his hand on his chest.

662
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,224
Like this?

663
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,562
And then, put your right hand on top.

664
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,650
Jeok-bong.

665
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,819
See you later.

666
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,059
This was your first summon, Jeok-bong.

667
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,230
What will happen to that evil spirit now?

668
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,232
It was sent to the eternal prison.

669
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,153
It's all thanks to you.

670
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,997
Jong-guk, you see…

671
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,668
It was a bit dangerous back there.

672
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,128
But I was just trying to do my best.

673
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,881
You must be very upset with me.

674
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,591
I'm not upset.

675
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,386
I'm just touched.

676
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,804
What?

677
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,931
Thank you, my big brother.

678
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,271
What? Hold on.

679
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,233
I'm older than you?

680
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,238
I'm actually 21 years old.

681
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,075
I should've told you sooner.

682
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,284
I'm sorry.

683
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,161
You were

684
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,999
totally incredible today,

685
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,542
my big brother!

686
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,213
I see.

687
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,090
You're 21?

688
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,174
Yes!

689
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,677
Goodness!

690
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,014
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you were older than me.

691
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,974
Don't cry.

692
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:12,892
Did I look cool?

693
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,644
Yes, you were!

694
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,397
All right. Don't cry now.

695
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,909
Don't touch it.

696
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:30,910
All right.

697
00:55:56,478 --> 00:56:00,065
You look neat and dandy like a bachelor.

698
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,775
You could get married again.

699
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,318
Is that so?

700
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,361
You should've shaved sooner.

701
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,447
It's been ages since I last shaved.

702
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,740
You look clean.

703
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,992
-Do I look good?
-Yes.

704
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:33,890
What's this?

705
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,476
Open it.

706
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,651
Your shoes were pretty worn out.

707
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,361
Do you like them?

708
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,449
But you don't have any money.

709
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,077
I have enough
to buy my son a pair of shoes.

710
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,955
You're the most important to me.

711
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,749
Nothing comes before you do.

712
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,587
Also…

713
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,092
I've never wished
for someone else as a son.

714
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,512
I admit I was envious at times.

715
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,723
But no parent in this world

716
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,393
would trade their child for another.

717
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,353
That's a fact.

718
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,192
Dad.

719
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,531
I'll go back to my company.

720
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,035
I'll do as you wish.

721
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:39,956
I'll go back…

722
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,710
and save the world.

723
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,340
Jeez.

724
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,761
Sure, go save the world.

725
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,682
And when you have the time,
find yourself a wife too.

726
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,517
Do whatever you want, you brat.

727
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,686
Jeez.

728
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,648
Thank you.

729
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,650
Unbelievable.

730
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:20,455
I'm glad Jeok-bong's power has returned.

731
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,372
Plus,

732
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:25,752
it seems like he's become
a true Counter now.

733
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,964
He'll never forget

734
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,508
his first summon.

735
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,094
My heart still races
whenever I think back to mine.

736
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,681
So that makes you
a veteran Counter now, right?

737
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,144
Now that Jeok-bong's back,

738
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,438
we'll find those evil spirits, right?

739
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,817
I wonder where they're hiding.

740
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,991
They're probably where
their desires have led them to.

741
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,620
After all, it's their nature.

742
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,209
There is something I do know for sure.

743
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,753
It's that they're after me

744
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,463
and my power.

745
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,549
And I know

746
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,801
they'll never give up.

747
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,489
You remember that woman?

748
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,953
The woman we ran into
at the elevator with Mr. Park.

749
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,205
"Please don't kill me."

750
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,043
What about it?

751
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,798
Among the memories
of that bitch from the reeds,

752
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,301
that woman was there.

753
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,261
What do you mean?

754
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,188
That bitch from the reeds
and the guy you're after

755
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,985
bawled their eyes out
at the hospital when she died.

756
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,616
Are you saying they know each other?

757
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,870
Probably more than that.

758
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,876
More interestingly…

759
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,553
HUSBAND OF COURT MURDER VICTIM
FAILS ATTEMPT AT REVENGE

760
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,848
Intriguing, right?

761
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,938
He has no idea who killed his wife.

762
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,233
30-YEAR-OLD MAN ARRESTED
AFTER ATTEMPTING REVENGE

763
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,653
ON WIFE'S MURDERER

764
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,370
You think killing people is a game?

765
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,622
Do you know what you've done?

766
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,083
Do you know what kind
of people you destroyed?

767
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,179
It's finally here.

768
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:24,722
Your day in court.

769
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,433
How are you feeling?

770
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,064
I wonder what went through her mind.

771
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,984
Mr. Ma.

772
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,613
Yes?

773
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,618
The prosecution will emphasize
that it was premeditated.

774
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,830
You stole the fire truck
and found out the escort vehicle's route.

775
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:49,872
It's not a good look.

776
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,377
I'm talking about your wife.

777
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:59,757
Bam, bam, bam! What went through her mind
while she was being stabbed?

778
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:00,842
Shut up.

779
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,935
-I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

780
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,146
Yes, I'm fine.

781
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:18,234
No one was there to help her.

782
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:23,531
She covered her stomach with all her might
to protect her unborn baby.

783
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:27,702
Meanwhile, her hands were torn to shreds.

784
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:32,373
It's best to avoid any questions
that may put you at a disadvantage.

785
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,544
Say "I don't remember"
if it's difficult to answer.

786
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,088
Or just look at me.

787
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,131
Okay?

788
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,092
Okay.

789
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:49,682
But now,

790
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:53,686
even her own husband
who she trusted is giving up on her?

791
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,355
Were you this much of a coward?

792
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,107
Ma Ju-seok!

793
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,278
You haven't done anything!

794
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:08,826
All right, then.

795
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,079
Are you okay?

796
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,255
Yes.

797
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,090
I'm okay.

798
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,635
All right.

799
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,395
"Yes, I will tell you as it is."

800
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,731
No. "Let me tell you what happened."

801
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,899
That's not it either.

802
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,151
"Are you…" Why am I asking a question?

803
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,364
Just relax and tell them what happened.

804
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,366
There's no need to be so tense.

805
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:50,993
Don't detectives frequent the court often?

806
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:54,580
I can't just tell it as it is.

807
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,873
The emotions.

808
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,543
I need to deliver those emotions well.

809
01:03:58,626 --> 01:03:59,877
I need to show them…

810
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,673
how heartbroken Mr. Ma was.

811
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,425
These emotions need
to be felt by the judge too.

812
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,343
Don't you agree?

813
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:10,054
I hired our nation's top attorney for him,

814
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,597
so don't worry too much.

815
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,724
You just need to answer

816
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,226
the judge's questions honestly.

817
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,477
Yes, sir.

818
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,146
-Shall we go?
-Right now?

819
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,314
Okay.

820
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:23,401
Mun is going to pick up
Mr. Ma's mother before heading over.

821
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,569
All right.

822
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,197
Are you sure you two don't have to come?

823
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,199
I'll only end up crying.

824
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,325
-You can go.
-Okay.

825
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,494
Jeok-bong will be arriving today.

826
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,163
So we'll look for the evil spirits
once you return.

827
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:37,832
Okay.

828
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,418
-We'll be back.
-Be calm.

829
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:41,961
I'm so nervous.

830
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,170
Come on.

831
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,381
-I'll do my best.
-Bye.

832
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:46,382
-Mo-tak.
-Yes?

833
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,425
Relax.

834
01:04:56,934 --> 01:05:00,021
Goodness, you didn't have to pick me up.

835
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,981
I could've just taken the subway.

836
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,068
I wanted to escort you.

837
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:10,364
By the way,

838
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:12,992
this…

839
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,786
What's all this?

840
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,583
They're photos I had at home.

841
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,961
Some were sent to me.

842
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:30,009
Someone told me submitting these pictures
and a petition would help his case.

843
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:36,974
But I'm worried doing such a thing

844
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,602
would only backfire on us.

845
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,608
Do you think it'll be okay?

846
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,861
Of course.

847
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,907
These will help him greatly
if the court decides to accept them.

848
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,661
Every one of these

849
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,537
is precious.

850
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,208
Let's go.

851
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,043
Okay.

852
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,765
COURT

853
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,769
He'll be okay.

854
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,570
Don't worry, ma'am.

855
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,531
Thank you.

856
01:06:56,637 --> 01:07:00,266
The trial for case number 2025-347
will now begin.

857
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,979
He was looking at the victim

858
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,148
and crying.

859
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,358
He was crying.

860
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,695
Did he look dangerous?

861
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,363
No.

862
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,743
It didn't look like
he was going to kill him at all.

863
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,162
Why do you think so?

864
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,623
Because he asked,
"How could someone kill another person?"

865
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,294
He asked how someone could do that.

866
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,213
He didn't resist his arrest,

867
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,300
and he kept asking the same question.

868
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,220
"How could they kill another human being?"

869
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,645
Would the defendant
like to address the court?

870
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,649
You've been doing very well.

871
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,568
Just tell them

872
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,029
you regret everything
and you're full of remorse.

873
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:55,946
That's it.

874
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,565
Right now,

875
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,069
I regret everything.

876
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,614
Also,

877
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,117
I'm full of remorse.

878
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,955
If only I could turn back time…

879
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,126
and go back

880
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,254
to that same moment…

881
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,554
What is…

882
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:03,514
wrong with him?

883
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,229
Then, I'd kill him.

884
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,774
No matter what.

885
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,527
Mr. Ma, what are you doing?

886
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,444
Mr. Ma.

887
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,698
Your Honor, my client only said that

888
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,952
because he's still mentally unfit
from the loss of his wife.

889
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,246
I'd like to withdraw his words.

890
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:31,125
The defendant's statement
and his attorney's opinion seem to differ.

891
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,626
Could the defendant discuss

892
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,837
with his attorney
and give his statement again?

893
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:27,932
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

894
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:28,849
You know very well

895
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,935
this isn't what Ms. Lee would've wanted.

896
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,229
Min-ji is gone now.

897
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,607
He must've gone insane
after his wife and baby died.

898
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,443
If Ma Ju-seok accepts the power,

899
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:40,986
he'll be a very special one.

900
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:41,946
Straight ahead.

901
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,198
They're finally here.

902
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,868
You'd be very happy to see them.

903
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,288
Who do you think killed your wife?

904
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,873
What are you getting at?

905
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,458
That guy, So Mun…

906
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,920
How will he look once he sees
that his savior has become the devil?

907
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,053
