1
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,189
We have an update on the ballot count.

2
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,275
The results of the mayoral election
of Jungjin just came in,

3
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,568
the city with the closest race.

4
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,361
Mayoral candidate Shin Myeong-hwi

5
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,782
won the election for mayor of Jungjin
by a margin of 358 votes.

6
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,700
Shin Myeong-hwi!

7
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,454
Mom, I made a storybook about our family.

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,041
Did you? A storybook?

9
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,294
Yes, it's a story about
our family going on a trip.

10
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,296
-Gosh.
-Really?

11
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,217
Then it must be about Mom, Dad, and Mun,
taking a trip together.

12
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,844
No, it's with Grandpa and Grandma.

13
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,972
You and Mom are always busy.

14
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,392
That's why you couldn't go on this trip.

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,021
-Honey, we can certainly go, right?
-Of course.

16
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,023
You always break your promises.

17
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:53,530
Mun, let us be a part of your storybook,
pretty please?

18
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,532
-Please.
-We'll be there!

19
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,367
Come on, seriously. I promise.

20
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,620
Ow! My arm hurts!

21
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,960
And Mom?

22
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,255
Yes, sir! I'll be there, too!

23
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,423
Please draw me in.

24
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,343
Then let me draw you two.

25
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,470
-All right!
-All right!

26
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,749
At times, things will feel unfair

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,796
And drive you to the brink of tears
For no reason

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,923
CONTACTS: SO GWON

29
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,595
For ordinary people
Who never win first place

30
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:03,892
Getting an applause
Is only for other people

31
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,186
But there is one promise…

32
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,771
-Hello?
-Gwon.

33
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,940
You better be careful, too.

34
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,570
Why do you sound like that?
Is something going on?

35
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,822
Make sure you survive.

36
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,115
You have to!

37
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,617
Where are you, Detective Ga?

38
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,084
Hey… Where are you?

39
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,828
Mom…

40
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,086
My leg really hurts.

41
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,804
Dad…

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,182
Dad…

43
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,286
Help…

44
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,497
me…

45
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,074
SEVEN YEARS LATER

46
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,328
Okay, Grandma. Let's wash up.

47
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,040
You good-for-nothing.
You killed my daughter, you jerk.

48
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,583
-You jerk!
-My gosh!

49
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,003
Gosh, Grandma.
You're very energetic this morning.

50
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,547
Why hasn't this jerk died yet?

51
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,132
Grandma, wait!

52
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,635
Die! Take this. It's your fault!

53
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,638
It's all your fault!
It's all because of you!

54
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,517
Grandma,
you look unbelievably pretty today.

55
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,773
I look pretty?

56
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,358
Of course.
You're the prettiest in the world.

57
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,955
EPISODE 1

58
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,501
Grandpa! Grandma needs
another pair of underwear.

59
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,962
Did she make a mistake?

60
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,215
Number two or number one?

61
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,092
Number one.

62
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,135
It's all right.

63
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,554
Come here, Grandma. Don't be embarrassed.

64
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,848
-Gosh!
-Come here.

65
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,142
-Stop it, you jerk.
-Yes, right. Number one.

66
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,728
Come on! Let me wash your face!

67
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,647
Gosh, seriously!

68
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,815
You little jerk!

69
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,073
2019 EXCELLENCE AWARD: SO MUN

70
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,576
DAEHAN CHILDREN'S ART CONTEST
EXCELLENCE AWARD: SO MUN

71
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,591
-Hey, Mun!
-Hey, Mun!

72
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,009
Hey, I'm coming!

73
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,448
Okay, one more bite.

74
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,450
That's it.

75
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,659
I'm going to school.

76
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,119
All right, have a good day.

77
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,082
Be careful.

78
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,918
Don't worry.

79
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,353
Oh, dear. My goodness.

80
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,646
-Gosh.
-Here.

81
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,356
Are you all right?

82
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,366
Wait a second. Today is the 12th.

83
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,785
Let's go!

84
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,954
You're fast!

85
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,590
Wait up. Wait for me.

86
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,175
Catch up already.

87
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,023
Mun, are you done
making the lead character?

88
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,818
-Of course I am. He's totally awesome.
-Nice.

89
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,071
-I want him to be from a dirt-poor family.
-A dirt-poor family?

90
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,533
-One who lives in a semi-basement.
-A semi-basement?

91
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,452
Like a place where rusty water comes out
when he turns on the tap.

92
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,580
He's a part-timer
at an Internet cafe, too.

93
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,833
And he has to take out a loan
to make his hero costume.

94
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,920
Oh, right. Let's say he gets stronger
whenever he defeats a villain.

95
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,047
-Like in games?
-Yes.

96
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,633
He can absorb the villain's power
and make it his.

97
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,801
And make it his?

98
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,387
What if he had
an awful and sarcastic personality?

99
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,473
Like a guy with anger management issues
who can also be mean.

100
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,642
-His blood type should be B.
-Any girlfriends?

101
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,853
-He only has crushes!
-He only has crushes!

102
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,146
-Jinx.
-I jinx you back.

103
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,404
HALT UNCONSENTED REDEVELOPMENT

104
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,530
This is it.

105
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,866
The hideout for the last villain.

106
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,034
What do you think?

107
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,119
I heard it'll become
the tallest building in Korea.

108
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,912
It can even be seen from North Korea.

109
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,749
What? That's awfully tall.

110
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,378
TAESIN CONSTRUCTION WILL KEEP
MAYOR SHIN MYEONG-HWI'S PROMISE

111
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,671
AND CREATE JUNGJIN'S NEW TOWN

112
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,423
Hello.

113
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,969
-Can you stop for a second?
-Sure.

114
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,682
-Hello.
-Where are you going?

115
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,808
Thank you.

116
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,269
Hello.

117
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,687
MISSING PERSON

118
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,897
Thank you.

119
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,607
Thank you.

120
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,735
-Oh, hello.
-Thank you.

121
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,195
Thank you.

122
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,073
Didn't you take this last time?

123
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,368
Not a lot of people took one,
so I thought I would.

124
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,704
She'll feel less lonely
if she knows that someone out there cares.

125
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,999
But they've been missing for a year.
Maybe they already passed.

126
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,210
-Hey, come on.
-Hey, don't be so harsh.

127
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,712
Where are you?

128
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,715
-Have you been to Eonni's Noodles?
-Nope.

129
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,550
-You still haven't been there?
-No.

130
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,721
Taesin wanted to build a building
right where this noodle place sits,

131
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,224
but the owner there
flat out refused to sell it.

132
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,142
That's a long line.

133
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,436
It looks like
an ordinary noodle place to me.

134
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,604
No way.

135
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,898
I'm sure they have a secret recipe.

136
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,901
There are folks who haven't tried it,
but no one eats it just once.

137
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,487
Why are we just hearing about it?

138
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,072
They don't even advertise.

139
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,157
Not on blogs, social media, nothing.

140
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,078
It's a real hidden gem
that only those in the know know about.

141
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,579
What a strange place.

142
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,081
Miss, more kimchi, please.

143
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,374
Kimchi? Get it yourself.

144
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,583
It's self-serve.

145
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,753
What's even more bizarre are the owners.

146
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:58,050
At first glance, they look like a family,
but then they seem too odd to be a family.

147
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,136
Two banquet noodles, please.

148
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,971
What is this place?

149
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,556
You don't know? It's famous.

150
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,642
-Miss! When are my noodles coming out?
-You'll have it soon.

151
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,520
Two banquet noodles.

152
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,101
EONNI'S NOODLES

153
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,857
I can't use that.

154
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,693
Use it as long as you can.

155
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,288
Should I take these inside?

156
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,665
It's fine.
I'll take my time to take it in.

157
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,804
Goodbye.

158
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,974
Goodbye.

159
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:29,975
LOVE JUNGJIN
LOVE NATURE

160
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,774
We stepped on one.

161
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,070
-What's the level?
-I think it's level two.

162
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,279
You think?

163
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,989
It might be a level three.

164
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,658
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

165
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,160
I heard ones that are in level three
speak in two voices.

166
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,330
I'm not sure because it was a first,
but that thing had two voices.

167
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,915
When will Cheol-jung get here?

168
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,250
Let's get moving.

169
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,044
How is it?

170
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,171
It tastes pretty good.

171
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,840
-You can all leave after you eat.
-Sure.

172
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,260
It's only open for three hours
during lunch.

173
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,427
They know they're too good.

174
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,804
-We're done. Come later.
-What?

175
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,264
But we waited for an hour.

176
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,103
Wait, you can't do this.
You think you're too good.

177
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,813
Gosh, I'm starving to death.

178
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,981
Let's go, Ha-na.

179
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,983
Can you let us in as the last table?
It's his…

180
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,360
We have an emergency,
so I'll give you twice as much later.

181
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,987
Noodles on birthdays mean longevity.

182
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,488
-Wait!
-I'm sorry.

183
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,240
-One second.
-We're starving.

184
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,998
She's really pretty.

185
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,499
She's totally pretty.

186
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,584
Hey!

187
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,222
What's up?

188
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,391
Where are you?

189
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,392
We stepped on one.

190
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,227
We stepped on one?

191
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,563
He was in a black hoodie with a tiger.

192
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,857
-Where is he?
-Near Jungjin Internet Cafe.

193
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,901
Cheol-jung, did you hear that?

194
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,652
Okay, I'll head over right now.

195
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,625
Go over there. Let's split up.

196
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,427
Why'd that evil spirit have to get spotted
now? How tactless.

197
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,721
I was about to try
my dear Ms. Chu's noodles.

198
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,390
Did you get nagged
at your niece's wedding?

199
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,517
All throughout the three days.

200
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:40,272
I'm sure your niece also feels burdened
about having a 50-year-old single uncle.

201
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,316
-Ha-na, you…
-Let's get this over with and go.

202
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,859
I'll make you an extra-special bowl.

203
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,278
-Leave the mushrooms out of mine.
-Sure.

204
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,535
Our territory opened up in the north.

205
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,996
It opened up, but it's too confined.

206
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,499
Whoever's the first to find him,
lure him there.

207
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,959
Cheol-jung, take up your position.

208
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,672
Cheol-jung, are you walking right now
instead of running?

209
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,966
Okay, fine. I'll be there soon.

210
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,907
Found him.

211
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,827
He's headed toward the alley
where we parked.

212
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,286
Right, okay.

213
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,477
Darn it. He's on to us.

214
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,191
Everyone, block off the exits!

215
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,486
Okay, I'll cover the back exit.

216
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,947
Ms. Chu, block the front entrance.

217
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,699
All right. Be careful, everyone.

218
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,697
That bastard.

219
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,909
He's definitely a level three.

220
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,452
He jumped off the rooftop.

221
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,787
What?

222
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,704
What?

223
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,122
He jumped off the rooftop?

224
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,858
Are you all right?

225
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,277
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

226
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,028
-I'm fine. I'm totally fine.
-But…

227
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,469
Mo-tak, did you take a blow?

228
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,637
Are you okay, Mo-tak?

229
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,806
Where are you right now?

230
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,516
I'll be in our territory soon.

231
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,851
Keep the streets guarded.

232
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,477
I'll lure this thing that way.

233
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,913
Who are you people?

234
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,873
You can't be the police.

235
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,092
Not bad.

236
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,792
Who in the world are you?

237
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,001
Are you talking to us?

238
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,004
We're Grim Reapers, you jerk.

239
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,368
He's a level three.

240
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,829
Stay focused.

241
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,915
Darn it. Why can't I pull this out?

242
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,545
Darn it. Man.

243
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,423
Are you okay?

244
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,842
What was that?

245
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,719
That jerk uses psychokinesis.

246
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,014
Psychokinesis? Ms. Chu, stay out of this.
Things could get bad.

247
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,724
You'll be finished in an instant. Okay?

248
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,935
I'm not going to die
before I make noodles for you.

249
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,019
Don't worry.

250
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,738
He's coming this way.

251
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,493
Wait for us.
Don't take him on by yourself.

252
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,994
Get in here. Get in.

253
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,805
I can fight against him in our territory.

254
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,598
I'll hold out until you get here.

255
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,064
LAKE PARK, JUNGJIN STATION

256
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,628
I think I might be able…

257
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,797
to put an end to this.

258
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,868
Cheol-jung, hold out just a little more.

259
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,036
We'll be there soon.

260
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,091
What is this?

261
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,136
It suddenly got boring.

262
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
Look!

263
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,268
Our territory is gone!

264
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,989
Who are you people?

265
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,200
Why are you following me?

266
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,565
Cheol-jung! Hang in there!

267
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,913
Cheol-jung! Just a bit more!
Hang in there just a bit longer!

268
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,456
Please don't die!

269
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,261
No, please.

270
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,580
That was the most delicious thing
I've ever had.

271
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,553
UNDERPASS

272
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,775
It's gone.

273
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,693
Our territory is gone.

274
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,660
-Cheol-jung!
-Cheol-jung!

275
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,995
Hey! Cheol-jung!

276
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,538
Cheol-jung!

277
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,957
-Cheol-jung!
-Cheol-jung, wake up!

278
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:48,875
Cheol-jung!

279
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,710
No!

280
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,920
-No, Cheol-jung!
-No!

281
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,341
No!

282
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,009
No.

283
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,224
No!

284
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,491
Coma.

285
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,660
I must find someone who's in a coma.

286
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,544
Let me see.

287
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,381
Gosh, does it hurt a lot?

288
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,760
They bully kids for a few coins
as second years in high school.

289
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,595
How pathetic is that? Those jerks.

290
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,557
A few coins? They probably take
a few million won a month.

291
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,851
That's insane.
Isn't that totally criminal?

292
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,103
They're almost like gangsters.

293
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,521
Report them to the police.

294
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,480
Report what?

295
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,733
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

296
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,025
It's nothing.

297
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,736
-Pile up a lot.
-Okay.

298
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,039
-Let's eat!
-Let's eat!

299
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,459
It's so good.

300
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,753
Yes, this one.

301
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,463
-Gosh.
-You're splattering that everywhere.

302
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,131
It's my treat. Eat as much as you want.

303
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,716
-I love you!
-I love you!

304
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,885
That was delicious.

305
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:22,969
I'm so full.

306
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,387
We had so much food today.

307
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,347
It's enough to cover for tomorrow.

308
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,120
-Mun!
-Hey!

309
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,498
I can't believe this.
How did I get in here?

310
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,749
-Wake up.
-Are you okay?

311
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,584
-Wake up.
-Open your eyes.

312
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,002
-Mun!
-Hey!

313
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,172
Mun.

314
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:00,840
Are you okay?

315
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,842
No idea.

316
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,011
It felt like something zapped my body.

317
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,679
-Get up.
-Stand up.

318
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,433
"Zapped"?

319
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,269
-Were you struck by lightning?
-Lightning?

320
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,354
On this sunny day?

321
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,397
I guess it was out of the blue.

322
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,690
-My gosh!
-What?

323
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,609
Oh, my gosh.

324
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,110
-What?
-My goodness.

325
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,237
What's wrong?

326
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,321
-What is this?
-No…

327
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,032
-No way.
-My gosh!

328
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,201
What? What about my hair?

329
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,453
-Popcorn!
-Popcorn.

330
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,538
What?

331
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,045
What's going on?

332
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:39,963
What is this?

333
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,881
-What happened?
-My gosh!

334
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,235
Hey.

335
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,362
How did you know I was here?

336
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,700
I can hear my grandkid come
all the way from the outskirts of town.

337
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,994
I didn't forget your birthday.

338
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,506
Happy birthday to you

339
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,050
Happy birthday to you

340
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,512
Happy birthday, dear Mun

341
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,307
Happy birthday to you

342
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,810
Thank you.

343
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,273
Goodness.

344
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,525
Come on, Grandma.

345
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,819
-Goodness.
-No.

346
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,863
Who are you?

347
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,199
Why are you taking Mun's cake?

348
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,367
Let it go.

349
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,702
Who's Mun?

350
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,412
He's my grandson.

351
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,539
My delight and my happiness.

352
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,251
Gosh, you put me down,
then you raise me up again, Grandma.

353
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,130
I'm that grandson you're talking about,
okay?

354
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,841
Have you gone insane?

355
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,217
Goodness.

356
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,135
Oh, no.

357
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,346
My gosh.

358
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,347
Come on.

359
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,183
Come on, seriously.

360
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,226
What? Hey!

361
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,561
No.

362
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,690
Grandma, this is Mom's. My gosh.

363
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,610
Stop eating that.

364
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,044
It's still like this
even after I washed my hair.

365
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,131
Wait.

366
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,549
What?

367
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,094
What are these?

368
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,888
My gosh.

369
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,396
Wait, why is this soap
breaking into pieces?

370
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,649
My goodness.

371
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,031
What?

372
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,617
My gosh.

373
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,911
Everything is broken.

374
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:37,015
Did I get these
when I was struck by lightning?

375
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,857
No.

376
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,110
It didn't seem like lightning.

377
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,992
I wouldn't say it felt like lightning.

378
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,913
It felt like icy cold water,

379
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,833
and I could feel it

380
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,086
through every microvessel,
to the tip of my hands and feet.

381
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,796
It was that intense.

382
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,382
It felt so clear.

383
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,595
And my head was very clear
as if I had put my head in ice water.

384
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,764
That's how it felt.

385
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,392
What was that?

386
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,175
You must be So Mun. I'm Wi-gen.

387
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,812
It wasn't a dream.

388
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,355
Then?

389
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,148
But it must be a dream.

390
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,442
But that felt too vivid.

391
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,652
I wouldn't know.

392
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,030
The way that woman touched me
also felt completely realistic.

393
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,615
I can still recall how it felt.

394
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,909
Whoa, "touched"?

395
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,745
Was she naked?

396
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,038
Oh, man.

397
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,833
Or did you take her clothes off?
Or maybe you two stripped at once.

398
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,168
It wasn't that kind of dream.

399
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,462
What did she look like?

400
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,925
She had long, thick silver hair

401
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,511
and looked very exotic.

402
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,891
She must've been in her 50s.

403
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,476
Oh, my God, you pervert.

404
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,228
Come on, goodness.

405
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,816
We aren't asking you to give us money.

406
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,610
We're asking you to let us borrow some.

407
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,654
Sorry.

408
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,490
Can you give me one more day?

409
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,075
I'll bring it tomorrow. I mean it.

410
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,829
His family runs a pension, right?

411
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,666
Book us a room for 15 people
for three nights.

412
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,917
I'll take it as the interest.

413
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,502
Not that, Cheon-jung.

414
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,920
What I mean is that,

415
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,213
our pension is really old…

416
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,507
-You little jerk.
-If you can't do it, you can't.

417
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,301
There's no need to get so serious, man.

418
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,011
You made him angry.

419
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,220
What are you looking at?

420
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,722
Look down.

421
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,185
Where are you going?

422
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,897
Come on. Put your head there.

423
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,690
Yes, that's it.

424
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,234
Ung-min.

425
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,571
Why do you let them do that? Let's go.

426
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,449
Mun…

427
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,034
Man, what's that thing?

428
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,411
I'm Ung-min's friend.

429
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:49,123
Wow, you have some killer friends.

430
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,086
Please let him go.

431
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,214
Hey, you. Come here.

432
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,886
Come here.

433
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,846
Stop it.

434
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,390
Look down!

435
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,851
Don't come over here, Mun.

436
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,562
Please just go.

437
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,648
Hey, attention.

438
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,234
-Stop it!
-Darn you.

439
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,111
If you want to take him,

440
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,239
you need to come here.

441
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,698
I told you to stop!

442
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,119
Who's being so loud in the library?
Who is it?

443
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,788
Sir, over here!

444
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,581
-Ju-yeon, why are you crying?
-Sir!

445
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,000
-Be quiet.
-Hello.

446
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,293
See you tomorrow.

447
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,378
What's going on?

448
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,963
-Hello.
-Hey.

449
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,800
You're pretty funny.

450
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,095
-Hello.
-Oh, Hyeok-u, you were here.

451
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,558
Get back to your studies.

452
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,559
Ung-min…

453
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,016
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

454
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,726
CEO CHOI JANG-MUL, JANGMUL RETAIL

455
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,816
CEO CHOI JANG-MUL, JANGMUL RETAIL

456
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,235
CEO CHOI JANG-MUL, JANGMUL PRODUCTS

457
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,411
He must be the chairman of Jangmul Retail.

458
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,830
Cheol-jung worked there.

459
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,085
A billion won?

460
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,963
THE LATE JANG CHEOL-JUNG

461
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,478
This is the last day
we're mourning for him.

462
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,147
We do not qualify

463
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,192
to shed a teardrop for him
until we find that jerk

464
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,195
and let Cheol-jung go in peace.

465
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,488
Do you understand?

466
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,327
He was a level three.

467
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,835
He even uses psychokinesis.

468
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,880
That means he went up to level three
a while ago.

469
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,593
Why didn't we have any idea
until he got up to level three?

470
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,472
We come across an exceptional one
once in a blue moon.

471
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,932
Can you find his location?

472
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,476
I'm sure you read his mind.

473
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,520
I couldn't.

474
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,855
And you haven't seen
how many souls he captured?

475
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,485
But Cheol-jung definitely got captured,
right?

476
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,574
What happened to Wi-gen?

477
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,327
Oh, Wi-gen.

478
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,123
I heard she found this splendid guy
and dramatically survived.

479
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,166
A splendid guy?

480
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,251
Yes.

481
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,421
It's quite uncanny.

482
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,922
He wasn't even in a coma.

483
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,758
She went into this guy
who was walking around fine in one piece.

484
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,759
What?

485
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,097
Can someone who isn't in a coma
become a counter?

486
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,641
Wi-gen said

487
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,436
that kid was filled with energy.

488
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,355
Once she slipped into his body,

489
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,858
she couldn't even take all the energy
he had in him.

490
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,861
He has anger and passion all piled up.

491
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,737
She said no one will be able to take him

492
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,364
once he blows up.

493
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,580
Mo-tak, try to make something out of him.

494
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,749
We have to catch that jerk
who ate Cheol-jung up.

495
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,753
We need that kid.

496
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,381
Let's make this work.

497
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,187
You're pulling out already?

498
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,398
Why are you asking?

499
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,110
Is this case closed?

500
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,031
It's not your case. Why do you care?

501
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,866
Just go.

502
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,331
Chief, I heard you'd be here

503
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,584
to oversee the scene
of a poor man's death,

504
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,879
so I got a little interested.

505
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,882
What? Did you say you're interested?

506
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,140
That's a lot of evidence

507
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,225
for a supposed suicide.

508
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,644
Are you collecting the evidence

509
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,854
or destroying it?

510
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,278
Why is this brat making up stuff?

511
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,446
Darn it, I'll just…

512
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,698
-I'll beat you up right here.
-Stop that. Calm down.

513
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,991
-Hey.
-Stop it.

514
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,286
You need to get her somewhere.
Go get her married off.

515
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,121
All right, I got it.

516
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,039
Hey.

517
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,999
Stop acting up.

518
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,420
Man, that attention whore.

519
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,548
Why hasn't she been fired?

520
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,426
-Wrap up quickly.
-Yes, sir.

521
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,553
LOVE JUNGJIN, LOVE NATURE

522
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,191
Darn it.

523
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,793
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

524
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,298
THE CITY OF JUNGJIN
IS KILLING MY DAUGHTER!

525
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,562
That man who had been protesting alone.

526
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,689
What was his name again?

527
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,192
Are you talking about
CEO Kwon Jin-seung of Love Jungjin?

528
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,862
Yes, right. I haven't seen him lately.

529
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,115
He took his own life.

530
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,241
Why?

531
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,994
He had been mentally unstable.

532
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,913
He suffered from delusion
and anger management issues.

533
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,957
Goodness.

534
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:48,959
That's too bad.

535
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,586
You don't have to mind him.

536
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,504
I'll make sure everything gets wrapped up

537
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,922
so it doesn't affect our business.

538
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,051
All right.

539
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,770
SAVE JUNGJIN

540
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,064
KEEP OUR CHILDREN HEALTHY

541
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,655
FINAL REPORT ABSTRACT

542
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,575
REPORT BY LOVE JUNGJIN

543
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,744
RADIOACTIVITY LEVEL REPORT
FOR THE CITY OF JUNGJIN

544
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,500
What did the teacher say?

545
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,460
Why did you do that?

546
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,921
-Ung-min.
-Why didn't you go? You made things worse.

547
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,631
Why did you two do that?

548
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,301
Why didn't you tell me?
Ju-yeon, you knew, too, didn't you?

549
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,429
-It's not…
-You'll die if you get on their bad side.

550
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,184
You made them blow up today.
What will you do now?

551
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,019
Would you have walked away?

552
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,563
Could you walk away
if you saw me getting beaten up?

553
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,773
I'd walk away.

554
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,483
I'd walk away 1,000 times over.

555
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,442
Ung-min.

556
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,736
Would it hurt less
if we got beaten together?

557
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,781
That pain from getting beaten up?
It's nothing.

558
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,952
I'm scared.

559
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,790
I'm scared I'll get beaten.

560
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,167
I get frightened

561
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,711
when I get beaten, when I don't…

562
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,298
and even after I get beaten up.

563
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,470
But do you know what's scarier?

564
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,850
I'm scared they'll do what they did to me
to you.

565
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,561
That's what frightens me the most.

566
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,419
How long has it been?

567
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,422
How long have they been doing this to you?

568
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,507
It's been a while.

569
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,348
Wait for me.

570
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,642
No, I want to go home alone today.

571
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,021
What if you run into them
on your way home?

572
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,155
Did you tell the teacher everything?

573
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,991
He said he'll help us make up.

574
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,619
What? "Make up"?

575
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:29,786
He should punish them.

576
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,788
Why would he? Shin Hyeok-u is one of them.

577
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,832
He'd rather transfer me.

578
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,000
He's the mayor's son.

579
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,586
Why does he beat up other kids?
What more does he need?

580
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,591
Do I get beaten up
because I don't need anything?

581
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,267
Look. Hi!

582
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,567
All right.

583
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,196
Little baby, are you scared?

584
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,490
-I'll steal this!
-Hey, nice job.

585
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,325
-Try to take it.
-Stop it.

586
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,369
Hey, take it.

587
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,662
-Give it to me.
-Hey.

588
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,747
Try to take it. Come on.

589
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,749
Give it back.

590
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,460
Hey, gimp. Are you pissed?

591
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,173
Have you gone insane?

592
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,802
I wonder what's in his backpack.

593
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,804
-Don't touch it.
-Darn it.

594
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,599
Hey, stay still.

595
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,601
Come on.

596
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,062
-Stop it!
-Lie down and stay there.

597
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,985
Isn't your life already tough enough?
How dare you mess around.

598
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,988
Hey, what's this?

599
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,033
-Hey, is this yours?
-Don't touch that.

600
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,244
-Give it back!
-Isn't this ancient?

601
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,079
Give it back! Let me go!

602
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,163
It's like an artifact.

603
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,251
-Let me go.
-He's mad.

604
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,671
Give it to me. Give it back!

605
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,589
Give it to me.

606
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,549
Hey.

607
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,681
Don't look at me like that. You'll die.

608
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,058
Why are you going nuts over this?

609
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,269
You make me want to smash it into pieces.

610
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,522
Are you So Mun?

611
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,443
You are So Mun.

612
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,160
Who's this bitch?

613
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,412
Stop swearing.

614
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,664
You need to come with me.

615
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,582
What?

616
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,919
-What is this?
-Get lost.

617
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,797
-Darn it.
-Are you insane?

618
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,762
You crazy brat.

619
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,097
Hey. Who do you think you…

620
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,938
You act like a king at school,

621
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,524
but no one at home
treats you like a human being.

622
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,949
-This is yours, right?
-Yes.

623
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:13,950
Let's go.

624
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,664
-Darn it.
-Hey.

625
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,041
-Get that bitch.
-Ouch.

626
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,001
-Go get that bitch!
-Darn it.

627
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,221
Excuse me.

628
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,722
OWNER-OPERATED TAXI

629
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,225
You're the lady
who works at the noodle place, right?

630
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,643
So what if I am?

631
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,484
Where are you taking me right now?

632
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,820
The other side.

633
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,071
What?

634
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,032
You had a weird dream, right?

635
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,076
A dream?

636
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,206
It felt like a dream, but it didn't,

637
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,833
but then it still felt like a dream.

638
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,589
Are you So Mun?

639
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,174
Yes, I did.

640
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,593
I'm sure you met this silver-haired lady.
She's Wi-gen.

641
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,179
How did you know?

642
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,851
Hey.

643
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,770
That's the other side.

644
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,153
Sir.

645
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,114
I'm not a weirdo.

646
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,032
I'm just joking.

647
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:37,909
-I see.
-Yes.

648
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,580
EONNI'S NOODLES

649
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,713
We're here.

650
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,884
Hello.

651
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,262
What?

652
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,014
He's a high school kid?

653
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,309
I gave him a brief overview
of the afterlife.

654
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,226
What?

655
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,604
Great job.
You finished doing the hard part.

656
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,938
What part?

657
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,857
Hey, take a seat right here.

658
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,197
It must've been quite a journey.

659
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,742
Here, drink this. It must've been tough.

660
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,786
Thank you.

661
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,917
-May I speak casually with you?
-Sure.

662
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,047
Your name is So Mun? That's one of a kind.

663
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,090
Are you sure it's not Moon?

664
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,600
We are…

665
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,062
a group of people
who do business for the afterlife.

666
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,741
"Business for the afterlife"?

667
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,327
Yes, something like the Grim Reaper.

668
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:09,417
Like taking dead people to the other side?

669
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,418
Precisely.

670
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,297
You're going to join our team
and do the same thing.

671
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,340
What?

672
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,301
Spirits that escape from the afterlife
tend to be very strong.

673
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,263
That's why we always train ourselves
like this guy right here…

674
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,392
This is a part of our training.

675
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,687
So, yes, we get trained.

676
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,981
You look awfully wimpy right now…

677
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,276
I mean, a little weak.

678
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,528
But you'll become very powerful
from now on.

679
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,284
We're really going to work with this kid?

680
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,910
Hey, can you do it?

681
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,495
Quiet. Don't scare him.

682
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,664
I'm the one who's scared.

683
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,708
How can we work with him?
He looks so wimpy…

684
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,800
Wait, why does this little punk
seem so familiar?

685
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,806
You.

686
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,726
Do you know me?

687
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,311
No.

688
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,604
Good.

689
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,940
We never knew each other,
so let's keep it that way.

690
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,985
Ga Mo-tak.
Don't you remember what Jang-mul said?

691
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,737
He said we need this kid.

692
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,447
-Why are you asking me…
-Excuse me.

693
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,657
Please don't get into a fight.

694
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,452
I came here because of these.

695
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,704
She said she'll tell me what these are.

696
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,914
Oh, yes.

697
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:33,460
These marks are the door to the afterlife.

698
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,544
What?

699
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,213
Hey.

700
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,179
It's not this hand.

701
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,020
All right, now, Mun.

702
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,481
Go visit the afterlife.

703
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,149
-What?
-Quiet.

704
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,777
Put your hand over your heart.

705
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,446
Close your eyes,

706
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,365
and stay there
for more than three seconds.

707
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,699
No, I'm not here to do…

708
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:05,742
Come on.

709
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,871
It sounds crazy, but give it a try.

710
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,998
You won't lose anything.

711
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,093
If you decide to join us,
I'll fix your leg.

712
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,472
-What?
-Three seconds, you punk.

713
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,765
Three seconds.

714
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,856
One…

715
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,694
two…

716
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,572
three.

717
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:47,993
Are we…

718
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,328
good now?

719
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,220
Do you need a hand?

720
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,820
Is this… the afterlife?

721
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,449
It's a boundary
between the afterlife and your life

722
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,909
called Yung.

723
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,455
It's a place
where the dead and the living can meet up.

724
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,542
It doesn't seem too different
from my world.

725
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,128
Once someone from the world comes to Yung,

726
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,130
that person sees this place

727
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,216
as a place that's hidden
deep inside their subconscious.

728
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,221
It's like a dream.

729
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,975
Then are you a dead person?

730
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,435
Is it uncanny?

731
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,980
Yes, even more so
because you don't seem like a dead person.

732
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,361
Life here isn't too different.

733
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,782
There are good people
and wicked people, too.

734
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,160
However, the only difference is that

735
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,037
the good are rewarded,

736
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,165
but the evil must pay the price
for their wicked deeds.

737
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,168
That's a huge difference.

738
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,506
Let's go somewhere else.

739
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,928
One second.

740
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,973
You said
this is a place where we can meet.

741
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,309
Then, by any chance,

742
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,813
do you think I can see my mom and dad?

743
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,817
They passed away.

744
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,617
I'm sorry, but no.

745
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,535
WONDONG STONER

746
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,710
How did that happen?

747
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,712
CNC MACHINING CENTER

748
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,046
Where are we?

749
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:52,802
Hey.

750
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,272
You heard that it's your job
to catch evil spirits, right?

751
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,108
Yes.

752
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:10,111
There's only one way
for evil spirits to come to this world

753
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,821
and live among people.

754
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,782
They must go into a human
and live off them.

755
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,495
So a person becomes their host?

756
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,455
An evil spirit

757
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,250
can continue to live
as it feeds off the food from its host.

758
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,794
The food from its host?

759
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,967
Murder.

760
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,178
Once the host murders someone,

761
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,888
it preys on the victim's soul.

762
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,059
Which means

763
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,103
they should pick a good host to live in.

764
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,857
They either find someone
who has murdered another

765
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,442
or someone who has

766
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,653
a strong impulse and desire
to kill someone else.

767
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,488
Give it to me.

768
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,406
-Why are you doing this?
-Give it to me.

769
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,784
Evil spirits keep a keen eye out

770
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,953
for ones who are as violent as them.

771
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,079
I just need one look.

772
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,998
Will you please stop doing this?

773
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,336
Hey!

774
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,754
You!

775
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,297
Hey, wait.

776
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,507
No!

777
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,175
-Hey!
-No!

778
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,441
What?

779
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,070
This is a moment in the past
which this land remembers.

780
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,489
It's already history.

781
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,918
It's already history?

782
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,336
Hey!

783
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,227
An evil spirit goes into a human
who's filled with a violent temper

784
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,813
then encourages their desire to kill.

785
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,317
The more the host kills,

786
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,569
the stronger the spirit gets.

787
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,404
In the end,

788
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,282
it takes over the host's body as its own.

789
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:27,040
After that,
it begins to kill others as it wishes.

790
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,467
Do you think…

791
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,595
I can do something like this?

792
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,264
Catching evil spirits?

793
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,560
You need to work for it.

794
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:52,815
We give you great power
that a normal person doesn't have,

795
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,276
but you might die from doing this work,

796
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,112
and you get hurt all the time.

797
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,871
On Sunday, at a place
not far away from where you were,

798
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,457
my partner died.

799
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,128
So I could die while doing this work?

800
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,385
I'm not forcing you to join us.

801
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:26,933
So I have a choice…

802
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:29,686
to turn this down?

803
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,317
You aren't going to do it?

804
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,194
No.

805
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,698
How can you come to such a conclusion?

806
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,409
I get it.

807
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,871
I mean, we got our lives back

808
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,165
because she came to see us
when we were in a coma.

809
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,668
But he doesn't get anything out of this.

810
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,670
-Right.
-Right.

811
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,216
Then why didn't you try
asking for something else?

812
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,676
What did Wi-gen say?

813
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,971
She wants to meet again
after I get a week to think.

814
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,681
She told you to think about it?

815
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,642
Yes, but I can't do this anyway.

816
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,145
Why not?

817
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:14,564
I heard…

818
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,191
I might die while doing this.

819
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,068
You were already as good as dead, so…

820
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:19,986
Oh, right.

821
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,404
You weren't in a coma.

822
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:26,451
Why did Wi-gen go into his body
and make everything complicated?

823
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,245
So why can't you do this?

824
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,711
I can't die before my grandma and grandpa.

825
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,838
Never.

826
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,632
I could never do that to them.

827
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,095
I don't want to give them
that much pain again.

828
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,809
I had fun.

829
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,272
What?

830
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:01,319
Oh, right. What time do I have to be here
to try your noodles?

831
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,324
Is that what you want to know right now?

832
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,118
Yes.

833
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,997
I'll come back next time.

834
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,791
Hey.

835
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,584
You know,

836
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,253
shouldn't we erase his memory?

837
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,964
He knows that this is our hideout,

838
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,592
and he knows who we are, too.

839
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:28,054
You can erase memories?

840
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,972
Hey, Ha-na, wait a second.

841
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,850
You have a week to think about this,

842
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,644
so think it over carefully.

843
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,771
Okay.

844
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,148
I won't tell anyone.

845
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,566
Don't worry.

846
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,734
Okay.

847
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,570
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

848
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,910
EONNI'S NOODLES

849
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,669
What should we do?

850
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,504
That punk.

851
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,298
It's kind of disappointing
to hear him say no.

852
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,511
Is he…

853
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,806
playing hard to get?

854
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,732
Oh, right.

855
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,736
Hey, I'm sorry, Ung-min.

856
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,823
I haven't made the storyboard yet.
Something came up.

857
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,741
Mun…

858
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:32,660
Ung-min.

859
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,204
What's wrong?

860
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,416
Come to the school gym right now!

861
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:42,169
If you report us, we'll beat him
until you won't recognize him tomorrow.

862
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:44,589
So remember that.

863
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,007
Where are you?

864
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,009
Where are you right now?

865
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,678
And bring that brat with you.

866
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,272
Where is he going? Is he going home?

867
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,358
He's on his way to get beaten up again.

868
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,409
Hey.

869
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,706
Man, look at his face.

870
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,625
Did you pee in your pants?

871
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,085
What do you think you're doing?

872
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,213
Why are you here alone?

873
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,507
I told you to bring that brat here!

874
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,593
You really shouldn't be doing this.

875
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,178
Right? You can't do this.

876
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,680
Who is this human ethics textbook?

877
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,848
Mun.

878
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,100
No, what are you doing?

879
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,186
Ung-min has nothing to do with this.

880
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:41,854
So let him go.

881
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,522
Have you gone completely insane?

882
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,985
Let me apologize instead of him.

883
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,405
So let him go.

884
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:53,908
What's Cheon-jung doing?

885
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,786
I apologize on behalf of that woman, too.

886
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:00,039
If you got hurt,
I'll pay your bills for that, too.

887
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,667
I'm so sorry. I apologize.

888
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,297
"Apologize"?

889
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,096
Is that a type of food?

890
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,102
Who was that girl we saw today?

891
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,104
I can't tell you that.

892
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:24,105
You can't?

893
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:25,606
Then don't.

894
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,608
I'll make you spill the truth.

895
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,527
You jerks!

896
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,612
Stop beating Mun!

897
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,824
Mun, who is she?

898
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:38,244
Just tell him!
If you don't, you might die!

899
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,622
You've done enough.

900
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,457
So it's time for you to stop!

901
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:44,959
Cut your damn nonsense.

902
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,460
Where is she right now?

903
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,142
I paid you back in full already.

904
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,316
You son of a bitch.

905
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,597
I'm walking.

906
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,098
You shouldn't be running yet!

907
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,476
He won't listen to us now.

908
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,686
Will you be a counter or not?

909
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,645
On one condition.

910
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,105
You wanted to take me down.

911
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,943
Our physical abilities
are thrice as strong as ordinary people's.

912
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,321
But it can vary
depending on how hard you train.

913
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,280
Mun!

914
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,909
I just spotted one.

915
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,118
-I should go in.
-Wait.

916
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,536
-The kid is…
-Mun.

917
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,580
Is that the evil spirit?

918
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:07,750
