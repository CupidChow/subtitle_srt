00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,390
EPISODE 11

3
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,188
Why are you suddenly
confessing to everything?

4
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,315
A word, please.

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,570
Because I…

6
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,868
had to find you.

7
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,039
-It's Ma Ju-seok!
-That's him?

8
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,415
Ma Ju-seok.

9
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,863
I'm pregnant, so please don't kill me!

10
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,035
-No!
-No!

11
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,620
No!

12
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,756
Congratulations.

13
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,927
You've finally discovered the truth.

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,182
Yes. It was me.

15
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,395
I am responsible for the deaths

16
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,898
of your wife and baby.

17
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:34,404
So all this time, that rage of yours…

18
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,117
should've been directed at me.

19
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,457
Die.

20
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,458
Yes. That's it, Ma Ju-seok.

21
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,255
I will live inside you…

22
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,050
forever.

23
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,279
-We can't wait.
-It disappeared.

24
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,863
-What?
-What disappeared?

25
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,781
His smell?

26
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,411
I swear I smelled
two different evil spirits.

27
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,539
Hwang Pil-gwang…

28
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,126
No. Ma Ju-seok…

29
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,504
Wait. They both disappeared--

30
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,053
This smell…

31
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,432
Jeok-bong, are you okay?

32
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,519
I can't breathe!

33
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,860
Where are you going?

34
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,169
Wait.

35
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,173
Does Ma Ju-seok…

36
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,843
no longer exist now?

37
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,659
Yes, run away.

38
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,079
Run.

39
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,734
Ma Ju-seok killed Hwang Pil-gwang
after all.

40
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,779
That evil spirit.

41
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,282
That bastard provoked Mr. Ma.

42
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,409
Hwang Pil-gwang?

43
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,791
Why did he want Mr. Ma to kill him?

44
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,423
Hwang Pil-gwang didn't die.

45
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,887
He sacrificed his body
to enter Ma Ju-seok's.

46
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,849
He took control of Ma Ju-seok's power.

47
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,851
And what about Ma Ju-seok?

48
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:22,316
Ma Ju-seok's soul has been consumed
by Hwang Pil-gwang's evil spirit.

49
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,864
So he has the body of Ma Ju-seok
but the soul of Hwang Pil-gwang.

50
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,952
-That's what the Yung people call--
-A complete evil spirit.

51
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,415
That's what he has become now.

52
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:44,672
Hold on.
What exactly is a complete evil spirit?

53
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,466
How strong is he exactly?

54
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,092
That smell…

55
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,179
That was…

56
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,265
How do I put it?

57
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,853
The smell was so strong
I couldn't even breathe.

58
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,773
Not only can the evil spirit
use the power of the territory,

59
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,358
but it can also hide itself in it.

60
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,736
Does that mean we can't catch it
with the territory?

61
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,364
What's even more dangerous
is that a complete evil spirit

62
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:16,162
can find the Counters
through the territory.

63
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,206
That means…

64
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,793
they're no longer the ones
who need to avoid the territory.

65
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,961
It's us.

66
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,297
Unless you're fully prepared,

67
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,008
the territory is now dangerous.

68
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,969
If we can't use the territory,
is there another way?

69
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,097
There must be another way to summon it.

70
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,307
Summoning it…

71
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,477
is meaningless now.

72
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,355
What do you mean?

73
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:49,237
For the Yung, there's only one rule
regarding a complete evil spirit.

74
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,908
He should be…

75
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,287
eliminated on sight.

76
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,497
Eliminated?

77
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,420
You want us to kill him? Wi-gen!

78
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,678
Now that a complete evil spirit
has emerged,

79
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,973
things have changed completely.

80
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:24,564
The Yung is not ordering you
to summon the complete evil spirit.

81
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,609
Your order is to eliminate him.

82
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,116
They want you to kill him, not summon him?

83
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,742
Yes.

84
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,162
Oh, dear.

85
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,748
In that case,
forget about Ma Ju-seok for a second.

86
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,668
What about all the souls inside him?

87
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,463
Will they all disappear along with him?

88
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:55,803
I promised Ms. So that I'd save Papa.

89
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,432
Who knew I wouldn't be able
to keep my word?

90
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,937
Ma Ju-seok only killed
Mr. Park and Hwang Pil-gwang.

91
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,774
But the problem is Hwang Pil-gwang.

92
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,320
He took too many innocent lives.

93
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,242
We can't do this.

94
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,787
Our job isn't only
to catch the evil spirits.

95
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,834
It's also to return the trapped,
innocent souls back to Yung.

96
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,377
You're right.

97
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,339
That is our job as well.

98
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,549
But Ma Ju-seok right now…

99
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,676
No.

100
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:41,223
If we fail to stop Hwang Pil-gwang,
there will be more innocent victims.

101
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,059
That's the truth.

102
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,976
I agree.

103
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,022
The hell Hwang Pil-gwang created
has already begun.

104
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,652
Those at the broadcasting station
and many other innocent people

105
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,197
have already become his victims.

106
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,158
Yes, we must stop Hwang Pil-gwang
at all costs.

107
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,078
But maybe there's another way.

108
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,914
We should try our best
to save those souls inside him.

109
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,040
Another way?

110
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,710
Do you really believe that?

111
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,257
Trying to persuade Ma Ju-seok
was our last chance to summon him.

112
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,425
However,

113
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,803
we failed to do that.

114
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,061
It's a pity for all those trapped souls,
but we can't take any more risks.

115
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:27,978
Okay?

116
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,608
Chairman Choi, we need some weapons.

117
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,153
All right.

118
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,827
Are you seriously giving up
on trying to summon him?

119
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,831
Mun! We're not giving up.
This is a choice!

120
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,921
We're at a dead end!

121
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,971
It's also our job
to prepare ourselves for the worst.

122
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,597
So this is it.

123
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,434
This incredible power.

124
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,645
Finally…

125
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,025
this power has met its rightful owner.

126
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,320
All right.

127
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,281
Come at me, Mun.

128
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,534
With these uncanny powers…

129
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,414
I will end your life.

130
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,379
Hello, this is Jungjin Police Station.

131
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,090
No, this is a police station.
We're not a restaurant.

132
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,430
-God, this is driving me crazy.
-Why are you all cranky again?

133
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,390
The caller said he was Ma Ju-seok.

134
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,350
Damn it.

135
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,685
He said he'd turn himself in
if we feed him.

136
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,438
Does everyone think this is a joke?

137
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,901
Many people want to help, like a relative
of one of Mr. Ma's former classmates.

138
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,612
Doesn't that mean
they're pretty much strangers?

139
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,949
Forget it.
Do we have any useful information?

140
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,826
We don't know for sure.

141
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,705
Everyone around the country
is claiming to have seen him.

142
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,040
Don't ignore any report.

143
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,002
Some of them could be risking their lives
to give us information.

144
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,922
-Let's go.
-Sorry?

145
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,383
-Let's verify the reports.
-Right.

146
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,801
Don't overlook any of them.

147
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,263
Don't overlook any of them.

148
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:13,936
Mun.

149
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,154
This is where he was last seen
before going to the broadcasting station.

150
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,241
He was near the hospital where we were.

151
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,911
He was fighting the evil spirit
and wanted to see us.

152
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,791
We could've succeeded
had I moved a bit faster.

153
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,167
What's done is done.

154
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,044
You did your best.

155
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,172
I know how he feels.

156
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,468
When I met my parents in Yung…

157
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,722
Do you really think…

158
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,311
Ma Ju-seok became a complete evil spirit?

159
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:01,317
-What?
-We didn't even know he was swayed.

160
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,571
What if we still don't understand
what's going on with him right now?

161
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,116
What if Hwang Pil-gwang
hasn't completely consumed him yet?

162
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,829
Mun, even the Yung people said
that the evil spirit consumed him--

163
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,497
But they don't know that.

164
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,249
There's no way to know,

165
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,919
unless we see inside his mind.

166
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,880
Don't tell me

167
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,467
that you're thinking about doing that.

168
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,807
We could still have a chance.
I need to check for myself.

169
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,393
I can't give up like this. Please help me.

170
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,311
Mun.

171
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,023
Please.

172
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,657
We need the territory.

173
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,052
He will find you through the territory.

174
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,115
Mr. Ma.

175
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,074
You see,

176
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,161
this wasn't my body of choice.

177
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,581
But I guess I'm content
with the power I've acquired.

178
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,916
It's you.

179
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,337
Hwang Pil-gwang.

180
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,673
Have you finally recognized me?

181
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,497
Mr. Ma!

182
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,418
Mr. Ma, where are you?

183
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,300
Mr. Ma!

184
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,259
Watch out!

185
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,440
How dare you come in here?

186
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,072
Mun, what's wrong?

187
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,532
Are you okay?

188
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,505
Mun, you need to leave!

189
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,348
Right now!

190
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,350
Get out right now, Mun!

191
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,022
Mun.

192
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,442
Are you okay?

193
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,114
It was definitely Mr. Ma.

194
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,867
He warned me and helped me get out
of the evil spirit's mind.

195
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,829
Are you sure it was him who helped you?

196
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,667
You need to be careful, Mun.

197
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,587
You were in serious danger.
You almost died.

198
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,924
You could've been trapped
in there forever.

199
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,342
I'm sure of it.

200
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,512
How could I not recognize his voice?

201
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,099
Now, we have hope.

202
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,600
It won't be easy,

203
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,396
but if Mr. Ma helps us
and fights the evil spirit from within,

204
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,232
then there will be a way
to summon Hwang Pil-gwang.

205
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,900
If it's true…

206
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,990
that the soul of Ma Ju-seok still remains,

207
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:22,619
then it could be possible
to summon the evil spirit.

208
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
However,

209
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:37,467
we'd be taking a huge risk
for such a small possibility.

210
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,054
Therefore,

211
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,682
Yung's previous decision

212
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,059
still stands.

213
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,523
Ma Ju-seok has to be eliminated.

214
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,734
Wi-gen.

215
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,373
None of the reports were useful.

216
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,796
Do you really think
that Ma Ju-seok became a monster?

217
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,091
I felt bad when I saw him.

218
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:23,305
Maybe he wouldn't have become so resentful
had we caught those scammers sooner.

219
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,766
I know that I shouldn't say this
as a detective,

220
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,809
but having a fiancée myself,

221
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,982
I can understand the rage and pain
he must've felt to become like that.

222
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:41,323
But the idea of facing him again
frightens me a bit to be honest.

223
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,701
Me too.

224
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,288
I'm also…

225
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,460
scared and regretful.

226
00:20:55,712 --> 00:21:01,134
But don't you think he's the one
who regrets this situation the most?

227
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,766
The Ma Ju-seok I know
probably wants someone

228
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,061
to stop the monster he has become.

229
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,110
When is it?

230
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,905
-Sorry?
-Where's my invitation to your wedding?

231
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,827
I know things are hectic now,
but you still have time to invite me.

232
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,537
How did you know?

233
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,580
How? Everyone is bogged down with work,

234
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:35,627
but you keep opening and closing
your desk drawer. Surely everyone noticed.

235
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,212
You just didn't realize.

236
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,007
I actually wanted you
to be the first to get one,

237
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,217
-so I brought it.
-Give it to me already.

238
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,553
-But you're driving.
-Let me see it.

239
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,305
WITH THEIR FAMILY
KANG HAN-UL, KIM YUN-JI

240
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,182
-It looks nice.
-Right?

241
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,231
The next report
came from somewhere nearby.

242
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,953
Is this it?

243
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,371
Yes.

244
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,876
Isn't this
Baekdu Planning & Construction's office?

245
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,964
BAEKDU PLANNING & CONSTRUCTION

246
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,091
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

247
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,558
-Han-ul.
-Yes, sir.

248
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,021
Call for backup and wait outside.

249
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,481
Sorry?

250
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,318
Wait outside, okay?

251
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,402
Yes, sir.

252
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,095
Mo-tak.

253
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,935
What are you doing here?
I told you to wait outside.

254
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,106
There's a dead body.

255
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,114
There's a dead body over there.

256
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,076
What are you talking about?

257
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,287
Damn it. We have no time to joke around.

258
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,913
What's wrong with you?

259
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,332
-There's a dead body.
-No!

260
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,546
What's the matter with you?

261
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,755
Snap out of it!

262
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,931
What a shame.

263
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,601
It was so close.

264
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,935
You're pretty quick.

265
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,604
Run!

266
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,149
Mo-tak!

267
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,740
What took you so long?

268
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,535
I'm sure a lot of people
reported seeing me.

269
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,120
Ma Ju-seok.

270
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,413
Damn it!

271
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,294
You think I'm Ma Ju-seok too?

272
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,674
This is starting to hurt my feelings.
I even changed my look.

273
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,303
Is no one happy to see me?

274
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:40,121
You look so miserable with that gun.

275
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,503
Mo-tak.

276
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,213
What's going on?

277
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,801
Die.

278
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,719
You evil spirit!

279
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,531
What?

280
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,949
Damn it.

281
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,702
This is no fun.

282
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,581
I'm sure I'll have more fun
with Mun, right?

283
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,419
Our previous encounter was too short.

284
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,384
All right.

285
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,805
Then let me find out

286
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,726
where you vermin are hiding.

287
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,477
No.

288
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:52,569
I won't tell anything to an evil spirit.

289
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,695
Is that so?

290
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,294
Gi-ran…

291
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,088
Do forgive me.

292
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:21,973
No!

293
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,020
Han-ul!

294
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,648
Han-ul!

295
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,698
No! Han-ul!

296
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,050
No, Mo-tak.

297
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,968
You need to stop.

298
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,305
You'll expose the Counters
and let the evil spirit grow stronger.

299
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,183
There will be more victims!

300
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,311
It's too late.

301
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,481
You need to get out of there
and save yourself.

302
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,944
Hurry, Mo-tak!

303
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,115
Ga Mo-tak!

304
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,650
What did you do?

305
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,026
What--

306
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,827
-Mo-tak!
-Mo-tak!

307
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,745
Mo-tak!

308
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,205
Mo-tak.

309
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,722
Mo-tak, are you okay?

310
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,682
What are you doing?

311
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,184
What happened?

312
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,272
I ran into Ma Ju-seok.

313
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,024
You ran into him?

314
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,026
Let me treat you first, okay?

315
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,447
-Mo-tak.
-No, Mo-tak.

316
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,783
Move, Mun.

317
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,034
Why are you doing this?

318
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,368
I said move!

319
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,248
Don't do this. We still have a chance.

320
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,339
A chance?

321
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:03,301
I definitely heard him today.
Mr. Ma's conscience was still inside him.

322
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,220
It was definitely his voice.

323
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,892
He saved me from Hwang Pil-gwang,
so we still have a chance.

324
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,102
We can summon him and save everyone.

325
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,564
You might've gotten out of there
because Mr. Ma helped you.

326
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,857
That's enough!

327
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,237
Please, just stop!

328
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,699
Are you still determined to save him?

329
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,159
Are you?

330
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,832
Do you know what that evil spirit
has done, you bastard?

331
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,293
We must save him.
Why are you giving up when there's a way?

332
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,713
We can summon him and save everyone!

333
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,340
How can we give up on him?

334
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,051
That's enough, Mun!
What's the matter with you two?

335
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,803
Why are you fighting?

336
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,013
Fight the evil spirits, not each other!

337
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,598
Han-ul!

338
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,561
Han-ul…

339
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,439
died.

340
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:00,900
What?

341
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,777
That scumbag…

342
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,947
killed…

343
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,158
Han-ul.

344
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,661
He…

345
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:17,250
He didn't even hesitate.
He killed Han-ul as if he was nothing.

346
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,793
He just…

347
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,170
He just killed him.

348
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:23,840
But…

349
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,800
what did you say?

350
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,762
We still have what?

351
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,391
What more can we do?

352
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,649
Why can't you give up? Why?

353
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,905
How many more deaths do you need,
God damn it!

354
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,040
Now…

355
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,584
I'll do it my way.

356
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,753
I will…

357
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,092
I will kill him.

358
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,558
Mo-tak.

359
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,018
Mo-tak!

360
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,439
Mo-tak!

361
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,109
KANG HAN-UL, KIM YUN-JI

362
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,329
What are you doing? Why are you here?

363
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,916
Let's go. You can't catch him alone.

364
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,922
He's gone. This place is empty.

365
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,926
Where could he be?

366
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,556
Han-ul's body disappeared.

367
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,729
JANGMUL NURSING HOME

368
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,167
I need to ask you something.

369
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,589
Is my son…

370
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,802
dead?

371
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,345
Sorry?

372
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,182
Why would you ask me that?

373
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,437
They removed all the TVs here.
There are no newspapers either.

374
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,858
They said it was Chairman Choi's orders.

375
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,739
So I was wondering
if it was because of me.

376
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,120
I was wondering
if something happened to Ju-seok.

377
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,290
No, it's not like that.

378
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,629
But perhaps,

379
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,966
that's all for the best.

380
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,388
I shouldn't say this as his mother…

381
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,185
but I wish Ju-seok…

382
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,732
could meet Min-ji in heaven and be happy.

383
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,986
I can take responsibility

384
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,490
for all his wrongdoings.

385
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,994
If only that were possible…

386
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,120
Ma'am.

387
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,462
If he dies,

388
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,925
please come and tell me yourself.

389
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:24,557
That way, at least I'd feel a bit better.

390
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,296
I promise to repay you.

391
00:36:55,379 --> 00:37:00,092
I will protect you no matter what.

392
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,220
I'm going to be a father soon.

393
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,055
-Oh, my God! That's amazing!
-Hey.

394
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,307
Ms. Lee is pregnant!

395
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,476
-Oh, my goodness!
-He's going to be a dad!

396
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,190
Mun, you shouldn't have let him go…

397
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,483
Mun!

398
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,403
…like that today.

399
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,240
Let's not give up.

400
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,575
I won't give up…

401
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,578
on you either.

402
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,623
How many more deaths do you need,
God damn it!

403
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,509
I will kill him.

404
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,424
This is pointless if you ask me.

405
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,886
Even if he steps into our territory,
it'll be hard to catch him.

406
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,514
He knows the territory better than we do.

407
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,349
That's why I have a plan.

408
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,644
What if we enter the territory first?

409
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,564
We can wait there and lure him in,
just like he did to us.

410
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,150
Once he sets his foot inside…

411
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,819
I'm against killing him.

412
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,615
We should summon him.

413
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:52,121
Who can summon complete evil spirits
if not us?

414
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:59,295
Evil spirits will keep getting stronger.
We can't kill them every time.

415
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,258
We need to succeed
for Yung to change their rules.

416
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,176
Then…

417
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,930
why did you come with me?

418
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,310
I would've done that
with anyone who left the way you did.

419
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,479
What?

420
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,399
No one should be alone.

421
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,195
Whether it's Mun when he was in a coma

422
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,906
or you who left our hideout like that.

423
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,036
I don't want any of you to be alone.

424
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,957
You said we were family.

425
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,794
I guess only I took that seriously.

426
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,930
Ga Mo-tak speaking.

427
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,808
Where?

428
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,731
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

429
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,235
His name is Kang Han-ul.

430
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,028
He…

431
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,448
A man in his twenties
found unconscious in Jungjin-dong.

432
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,789
Han-ul.

433
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,798
Mo-tak.

434
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,471
Han-ul.

435
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,142
Han-ul.

436
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,194
-There's a dead body…
-No!

437
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,197
Han-ul!

438
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,449
Han-ul!

439
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,331
You need to live.

440
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,459
You can.

441
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:15,473
Hang in there a bit longer.

442
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,652
This can't be.

443
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,697
Mun was right.

444
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,240
That was Ma Ju-seok.

445
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,202
He saved him.

446
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,762
Add a bit of this.

447
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,186
Are Mo-tak and Ha-na really coming back?

448
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,691
I'm telling you.

449
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,362
Ha-na secretly told me so a while ago.

450
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,074
Jeok-bong, call Ha-na.
I need to cook the noodles on time.

451
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,660
Mo-tak hates soggy noodles.

452
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,371
-That rascal.
-All right.

453
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:26,043
You're a complete evil spirit?
You're dead meat.

454
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,171
Darn it.

455
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,217
Ha-na, where--

456
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,689
-Jeok-bong, what's wrong?
-Jeok-bong!

457
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,901
Jeok-bong, what's wrong?

458
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,408
Jeok-bong!

459
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,704
This smell…

460
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,208
This smell… It's Ma Ju-seok.

461
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,502
Ma Ju-seok?

462
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,838
He's around here?

463
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,632
No.

464
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,801
Not there.

465
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,470
Here!

466
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,143
Mun.

467
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:27,605
-Ma Ju-seok is at our hideout.
-What do you mean?

468
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,649
Ms. Chu, Jeok-bong,
and Chairman Choi are in danger.

469
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,985
Understood. I'm on my way.

470
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,652
Are you all hiding?

471
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,534
Hang in there a bit longer.

472
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,756
What are you doing?

473
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,301
What are you doing, Ma Ju-seok?

474
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:52,940
Are you seriously doing this
just to save that worthless human?

475
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,447
Go.

476
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:06,078
No. Don't let him go, Ma Ju-seok!

477
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,168
How am I supposed to take this?

478
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,549
Leave.

479
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,010
I said get out.

480
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,013
Get out of my body.

481
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,684
Leave!

482
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,396
All you can do is shout.

483
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,529
But this is what…

484
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,699
I can do.

485
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:45,951
No.

486
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,205
Sadly,

487
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:55,169
your merciful god is dead.

488
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:05,637
No!

489
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,061
Poor you.

490
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,190
You can never escape.

491
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,785
Let's see where you guys are hiding.

492
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,584
I see. That's where you've been hiding.

493
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,597
You already knew…

494
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,184
where Mun was.

495
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,853
Right?

496
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,234
In that case,

497
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,070
you're dead if I find you.

498
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,123
Come out, come out

499
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,710
Wherever you are

500
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,185
We can't do this.

501
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:39,773
At this rate, he'll consume us all.

502
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,526
We should wait until Mun comes--

503
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,736
We can't wait for him.

504
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,240
Forget about me.

505
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:53,328
He'll grow even stronger
if he consumes your powers.

506
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:57,541
And that means Mun will have to deal
with an even stronger evil spirit.

507
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,920
Since things have come to this,
let's just…

508
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,132
take care of this ourselves.

509
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,800
How?

510
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,529
Jeok-bong.

511
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,572
Yes?

512
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,743
There's a pillar marked A3
in that storage room.

513
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,037
There is an air vent at the base of it.

514
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:21,124
Move the hatch to the side
and you'll see an LED board.

515
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,462
That is a self-destruct mechanism.

516
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,131
-What?
-Don't be alarmed and listen carefully.

517
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,510
Place your hand on it.

518
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:37,057
Then a drawer will pop out
and you'll see a red button.

519
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,725
When did you build that?

520
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,187
I built it just in case we needed it,
like we do now.

521
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,774
Only Mun and I know about it.

522
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:49,277
This entire place will be destroyed
once that goes off.

523
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,863
Nothing will survive that.

524
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:57,244
While I distract Ma Ju-seok,
you go and press that red button.

525
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,081
Before the firewall comes down,
take Ms. Chu with you

526
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,626
and get out of here.

527
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,963
What are you saying? What about you?

528
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,801
This is the least I can do
as the eldest, don't you think?

529
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:15,887
Jang-mul.

530
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,075
Ma Ju-seok!

531
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,745
I caught one.

532
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,757
Jeok-bong, make sure
you take Ms. Chu with you!

533
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,846
Two.

534
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,567
What are you doing?

535
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,446
Why can't you guys just stay still?

536
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,950
I'm not even after any of you.

537
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:11,920
Let him go.

538
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:15,131
I'm the one you want, so let him go.

539
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,933
-Mun.
-Mun…

540
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,687
You're finally here.

541
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,899
You don't belong here. And that body
doesn't belong to you either.

542
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,818
I was expecting to find the territory.

543
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,361
Where could it be?

544
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:40,991
I see.

545
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,661
Are you not summoning it
in case I grow stronger?

546
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,873
There's no territory for you, you bastard!

547
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,637
You're wrong.

548
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,182
Your territory, this body,

549
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:10,979
and even your power belong to me now.

550
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,607
Mun!

551
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:10,080
You annoying little pests.

552
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,852
No!

553
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,744
Mun.

554
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:54,332
There's no way to beat him right now.
Take everyone and get out of there!

555
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,042
You're right.

556
00:54:56,626 --> 00:55:00,672
Maybe there's no way to beat him.

557
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:05,719
That's why I can't let him survive.

558
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,899
-Ms. Chu!
-Now's the time! Hurry and get out!

559
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,573
Chairman Choi!

560
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,534
Hurry and run!

561
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,499
Ms. Chu!

562
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,252
Ms. Chu!

563
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,175
Ms. Chu.

564
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:49,054
-Ms. Chu!
-Ms. Chu!

565
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,430
Get in Ms. Chu!

566
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,474
-Mun!
-Mun!

567
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,975
No, Mun!

568
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,397
What? Mun!

569
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,774
-Mun!
-Mun!

570
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,650
-Mun!
-What are you doing?

571
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,196
I'll end this fight.

572
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,617
Thank you for everything.

573
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,911
No, you can't do it alone.

574
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,496
Mun!

575
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,456
No!

576
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,373
No!

577
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,168
No!

578
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,134
You want to kill us both?

579
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:34,974
That's enough time to kill you,
consume your power and get out of here.

580
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,203
This is the end…

581
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,541
for both of us.

582
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,583
You're wrong.

583
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,377
This is the end for you

584
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,255
and the beginning for me.

585
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,295
Mun!

586
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,926
How dare you set foot in here?

587
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,809
Mun, are you okay?

588
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,270
Mun!

589
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,148
Mun, you were right.

590
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,317
Inside that evil spirit,

591
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,989
Ma Ju-seok is still alive.

592
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,784
Mun, change of plans.

593
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,411
We're not killing him.

594
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,246
We're summoning him.

595
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,335
Everyone,

596
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,920
we have four minutes left.

597
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,009
That's enough, right?

598
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,767
Of course.

599
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:52,987
It's enough.

600
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,187
Because from the start…

601
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,361
I never once…

602
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,578
gave up on him.

603
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:25,121
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

604
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,748
Because from the start…

605
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,542
I never once gave up on him.

606
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,922
You think you can handle it?

607
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,925
-Go into Ma Ju-seok's mind!
-I can't!

608
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,969
Do you think we can't keep you safe?

609
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,348
We'll try to buy as much time as possible!

610
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,435
You can die together.

611
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,604
Please, Mr. Ma.

612
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,397
Please help me.

613
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,651
I will never give up on you.

614
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,158
