1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,727
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,978
AND OCCUPATION ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,525
Eat up.

4
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,113
Unwrap the hamburgers for them.

5
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,574
Man, that looks good. Eat up.

6
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,743
Eat up.

7
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,790
Isn't it good? Hey.

8
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,001
Remember the guy who came
with a pretty girl and a kid?

9
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,170
Tell me where he lives.
I'll get you anything.

10
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,088
I don't know.

11
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,424
-I've never seen him before.
-Darn it!

12
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,302
Why would total strangers help you?

13
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,555
Dan-o…

14
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,850
Dan-bi, it's all right. It's okay.

15
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,061
Girls, do you live there alone?

16
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,562
You don't have a mom or a dad?

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,023
We have a dad.

18
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,442
Why aren't you with him?

19
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,071
Dan-bi, don't say anything.
Don't tell them anything.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,198
Do you want some real trouble?

21
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,660
It looks like…

22
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,914
your sister has no idea how scary I am.

23
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,135
Do you remember anything now?

24
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,390
He goes to my school.

25
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,692
Gosh, you fool.

26
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,152
Why do you trust me?

27
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,946
You do everything I tell you to do.

28
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,990
Drink up.

29
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,043
-Father.
-Don't turn around, you punk!

30
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,021
Father.

31
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,189
Were you trying to kill me?

32
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,859
Cheong-sin.

33
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,737
Kill me if you can.

34
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,948
What are you waiting for?

35
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,919
Cheong-sin.

36
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,422
Don't kill me…

37
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,424
Cheong-sin…

38
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,926
Don't kill me.

39
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,844
Don't kill me!

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,409
86S6260

41
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,636
It's that guy. He killed Cheol-jung.

42
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,346
It's him.

43
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,658
You're that bitch.

44
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,538
There's no way he can see me.

45
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,206
It's you.

46
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,799
Mun, we have to get out of here.

47
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,093
This bastard is…

48
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,678
I'll remember your face

49
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,972
so I can find you

50
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,726
and tear you to shreds, bitch.

51
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,407
You son of a bitch!

52
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,036
Mun, no!

53
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,583
Mun, don't do that!

54
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,547
You must be that kid.

55
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,676
-Mun!
-You!

56
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,503
Do you want to go grab
some pork belly and soju?

57
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,255
Hey. It's not over yet.

58
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,511
Mun, you have to come back.

59
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,595
You have to come back!

60
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,222
Darn it.

61
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,232
Darn it.

62
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,274
We have to go!

63
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,527
Mun, no.

64
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,570
Come on out!

65
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,495
Let's go back in, Ha-na.

66
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,622
I had him. I can catch him!

67
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,706
He's a level three.

68
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,251
You would've died if you fought him.

69
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,254
-I can risk my life if I can catch him.
-Lower your voice.

70
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,881
Your grandparents.

71
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,801
You can "risk your life"?

72
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,784
He called him Sin, right?

73
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,287
I heard the other asshole say, "Sin."

74
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,914
That's what he called him.

75
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,251
I'll make them regret…

76
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,672
that they let me live.

77
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,679
-Are we at the right place?
-Yes, this is it.

78
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,764
Boss.

79
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,559
They're here.

80
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,685
-Those kids?
-Yes.

81
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,020
-Go after them.
-Yes, Boss.

82
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,230
Where are Ms. Chu and Mo-tak?

83
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,523
At the restaurant.

84
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,412
You can't even drink.

85
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,206
Stop it.

86
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,584
That little kid had such a rough life.

87
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,129
He only found out recently
that his parents' death

88
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,422
wasn't just an accident.

89
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,176
Do you want some kimchi?

90
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,560
Mun.

91
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,605
An evil spirit has his parents.

92
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,901
How did you two find out?

93
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,529
We went into his past and saw it.

94
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,489
It's the guy who killed Cheol-jung.

95
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,657
What?

96
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,741
Are you sure?

97
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,202
Yes. It was a contract killing.

98
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,287
The target was his dad.

99
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,959
Wait, then what does this mean?

100
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,629
The evil spirit who has Cheol-jung
is also holding on to Mun's parents.

101
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,381
I know what it means.

102
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,138
You went in there and saw that?

103
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,141
You saw your parents as they passed away?

104
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,102
My goodness.

105
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,687
Goodness, you poor thing.

106
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,655
Mun.

107
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,574
Let's catch him.

108
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,702
Let's make sure we catch him.

109
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,246
It's for the better.

110
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,582
I know who did it now.

111
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,919
Are you two done with each other?

112
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,173
Mun, we should talk.
You must have a lot of questions.

113
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,061
You asked why I suddenly began
to look into my past.

114
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,191
It's because of you.

115
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,610
RECENTS

116
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,069
SO GWON

117
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,154
Because of your dad.

118
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,282
Were you

119
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,827
investigating the Kim Yeong-nim case
with him?

120
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,121
Were you two close?

121
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,082
I don't remember,

122
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,794
but the last person I called wasn't my mom

123
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,380
or my girlfriend.

124
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,965
It was your dad.

125
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,052
So I'm sure we weren't strangers.

126
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,139
RECENTS: SO GWON

127
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,017
I called this number,

128
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,060
and you picked up.

129
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,270
I've been using his number.

130
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,105
Sad news for your mom.

131
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,401
I had to let my grandma use her number.

132
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,569
You little punk.

133
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,574
I remember when you first walked
into the restaurant.

134
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,825
Hello.

135
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,871
What? He's a high school kid?

136
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,500
Wait, why does this little punk
seem so familiar?

137
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,089
You. Do you know me?

138
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,466
I knew you looked familiar.

139
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,264
I look a lot like my dad.

140
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,391
Do you?

141
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,063
Mo-tak.

142
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,651
My dad said

143
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,404
he'd see this to the end.

144
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,407
"To the end"?

145
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,742
Right before the accident,

146
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,495
an election update came on the radio.

147
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,705
Shin Myeong-hwi
won the election for mayor…

148
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,584
He turned it off when he heard
Shin Myeong-hwi was elected.

149
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,795
I'm…

150
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,631
going to see this to the end.

151
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,758
That's what my dad said.

152
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,386
Even though Shin had been elected…

153
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,264
he would keep going?

154
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,308
Yes, that's what I heard.

155
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
That cleared something up.

156
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:16,026
Jeong-yeong found something
while she was investigating another case.

157
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,156
Kim Yeong-nim was a part
of Shin Myeong-hwi's camp.

158
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,407
SHIN MYEONG HWI

159
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,242
And Kim Yeong-nim went missing

160
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,244
while the campaign was still ongoing.

161
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,496
SHIN MYEONG HWI

162
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,914
A NEW JUNGJIN FOR EVEYRONE

163
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,374
WE'LL BRING CHANGE WITH YOU!

164
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,209
An election is like a war.

165
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,920
If she was killed by an insider,
they would've lost.

166
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,215
The race was very close,
and he won by a few hundred votes.

167
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,468
When your dad and I

168
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,345
began to go after Kim Yeong-nim,

169
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,055
he probably got scared.

170
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,143
So he told Noh Hang-gyu to kill her?

171
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,104
But, you know,

172
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,482
I don't think what happened

173
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,485
seven years ago is over yet.

174
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,611
What do you mean?

175
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,905
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

176
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,031
This guy right here.

177
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,908
He was recently murdered.

178
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,702
Who is this?

179
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,914
The president of Shin's campaign club
for his first and second terms.

180
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,373
Jeon Gi-hwan.

181
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,708
Campaign club president?

182
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,460
JUNGJIN'S CHOICE, SHIN MYEONG-HWI

183
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,879
And the one who killed him is the same guy

184
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,007
we tracked down in Suil-dong
by using his foot tracks.

185
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,384
"Foot tracks"? Like footprints?

186
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,265
An evil spirit?

187
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,934
The suspect is an evil spirit?

188
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,396
-The evil spirit?
-Yes.

189
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,941
Does that mean it was him?

190
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,111
Why didn't you say you were here?

191
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,448
Don't leave us out
from something that important.

192
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,242
We have to catch him ASAP.

193
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,832
Man, that one found one amazing host.

194
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,502
A contract killer?

195
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,303
Are you on your way
to see Detective Jeong-yeong?

196
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,973
Why?

197
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,141
Are you going to follow me?

198
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,519
May I?

199
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,021
Bring my shirt, punk.

200
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,191
I couldn't imagine anything like this

201
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,986
back when I drew the composite.

202
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,658
You aren't alone.

203
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,660
You're with us.

204
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,915
I won't forget.

205
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,504
Man, you little punk.

206
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,673
Come here.

207
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,013
-See you tomorrow.
-Hey.

208
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,014
You killed my love!

209
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,098
Stop right there!

210
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,226
Get home safely.

211
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,029
This isn't possible.

212
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,948
I told you. Ga Mo-tak is alive.
Man, it's unbelievable.

213
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,872
Hey, follow him.

214
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,749
Follow him.

215
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,468

218
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,526
Hey, Mo-tak.

219
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,154
Jeong-yeong?

220
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,991
Why is she here?

221
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,967
Thanks to you, I got the suspect's face.

222
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,468
You did?

223
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,097
So how did you find his location?

224
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,848
That was pretty far from Suil-dong.

225
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,231

SENDING PHOTO

227
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,068
By any chance, does he look like this?

228
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,948
MO-TAK

229
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,630
KIM JEONG-YEONG

230
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,427
It's him, that bastard.

231
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,722
Let's meet.

232
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,732
So Gwon, Ha Mun-yeong,
Chairman Jeon Gi-hwan,

233
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,525
and the one who was killed
on September 12th,

234
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,819
CEO Kwon Jin-seung.

235
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,290
So it was done by the same person,
a contract killer?

236
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,042
I mean,

237
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,129
I'm sure they found his traces
at the scene of Kwon Jin-seung's death.

238
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,131
Why can't you connect it to Jeon's case?

239
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,341
They're connected in a way.

240
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,554
The chief has been doing his best
to cover up those cases.

241
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,100
Su-ryong is the chief, right?

242
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,356
Forget it.

243
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,942
I don't want to know.

244
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,695
For now,

245
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,406
let's find this jerk first.

246
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:01,538
I'll take another look at these cases.
We might find another lead.

247
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,793
I'll call you.

248
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,857
You must be that kid.

249
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:46,959
You suddenly disappeared for a moment.
Where were you?

250
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,043
I disappeared?

251
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,754
Yes, you disappeared with him.

252
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,881
And you had that wound when you came back.

253
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,472
Another place.

254
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,016
Where could it be?

255
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,444
It was daytime.

256
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,446
The accident broke out at night,

257
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,865
but it was broad daylight.

258
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,450
It's where he was.

259
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,202
I heard loud machines.

260
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,039
BAEKJO MOTORS

261
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,920
A junkyard.

262
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,463
It was a junkyard.

263
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,215
EONNI'S NOODLES

264
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,884
I located him.

265
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,219
Baekjo Motors?

266
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,304
I'll head there now.

267
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,310
A junkyard.

268
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,853
How did I miss that?

269
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,452
Relax.

270
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,455
You get muscle cramps if you get nervous.

271
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,751
He might get you
if you run amok by yourself.

272
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,462
That asshole is awfully strong.

273
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,049
I've fought him, so I know that already.

274
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,133
Don't get hurt.

275
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,843
Just don't get hurt.

276
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,411
Who are they?

277
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,414
Just to be safe, stay right behind me.

278
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,591
Let me know if anything's weird.

279
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,161
The asshole left already.

280
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,080
What?

281
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,135
You're doing a search without a warrant?

282
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,264
We need to find out
who he is and where he went.

283
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,976
You can leave if you're worried.
We'll manage.

284
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,603
Where are these people from?

285
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,230
A noodle house.

286
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,441
What?

287
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,110
Didn't I tell you
that I run a noodle house?

288
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,865
She's in charge of the kitchen,

289
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,034
she's the chief server,

290
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,911
and that kid in there is So Mun.

292
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,501
So Mun?

293
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,379
So Gwon and Ha Mun-yeong's son.

294
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,508
Mun seemed to remember you.

295
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,761
He's that kid?

296
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,889
No one's more disappointed

297
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,767
that we lost the guy than Mun.

299
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,115
Aren't these illegal plates?

300
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,619
He'll switch license plates on the run.

301
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,456
It's a list of scrapped license plates.

302
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,166
It has logs from today.

303
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,876
FREIGHT CAR, SEIZED

304
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,712
Mo-tak.

305
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,764
He won't pick up.

308
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,733
Ji Cheong-sin.

309
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,318
That's his name.

310
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,741
It can't be used as evidence
once your fingerprints get on it.

311
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,582
The doctor said it wouldn't be easy.

312
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,209
Your leg got better.

313
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,919
I'm glad.

314
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,610
That bastard killed another person.

315
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,796
It's time for you to leave.

316
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,340
This is now a murder scene.

317
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,054
Hello? This is Kim Jeong-yeong.

318
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,308
I need you to come to Baekjo Motors now.

319
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,732
What's going on?

320
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,448
There's the chief!

321
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,285
Why are there reporters?

322
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,495
Is this really a serial murder case?

323
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,831
The suspect is named Ji Cheong-sin.
What's he like?

324
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,168
Is it true that the body belongs
to the junkyard's CEO, Bae Sang-pil?

325
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,003
-Chief, just one word.
-Chief!

326
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,046
Is it Bae Sang-pil?

327
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,589
You idiot.

328
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,924
Do you think it was Ji?

329
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,300
-Just one word, please.
-Chief.

330
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,094
Can we get a comment?

331
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,350
-Show us!
-Chief!

332
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,602
Show us the body!

333
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,524
Chief, you have no choice.

334
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,861
You need to get Ji Cheong-sin
on the wanted list.

335
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,530
You punk.

336
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,907
We need you to cooperate.

337
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,492
-Look here!
-Chief!

338
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,285
-Any comments?
-Look here!

339
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,411
Move back.

340
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,298
APPROVAL RATING

341
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,435
The election
was already against our favor,

342
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,647
and then Park Sang-hun had to go
and duck out after the scandal.

343
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,649
It's troubling.

344
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,611
You became the representative
during a tough time.

345
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,616
Mayor Shin, why don't you take the lead?

346
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,288
Join the race as a player
for the presidential election.

347
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,377
Let's bring about a new sensation.

348
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,214
Will you give me your support?

349
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,426
You're the most loved local politician.

350
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,012
The citizens are behind you.
Our people are waiting.

351
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,181
I do pretty good work in office.

352
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,726
I like how outspoken you are.

353
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,106
-Here.
-Yes, sir.

354
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,155
Anyway, Mayor Shin.

355
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,198
I heard something inconvenient

356
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,576
regarding your personal affairs.

357
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,787
I'm aware of the trouble
surrounding the redevelopment.

358
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,207
You know these rumors
always follow politicians who stand out.

359
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,044
The first and second were too successful.

360
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,421
You need to distance yourself
from Taesin Group.

361
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,674
If you serve too long locally,

362
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,011
you'll unknowingly catch these
development companies right behind you.

363
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,016
Please excuse me.

364
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,436
CHIEF CHOI SU-RYONG

365
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,229
Mr. Bae Sang-pil died.

366
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,648
Ji Cheong-sin will be
on the wanted list very soon.

367
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,984
I'll fill you in on the details in person.

368
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,696
I'll remember that.

369
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,918
72R6542

370
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,549
Hey, who are you?

371
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,016
92R7089

372
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,949
SONGJU POLICE STATION

373
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,912
WRITTEN STATEMENT

374
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,038
NAME: SONG MAN-HO

375
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,331
SONGJU POLICE STATION

376
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,291
Tell them to bring the evidence.

377
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,962
I never went to use the restroom.

378
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,382
And I have no idea who this…

379
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,842
HAN SEUNG-WOO

380
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,844
…Han Seung-woo is.

381
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,596
How can I know
every single employee by name?

382
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,598
Mr. Song, allow me to do the talking.

383
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,226
He keeps saying I killed him!

384
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,563
Darn it.

385
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,857
My life is about to end

386
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,275
for hiring the wrong guy.

387
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,569
Mr. Song, please calm down.

388
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,238
Please talk to me, his attorney.

389
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,616
-Come again.
-Sure.

390
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,535
CEO Song Man-ho
of Dajeong Construction Firm

391
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,289
was cleared as a suspect
for murdering an employee and released.

392
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,498
Song Man-ho?

393
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,293
-He's coming out.
-There he is!

394
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,087
Are you innocent?

395
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,464
-No need to answer.
-Why kill him?

396
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,465
Say something.

397
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,799
-Let's go.
-Please say something.

398
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,759
Stop it.

399
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,886
Were you really not involved
in Han's death?

400
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,888
I did not kill him!

401
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,681
It's so unfair.

402
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,018
Shouldn't I be compensated for the drop
in our stock prices?

403
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,770
I am innocent.

404
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,064
I do not have anything on my conscience.

405
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,816
Bring my son back!

406
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,276
-Are you okay?
-Bring him back!

407
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,778
Bring Seung-woo back!

408
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,821
-You're bleeding.
-Bring him back!

409
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,032
-You threw a rock? How dare you!
-Sir!

410
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,992
-Sir!
-Let me go. Let go of me!

411
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,702
Let me go! I'm going to sue him!

412
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,205
Songju Police Station had him detained,

413
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,958
but they could not find the weapon
within the allotted 48 hours.

414
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,461
-You jerk!
-Let me go!

415
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,588
How dare you throw a rock at me?

416
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,549
-Seung-woo…
-You jerk!

417
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,137
Hey, kid.

418
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,890
Your dad failed to run a business.

419
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,933
CEO SONG MAN-HO

420
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,769
Uncle Man-ho didn't steal
your dad's business.

421
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,439
I'm not here because of that.

422
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,690
Then why are you here?

423
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,736
To borrow money for living expenses.

424
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,200
Please help our family.

425
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,207
Goodness, kid!

426
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,125
You're here to borrow money.

427
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,461
Why would I give you anything
if you stand there

428
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,671
like you're a creditor?

429
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,340
How much?

430
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,175
How much do you need?

431
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,723
Here.

432
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,060
I tried to grab 50,000, but that's 20,000.

433
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,771
Take it.

434
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,133
Goodness, he beat an employee to death.

435
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,677
And he can get off because he's rich?

436
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,596
The dead guy was only 26 years old.

437
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,555
-Ha-na.
-He was 26?

438
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,931
Exactly.

439
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,142
Unbelievable. That poor kid.

440
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,977
He's not even human.

441
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,520
-Ha-na.
-Song stated that…

442
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,272
-Ms. Chu, I got it.
-he plans to hold

443
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,900
the Songju Police Station responsible
for the drop

444
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,443
-in their stock price.
-What's wrong?

445
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,571
A police official stated
that they will continue to investigate

446
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,615
to expose the truth
behind the unfair death

447
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,200
of this young man until the end.

448
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,830
You idiot.

449
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,457
Moron!

450
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,253
You asshole. Did you see me do it?

451
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,505
Did you see me kill Han Seung-woo?

452
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,591
I'm sorry.

453
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,307
You can rest assured

454
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,894
that your identity will not be revealed,
Mr. Yoo Yeong-jae.

455
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:25,735
TWO DAYS EARLIER

456
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,616
Hey.

457
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,826
Who left this here?

458
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,287
Who was it?

459
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,212
You idiot.

460
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,339
Report to me right away
when you get a call.

461
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,549
You just left a note?

462
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,761
-You little…
-Mr. Song, you should stop.

463
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,767
Let go.

464
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,561
Seung-woo.

465
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,481
Are you in here?

466
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,817
Seung-woo…

467
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,220
When I walked into the restroom,

468
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,472
Seung-woo was…

469
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,269
already dead.

470
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,815
You thought I wouldn't know?

471
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,942
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

472
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,194
Kneel down, you asshole!

473
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,823
I'm going to skin you alive.

474
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,534
I'm sorry, Mr. Song! I'm sorry!

475
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,369
-Let me go. Let go!
-Sir.

476
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,706
Please. I'm… I'm so sorry.

477
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,874
I'm sorry.

478
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,876
-I know everything no matter where you are
-Sorry.

479
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,085
and what you're up to.

480
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,840
Run to the police just one more time
and tell them more nonsense,

481
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,509
and see what happens to your sister.

482
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,557
I'm sorry.

483
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,101
Damn it.

484
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,319
Take it.

485
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:32,987
Hey.

486
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,286
Behave, okay?

487
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,246
You better behave.

488
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,831
There, there.

489
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,673
-Come here.
-My gosh.

490
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,758
I'm fine.

491
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,426
Wake up.

492
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,637
-You have to go home.
-I'm fine.

493
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,098
Hey.

494
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,561
I choked him with this thing.

495
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,899
It felt so good.

496
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,900
HAN SEUNG-WOO

497
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,199
This is a present for you.

498
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,289
Kids these days love this
more than a necklace.

499
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,128
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

500
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,135
CITIZENS IN FEAR,
JUNGJIN'S ENDLESS MURDER CASES

501
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,222
Come in.

502
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,310
What is it?

503
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,896
I thought you should see this.

504
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,981
CHIEF CHOI SU-RYONG

505
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,319
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT

506
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,073
Jeong-yeong made a request to the NFS.

507
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,535
DECEASED, KIM YEONG-NIM

508
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,746
Who's Kim Yeong-nim?

509
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,585
None of your business.
How's Chairman Jeon's case coming along?

510
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,129
As smoothly as you ordered.

511
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,130
Wrap it up quickly.

512
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,258
Yes, sir. I'll wrap it up in a flash.

513
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,891
RELATED PERSON: KIM YEONG-NIM

514
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,350
DISAPPEARANCE, SEPTEMBER 16TH, 2013

515
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,737
That detective bitch is a nutcase too.

516
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,988
Try to lose her first.

517
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,490
Don't mess with the police.

518
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:46,579
Chief Choi won't cooperate if we lay
a finger on his subordinates again.

519
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,622
CEO NOH HANG-GYU

520
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,207
What's he going to do?

521
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:54,712
We're holding him by a number of leashes,
so we can always keep him under control.

522
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,590
Go get Ga Mo-tak for now.

523
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,550
And bring him here?

524
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,639
Where do you think we are?
Why would you bring him here?

525
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,974
If only you weren't my brother…

526
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,270
Keep him in your warehouse.

527
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,940
I need to see him

528
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,401
take his last breath with my own two eyes.

529
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,486
TAESIN GROUP

530
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,445
And do it right.

531
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,489
If the reservoir gets exposed,

532
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,783
you can forget the third ICT redevelopment

533
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,660
and his presidency.

534
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,495
His presidency?

535
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,498
Mayor Shin will be president?

536
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,750
Of course.

537
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,754
Do you think we're doing all this work
only to get Jungjin?

538
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,465
Are we going to the Blue House?

539
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,803
Damn, what's with my heart? It's racing.

540
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,597
EONNI'S NOODLES

541
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,309
Am I a private detective agency
to you now?

542
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,436
Making me run background checks?

543
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,854
You shouldn't do this!

544
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,818
They've been reading people's minds
using their powers as Counters,

545
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,820
and I got anxious.

546
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,614
They'll be excommunicated
as soon as Yung finds out.

547
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,283
I can't believe their nerves.

548
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,161
I know it's just a cup of coffee,
but try to have some class.

549
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,246
That's what life's about.

550
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,123
Just take what you get, okay?

551
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,040
Great work.

552
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:19,088
Those brothers lived very dirty lives,

553
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,132
even for kids whose parents died early

554
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,009
and who didn't have good circumstances.

555
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,385
I can't believe this.

556
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,263
How did someone
with 11 previous convictions

557
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,390
become Taesin's executive director?

558
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,058
They found a successful lord.

559
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,394
It's Cho Tae-sin.

560
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,275
Cho Tae-sin, this guy. He's unbelievable.

561
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,402
-He was a dealer.
-A drug dealer?

562
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,613
Yes, then he cleaned up everything,

563
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,241
made himself presentable,
and came out into the world.

564
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,661
Then Cho Tae-sin took over
a construction firm,

565
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,289
and Noh Hang-gyu found
a goods and services company.

566
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,083
Then the next year, all of a sudden,

567
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,128
Jungjin was overtaken
with a redevelopment craze.

568
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,880
-All of a sudden?
-All of a sudden.

569
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,048
Fishy, isn't it?

570
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,426
They have someone in their hands.

571
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,469
Who?

572
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,346
Shin Myeong-hwi.

573
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,764
Yes, that's right.

574
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,851
Shin Myeong-hwi was the head
of this borough back then.

575
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,520
The puzzle is coming together, right?

576
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,857
They made up Taesin Group as a front,

577
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,360
but they've been operating
11 more companies

578
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,154
with a puppet boss,
just as he did while dealing drugs.

579
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,579
These have to be paper companies
that launder money to create slush funds.

580
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,374
There was an article on this back in 2014.

581
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,211
The prosecution began to investigate
Taesin's slush fund,

582
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,922
but the article and the case
both got deleted very quickly.

583
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,091
They got their hands
on the prosecution too?

584
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,302
The prosecutor
in charge of the investigation was

585
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,930
seen on TV as Song's attorney.

586
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,432
He's a part of Taesin's legal team.

587
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,476
How do you know that?

588
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,729
Song Man-ho's company,
Dajeong Construction Firm…

589
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,816
belonged to my dad before.

590
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,323
All these companies were taken away
from their owners, like my dad.

591
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,369
They dry up funding
by stopping their subcontractors,

592
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,412
then lend them money.

593
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,456
That had to come from Noh Hang-gyu, then.
Isn't that right?

594
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,543
A day after the repayment date,
they sue the CEO for fraud,

595
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,629
take over,
and put jerks like him in charge.

596
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,631
My goodness.

597
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,717
And that happened to your family?

598
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,517
Who's blocking the sunlight like this?

599
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:55,035
That's the true nature of Taesin Group,
one of the top 50 groups in Korea.

600
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,165
How does it make any sense that they rank
three spots higher than my company?

601
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,710
Who's the asshole that stabbed Mo-tak?

602
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,670
The boss.

603
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,257
Mo-tak, let me see your wound.

604
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,303
Right here, right here,

605
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,555
-and here, then right here…
-Enough.

606
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,143
DAJEONG ENC

607
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,105
Mr. Ga Mo-tak.

608
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,359
There's a lot of you.

609
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,696
Mr. Ga Mo-tak, I need to see you.

610
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,331
Damn it, that bitch.

611
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,665
-Hey!
-What happened?

612
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,958
-What's going on?
-Damn.

613
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,211
-Whoa.
-What's she doing?

614
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:49,423
You jerk.
Do you think it's fun to kill people?

615
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,469
You freaking…

616
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,473
Wait. Wait a second.

617
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,395
Hey, do you want me to crush
all 206 bones in your body?

618
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,690
How dare you show up here?

619
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,984
Hey, lady. Do you want to die?

620
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,780
Kid, listen to the lady and get lost.

621
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,659
You're pretty brazen for someone
who ruined Mo-tak's life.

622
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,954
You even took away his parents.

623
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,623
How dare you show up
to take more from them?

624
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,667
-Whoa.
-Boss!

625
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,626
-Darn it.
-Boss.

626
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,794
Hey, Boss.

627
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,045
-Let's go.
-What happened?

628
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,005
It'll take forever
to erase their memories.

629
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,006
Don't.

630
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,925
They saw everything.

631
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,094
They're like cockroaches.

632
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,263
They'll keep coming back.

633
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,015
What did you call us? Cockroaches?

634
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,227
You're that asshole
who stabbed me to kill me,

635
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,020
yet that sounds humiliating to you?

636
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,107
If you show up here again,

637
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,110
I'll pull out your tongue
and wrap it around your neck.

638
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:55,072
You know how crazy people can be
when they lose their living, don't you?

639
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,743
You still don't get it?

640
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,746
I'm not who I was seven years ago,
you asshole.

641
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,708
You can't stab me with a toy like this.

642
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,501
Ouch, that hurts.

643
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,419
That hurts.

644
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,341
His presidency?
Mayor Shin will be president?

645
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,427
Think we're doing all of this
only to get Jungjin?

646
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,886
Are we going to the Blue House?

647
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,144
The presidency?

648
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,022
Are you kidding me?

649
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,276
What are you doing, jerk?

650
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,902
-Let me go.
-Boss.

651
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:34,987
Move aside. Move!

652
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,113
I haven't even started.

653
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,239
-Boss!
-Let me go.

654
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,783
-Let's go.
-Darn you.

655
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,954
We'll be back. You better be ready.

656
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,582
Watch it, okay? Be good.

657
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,128
You just stood there?

658
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,505
You stood there watching
while I got beaten up?

659
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,799
They broke those knives in half.
What can I do?

660
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,801
And that gives you a reason
to stand there?

661
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,054
Is he really a human being?

662
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,056
Darn it.

663
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,601
What if Ga Mo-tak ends up
ruining our plan?

664
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,811
Darn it. Damn it.

665
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:11,899
What's wrong?

666
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,028
The presidency.

667
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,738
The presidency.

668
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,867
It's completely absurd,

669
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,744
but not impossible.

670
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,996
He has the highest approval ratings.

671
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,833
People have no idea
Shin Myeong-hwi has been doing dirty work

672
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,335
behind people's backs.

673
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,005
We have to expose this. This is absurd.

674
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,423
What's the reservoir?

675
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,469
They said they have to kill me

676
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,971
because of the reservoir.

677
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,140
Go get Ga Mo-tak for now.

678
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,684
If the reservoir gets exposed,

679
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,396
you can forget the third ICT redevelopment
and his presidency.

680
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,315
Once the reservoir is exposed,

681
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,236
his presidency and the third
ICT redevelopment contract will be gone.

682
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,279
-The reservoir?
-Yes.

683
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,490
Is that where Kim's body is?

684
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,243
Her dead body?

685
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,747
RESERVOIR, 3795D123 61 R33L1

686
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,917
RESERVOIR, 3795D123 61 R33L1

687
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,838
Is there a reservoir in Jungjin?

688
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,506
Mo-tak.

689
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,092
I saw "reservoir" in my dad's notebook.

690
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,097
Right here. "Reservoir" and some numbers.

691
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,308
The reservoir?

692
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,521
What could it be?

693
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,902
RESERVOIR, 3795D123 61 R33L1

694
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,879
Ji Cheong-sin took the book.

695
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,047
Damn it!

696
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,302
We have Jungjin in our hands,
and we're about to take Korea.

697
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,345
How can you ruin it like this?

698
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:06,930
Before that…

699
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,315
It looks like Ga Mo-tak
is getting ready to begin something.

700
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,195
What is this?

701
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,072
He got a blood sample of the suspect…

702
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,658
in Kim Yeong-nim's murder.

703
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:29,703
What?

704
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,873
I stopped the NFS from doing the analysis

705
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,293
and told them to burn the sample.

706
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,715
What now? We won't get caught
for what we did to Kim Yeong-nim?

707
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,051
No.

708
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,025
You idiot.

709
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,111
You said that he died. What's going on?

710
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,781
-I'm sorry.
-Damn you!

711
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,032
Tae-sin.

712
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,374
I'm sorry.

713
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,966
Jae-cheol, where are you?

714
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,811
Where's Ji Cheong-sin?

715
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,522
He's on the wanted list.

716
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,567
The media is onto us,
so I had no other choice.

717
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:46,572
Why did Sang-pil sit on his hands
when I told him to get rid of him,

718
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,156
only to get himself killed?

719
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,535
Let the media blow it up.

720
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,496
Pardon?

721
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,500
Ji Cheong-sin the serial murderer.

722
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,920
Have them blow this up.

723
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,132
The more people get scared, the better.

724
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,595
He must be caught ASAP.

725
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,974
But he can't be alive.

726
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,769
Have him killed.

727
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,524
Yes, sir.

728
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,367
Lieutenants So Gwon and Ha Mun-yeong.

729
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,954
CEO Kwon Jin-seung of Love Jungjin.

730
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,624
Chairman Jeon Gi-hwan.

731
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,877
And Ji Cheong-sin, a hit man.

732
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,971
If they were killed by a hit man,

733
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,015
there must be a connection
between their deaths.

734
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:02,064
Who and why did someone
tell Ji Cheong-sin to kill them?

735
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:09,404
CCTV footage showing the suspect
in a murder that occurred

736
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:13,200
on the 15th in a junkyard in Jungjin
has been released.

737
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,370
The suspect, who was an employee
at the junkyard,

738
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,664
allegedly killed Bae,
the junkyard's owner,

739
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,708
stole money out of a safe,
and fled the scene.

740
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,169
Bae had a gunshot wound to the head,

741
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,673
and his disfigured body was found
in a crushed vehicle.

742
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,385
The gunshot wound was determined
as the cause of death.

743
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,638
Man, that jerk looks awfully wicked.

744
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:37,683
That'll be 9,000 won.

745
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,226
How much?

746
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,980
Police have vowed to wrap up the case.

747
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,359
If you see the man in this footage,

748
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,405
please call 911 or contact
the Jungjin Police Station directly.

749
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,572
That'll be 9,000 won.

750
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,367
Next story.

751
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,938
Hey, open the door!

752
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,692
Open the door!

753
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,490
Open the door. Hey!

754
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,202
Open this.

755
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,913
Whoa, it's open.

756
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,053
Don't you want to do business?

757
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,390
That asshole is one of us too.

758
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,019
Do your job right.
You get paid to do this.

759
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,274
See you around.

760
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,322
What was that?

761
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,240
Warm up my fish cake bar too.

762
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,442
You surprised me.

763
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,614
Don't go around with these in your ears.

764
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,201
Ji Cheong-sin saw you,
and he probably saw your name.

765
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,663
I know.

766
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,374
Be careful.

767
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,001
You be careful too.

768
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,838
And keep this with you.

769
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,717
Ha-na.

770
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,807
I'm waiting for that jerk to show up.

771
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,685
Don't be so rash.

772
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,700
TARGET

773
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,999
Yes, Boss. All finished.

774
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,709
Yes.

775
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,754
Where is it?

776
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,513
Songwon, right next to Jungjin.

777
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,141
Songwon used to be a part of Jungjin,

778
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,018
but they broke away in 2013.

779
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,603
There's a reservoir there.

780
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,231
So this is where they buried
Kim Yeong-nim's dead body.

781
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:15,859
-Whoa.
-What's going on?

782
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,110
What's with him?

783
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,823
My gosh.

784
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,580
We stepped on one.

785
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,999
Is it Ji Cheong-sin?

786
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,334
No.

787
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,044
You're completely worthless.

788
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,130
-My uncle.
-Your uncle?

789
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,799
Man, look at this guy.

790
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:41,843
What's the level?

791
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:42,969
Level two.

792
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,932
Please… Please spare my life.

793
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,560
A person. A person is about to die.

794
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,895
Damn it.

795
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,439
Just said goodbye to all of them.

796
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,813
Well, it's not bulletproof though.

797
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:46,069
Can you prove that they hired hit men
to kill Mun's parents?

798
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,070
How will you prove it?

799
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,321
We will find evidence.

800
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:52,492
Today, the City of Jungjin
declares war against violent crimes.

801
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,244
Back off, you little shit!

802
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,664
We will not let this murderer
threaten the peace

803
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,415
and security of our city, Jungjin.

804
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,417
-Song Man-ho!
-Is that you, Ha-na?

805
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,420
Don't call my name.

806
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,465
