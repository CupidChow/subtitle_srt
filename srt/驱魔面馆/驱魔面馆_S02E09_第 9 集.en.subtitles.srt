1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,603
I'm not powerful enough to kill you.

3
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,817
But how about this?

4
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,863
What if I erased the memory

5
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,824
of your rebirth?

6
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,583
What'll happen once the power

7
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,835
you've acquired

8
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,421
disappears?

9
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,137
-Wi-gen!
-Wi-gen.

10
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,181
Wi-gen!

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,502
Mun, stay with me!

12
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,670
Mun!

13
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,425
Mun!

14
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,033
So Mun is in a coma.

15
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,627
What have you done?

16
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,136
It would've been a waste!

17
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,723
How could I let you take his power?

18
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,043
How dare you

19
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,463
ruin my plan?

20
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,427
I've never seen you look so mad before.

21
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,354
No!

22
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,149
Ms. Chu!

23
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,987
He'll become even stronger
if he consumes her soul.

24
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,573
Ms. Chu!

25
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,537
Ha-na, protect Mun!

26
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,752
No.

27
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,216
You're not going anywhere.
Don't you get it?

28
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,219
We're all going to die here!

29
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,299
Ha-na!

30
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,686
Ha-na…

31
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,399
Jeok-bong, listen to me carefully.
Ha-na used U-sik to send this message.

32
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,985
Take Mun and get out of there.

33
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,404
You must save Mun.

34
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,824
Trust them and get out of there right now!

35
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,955
Mun!

36
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,590
What's going on?

37
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,051
I asked you a question.

38
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,071
Get down!

39
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,188
-Mun!
-Hurry!

40
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,149
Help Mun!

41
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,275
-Mun.
-Help him!

42
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,317
That's a gun.

43
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,840
Didn't I tell you
that I had the best equipment?

44
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,261
Let's go!

45
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,930
-Mun!
-Hurry!

46
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,985
Don't mess with us, you evil spirits!

47
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,417
-Chairman Choi!
-Chairman Choi!

48
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,252
-Come here!
-Hurry!

49
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,837
Hurry up!

50
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,381
Close the door!

51
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,967
Is everyone all right?

52
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,726
-No!
-No!

53
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,037
Let me go.

54
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,550
-Mo-tak!
-Mo-tak!

55
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,054
This is the power of Ga Mo-tak!

56
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,891
Hurry up!

57
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,727
Are you okay?

58
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,980
Am I okay? No.

59
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,612
Mun.

60
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,490
Mun.

61
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,827
Can you hear me?

62
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,123
Please answer me if you can.

63
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,125
Mun.

64
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,925
Please open your eyes, Mun.

65
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,846
Ms. Chu, do something.
Is there no way to heal him?

66
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,640
What do we do?

67
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,436
What will happen to Mun?

68
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,896
Don't worry, I'm sure there's a way.

69
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,357
He will pull through.

70
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,192
There must be a way.

71
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,738
Please, Mun.

72
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,740
I can't reach Wi-gen either.

73
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,534
After being disconnected from Mun,

74
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,245
I think she's trapped somewhere
in the White Ground.

75
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,538
The "White Ground"?

76
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,248
Where's that?

77
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,500
Is Mun there too?

78
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,629
Then we should go there
and find Mun and Wi-gen--

79
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:35,009
You can't do that, Mom.
Only those in a coma can enter that place.

80
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,930
Are you telling me
that there's no way to wake him up?

81
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,600
He needs to be reunited with Wi-gen

82
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,603
and enter into the Counter contract
once again.

83
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,981
That's the only way he'll wake up.

84
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,692
And the only way to get Wi-gen back.

85
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,904
Hey, you read his memories, right?

86
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,447
How is he doing?

87
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,992
Only two events were erased
from his memory.

88
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,162
The miraculous time
when Wi-gen entered his body

89
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,415
and when he woke up from his coma
as a little kid.

90
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,252
Both moments were when he was reborn.

91
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,547
He fell into a coma after his past
and present were disconnected.

92
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:18,219
In that case,
can't you give him back those memories?

93
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,138
His memory is completely gone.

94
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,557
It's impossible to restore them.

95
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,811
Damn it.

96
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:31,524
Gelly did a number
on Hwang Pil-gwang and us.

97
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:37,905
She knew how important Mun was
to all of us.

98
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,076
We must summon her first.

99
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,787
We don't know what else she'll do.

100
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,790
Now that she's cut ties
with Hwang Pil-gwang,

101
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,919
we can subdue her even without Mun.

102
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,296
No, we must.

103
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,802
But there's no way to locate her.
If we're too rash…

104
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:04,640
None of us will be safe if you run
into Hwang Pil-gwang or Ma Ju-seok.

105
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,600
Then what?

106
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,269
Should we just sit on our hands?

107
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,438
I'm saying we should do what we can.

108
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,566
Catch Lee Chung-jae
and obstruct Ma Ju-seok's plan.

109
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,317
That's the best option for Yung

110
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,946
and the safety of the Counters.

111
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:40,384
What the hell did Gelly do
to incapacitate Mun?

112
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,554
She didn't kill him.

113
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,725
He just lost his power all of a sudden.

114
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,313
Were you after Mun's power all along?

115
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,106
And you used me?

116
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,985
You weren't interested in getting revenge.

117
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,447
So what if our destinations differ?

118
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,574
We're taking the same path.

119
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,993
If you want to kill Lee Chung-jae--

120
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:06,952
No.

121
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,334
They can't stop me without Mun's help.

122
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,545
I only want my revenge.

123
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,173
That means our paths

124
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,550
are different.

125
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,431
So tell me.

126
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,351
How will you locate Lee Chung-jae?

127
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,565
Let them do the work.
Then all you have to do

128
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,568
is find them.

129
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,619
You must know where their hideout is,
given your close relationship.

130
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,121
Find them,

131
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,250
and locating Lee Chung-jae will be easy.

132
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,631
I should at least…

133
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,012
consume their souls.

134
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,021
EPISODE 9

135
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,611
Mun…

136
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,323
He's not dead.

137
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,200
Enough with your crying.

138
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,582
Then why are you getting teary-eyed?

139
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,417
What are you saying? Be quiet.

140
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,669
You're going to wake him up--

141
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,254
He should wake up!

142
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,090
Of course, he should! He has to wake up.

143
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,259
But still…

144
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,720
How dare you talk back to me?

145
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,725
Answer that.

146
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,313
It's not mine.

147
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,319
Where is it coming from?

148
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,532
GRANDFATHER

149
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,035
Oh God, what do we do?

150
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,079
It's his grandfather.

151
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:20,586
He's going to be so shocked
when he finds out that Mun is unconscious.

152
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,131
Jeez. What should we do?

153
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,220
HANMARU SENIOR CENTER

154
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,309
An art contest?

155
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,938
-Yes.
-He would've told us that.

156
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,859
He asked me not to tell you.

157
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,737
He didn't want you
to be disappointed if he lost.

158
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,989
No wonder he hasn't been
answering my calls.

159
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,953
I hope he prepared well for the contest.

160
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,497
Of course. You don't have to worry.

161
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,377
Mun. Our dear grandson, Mun.

162
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,380
My goodness, don't use your hand.

163
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,383
Here. Use this fork.

164
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,219
By the way,

165
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:16,016
Mun told us that he was unconscious
for a long time when he was younger.

166
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,814
How was he able to wake up again?

167
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,735
Have they found Wi-gen yet?

168
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,531
This way.

169
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,243
Hey, Mun.

170
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,496
He'll wake up.

171
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,082
He will. Calm down.

172
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,128
I heard that you played a big part

173
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,672
in waking him up
when he was younger, Ju-yeon.

174
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,301
You sang and talked to him.

175
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,262
So…

176
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,849
How long has it been?

177
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:03,856
It happened around 6:00 p.m. yesterday.
It was before sundown.

178
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,607
So it's been a day already.

179
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,444
What about a doctor?
Have you called one already?

180
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,530
No, not yet.

181
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,909
He must be hungry. We should
administer nutrients intravenously.

182
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,288
You must know a doctor.
Please call them right now.

183
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,373
-Okay.
-All right.

184
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,835
Does he have a diaper on?
You still have bowel movements in a coma.

185
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,505
I placed two bedsheets
under him yesterday.

186
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,092
That'll soil the sheets
and make it hard to wash them.

187
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,054
His stomach is full already.

188
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,722
I'll go buy some diapers.

189
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,807
Okay. Hurry.

190
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,605
Just singing,

191
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,108
talking, and praying
won't help him wake up.

192
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,860
We must cope with this situation.

193
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,742
Let's wipe and massage his body first,
so it won't stiffen.

194
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,826
We need wet towels.

195
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,078
-Right.
-Give me one.

196
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,496
I got it. Right here…

197
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,247
What are you doing?

198
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,583
You need to move quickly.

199
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,251
-Yes, ma'am.
-Sorry.

200
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,045
What else do you need?

201
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,213
Plenty of wet towels.

202
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,757
-A lot of towels.
-I'll bring more water.

203
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,698
Wake up soon.

204
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,993
Don't leave me and Ung-min alone.

205
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,500
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

206
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,962
What are you talking about?
I never said that.

207
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,589
Must I keep saying this? It's frustrating.

208
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,093
I never said that President Lee was alive.

209
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,222
How could someone rise from the dead?
Think about it.

210
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,226
Has this scumbag gone insane?

211
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,899
I'll be his first target if he lives.

212
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,237
Why don't you just kill him off
this time around?

213
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,409
You were pressuring me
to say those things.

214
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,244
This can't be used as evidence.

215
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:26,957
What?

216
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,877
-What?
-Are you recording this?

217
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,253
You bastard!

218
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,338
-What did you say?
-Mo-tak, no.

219
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,548
What?

220
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,924
Don't do this. Calm down.

221
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,884
-What?
-Mo-tak.

222
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,468
-Mo-tak.
-Let me go.

223
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,387
Calm down, Mo-tak. Okay?

224
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,722
Let me go.

225
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,934
Come on, Mo-tak. Please.

226
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,396
You think Wi-gen hasn't found Mun yet?

227
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,273
It's been quite some time now.

228
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:56,612
Gosh! This is so frustrating!
I don't know what's going on!

229
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,075
Maybe Mun isn't in a coma.

230
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,914
What do you mean? Then what could it be?

231
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:13,962
If he's not in the White Ground, it means
his soul is still inside his body.

232
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,757
Come on. Then, why would he not wake up?

233
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,134
-That's ridiculous.
-No.

234
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,179
We should consider all possibilities.

235
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,765
U-sik.

236
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,017
We need Ha-na's help.

237
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,213
I'll begin now.

238
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,683
I'm in.

239
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,519
I'm inside…

240
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,981
Mun's mind.

241
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:18,735
You need to be careful.
If you get lost in there--

242
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,653
I know.

243
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,989
I'll be trapped here.

244
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,366
Mun!

245
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,744
Answer if you can hear me, Mun!

246
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,622
Mun?

247
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,378
Is that him?

248
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,802
Who are you?

249
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,223
It's me, Do Ha-na.

250
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,143
Do Ha-na?

251
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,147
I don't know you.

252
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,108
You don't know me? What do you--

253
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,319
Don't come near me.

254
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,779
-Mun, it won't take long.
-I told you to stay back.

255
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,408
-What's wrong?
-Back off!

256
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,414
What's wrong?

257
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,749
Everyone will die.

258
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,710
What?

259
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,006
Everyone around me…

260
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,886
dies.

261
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,600
Mun!

262
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,019
No.

263
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,896
Mun.

264
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,481
Mun!

265
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,775
Mun!

266
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,904
Mun is hiding deep within himself.

267
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,281
He's refusing to wake up.

268
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,451
But why would he do that?

269
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,538
Maybe he thought

270
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,959
we all died in the hotel that day.

271
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,881
He went into a coma
before he could see us escape.

272
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,845
"Everyone around me dies."

273
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,015
I'm worried about what he said.

274
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:17,229
I'm afraid he blames himself
for failing to protect us.

275
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,899
Most of all, he was the one

276
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,361
who carried all the burden.

277
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,697
Then we can let him know.

278
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:32,828
Ha-na can enter his mind
and tell him that we're fine.

279
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,123
Can't you just tell him
that we came out of there alive?

280
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,584
Mun doesn't even remember her.

281
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,088
If she forces him to remember her,

282
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,799
he might hide even deeper within.

283
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,261
So there's no other way?

284
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,680
How could this be?

285
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,265
Has this ever happened before?

286
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,349
Just once.

287
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,018
A similar case took place abroad.

288
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:02,315
A Counter fell into a coma after losing
his colleague and refused to wake up.

289
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,027
And? What happened to the Counter?

290
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,992
The Counter…

291
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,662
died while being in a coma.

292
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,916
The Yung individual connected to them…

293
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,711
vanished as well.

294
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,635
It's all about Mun's will to wake up.

295
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,346
That's the only way.

296
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,392
But we're running out of time.

297
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,188
Then that's enough.

298
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,567
You said it was up to him.

299
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,157
No one is more strong-willed than him.

300
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,162
Who helped us get back on our feet

301
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,998
whenever we felt helpless?

302
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,958
It was Mun.

303
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,296
So why wouldn't he wake up?

304
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,466
He will wake up. No matter what.

305
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,679
So you better not blabber

306
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,683
about there being no other way
or whine about this situation.

307
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,977
I won't put up with it.

308
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,187
Got that?

309
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,940
Both Wi-gen and Mun…

310
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,485
will return.

311
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,116
SIMYANG SHIPPING

312
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,201
Bye.

313
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,169
Damn it. You startled me.

314
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,087
Damn it.

315
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,631
I look better in other photos.

316
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,804
I shouldn't be happy to see you.

317
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,556
Has it been two years now?

318
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,850
I realize this more and more.

319
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,311
You look dumb,

320
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,438
but you're pretty smart.

321
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,233
You're going through a rough patch?

322
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,193
It's a shame.

323
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,988
I don't work for the same client twice.

324
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,448
Is that so?

325
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:18,952
But you see,

326
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,082
I won't let Lee Chung-jae
run away with my money.

327
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,131
When is he leaving?

328
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,431
This is exactly why
I don't get close to others.

329
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,644
Even if my father came back from the dead,
I wouldn't reveal my clients' information.

330
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:49,316
That's why you and Mr. Hwang
were able to escape safely.

331
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,693
Right? Impressive, right?

332
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,907
Shut your trap.

333
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,084
Tomorrow.

334
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,420
So it's tomorrow.

335
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,930
What? I already served the rice.

336
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:22,807
This is Mun's.

337
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,185
What if he wakes up and wants to eat?

338
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,353
Right.

339
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:37,364
Then, should we grill some meat
in case he wakes up?

340
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,741
Mun likes meat in broth.

341
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:46,790
Look. Ms. Chu prepared
beef and radish soup for him.

342
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,296
These are all his favorites.

343
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,549
He'll wake up just to eat.

344
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,219
Ms. Chu.

345
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:07,143
Yesterday, I asked whether or not
there was a way because I was frustrated.

346
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,272
You understand, right?

347
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,568
Make sure to eat well.
You're working hard these days.

348
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,075
We're all going through a lot,
not just me.

349
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,995
I should catch Lee Chung-jae
as soon as possible.

350
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,913
Jeez.

351
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,708
That way, I won't feel ashamed
when Mun wakes up.

352
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,215
Lee Chung-jae's men won't talk, right?

353
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,430
Have you found Jae-youl yet?

354
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,726
I thought he'd testify against them,
but he just vanished.

355
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,313
Ma Ju-seok appeared on CCTV
near Jae-youl's house.

356
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,651
That means he used Jae-youl
to find Lee Chung-jae.

357
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,281
But I have no idea where he is.

358
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,936
Do you miss her?

359
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,501
I was right.
You delivered Lee Chung-jae's money.

360
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,003
Help me!

361
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,257
Don't worry. I'll save you.

362
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,769
Ma'am! You should run! Hurry!

363
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,441
Are you up?

364
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,950
What are you doing here?

365
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,328
You look like you've seen a ghost.

366
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,080
Did you think I was dead?

367
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,291
No. That's not it.

368
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,760
Get up.

369
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,887
Let's eat.

370
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,527
You see, about that time…

371
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,199
They were grilling me so hard, so…

372
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,452
Just eat.

373
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,664
You and your darn food.

374
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,209
Why did you come?

375
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,587
Why did you come back?

376
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,714
To take revenge on me?

377
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,631
If not,

378
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,677
is it to see if I was still alive
after handing you over to get beaten?

379
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,304
How did you know I'd be here?

380
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,639
"Thank goodness."

381
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,894
That's what I got
from your expression earlier.

382
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,897
"Thank goodness she's alive."

383
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,982
Am I wrong?

384
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,655
Who are you?

385
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,035
You know me, don't you?

386
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,956
This isn't the first time
we've met, right?

387
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,669
What are you rambling about? Just eat.

388
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,425
When I was younger,

389
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,430
some kids bullied me so much
I wanted to die.

390
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,141
And one day,

391
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,271
they beat me up so hard
I thought I'd actually die.

392
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,609
But when I woke up,

393
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,402
they were the ones beaten to a pulp.

394
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,074
I had a dream then.

395
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,205
Someone saved me that day.

396
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,084
Don't worry.

397
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,795
I'll save you.

398
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,547
And it was you.

399
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,258
Right?

400
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,515
It was you who saved me, right?

401
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,354
Who are you?

402
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,862
Someone…

403
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,616
who is indebted to you.

404
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,662
You saved me

405
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,041
and helped me get back on my feet.

406
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,423
But I had forgotten about you
all this time.

407
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,553
I'm truly sorry.

408
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,017
That's why

409
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,310
I came here today.

410
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,398
I want you to know
that you still have time.

411
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,696
Jae-youl.

412
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,365
You still have a chance.

413
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,202
Go to the police station.

414
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,538
Go and testify.

415
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:05,710
Tell them Lee Chung-jae is still alive.
I'll go with you, okay?

416
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,383
It doesn't matter anymore.

417
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,635
What do you mean?

418
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,679
It doesn't matter?

419
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,224
It's today.

420
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,353
Tonight, Lee Chung-jae…

421
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,440
is going to leave.

422
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,152
What? He's stowing away?

423
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,073
Yes. Jae-youl was once taken
to where he was,

424
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,075
and that's when he overheard it.

425
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,037
He knows the location and time.
I don't think he's lying.

426
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,750
I'm taking him to the police station.
I'll see you there.

427
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,627
Okay. Bye.

428
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,180
Jae-youl!

429
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,307
Jae-youl!

430
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,897
If we lose Lee Chung-jae,
we'll never be able to catch him.

431
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,983
Then, we can't predict
how Ma Ju-seok will react.

432
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,737
If all goes well,
we'll catch Lee Chung-jae,

433
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:20,076
retrieve the 120 billion won,
and even summon Gelly.

434
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,622
But like the Yung people said,

435
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,167
we shouldn't be so rash
when Mun is still unconscious.

436
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,419
Or else, we might…

437
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,340
I agree with him.

438
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,636
I think it's best to lie low for now.

439
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,056
Plus, how can we believe Jae-youl?

440
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,226
He could've said anything just to flee.

441
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,654
That's what Mun always said.

442
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,239
We can

443
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,491
do it.

444
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,877
We need to prove it to him.

445
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:16,883
We need to show him
that he doesn't need to protect us

446
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,802
and that we can protect him.

447
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,302
All right…

448
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,310
Have you been well, my babies?

449
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,501
What the hell? Where's everyone?

450
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,672
Damn it.
Are these bastards kidding me?

451
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,258
You're right on time.

452
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,886
What's this?

453
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,680
You're one tenacious bitch.

454
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,892
What? How did you do that?

455
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,687
Don't try to understand.

456
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,730
You'll soon be dead.

457
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,069
You're right on time.

458
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,570
Those scumbags.

459
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,244
-Excellent parking skills.
-Let's go.

460
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:11,872
Lee Chung-jae.

461
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,291
Come here.

462
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,209
Don't come near me.

463
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,505
I told you to back off!

464
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,636
Don't you have something better to do?

465
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,639
I'm quite busy, so let's finish
this in the next ten minutes.

466
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,224
That's too long.

467
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,019
Then it'll be quarter to--

468
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,617
-Go over there.
-Okay. Be safe.

469
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,056
Come on. I'm getting bored.

470
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,936
It won't even take ten minutes.

471
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,930
Ha-na! No, Ha-na!

472
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,850
Ha-na!

473
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,269
Run!

474
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,023
Run, Ha-na!

475
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,606
Judging from the fact
that you're all here…

476
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,237
I guess that bastard Mun is dead.

477
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,322
Shut up.

478
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,707
I pitied him.

479
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,003
It must've been a hassle…

480
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,302
to drag you losers around.

481
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,286
Don't you get it?

482
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,923
Jeok-bong and I will get Gelly.

483
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,674
What? Me?

484
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,552
You need to keep us in a confined space.

485
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,805
Still, don't you think
it'll be dangerous alone?

486
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,476
I can do it. I'll take care of her.

487
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,686
I'll get her, Ms. Chu.

488
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,152
You're not going anywhere, you idiot.

489
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,949
Na Jeok-bong.

490
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,829
Answer me, Jeok-bong! What's going on?

491
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,163
Be quiet!

492
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,477
No!

493
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,984
Jae-youl!

494
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,569
Shit.

495
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,283
Hey, lady.

496
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,660
Are you okay?

497
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,413
Stay still. Don't talk.

498
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,624
Stay still, Jae-youl.

499
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,666
Hey, lady.

500
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,170
I still have a chance, right?

501
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,715
Of course.

502
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,383
Of course.

503
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,719
It's not too late.

504
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:00,929
Jae-youl.

505
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,437
Lim Jae-youl.

506
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,358
You idiot. Why did you get between us?

507
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,567
Ms. Chu!

508
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,403
Who the hell are you?

509
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,741
You crazy, little bastard.

510
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,875
I surrender.

511
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,419
You can take my money.
All 120 billion won.

512
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,129
It's in the truck over there.

513
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,676
You still haven't come to your senses.

514
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,886
Your money?

515
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,348
You don't own even a single penny of it.

516
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,813
All right. I'll turn myself in.

517
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,981
Let's go to the police station.

518
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,693
Why would you turn yourself in?

519
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,321
Blood.

520
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,825
Sweat!

521
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,453
And tears!

522
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,334
You should pay for them first. Right?

523
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,294
After that, kneel and beg the people…

524
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:17,798
for forgiveness!

525
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,636
And then,

526
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,307
you'll go to jail, you scumbag.

527
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,336
She's being sly.

528
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,819
How does it feel
to be attacked in the dark?

529
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,863
You thought darkness was your friend?

530
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,336
Come out.

531
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,629
No.

532
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:42,758
You guys belong
to neither light nor darkness.

533
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,611
Do you still not get it?

534
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,281
You're the one who can't escape.

535
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,030
Now, go…

536
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,951
to hell!

537
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,288
Fine.

538
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,874
I'll see you in hell.

539
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,394
Ha-na.

540
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:01,855
What?

541
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,902
Ha-na! We did it!

542
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,323
-Yes, we did.
-Well done!

543
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,367
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

544
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,493
Jeez.

545
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,411
Well done.

546
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,467
Ha-na.

547
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:37,974
You're incredible. You had no territory,
but summoned a level-three evil spirit.

548
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,978
I didn't do it alone. Jeok-bong helped me.

549
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,191
I knew you wouldn't
just sit on your hands.

550
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,360
You're too good for that.

551
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,903
Exactly.

552
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,406
Ha-na just doesn't listen, you know?

553
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,490
Oops.

554
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,991
-Mo-tak.
-Yes?

555
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,119
I know you encouraged them.

556
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,162
These are some big shoulder pads.

557
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,000
You caught Lee Chung-jae
and summoned Gelly too.

558
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,129
The Chinese Counters
that Gelly had consumed

559
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,630
arrived safely in Yung.

560
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,383
They want to thank you.

561
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,844
We just did our job.

562
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,304
You're not hurt, are you?

563
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,515
Come on, Jong-guk.

564
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,727
I'm not the type of man
who gets hurt that easily.

565
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,229
Of course not. A doorman like you…

566
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,605
-What?
-Never mind.

567
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,859
I was ready to jump in if I had to!

568
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:29,901
Of course!

569
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,570
What? I'm serious!

570
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,821
Of course.

571
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:40,412
I wish Mun and Wi-gen were here with us.

572
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,459
Do you think

573
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,337
they saw how well we fought today?

574
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,018
Hold on.

575
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,396
Is this the one we used before?

576
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,900
My God. Where is she?

577
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,236
Where did she go? Chun-ok!

578
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:18,283
This is bad! Chun-ok!

579
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,760
Darling.

580
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,429
Darling.

581
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,433
It's Darling!

582
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,227
Darling!

583
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:52,484
Will that old hag
lead us to those pests?

584
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,864
POLICE

585
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,707
My goodness.

586
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,001
Have a safe trip home.

587
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,920
-Okay. Thank you.
-Goodbye.

588
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,588
My God, sir.

589
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,590
What happened?

590
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,633
Chairman Choi.

591
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,219
She got lost.

592
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,305
Thankfully, someone dropped her off
at the station.

593
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,686
I'm sorry, sir.
I shouldn't have called you out of panic.

594
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,856
Don't be sorry. Of course you can call me.

595
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,985
Oh God. You must've been so shocked.

596
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:39,406
But it seems like
you had a great day today.

597
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,869
I played with my darling today.

598
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,953
Darling?

599
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,873
What are you talking about?

600
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,792
It's cold so hop in. I'll drive you home.

601
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,766
Where am I?

602
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,687
Where are we going?

603
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,401
It's so cold.

604
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:23,909
Am I

605
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,620
going to the hospital?

606
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,668
I don't like hospitals.

607
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,421
What are you talking about? The hospital?

608
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,757
She must be pretending to be insane.

609
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,896
Sir, what's going on?

610
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,606
Please move your car--

611
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,447
Put your hands up!

612
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,922
Did they get you?

613
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:25,387
You ruined my entire plan
just to end up like this?

614
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,898
Have you come to get me?

615
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:42,320
I feel frustrated and afraid.

616
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,117
Please help me.

617
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,830
Your power went to waste.

618
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,257
Your power

619
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,845
didn't meet its rightful owner, Gelly.

620
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,646
Just like Ma Ju-seok's power.

621
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:53,850
Goodness. What should I do about Mun?

622
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,313
I can't keep it a secret
from them forever.

623
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:08,698
Let's see where you guys are hiding.

624
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:19,793
I see. That's where you've been hiding.

625
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,925
Hey, Mun.

626
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,847
They caught Lee Chung-jae.

627
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,101
They retrieved the money too.

628
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,292
Are you saying Ma Ju-seok
might've found out about our hideout?

629
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,087
If he did,

630
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,633
he would've gotten here before I did.

631
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:11,386
Judging by how he just left me there,

632
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,181
maybe he had a change of heart.

633
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:21,813
Maybe Mun's grandmother disappearing
out of the blue was all part of his plan.

634
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,773
We should leave this place with Mun.

635
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,732
No.

636
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,526
That won't change anything.

637
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,195
Ma Ju-seok knows us too well.

638
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:35,076
If he's determined to find us,
we won't be able to run forever.

639
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,620
Then do you want us to fight him?

640
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,291
It's impossible without Mun.
He's unfathomably stronger than Gelly.

641
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,960
While Mun's unconscious, we can't--

642
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,920
I need to bring him back.

643
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,135
But…

644
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,013
what if that puts you in danger?

645
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,934
He's been alone for way too long.

646
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:01,936
This time,

647
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,981
I'll bring him back.

648
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,276
Ha-na.

649
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,622
Mun.

650
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:24,918
Mun.

651
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,588
Mun…

652
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,510
Ji Cheong-sin?

653
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,305
I bet you think it's over now.

654
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,934
This fight will go on forever.

655
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,813
Your cursed fate
will lead you to a painful death.

656
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:50,193
And everyone around you
will also die like that because of you.

657
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,120
What's going on?

658
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,800
You have so many things
you need to protect.

659
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,262
I'm glad you're here.

660
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,431
This will be your gravesite.

661
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:27,814
Mun.

662
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:29,941
None of this is real.

663
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,277
You must stay strong.

664
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:41,536
That's right, Mun.

665
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,331
There's nothing we can do about this.

666
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:49,043
Neither of us will regret this.

667
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,680
What'll happen once the power

668
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,266
you've acquired

669
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,728
disappears?

670
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,652
Mun.

671
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,448
Why?

672
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,700
Why did you come back?

673
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,118
What do you mean?

674
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,704
I can't leave you here.

675
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,955
Stay away.

676
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,833
I told you to stay away from me!

677
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,895
I told you.

678
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,649
Everyone around me…

679
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,277
dies.

680
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,407
No, Mun.

681
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,742
No one died.

682
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,288
So you can stop feeling this way.
Let's go back together.

683
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,040
Don't lie!

684
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,423
In the end,

685
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,050
everyone died.

686
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,638
In the end,

687
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,684
I couldn't…

688
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,691
save anyone.

689
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,995
If you don't believe me,

690
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,622
let me show you.

691
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,381
You're going to join our team
and do the same thing.

692
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,266
It's great to be all together like this.

693
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:59,025
We're one. We're family.

694
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,411
You're not alone, Mun.

695
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,915
Believe in all the moments

696
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,418
that we spent together.

697
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:39,941
No.

698
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,486
I'm…

699
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,198
too exhausted now.

700
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,106
Dad.

701
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,401
Why are you back here again, Mun?

702
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,115
Let's go.

703
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,533
Let's go.

704
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,703
Let's go!

705
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,205
You need to return to everyone
who's waiting for you!

706
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,165
Why are you back here?

707
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,296
Hello?

708
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,089
No.

709
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,093
No.

710
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:52,054
Mun, we really have to go.
We need to go, please!

711
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:53,764
Let's go!

712
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,058
You need to live!

713
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,479
Thank you.

714
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:05,026
And I'm sorry for everything, Mun.

715
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:13,200
You need to return to those
who are waiting for you! Let's go!

716
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,869
We need to go, please!

717
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,628
You said it was up to him.

718
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,796
No one is more strong-willed than him.

719
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:30,134
Who helped us get back on our feet
whenever we felt helpless?

720
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:35,097
He will wake up. No matter what.

721
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,381
Ha-na.

722
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,187
Is everyone…

723
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:25,982
really…

724
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,611
waiting for me?

725
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,827
It must've been tough for you.

726
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:41,247
You should tell us
if you're struggling or exhausted.

727
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,792
We can protect you too, you idiot.

728
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,255
We're family.

729
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,528
How did it go with Mun?

730
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,851
Mun.

731
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,855
I'm sorry I kept you waiting for so long.

732
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:23,849
Mun…

733
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,768
His hair…

734
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,567
May…

735
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:37,947
I

736
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,366
wake up?

737
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,992
Mun!

738
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:51,418
Come on. Weren't you waiting for me?

739
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:55,047
I expected a bouquet of flowers.
I should go back to sleep then.

740
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,967
-Mun!
-You little brat!

741
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:58,485
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

742
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,029
Come to think of it,

743
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,198
their powers

744
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,533
were nothing compared to yours.

745
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,035
Don't tell me

746
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:09,121
he's planning to kill Ma Ju-seok
and consume his power?

747
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,581
I smell Ma Ju-seok.

748
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:12,374
He's near Ms. Lee's columbarium.

749
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,543
He's taking Lee Chung-jae there.

750
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:18,505
Don't tell me
you can absorb the territory's--

751
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,590
Something's wrong.

752
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:20,841
Mr. Ma.

753
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,426
We found Hwang Pil-gwang.

754
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,095
It was in here, Ma Ju-seok.

755
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,097
The truth behind your wife's death.

756
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,563
