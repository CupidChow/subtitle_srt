00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,774
JUNGJIN, REPUBLIC OF KOREA

3
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,192
Get on the bus now!

4
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:12,197
Get on the bus now!

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,365
Mister, look at this.

6
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,867
This is for you.

7
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,454
Children, put your seatbelts on.

8
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,540
-Na-yul, come and sit down.
-Okay.

9
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,047
YOU ARE NICE

10
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,692
Did you all put your seatbelts on?

11
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,277
-Yes!
-Yes!

12
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,363
Sir, you can go now.

13
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,073
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,331
DASEUL KINDERGARTEN

15
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,898
It set foot.

16
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,053
Excuse me, sir.

17
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,015
Could we slow down a little?

18
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,308
The kids are scared.

19
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,395
But why? I'm having a blast.

20
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,730
What?

21
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,376
An evil spirit's driving
a kindergarten bus.

22
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,337
Daseul Kindergarten.

23
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,047
A yellow bus with clouds on it.

24
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,132
Toward Jungjin Intersection.

25
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,809
Where are you?

26
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,646
Are you hiding because you're scared?

27
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,649
Once I catch you, you're dead meat!

28
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,828
Let me make this more fun.

29
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,505
You punk!

30
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,885
Goodness, you little ones!

31
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,697
To Jungjin 2-ga!

32
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,032
The kids are in danger!

33
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,327
It hurts to see kids cry.
Let's get this done fast.

34
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,842
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

35
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,140
What the heck?

36
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,474
What the…

37
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,727
Hey!

38
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,603
Damn it. Get out of the way!

39
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,775
Please stop!

40
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,910
It's headed towards Jungjin Boulevard.

41
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,369
We have to stop it.

42
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,621
I'll go.

43
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,332
Let's go, Ms. Chu!

44
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,084
Wait. Someone's hurt.

45
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,955
Darn it.

46
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,695
Mommy!

47
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,698
-Mommy!
-God damn it.

48
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,568
You need to learn how to drive.

49
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,335
Damn it.

50
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,836
I can't stop the bus.

51
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,129
The brakes don't work.

52
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,425
Jungjin Bridge 3 is
under construction now.

53
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,593
Make your way there.

54
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,094
Okay.

55
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,932
We must protect the kids.

56
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,019
Ha-na!

57
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,895
END OF THE ROAD

58
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,336
This ends here no matter what.

59
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,004
Bring it on.

60
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,881
Hold on tight, kids!

61
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,623
Are you okay?

62
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,916
Are you all right?

63
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,418
Is anyone hurt?

64
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,045
Ma'am, are you okay?

65
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,255
Yes, I'm okay.

66
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,757
Na-yul.

67
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,301
No.

68
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,719
Put her down.

69
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,266
Put her down!

70
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,977
I was having so much fun,

71
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,563
but you ruined my plan.

72
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,902
No.

73
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,702
Put the kid down.

74
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,412
You little…

75
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,880
Don't move.

76
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,509
Don't. Keeping the girl safe comes first.

77
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,553
Stay where you are!

78
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,442
What's going on?

79
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,628
Sorry I'm late.

80
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,923
I kept you waiting.

81
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,016
Mun!

82
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,393
Mun, you rascal.

83
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,105
Didn't you hear what I said?

84
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,025
Remember.

85
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,611
You killed this girl.

86
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,780
-No!
-Damn it!

87
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,027
You're safe now. It's all over.

88
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,158
Not for you, though.

89
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,045
Bye.

90
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,593
Well done.

91
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,513
Hi.

92
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,224
Right. Should we cover the kids' eyes?

93
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,476
They should see him get punished a little.

94
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,687
Still, let's erase their memories later.

95
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,314
So they don't have nightmares.

96
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,107
That's so sweet of you.

97
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,567
It's okay now.

98
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,290
Mun.

99
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,000
Did you eat some wild ginseng?

100
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,715
Jeez, you scared me.

101
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
Wow, nice landing.

102
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,977
Are you ever going to show up on time?

103
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,605
Mun, I thought you were never coming.

104
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,149
Maybe he thinks he's
the main character here.

105
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,901
-No--
-He's delusional.

106
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,653
He can definitely be the main character.

107
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,820
What matters is I'm here.

108
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,615
Can't you cure him, Ms. Chu?

109
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,991
I can't.

110
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,452
It's great to be all together like this.

111
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,662
I know, right?

112
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,704
What's he doing?

113
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,582
What a pathetic life.

114
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,461
I'll summon it.

115
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,635
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

116
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,346
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

117
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,640
Again?

118
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,850
Yes, sir.

119
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,476
Again.

120
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,939
We couldn't find him even with an APB
on him for robbery and murder.

121
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,900
But how did Mo-tak know
he was a kindergarten bus driver?

122
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,402
-He just…
-Yeah?

123
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,196
-He said he had a hunch.
-Exactly!

124
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,449
Where did that hunch come from?

125
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,994
It was while he was pooping
in the bathroom.

126
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,704
I know!

127
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,957
How does he catch criminals
every time he goes to the bathroom?

128
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,748
Well done, Mun.

129
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,416
Anytime.

130
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,836
SO MUN, WI-GEN

131
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,838
Ha-na, are you all right?

132
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,881
Of course.

133
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,051
U-sik, did you lose weight?

134
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,138
HA-NA, U-SIK

135
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,808
Mom, great job with the steel pipe.

136
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,106
CHU MAE-OK, SU-HO

137
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,486
It's Ga Mo-tak again.

138
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,824
Okay.

139
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,826
I said okay.

140
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,495
I get it, Mo-tak.

141
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,789
No, you're not getting it!

142
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,583
Does my body have to break down
for you to feel remorse?

143
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,045
There's a limit to how much
you can boss me around.

144
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,507
I'm working my butt off, you know.

145
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,638
Mo-tak! It's me, Han-ul.

146
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,349
-What's up?
-Please open the door!

147
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,602
This is from the captain.

148
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,813
-What's this?
-He said to go catch more criminals.

149
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,772
Han-ul.

150
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,275
Pink?

151
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,865
I get why Mo-tak is upset.

152
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,701
When you convinced him to work two jobs

153
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,745
to catch more evil spirits,
remember what you said?

154
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,583
You said you'd get us
a new, energetic member!

155
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,751
And our sweet Mun.

156
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,423
He even gave up his college education
to toil away for this.

157
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,592
-Why would you bring that up?
-Tell them.

158
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,343
I thought you got rejected.

159
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,722
I did apply for schools
a bit out of my league on purpose.

160
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,973
What did you say again?

161
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,558
Play along, will you?

162
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,978
Still, Mo-tak is back
in the police force now,

163
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,189
which helps the Counters settle cases.

164
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,151
And Choi Jang-mul is helping you out too.

165
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,487
Chairman Choi is at the age
where he'll have to hang it up soon.

166
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,405
She's right!

167
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,741
Why do you take it out on me?

168
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,915
The meeting at Yung
is taking longer than I thought.

169
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,626
Goodness, Ms. Chu.

170
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,213
We overdid it a bit, didn't we?

171
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,136
So we haven't found anyone suitable yet?

172
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,513
Being a Counter isn't easy.

173
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,768
We're doing our best in the search,
so please wait a little longer.

174
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,729
Maybe the partner is being too picky.

175
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,153
Why in the world is everyone so selfish?

176
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,156
When I think I've found a good one,

177
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,951
they lack manners.

178
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,078
Ha-na, don't.

179
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,958
The partnership between Counters
and Yung people is important.

180
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,293
You have to think
of the ones in the field.

181
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,629
You can't turn down
every applicant, Jong-guk.

182
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,508
You see, I'm not doing this for my sake.

183
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,803
If we hire the wrong person,
you'll be the ones who suffer.

184
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,762
What did you say?

185
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,013
You rude little…

186
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,348
Ma'am.

187
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,641
What a jerk.

188
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,274
All right. Mr. So's
psychokinesis class will begin.

189
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,276
First was a grain of rice.

190
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,485
Second was a kidney bean.

191
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,238
Then, we kicked it up
a notch and used a golf ball.

192
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,074
Seeing you improve day by day

193
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,743
makes me feel so proud as your teacher.

194
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,537
Just summon the territory already.

195
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,747
All right. For today…

196
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,257
Wouldn't this be too heavy?

197
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,216
Did you forget?

198
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,227
Good. Now, shall we begin with Ms. Chu?

199
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,450
Feel the territory.

200
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,120
As if you're fishing,
reel in the energy emerging from it.

201
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,040
Very good, Ms. Chu.

202
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,708
I can feel the strong energy!

203
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,881
Ms. Chu, you did it!

204
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,799
-Awesome!
-I wish I could do that too!

205
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,012
Don't strain yourself, okay?

206
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,640
What's this?

207
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,643
For goodness' sake.

208
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,729
Well done, Ms. Chu.

209
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,191
All thanks to our handsome teacher.

210
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,901
Teachers are crucial in everything.

211
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,695
And you're a ten out of ten student.

212
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,281
Now, Ms. Do Ha-na?

213
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,412
Ha-na, you're so good.

214
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,122
It's like nothing can stop her.

215
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,916
How did she master it so quickly?

216
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,001
Pretty good.

217
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:04,966
Had extra classes?

218
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,635
Not my first rodeo.

219
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,308
Mo-tak!

220
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,770
Who is he praying to?

221
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,732
-Mr. Ga Mo-tak.
-Yes?

222
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,695
-Mr. Ga.
-Yes.

223
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,905
Believe in yourself!

224
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,365
Believe, Mr. Ga!

225
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,783
Believe!

226
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,077
-Believe!
-Believe!

227
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,162
Now, close your eyes and focus!

228
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,416
One more time!

229
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,128
Ga Mo-tak!

230
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,184
Finally, I did it!

231
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,113
Oh, my.

232
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,034
Mo-tak.

233
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,204
At least this ant's pretty big.

234
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,707
Goodness.
If an ant required that much effort,

235
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,126
just imagine
what a fly would've done to him.

236
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,169
Damn it.

237
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,546
Mo-tak, you need a blood transfusion.

238
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,173
It's just my snot.

239
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,674
No, you should stop here.

240
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:28,592
It's just snot.

241
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,051
-Who wants ice cream?
-Give it up.

242
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,969
I do!

243
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,137
I want strawberry.

244
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,389
He never seems to improve.

245
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,184
It's okay. You'll get there soon.

246
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,769
I said stop!

247
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,745
Good work, guys.

248
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,163
Ju-seok, any plans tomorrow?

249
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,916
Come fishing with us.
We have all the gear.

250
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,210
Man, you're so clueless.

251
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,338
A passionate guy like him
always has plans on his days off.

252
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,549
He's going to have a good time

253
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,051
with his lady.

254
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,510
You're right.

255
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,138
Don't you get tired of things getting hot?

256
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,599
I guess I was born for it.

257
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,767
Have a nice day off.

258
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,269
And let's hope for no calls.

259
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,812
-Please.
-I'm off.

260
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,522
-Bye.
-Have a good one.

261
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,775
Don't get too hot.
Or we'll come put it out.

262
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,444
Bye.

263
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,905
-Take it easy.
-Likewise.

264
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,658
HANMARU SENIOR CENTER
MAKING KIMCHI WITH JANGMUL RETAIL

265
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,118
One, two…

266
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,204
-Careful.
-Give it to me.

267
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,705
Haven't you eaten or what?

268
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,249
There's one more upstairs. Bring it.

269
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,250
I'll take this one.

270
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,751
Grandpa, the cabbages.

271
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,045
Don't bring too many at once.

272
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,672
It's too heavy.

273
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,631
Let me carry it.

274
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,548
Oh, my.

275
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,050
Bring it over here.

276
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,009
Okay.

277
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,304
Aren't you being too lovey-dovey
in front of someone single?

278
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,098
Honey, I told you to take it easy.

279
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,517
-Didn't I say Ms. Chu wouldn't like it?
-What?

280
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,812
No way. Ms. Chu isn't single.

281
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,981
I have a heart that's just as full

282
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,150
of love and passion as yours, Mr. Ma.

283
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,069
Love and passion, my foot.

284
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,946
Enough. Get back to work.

285
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,114
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,866
-Over there.
-Where?

287
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,410
Here I come.

288
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,955
Can we have some kimchi here?

289
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,623
You help yourself.

290
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,751
Care and effort are
the best ingredients for kimchi.

291
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,545
That's so true.

292
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:32,382
What's the occasion?
Your eyes are full of life today.

293
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,926
My goodness.

294
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,554
Look at the color
of this delicious kimchi!

295
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,097
Can I try some?

296
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,557
Of course, you can.

297
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,018
All right. Let me try some.

298
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,233
Grandma!

299
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,151
Oh, no.

300
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,612
Don't eat it. It's for my darling.

301
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,656
Goodness.

302
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,284
Goodness, honey. Why did you do that?

303
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,911
You put the seasoning all over his face!

304
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,330
-Goodness.
-Sir.

305
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,750
The restroom's there.

306
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,544
Did my lady cause trouble again?

307
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,130
Darling!

308
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,798
Kimchi.

309
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,805
She always does that.

310
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,099
You must be so jealous, sir.

311
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,559
Oh, not at all.

312
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,312
I'm just so grateful for him.

313
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,405
Come here!

314
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,074
Come here!

315
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,450
Come over here!

316
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,535
I said come here!

317
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,788
TWO YEARS AGO

318
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,164
Oh, my goodness.

319
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,377
Come here, Mun-yeong!

320
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,422
Oh, my goodness.

321
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,508
-Come here!
-Ma'am!

322
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,094
Instead of going there,

323
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,471
come play with me.

324
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,681
Stay back.

325
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,894
You're scaring my Mun-yeong away.

326
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,354
Come here, Mun-yeong.

327
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,480
Mun-yeong?

328
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,150
Mun-yeong?

329
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,445
My daughter.

330
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:18,988
Mun-yeong is…

331
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,698
Yes?

332
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,127
Okay?

333
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,087
-Okay.
-That's right.

334
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,171
Okay. Fine.

335
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:36,965
Ma'am!

336
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,425
Ma'am!

337
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,057
Ju-seok, are you okay?

338
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,434
Yes, I'm okay.

339
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,686
Honey, are you okay?

340
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:53,982
Darling.

341
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,906
Thank goodness.

342
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,075
I'm so glad they're safe.

343
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,747
He's been her "darling"
ever since that day.

344
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,375
What did Mr. Ma say to her then?

345
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,337
I don't know. Even to this day,
he hasn't told me.

346
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,381
He says it's a secret or something.

347
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,051
-Piggyback.
-Get on my back.

348
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,846
Wait, Grandma.

349
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,473
You can't do that to him.

350
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,391
-I'll carry her.
-No, I'm okay.

351
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,351
He worked overtime yesterday.

352
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,895
He's tired. Let me carry you.

353
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,480
You underestimate my strength.

354
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,732
I'm still young. It's all right.

355
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,858
-He's okay.
-Ma'am.

356
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,444
-Are you comfortable?
-Yes, I love it.

357
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,987
My back's so broad, isn't it?

358
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,864
-It's great.
-More than Mun's, right?

359
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,199
My back's much broader.

360
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,326
Hop on me. I'll carry you.

361
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,578
Come on, Grandma.

362
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,913
Mr. Ma.

363
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,956
Grandma!

364
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,087
Mr. Ma.

365
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,216
Grandpa says he's very grateful for you.

366
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,053
He said you always take time out
to visit her despite being busy.

367
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,180
Of course. I have to visit her.

368
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,139
I'm her darling.

369
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,809
Oh, come on.

370
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,519
I'm the one who is grateful.

371
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,189
When Min-ji was having a hard time,
your grandparents

372
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,024
and your noodle shop coworkers

373
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,859
gave her so much support.

374
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,736
You did too, Mun.

375
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,238
Oh, I didn't do anything.

376
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,159
Is Ms. Lee doing better now?

377
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,662
She seems a lot more at ease.

378
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,289
She's doing very well.

379
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,172
By the way, Mr. Ma.

380
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,802
Is it really a secret?

381
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,053
What?

382
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,013
What you said to Grandma that day.

383
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,307
Come on. You can tell me now.

384
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,309
I thought we were close.

385
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,436
How can I tell you? It's a secret.

386
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,980
A secret between us two.

387
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,109
I'm starting to feel hurt now.

388
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:07,407
Hey, I do have another secret.

389
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,367
Really? What is it?

390
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,787
Come on. Tell me.

391
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,002
I'm going to be a father soon.

392
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,923
I just found out only recently.

393
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,300
-What?
-Hey.

394
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,301
Oh, my God!

395
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,218
That's amazing!

396
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,847
Attention, everyone!

397
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,433
Mr. Ma is going to be a father!

398
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,685
Ms. Lee is pregnant!

399
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,103
-Oh, my goodness!
-Hey.

400
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,438
That's unbelievable!

401
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,315
He's going to be a dad!

402
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,526
Goodness, congratulations!

403
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:44,861
Congratulations!

404
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,489
Thank you!

405
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,408
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

406
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,910
Hooray!

407
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,870
Hooray!

408
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,873
Gosh, I'm so happy for you.

409
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,000
They say life's full of ups and downs.

410
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,378
After all that hardship,
good things are happening.

411
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,546
I'm so happy for you.

412
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,632
Congratulations.

413
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,508
Thanks, Ms. Chu.

414
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,509
Sure.

415
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,597
Min-ji, make sure your baby
takes after you and not Mr. Ma.

416
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,599
Promise me, okay?

417
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,808
What about Mr. Ma?

418
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,685
Except for his face, he's fine.

419
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,062
Ms. Chu!

420
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,692
Keeping this secret
must've been torture for that romantic.

421
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,985
Congratulations.

422
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,448
Thank you.

423
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,283
Thank you.

424
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,500
We have two more elders to visit, right?

425
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,919
Yeah, one of them is in a nursing home.

426
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,170
So we can go there last.

427
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,380
Get lost!

428
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,176
Hey.

429
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,428
Hey, what are you…

430
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,556
-Get lost!
-Hey.

431
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,766
Get lost, you…

432
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,977
Hey, you can't do that to an animal!

433
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,687
It's none of your business!

434
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,404
How dare you talk like that!

435
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,155
I'm much older than you!

436
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,699
Mun, enough.

437
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,536
What happened?

438
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,497
Move, you annoying jerk!

439
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,582
Hey.

440
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,294
Hey, wait!

441
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,515
Where's the money?

442
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,599
Tell me.

443
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,810
You thought I wouldn't find you?

444
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,146
Where's the money?

445
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,188
Where did you hide it?

446
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,734
Tell me! Where did you hide the money?

447
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,236
-Stop!
-Your mother's life insurance money!

448
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,071
-Please stop.
-Move!

449
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,658
Hey, son.

450
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,077
Come here.

451
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,997
I said come here!

452
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,249
Stop, you little rat!

453
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,337
Where did your mommy hide the money?

454
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,964
I don't know.

455
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,507
You don't know?

456
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,470
You're just like your mother.

457
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,264
I need to beat some sense into you too!

458
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,269
Who the hell are you?

459
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,771
Let go, you bastard.

460
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,774
He's not an evil spirit.

461
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,072
Stay back, Jun-hui!

462
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,827
You're just a bad person.

463
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,123
Jun-hui!

464
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,084
Who are you?

465
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,794
How dare you meddle with my family?

466
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,298
Mun, stop. The kid's watching.

467
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,138
I'll let you go,
but you have to stop this.

468
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,348
And never come back.

469
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,434
You don't hit your family.
You protect them.

470
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,859
That doesn't mean you can run away.

471
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,866
Please don't kill me.

472
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,535
I'll get the money by tomorrow.

473
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,412
Illegal gambling and domestic violence.

474
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,540
You should be arrested.

475
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,627
Hello.

476
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,087
I'd like to report a crime.

477
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,338
It's domestic violence.

478
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,383
EONNI'S NOODLES

479
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,808
Eat up before it gets cold.

480
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,894
Thank you.

481
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,688
Oh, it's nothing.

482
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,773
We sell noodles, so that's what you got.

483
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,318
It's Jun-hui, right?

484
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,904
I hope you like the noodles.

485
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,614
Do you like rolled eggs?

486
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,324
How about a pork cutlet?

487
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,419
He seems to like it.

488
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,847
Mo-tak, how did it go?

489
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,473
Well, obviously,

490
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,268
I took care of it.

491
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,395
We had hard evidence.

492
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,234
It turns out he committed more
than just domestic violence.

493
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,861
He won't be out for a while.

494
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:45,036
It seems everything went
the way you wanted.

495
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:51,042
But one day, he may show up again.

496
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,294
Is that okay with you?

497
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,967
Well, we can't live like this forever.

498
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,349
Right.

499
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,603
You can come by anytime you want.

500
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,190
To eat noodles or to chitchat with us.

501
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,983
Of course. We'll chitchat away.

502
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,324
If you want, we'll always be by your side.

503
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,078
Jun-hui, you can have
free noodles forever.

504
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,288
Thank you.

505
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,921
Good, isn't it?

506
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,589
Eat up.

507
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,466
Good kitty.

508
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,387
Jun-hui.

509
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,514
Want to feed the cat too?

510
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,688
Hey…

511
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,897
That little…

512
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,899
Puberty must have come early.

513
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,611
I wasn't like that at his age.

514
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,990
I guess Jun-hui's still afraid. Right?

515
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,702
-It's okay.
-I'm so nervous.

516
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,121
-Relax.
-Are you ready?

517
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,247
-Yes.
-Yes.

518
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,509
Heart rate is at 157 bpm.

519
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,511
Hi, Treasure.

520
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,305
I'm your mommy.

521
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,307
I'm your daddy.

522
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,391
Nice to meet you.

523
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,520
The baby has a strong
and healthy heartbeat.

524
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,901
Are you crying?

525
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,280
No, I'm not. Why would I?

526
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,157
It's okay to cry.

527
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,285
We've been through a lot, haven't we?

528
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,495
For two years,

529
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,875
you've had to pinch pennies because of me.

530
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,502
I'm really sorry.

531
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,339
Stop saying that.

532
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,467
It wasn't hard on me at all.

533
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,386
Even if it was, you…

534
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,847
and our baby are making up for it.

535
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,225
By the way,

536
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,937
isn't it amazing how this little thing

537
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,690
-can have such a loud heartbeat?
-Right?

538
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,233
It inherited our strength.

539
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,778
I hope our baby takes after you.

540
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,489
What are you talking about?

541
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,240
No way. Take back your words now.

542
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,658
I mean it.

543
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,036
I hope our baby has

544
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,831
your cute face and kind heart.

545
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,169
Thank you so much

546
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,421
for always protecting me.

547
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,131
I should thank you.

548
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,550
For staying so strong.

549
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,766
The third trial for Park,
the alleged financial source

550
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,019
of the Baekdu Dynasty housing sale scam

551
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,189
that swindled over 120 billion won
from 800 victims two years ago,

552
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,024
is set to begin on the 27th.

553
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,986
As Baekdu Planning & Construction's CEO,
Lee Chung-jae,

554
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,446
-committed suicide,
-Min-ji.

555
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,199
the whereabouts of the money
still remain a mystery.

556
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,992
Baekdu's accountant…

557
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,744
We have to get our money back.

558
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,373
Ten years' worth
of your hard-earned savings.

559
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,458
Min-ji.

560
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,044
Min-ji, look at me.

561
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,755
We decided to move on.

562
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,549
We don't need the money.

563
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,050
Okay?

564
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,845
We can't let it shake us up now.

565
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,222
Remember, when you feel anxious…

566
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,392
I should look at you.

567
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,353
That's right.

568
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,647
Just look at me.

569
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,650
Just look at me.

570
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,121
PARK SEONG-UK CLAIMS INNOCENCE
OF FRAUD AND EMBEZZLEMENT

571

THE OUTSKIRTS OF JIRAN, CHINA

572
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,463
NOTORIOUS CROOK LEE KILLS HIMSELF

573
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,630
WHERE IS THE 120 BILLION?

574
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,660
That asshole finally died.

575
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,246
Congratulations.

576
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,419
I guess…

577
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,799
I guess we're done here now.

578
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,808
What's with those eyes?

579
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,693
Don't give me such a sexy look.

580
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,696
Sexy?

581
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,874
You're being funny today.

582
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:13,299
You know today's Ms. So's birthday, right?

583
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:18,554
How about we do this quickly
and go eat some noodles?

584
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,848
Can we eat something else?

585
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,726
Aren't you tired of eating
noodles every day?

586
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,145
You're supposed to eat
noodles on birthdays.

587
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,354
Am I wrong?

588
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,065
Ms. Chu makes the best noodles.

589
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,028
After we get these guys,
let's go on a vacation to Korea.

590
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,197
The kid who can summon a huge territory.

591
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:43,037
We'll probably get to meet him in Korea.

592
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,538
Let's go.

593
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,467
Nothing unusual back here.

594
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,472
The territory's weak at the moment,
so be careful, Ms. So.

595
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,978
Oh, my goodness.

596
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,397
What is it, Ms. So?

597
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,110
They're no ordinary evil spirits.

598
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,238
I see a lot of dead bodies.

599
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,290
Are you okay?

600
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,249
Don't be scared.

601
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,334
I'm here to help.

602
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,715
Hang on.

603
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,137
She's alive.

604
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,441
That's…

605
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,527
How did you do that?

606
00:44:58,946 --> 00:44:59,905
Man,

607
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:02,950
that's dope.

608
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,493
You…

609
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,287
Do what you just did on this too.

610
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,416
Come on. Do it!

611
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:11,959
Do it again.

612
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,837
You're an evil spirit.

613
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,588
Who are you, lady?

614
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,418
Papa, this one's no ordinary evil spirit.

615
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,421
Don't do anything rash.
I'll be right there.

616
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,190
If it's heads, you'll live.

617
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,445
If it's tails, you die.

618
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,920
Die.

619
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,840
A ferry ticket to Korea?

620
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,010
Who are you really?

621
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,100
How many people have you killed?

622
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,103
Don't even think of riding
any ferries today!

623
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,105
Who are you?

624
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,398
Answer me.

625
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,484
How did you know?

626
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:15,452
It hurts, doesn't it? You bastard!

627
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,831
No!

628
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,793
Please don't kill me.

629
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,223
This is what happens

630
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,601
when you help others,

631
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,062
old lady.

632
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,378
Interesting.

633
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,796
I was finally having some fun.

634
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,674
Did I finish him off too soon?

635
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,668
It's okay.

636
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,004
These bastards.

637
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,548
They're just a bit hard to digest.

638
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,352
Don't move.

639
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,023
I'm healing you.

640
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,908
Gelly, look.

641
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,784
I healed you.

642
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,412
Wong…

643
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,250
Did you get this power
after killing that woman?

644
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:34,544
Isn't it awesome?

645
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,090
Wait. How did you know it was a woman?

646
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,929
That asshole read my memories earlier.

647
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,061
So is that how I could read yours?

648
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,856
Seriously, who are these pricks?

649
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,373
Pil-gwang.

650
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,462
The time has finally come.

651
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,596
Let's go back.

652
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,183
Damn it.

653
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,894
Those scoundrels.

654
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,231
I can't believe this.

655
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,400
Papa and Ms. So…

656
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,944
I still vividly remember their kind faces.

657
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,324
I keep losing my friends.

658
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,619
I guess I'm getting old now.

659
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,623
What's very unfortunate is

660
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:40,837
the evil spirits now have
the Counters' powers.

661
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,507
They have the Counters' powers?

662
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,885
If a level three evil spirit
absorbs a Counter's soul,

663
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,346
it absorbs the Counter's powers, too.

664
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:56,019
Wait. Does that mean
they've become like us now?

665
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,354
They can read and erase memories

666
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,398
and heal people?

667
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,486
Those damn evil spirits.

668
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,739
Have we located them yet?

669
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,574
Not yet.

670
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,575
Jeez.

671
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,162
What about our new Counter?

672
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,042
We need a new Counter
to deal with a situation like this.

673
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,336
Jong-guk is preparing for the interview.

674
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,879
Please wait a bit longer.

675
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,589
You always say that!

676
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,216
In any case,

677
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,054
it'll be a battle unlike anything before.

678
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,480
I bet you think it's over now.

679
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,275
This fight will go on forever.

680
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,861
Your cursed fate

681
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,323
will lead you to a painful death.

682
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,909
And everyone around you

683
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,329
will also die like that because of you.

684
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,595
I just can't imagine

685
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,849
evil spirits with our powers.

686
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,438
Are you worried?

687
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,817
Maybe we should go over there.

688
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,529
To find them as soon as possible.

689
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,158
To locate the evil spirits,

690
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,578
Yung is doing everything they can.

691
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,664
For the time being,

692
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,710
we want you as Counters
to focus on training.

693
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,006
But this time,

694
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,216
I'm really worried.

695
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,677
As we have done in the past,

696
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,722
we shall prevail over this crisis.

697
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,268
Don't you think so, Mun?

698
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,521
I do.

699
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,356
I'll do as you say.

700
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,193
No matter who we'll have to fight,

701
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,778
the stronger they get,

702
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,364
the stronger we'll get too.

703
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,078
All of us

704
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,831
are grateful for you, Mun.

705
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,417
Always.

706
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,044
You know that, right?

707
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:28,796
This is cringey.

708
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:36,346
If there's anything troubling you,
don't hesitate to share with me.

709
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,933
Okay, I won't.

710
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,906
Has it been two years?

711
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,995
I wonder if things have changed a lot.

712
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,459
Things will change from now on.

713
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,213
Because we've changed.

714
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:19,430
Now, we're going to make

715
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,767
a completely different world.

716
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:45,790
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

717
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:51,254
I haven't done anything for you,

718
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,133
but you've grown up so well.

719
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,010
Thank you so much.

720
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,391
How about we go to the market,
eat some tteokbokki,

721
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,603
get a haircut, and buy some clothes today?

722
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,772
Cat food.

723
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,316
What?

724
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,944
We should buy some cat food too.

725
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,822
For cats.

726
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,283
The packaged stuff.

727
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,079
Sure.

728
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,957
Let's go buy some cat food.

729
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,424
It's not Dad.

730
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,467
Don't worry.

731
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,477
Who is it?

732
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,817
They shouldn't be so different.

733
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:58,321
Ji Cheong-sin used psychokinesis.
Baek Hyang-hui could read memories.

734
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,697
What's important is

735
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,909
we have less Counters
and more evil spirits using our powers.

736
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,412
If evil spirits like these multiply,

737
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,122
the world could fall into chaos.

738
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,749
Ha-na is right.

739
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,295
Papa said he'd recently finished
psychokinesis training.

740
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,593
-Goodness.
-Right now?

741
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,225
Repeat after me.

742
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,065
Repeat after me one more time!
Haven't you eaten or what?

743
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,156
-I can!
-That's right.

744
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,783
That's the spirit.

745
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,201
-You can do it.
-We can!

746
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,119
You can do it.

747
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,162
You're right. We must keep our heads up.

748
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,497
We have to succeed.

749
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,541
That's right.

750
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,961
Let's wipe out
all the evil spirits in the world!

751
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,213
That's our job.

752
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,424
And after we crush them,

753
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:02,885
we'll retire and enjoy some refreshing…

754
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,804
That sounds so good.

755
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,057
We'll enjoy beer like this!

756
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,269
You evil spirits, bring it on!

757
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,186
It set foot.

758
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,689
-Oh, come on.
-Seriously?

759
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,815
That was quick.

760
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:17,817
Ha-na, what's up?

761
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,319
Jun-hui and his mom.

762
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,113
They're in danger.

763
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,031
He's in danger? What do you mean?

764
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:24,949
That little boy?

765
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,786
His father shouldn't be out already.
He wasn't even an evil spirit.

766
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,747
There's no time for this! Let's go!

767
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,457
Okay. Let's go.

768
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,625
-I…
-Watch your mouth, okay?

769
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,377
Hurry! Let's go!

770
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,422
Mom!

771
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,339
Jun-hui!

772
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,049
-Mom!
-Jun-hui!

773
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,053
All right.

774
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:50,475
So your husband signed here
to waive his physical rights.

775
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,519
But then he was sent to prison.

776
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,563
I gave you my bankbook!

777
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,523
I have to live.

778
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,066
Jun-hui, my son…

779
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,735
I have to raise my boy!

780
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:01,694
God, you little…

781
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,655
That's just the principal.

782
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:06,949
Hey.

783
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,828
What are you waiting for? Let's begin.

784
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,498
The plane will be landing soon.

785
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,293
Come on! Get the place ready
for surgery now!

786
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,465
Stay still.

787
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,841
Doctor.

788
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,636
Let's take out the paired ones first.

789
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,013
One eye and one kidney.

790
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,808
Once the wound heals,
you'll have no problem breathing.

791
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,309
No!

792
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:37,146
Mom!

793
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,692
You're worth more

794
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,946
as a dead person than as a living one.

795
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,989
Mom!

796
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,535
Jun-hui!

797
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,745
No!

798
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,710
It's going to sting a little.

799
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,465
Mom!

800
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,300
Mom!

801
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:09,762
Doctor.

802
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:10,680
What about him?

803
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,431
We'll operate on him too.

804
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,683
He's worth money too.

805
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,351
What? But he's a kid.

806
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,104
Damn, the plane must have arrived by now.

807
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,357
This country has a low birth rate,
so he's a rare product.

808
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,234
Whatever you say.

809
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,988
Please don't kill me.

810
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,144
What's wrong with my arm?

811
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,480
What's happening to my arm?

812
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,212
Who are those punks?

813
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,173
Ha-na was right.

814
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,634
One evil spirit and some garbage…

815
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,552
Two, four, seven…

816
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,512
You're confusing me.
Why are there so many?

817
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,350
They look like they're no match for us.

818
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,228
-Hey, come here.
-Yes, sir.

819
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:45,149
Look at these pathetic idiots.

820
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,736
How dare you barge into our lab?

821
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,617
Oh, sorry.

822
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:01,666
Let's begin.

823
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,250
Don't beat them too much.

824
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,794
Ms. Chu will get tired.

825
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:07,171
It's okay to beat them too much.

826
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:08,589
-It is?
-Yeah.

827
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:09,924
I'll only heal them a little.

828
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,179
Okay. Class registered.

829
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,931
Life Lessons 101

830
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,391
begins now.

831
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,229
First period.

832
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:27,942
Do not mess with good people!

833
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,547
You're so weak, young man.

834
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,757
Learn to respect your elders!

835
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,720
If these were the old days,
you'd all be dead.

836
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,351
Who on earth are you?

837
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,479
Who are you? Why is my arm like this?

838
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,939
-Why?
-Give it.

839
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,568
Who are you?

840
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,320
Let me see what's inside your stomach.

841
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,131
-Jun-hui!
-Mom.

842
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,300
Wake up!

843
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,597
Let me take a look.

844
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,561
Jun-hui, your mom is all right.

845
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:46,771
Are you okay too?

846
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:52,276
Good. Now, close your eyes
and count to 100.

847
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,361
Then, your mom will wake up.

848
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,322
Can you do that?

849
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,532
Good boy.

850
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:00,117
Now…

851
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,329
Here. Listen to this.

852
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,211
Zero,

853
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,754
one,

854
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,547
two,

855
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,049
three,

856
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:17,635
four,

857
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:19,386
five,

858
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,098
six,

859
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:24,642
seven…

860
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,958
Who are these bastards?

861
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,376
Who the hell do you work for?

862
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:55,172
Who are we?

863
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,466
Eonni's Gang.

864
01:08:59,051 --> 01:08:59,969
Thirty-four,

865
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:02,388
thirty-five,

866
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,266
thirty-six,

867
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,394
thirty-seven…

868
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:23,659
Hey, you…

869
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,295
Drop the toy.

870
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:37,339
Drop it.

871
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,343
Come here.

872
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:42,720
I don't want to.

873
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:46,390
Why can't you idiots
understand what I'm saying?

874
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,101
You need to listen up. Okay?

875
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,103
Let me help you.

876
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:13,751
What's going on?

877
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:17,421
Hey, mister. Where are you going?

878
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,342
Just wait there for a while, okay?

879
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:22,760
Is the air fresh up there?

880
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,428
I'll put you down if you repent.

881
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,138
Help!

882
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,265
I'm scared of heights!

883
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,350
Hey!

884
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:32,853
What…

885
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:34,647
Mo-tak.

886
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:41,695
Did you see that?

887
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,781
I…

888
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,701
Without even a nosebleed.

889
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,870
I finally…

890
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,455
-Good job.
-I did great!

891
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:52,831
I did it!

892
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:53,749
Ninety,

893
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:55,459
ninety-one,

894
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,419
ninety-two,

895
01:10:58,629 --> 01:10:59,672
ninety-three,

896
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,091
ninety-four,

897
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,510
ninety-five,

898
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,638
ninety-six,

899
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,141
ninety-seven,

900
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,227
ninety-eight,

901
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,647
ninety-nine,

902
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,315
one hundred.

903
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,820
Jun-hui.

904
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:25,990
Mom.

905
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,914
See? I told you she'd wake up after 100.

906
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:44,550
-Well done.
-Good job.

907
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,306
You little…

908
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,568
How do we clean all of this up?

909
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,697
Goodness. It'll be a lot of work
to erase all their memories.

910
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:11,160
We can make it seem like
they beat each other up.

911
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,038
I don't see why not.

912
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,923
-What are you doing?
-I didn't do it.

913
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,280
He's enjoying this.

914
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,853
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

915
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:24,858
With a noble self-sacrificing attitude,
he risked his own life to save another.

916
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,819
I've found him.

917
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:29,613
I'm the new Count.
My name is Na Jeok-bong.

918
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:30,989
Why mess with our money?

919
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,367
Guests

920
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,494
are always welcome.

921
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,621
It set foot.

922
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,457
I think he can see the territory.

923
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,917
That's what a hero does.

924
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,837
At the most crucial moment,

925
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,796
bam!

926
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:48,882
Enough playing around,
you goddamn evil spirit!

927
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:55,931
