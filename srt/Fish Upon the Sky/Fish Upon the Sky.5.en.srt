1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,770
Pi, you dipshit!

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,820
What did you do last night?

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,580
It was just a misunderstanding.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,590
Don’t listen to them.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,060
The professor said there’s a fifth-year student in our class.

6
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,960
You never told me which Faculty you’re in.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,920
Dentistry.

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,700
Wanna go see a movie?

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,480
Sure.

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,970
Muang Nan asked him out for a movie.

11
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,780
What should I do?

12
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,460
Find a chance to be alone with him.

13
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,920
Pi, you're here too?

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,990
Don’t tell me you invited him too, Mork.

15
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,270
Our target is out.

16
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,350
Tell everyone to get ready.

17
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,770
Oh, no!

18
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,940
I can keep you company, Nan.

19
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,090
Can you take Mork home for me?

20
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,800
My place.

21
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,680
Go!

22
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,340
- Not them.
- No.

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,940
Is this the car?

24
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,320
It is!

25
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,740
Let’s go.

26
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,320
This way.

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,360
Let’s go.

28
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,150
I know.

29
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,020
I feel like I know this area.

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,650
Hey!

31
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,080
What?

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,870
There’re a lot of fierce dogs in this alley.

33
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,530
[Beware of the fierce dogs!]

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,780
What did you say?

35
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,330
I came here before.

36
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,060
Someone in that condo has 7 pitbulls.

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,450
That sounds familiar.

38
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,240
What are we gonna do?

39
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,570
Should we back off?

40
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,960
We’ve come this far.

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,830
There’s no turning back.

42
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,280
Let’s go on.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,570
Kleau Kang!!

44
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,260
I have my weapon.

45
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,380
I was saving this for dinner.

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,740
Just give it to them.

47
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,540
EP.5 - SAILING THE SHIP

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,540
Is this your house?

49
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,710
That’s right.

50
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,190
My family is about to have a meal together.

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,430
Do you want to introduce yourself…

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,910
and tell them about our relationship?

53
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,560
No!

54
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,230
No meal or no introduction?

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,270
No relationship between us.

56
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,270
But I want us to have one.

57
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,770
Come on.

58
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,020
Stop being flirty.

59
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,890
I don’t want to be involved with

60
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,480
or know your family members.

61
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,180
Is that clear?

62
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,830
That’s not fair.

63
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,830
I know your brothers.

64
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,010
When did you know them?

65
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,870
They’re those guys in kurtas and turbans, trying to cause the car accident.

66
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,490
Do you think I couldn't tell they’re in disguise?

67
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,150
You think this is a prime-time drama that when you wear a fake mustache, no one remembers?

68
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,070
No wonder why audiences prefer K-dramas these days.

69
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,340
Are you complaining about me or TV shows?

70
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,320
Nope. Not complaining.

71
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,090
Hey, before you go…

72
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,190
Damn it, Mork.

73
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,950
What are you doing?

74
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,460
No pictures.

75
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,290
Give it here.

76
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,800
No. You can’t have it.

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,220
Why are you doing this?

78
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,600
Muang Nan can get the wrong idea.

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,630
Mork, no!

80
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,610
Stop it already.

81
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,670
One photo and that’s it.

82
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,500
Just one, right?

83
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,030
Smile.

84
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,170
Happy now?

85
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,230
Just stop.

86
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,920
Give that to me.

87
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,500
No way.

88
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,040
Give that to me.

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,470
Mork, just don’t!

90
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,190
Damn you! Will you stop?

91
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,510
You have been doing this all day.

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,150
Doing what?

93
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,930
Stop messing with me.

94
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,790
You want to set me and Muang Nan apart, don’t you?

95
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,170
I’m not messing with you.

96
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,170
I did everything

97
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,930
because I like you.

98
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,250
What did you say?

99
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,270
I said…

100
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,360
I really like you.

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,870
(Does he really mean it?)

102
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,530
I know it.

103
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,080
You’re just so easy, Mork.

104
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,040
You’re trying to divert me by saying you like me?

105
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,150
Such a planner.

106
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,690
How stupid do you think I am?

107
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,930
I’m a second-year dental student with a 3.8 GPA.

108
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,160
You can’t deceive me.

109
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,790
You done talking?

110
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,860
Yes, I am.

111
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,820
Get out of my car already.

112
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,270
Just don't dilly-dally. Hurry!

113
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,890
What now?

114
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,020
What do you want?

115
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,360
If you are not ready to open up your heart,

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,940
we can start by being friends.

117
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,600
Drive home safe.

118
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,430
I care about you.

119
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,710
(Why is he still there?)

120
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,660
(Why doesn’t he get inside?)

121
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,570
We lost them already.

122
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,620
Hey!

123
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,110
I think we should call it a day.

124
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,430
Take me to a doctor.

125
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,350
Why?

126
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,240
Crap!!

127
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,670
Kleau Kang!

128
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,150
Look at you! I think the seven of them got you.

129
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,270
Let’s go to a hospital.

130
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,220
You ride. I’ve got your back.

131
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,860
Can I just ride like this?

132
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,870
Are you sure?

133
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,930
No.

134
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,660
1 2 3.

135
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,200
I really like you.

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,760
(Since when does he like me?)

137
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,570
Whose phone is this?

138
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,710
(He has me on his wallpaper.)

139
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,830
(What the heck is he trying to do?)

140
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,990
Hello.

141
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,920
I forgot my phone in your car, didn’t I?

142
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,710
Yes.

143
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,550
Can you bring it back?

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,140
Why did you just call? I’m home already.

145
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,860
Or do you want me to go get it at your place?

146
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,910
Stop talking nonsense.

147
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,650
What!

148
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,620
What is this?

149
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,950
I just told you I’d come here.

150
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,780
Give it here.

151
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,340
Don’t make me force you.

152
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,710
What the heck?

153
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,830
No! Don’t!

154
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,700
Don’t!

155
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,210
No! No!

156
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,520
Don’t!!

157
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,530
What the heck are you doing, Pi?

158
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,990
Nothing.

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,690
I was just stretching.

160
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,450
(Crap! I was thinking about him.)

161
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,570
So how did it go?

162
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,590
Did you get to take your cute little Muang Nan home?

163
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,140
Take him home, my ass!

164
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,310
The Kitty gang ruined it all.

165
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,040
It was not Mork’s car.

166
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,140
It’s Muang Nan’s.

167
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,990
Not just that, your friends even crashed his car.

168
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,160
Is that so?

169
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,570
Sorry, bro.

170
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,850
Sorry.

171
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,430
What happened to your head?

172
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,740
Nothing.

173
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,620
See?

174
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,230
Damn! I shouldn’t have cared at all.

175
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,160
That’s how you show your concern?

176
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,790
Do you want more?

177
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,720
Easy, man.

178
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,650
Calm down, bro.

179
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,710
By the way,

180
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,740
I need to borrow your boxers.

181
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,710
Huh?

182
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,240
Don’t huh me!

183
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,530
You used to borrow my clothes all the time.

184
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,550
I can’t even borrow yours now?

185
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,950
Can I take one?

186
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,740
No!

187
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,150
That’s my last one.

188
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,700
There’s one more in here.

189
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,220
Or you can wear mine.

190
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,320
I hung them outside and should be dry by now.

191
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,310
That mustache looks good on you.

192
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,910
Very nice!

193
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,380
THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT

194
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,440
EP.5 - LOVE OR LIE

195
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,140
Who the heck is it?

196
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,080
I knew it was you.

197
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,840
(Meen: I’m sorry for yelling at you.)

198
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,860
That’s right, you ass...

199
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,860
Is it too harsh?

200
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,920
How should I respond to him?

201
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,770
Duean, I’m up here.

202
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,270
5 HOURS EARLIER

203
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,880
How did you get up there?

204
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,030
I heard a kitten meowing. I thought it couldn’t come down.

205
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,190
Where is it now?

206
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,210
Somewhere down there.

207
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,480
But now I’m the one who can’t come down.

208
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,180
How did you get up there in the first place?

209
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,710
I don’t know. Please help me.

210
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,430
Climb back down slowly.

211
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,410
I’ll catch you here.

212
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,660
I can’t. This tree is quite tall. I’m scared.

213
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,680
Don’t be. I’ll be catching you right here.

214
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,190
Come on down.

215
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,630
- No.
- Just trust me.

216
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,960
I can’t.

217
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,500
Just trust me, will you?

218
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,190
Hurry.

219
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,710
Slowly.

220
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,960
That’s right.

221
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,290
Are you gonna stay here forever?

222
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,750
Ouch!

223
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,140
What’s up?

224
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,730
Duean, look.

225
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,180
Stop! I can’t stand drama.

226
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,320
Ouch!

227
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Just hang in there.

228
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,420
Ouch!

229
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,380
It hurts.

230
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,670
Be strong.

231
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,310
Hey!

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,950
Don’t be a chicken.

233
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,010
But it hurts.

234
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,830
What are you looking at?

235
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,950
I didn’t think you’d have such cute stuff.

236
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,170
Someone gave it to me.

237
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,640
Your girlfriend?

238
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,600
My mother.

239
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,510
She will chew me out if I don’t use it.

240
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,860
Alright.

241
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,950
Thanks for riding me home.

242
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,460
By the way, I talked to the professor about our project plans.

243
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,160
All we need to do is to go to the location.

244
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,390
And?

245
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,260
And we need to go tomorrow.

246
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,760
What?

247
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,010
Where? Is it far?

248
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,830
A school in Nakhon Nayok province.

249
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,870
Don’t tell me you forgot our plan again.

250
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,090
No, I didn't forget.

251
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,370
You always have an excuse to blame me, you bastard!

252
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,550
Duean,

253
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,490
how about you improve your language?

254
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,870
If you don’t, I’ll kick you out of this project.

255
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,670
And if you don’t graduate in 4 years, your parents will be so disappointed in you.

256
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,450
Roger that, Mr. Meen.

257
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,200
You can get inside now, sir.

258
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,210
That’s right.

259
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,740
Yes, sir.

260
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,630
Get home safe.

261
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,760
Bye now.

262
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,360
Bye.

263
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,770
Ride safe.

264
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,320
Bye.

265
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,350
Bye

266
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,290
Bye-bye.

267
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,610
Bye-bye.

268
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,700
Bye-bye, Duean.

269
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,560
Get home safe. Thanks for today.

270
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,600
Yeah, yeah!

271
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,790
(Oh, look at that sweet gaze you’re giving.)

272
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,810
That’s okay, Mr. Meen.

273
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,040
I’ll see you tomorrow.

274
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,620
Why do I have to be nice to him anyway?

275
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,950
(Exactly!)

276
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,910
(You never give in to anyone.)

277
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,330
It’s nothing, okay?

278
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,180
I just don’t want to hear him complain. It’s annoying.

279
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,500
And you keep getting on my nerves.

280
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,950
(I borrowed two, hehe.)

281
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,030
Save that ‘hehe’ for your dad!!

282
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,250
Sorry, dad.

283
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,090
I don’t have any boxers left.

284
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
Dueannnn!!

285
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,600
I just don’t feel right.

286
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,300
Screw it.

287
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,610
Am I forgetting something?

288
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,970
Pi.

289
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,940
Why are you walking like that?

290
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,180
Because I’m in a rush.

291
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,100
Shit! I know what I forgot now.

292
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,410
My lab gown!

293
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,650
Aren’t you going in, Pi?

294
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,550
You don’t want to be late.

295
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,740
I forgot to bring my gown.

296
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,370
What?

297
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,990
We need it for an assessment today.

298
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,520
My life is over.

299
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,950
Why does it have to happen today?

300
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,550
DS PATTAWEE PANICHAPUN

301
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,920
Your dad is a bird or something?

302
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
No. He’s a doctor.

303
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,020
Wow!

304
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,620
Your cuteness strikes me hard.

305
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,550
Can I have your number?

306
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,770
What a crappy dental student!

307
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,480
That can’t hurt me.

308
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,740
Did that hurt?

309
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,070
Nope.

310
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,870
Yep.

311
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,130
She just hit me twice.

312
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,880
You, hurry up!

313
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,850
I’m sorry.

314
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,910
I kind of slept in.

315
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,530
I got yelled at and slapped so many times before you showed up.

316
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,810
Next time, we don’t have to meet this early.

317
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,630
Alright, I’m sorry.

318
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,220
Why are you wearing a lab gown outside though?

319
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,290
People don’t actually wear it outside.

320
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,230
What you see in dramas isn’t real.

321
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,160
Now I know what I forgot.

322
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,640
I forgot to take it off.

323
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,110
Time to go.

324
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,340
Hold on one second.

325
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,180
I’m going to get some water.

326
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,880
No need.

327
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,830
I’ve prepared some drinks for you.

328
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,030
Here.

329
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,050
Thank you, Duean.

330
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
That’s my favorite, you know?

331
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,560
Really? I love it too. It’s so good.

332
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,580
I have things in common.

333
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,670
(No way! Why am I trembling?)

334
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,270
Alright. Let’s just go. We’re late.

335
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,730
What’s the hurry?

336
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Are you running to me to give back my phone?

337
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,650
Here.

338
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,150
Wait!

339
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,810
Where are you rushing to?

340
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,270
Don’t you have class?

341
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,190
I do. That’s why I have to go.

342
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,960
Hold on.

343
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,550
Your class is in that building.

344
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,060
I’m not headed to class. I’m going home.

345
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,870
Wait a minute.

346
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,220
Why are you going home?

347
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,230
Are you avoiding me or something?

348
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,510
No. I forgot my gown at home.

349
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,330
Wait!

350
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,300
What now? Ask away, you jackass.

351
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,330
I’m not going anymore.

352
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,440
I wanted to say you don’t have to go home.

353
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,470
You can wear mine to your lab.

354
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,900
Here.

355
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,770
Do you hate me that much you can’t even wear my gown?

356
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,970
Don’t you need it for class?

357
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,560
By the time you come back, your class will be over.

358
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,770
Here.

359
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,360
Alright then.

360
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,880
That’s it.

361
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,400
Why on earth is he walking like that?

362
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,270
MS SUTTHAYA NITHIKORNKUL

363
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,870
(Is someone taking photos?)

364
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,260
(Photos of me?)

365
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,830
Pi.

366
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,970
Are you dating Sutthaya?

367
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,050
What?

368
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,740
Why are you asking me that?

369
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,470
Because you’re wearing his gown. That’s sweet!

370
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,380
You must love Mork very much.

371
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,240
I know you guys went to a movie, ate together, and took selfies in a car.

372
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,970
You guys held hands like nothing could tear you apart.

373
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
I ship you guys so much.

374
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,300
How did you know all that?

375
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,300
Here.

376
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
@MPFanDom

377
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,930
(I must get this done fast so I can give him back his gown.)

378
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,580
(Stop looking at me, people.)

379
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,270
(You also have work to do.)

380
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,250
(I’m so done here.)

381
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,550
Shit!

382
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,980
Does it hurt?

383
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,660
No.

384
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,850
Let me see.

385
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,800
Don’t.

386
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,710
You just said ‘don’t.’

387
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,890
I just got carried away.

388
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,140
Look!

389
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,430
Just take back your gown.

390
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,440
I was quite gentle when I gave it to you.

391
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,810
Stop playing around already.

392
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,670
Don’t you know what people are saying about you and me?

393
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,270
I do.

394
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,570
Doesn’t it bother you?

395
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,990
They’re misunderstanding. I don’t think of you that way just a bit.

396
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,710
But I do.

397
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,070
Can you just stop doing this?

398
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Do you despise me that much, Pi?

399
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,130
I don’t despise you.

400
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,660
I just don’t like you that way.

401
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,550
I like Muang Nan and I don’t want him to have the wrong idea about me.

402
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,900
What do you want me to do?

403
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,760
Come with me. Tell them to stop shipping us.

404
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,700
You do that.

405
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,760
I can’t do it alone.

406
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,850
You must come with me.

407
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,840
Where?

408
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,000
They’re chatting.

409
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,230
Come on.

410
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,200
They’re holding hands!

411
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,480
Where are they going?

412
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,220
Let’s follow them.

413
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,270
They’re coming this way.

414
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,860
Where are you guys going?

415
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,470
We actually came to talk to you.

416
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,640
I want you two to stop doing the MorkPi fandom thing.

417
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,610
Why?

418
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,030
Because we’re not together.

419
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,740
We don’t have feelings for each other.

420
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,150
Right?

421
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,130
Tell them.

422
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,210
Say it.

423
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,020
Um.

424
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,120
What you are doing is an invasion of privacy.

425
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,310
You two need to delete that account.

426
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,790
Otherwise, I’ll need to report you.

427
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,180
Please.

428
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,010
Do it now!

429
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,410
Okay.

430
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,610
We’re so sorry, Pi and Mork.

431
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,590
Sorry.

432
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,080
Sorry about that.

433
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,130
That’s fine.

434
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,910
Damn you, Prik!

435
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,580
Why did you actually delete it?

436
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
We worked our asses off to get those photos.

437
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,260
I even sacrificed my back to the pitbulls yesterday.

438
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,150
Don’t you remember?

439
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,660
Didn’t you see they aren’t comfortable?

440
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,410
I think I should do as they said.

441
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,300
Whatever.

442
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,700
You all just left me alone here.

443
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,270
Pi.

444
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,720
Pi, hold on.

445
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,490
Pi, wait up.

446
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,690
Why are you following me?

447
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,740
There’s something in your hair.

448
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,940
Not there.

449
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,790
No.

450
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,030
Still no.

451
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,740
Just tell me where it is.

452
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,320
Stay still.

453
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,770
I told you

454
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,750
I don’t like anything unclean.

455
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,120
It is gone now?

456
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,440
Yes, it is.

457
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,000
It’s all gone. The staring isn’t necessary.

458
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,430
Duean, don’t go so fast.

459
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,290
Duean.

460
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,210
Duean, wait for me.

461
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,460
Good evening.

462
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,330
Good evening.

463
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,030
Are you Duean and Meen who are doing a project in our school?

464
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,270
We are.

465
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,010
My name is Duean. This is my friend, Meen.

466
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,710
Nice to meet you two.

467
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,050
My name is Namphueng. I’m a teacher here.

468
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,650
There will be some villagers coming tomorrow. They’ve been informed about the project.

469
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,870
Of course.

470
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,810
Should I show you guys your room?

471
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,400
How was your traveling?

472
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,490
Very tiring.

473
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,710
Then this way, please.

474
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,660
How did you come?

475
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
We drove here.

476
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,490
(A young teacher with her cute glasses. So damn lovely!)

477
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,330
- (It's worth traveling this far. I wish you all could see her too.)
- Excuse me, will children be coming too tomorrow?

478
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,280
Why?

479
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,070
My friend here is a dental student.

480
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,330
That’s right.

481
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,660
My dream is to be a dentist.

482
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,950
Okay. I will inform them of that information.

483
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:20,870
Sure.

484
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,850
This way, please.

485
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,870
Seriously, dentist?

486
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,950
I can’t even brush my teeth properly.

487
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,930
Let’s just go with the flow.

488
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,770
The secondary student classrooms are up here on the second floor.

489
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,600
It’s Friday today so we turned a classroom into a sleeping place for you two.

490
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,330
You did?

491
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,180
These are their work.

492
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,730
- Very cute.
- Very pretty.

493
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:55,220
I’m not sure if you guys have heard the story about his school.

494
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,690
What story?

495
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,470
I guess you guys haven’t.

496
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,120
That sounds scary.

497
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,660
I better not tell then.

498
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,290
What is it exactly?

499
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,780
Nothing. I was just joking.

500
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,070
You’re pretty and funny. You’re just my type.

501
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,480
No ghosts or anything. I was just playing.

502
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,310
You’re so cute.

503
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,370
Does this look comfortable enough?

504
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,260
It does.

505
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,770
Where are you sleeping though?

506
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,340
A teacher’s residential area.

507
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,280
I don’t want to be a dentist anymore.

508
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,660
I want to be a teacher so I can live close to you.

509
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,170
Make yourself at home. I’ll let you two rest.

510
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,090
Sure.

511
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,250
Be careful when you walk.

512
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,410
Have a good night.

513
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,310
Goodnight.

514
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,260
Why are you giving me that look?

515
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,450
Well.

516
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,240
You spoke with her very nicely.

517
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,070
So?

518
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,180
So what?

519
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,280
It’s a double standard. What are you gonna do?

520
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,200
- Duean.
- Meen!

521
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,160
What happened?

522
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,040
See it for yourself.

523
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,490
Look.

524
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,790
Look what?

525
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,990
Do not take me with you.

526
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,190
Leave me right here.

527
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,750
What is it? Calm down.

528
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,990
You didn’t wait for me.

529
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,390
What if there was a gecko again?

530
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,920
Hey!

531
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,720
Geckos in the countryside are so damn scary.

532
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,600
They are so big.

533
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,090
You’re a lot bigger than them. Why be scared?

534
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,940
You sound like you’re mad.

535
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,260
Are you mad at me?

536
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,460
No.

537
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
I’m tired. I’m gonna go to bed now.

538
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,740
Ah!

539
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,330
Duean.

540
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,600
Where are you going?

541
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,700
Going to ask the cute teacher about the wi-fi password.

542
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,570
Hehe!

543
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,140
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.5 ends...with bittersweetness.)

544
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,250
Have they deleted it?

545
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,490
Yes! It’s deleted. Awesome!

546
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:38,020
Now I need some positive energy to study.

547
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,220
You’ve changed a new profile picture.

548
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I’m so giving you a heart.

549
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,480
Shit! That’s Sutthaya.

550
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,880
He’s haunting me here too?

551
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,880
Let’s check out people’s comments.

552
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,570
(So Mork and Muang Nan are back on the same ship?)

553
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,270
(Is this why MorkPi fan page got deactivated?)

554
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,830
(Sutthaya: Muang Nan and I aren’t dating.)

555
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,530
(Sutthaya: We’ve been friends for so long.)

556
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,030
(So glad you replied to my comment, Mork!)

557
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,410
(You sounded a little upset though.)

558
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,660
(Are you feeling sad, Mork?)

559
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,490
(Sutthaya: A little.)

560
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,530
(Can you say what makes you sad?)

561
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,130
(Sutthaya: It’s someone I like. He’s so dumb, he doesn’t know it.)

562
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,450
(I really want to be that dumb person of yours.)

563
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,750
(Sutthaya: Nobody is dumb, actually. The dumb one is me.)

564
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,260
Yes, you are!

565
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,470
Shit! He can’t know I am Facestalking him.

566
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,250
I shouldn’t have liked his comment!

567
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,330
Why are you sending me a friend request? I don’t want to be your friend.

568
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,270
I’ll just cancel it.

569
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,320
Why did you cancel?

570
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,840
Don’t you want to be my friend?

571
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,560
I don’t want to be friends with someone who’s always with my Muang Nan.

572
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,990
Sorry.

573
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,440
Keep your voice down.

574
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,360
People are trying to read.

575
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,570
Why did you say that?

576
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,140
Well, it’s true.

577
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,480
Wherever he goes, you’re there.

578
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
You post photos with him all the time.

579
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,200
Because we’re close friends.

580
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,370
We’ve known each other since before we got into this university.

581
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,700
Are you saying Muang Nan likes you?

582
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,870
No.

583
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,490
No, my ass!

584
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,260
You just went to a movie with him.

585
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,400
Be quiet.

586
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,760
What are you laughing at?

587
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,690
Muang Nan and I go everywhere together,

588
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,510
not just movies.

589
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,250
We go clubbing, drinking, hanging out.

590
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,430
He always asks me to go anywhere with him.

591
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,350
You…

592
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,900
Are you bragging?

593
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,960
Are you trying to make me mad?

594
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,270
You just made me raise my voice again.

595
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,350
Nan has an issue with his family.

596
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,200
He doesn't like to be alone.

597
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
His life is more tragic than you can imagine.

598
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,500
He doesn’t like me for sure.

599
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,490
That’s one thing you don’t have to worry about.

600
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,340
Fine.

601
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,240
That’s good then.

602
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,770
I’m clear now.

603
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,110
But I’m not.

604
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,860
What else do you want?

605
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,490
Why are you touching my cheeks?

606
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,130
Your cheeks are very soft.

607
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,190
How come your heart is so stony?

608
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,830
If you’re not ready to open up your heart,

609
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,590
we can start by being friends.

610
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,630
No.

611
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,290
I won’t open up my heart for anyone.

612
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,290
I will open my heart for Muang Nan only.

613
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,540
You don’t like him that much.

614
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,930
Don’t act like you know so well.

615
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,000
You’re not me.

616
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,540
But I do know.

617
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,990
It’s just a matter of time.

618
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,490
You will surely fall for me,

619
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,670
soft-cheeked boy.

620
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
If you want to own those flowers,

621
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,930
that means you’re just obsessed with them.

622
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,980
But if you want to take care and let them grow,

623
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,870
that means you truly love them.

624
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,580
I want to take care of you, Pi.

625
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
You didn’t wash it all off.

626
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,080
No one has ever done that for me, except my mom.

627
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,250
Dental Student Pattawee Panichapun

628
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,550
I’ll just try searching by his name.

629
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,840
I’m an unlucky guy. I can’t get anything done in this life.

630
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,120
I just can’t…

631
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,850
I can be your vaccine, Pi.
