1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,120
The Terms of our Dating Probation.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,130
People can’t know we’re together.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,780
Are you two secretly dating?

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,560
- No.
- No.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,600
We can take care of each other but not in the public eye.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,650
Some snacks to eat when you’re hungry.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,910
I have some snacks for you too.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,810
Sit back down, Pi.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,160
What is it, Duean?

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,470
Are you two secretly dating?

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,630
Where did you get that idea?

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,080
From these.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,410
Damn you!

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,120
You said he was bothering you. He was the one approaching you.

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,030
I guess you’re the one that lured him in.

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,810
It’s…

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,090
Don’t talk.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,730
As for you…

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
As for you,

20
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,010
whatever you’re thinking of doing, just stop.

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,450
If you think you can hit on my brother, I’m telling you I disapprove.

22
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,110
Duean…

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,780
I don’t trust someone like you.

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,720
If I see you with my brother again, I’ll beat you up.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,640
Duean…

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Damn it!

27
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,420
Go ahead.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,820
You ask for it.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,910
Duean, don’t!

30
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,140
What did I say?

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,300
Do not talk!

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,760
Damn you!

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,040
Come and talk to me.

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,520
Let me finish.

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,120
We need to clear things up.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,850
Bring your food too.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Pi, you are such a prick.

38
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
You are dating him behind my back.

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,740
You lied right to my face, Pi!

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Why did you lie to me?

41
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,050
You know I don’t like this guy.

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,780
Teddy Bear, what’s wrong?

43
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,030
Why do you look so worried?

44
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,170
You chose to hide it from me.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
You think you’re covering it up so well, huh?

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,150
Do you think I don’t know?

47
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,230
Do you think I’m that stupid?

48
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,560
I’m not!

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,630
It’s…

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,150
Time to defend yourself now.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can’t, can you?

52
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,130
I wanna beat you up so badly.

53
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,160
Hold on.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I’m not done yelling at you.

55
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,450
Hello!

56
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,370
What?

57
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,490
We have a situation?

58
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,450
You guys go ahead. I’m teaching my brother a lesson here.

59
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,790
What? Yok has a situation?

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Pi, come with me.

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,830
Quickly.

62
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,720
See?

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,300
Our placebo worked!

64
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,490
A ship has become a real couple.

65
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,920
Why do you still look stressed out?

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,150
Just smile.

67
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,670
Smile and be happy.

68
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,810
Well…

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,910
I can’t be entirely happy.

70
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,710
We aren’t that real.

71
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,360
We are still on probation.

72
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,400
Pi asked me to keep it a secret for now.

73
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,790
Poor Mork.

74
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,440
You finally have a boyfriend, but your boyfriend wants to keep it private.

75
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,670
If I were Pi,

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,250
I’d broadcast it to the entire university.

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,720
I’d buy ads on Tuk-Tuks too,

78
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,650
saying Mork and Bam have become a real couple!

79
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,930
Too much.

80
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,250
Seriously.

81
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
Don’t worry.

82
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,290
Give me a smile.

83
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,530
Gosh!

84
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,360
Come with me.

85
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,290
Where?

86
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,210
Just come here.

87
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,310
What are you doing?

88
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,240
I am not going.

89
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,510
- Just come with me.
- No.

90
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,480
What are you trying to do?

91
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Where are you taking me?

92
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,530
What are you doing?

93
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,060
I’ve come to see my boyfriend.

94
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,650
Can’t I?

95
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,910
What are you looking at?

96
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,710
I am hungry.

97
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,780
Let’s go eat something.

98
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,310
I mean hungry for food.

99
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,170
Damn you!

100
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,810
I can’t. I’m going out for drinks.

101
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,370
Drinks?

102
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,680
You’re going to drink?

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,140
With who?

104
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,390
Duean and his gang. They’re making me go.

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,090
I’ll come with you.

106
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,290
You can’t.

107
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,310
You know Duean is tailing you.

108
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,850
So?

109
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,380
Just tell your brother we are together.

110
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
Can’t you?

111
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,250
Can you?

112
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,210
Please.

113
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,410
Please.

114
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,070
Pi!

115
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,530
Hey, Pi!

116
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,070
Duean, I’m here.

117
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,160
These are my friends.

118
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,580
This one is Koh.

119
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,580
That’s Pi.

120
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,930
That gamer is James.

121
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,460
The one in plaid shirts is Jeans.

122
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,190
And this dude, you don’t have to know him.

123
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,780
I’m kidding.

124
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,300
His name is Duean.

125
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,520
What are you all doing? Greet her.

126
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Sawasdee krub.

127
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,910
You aren’t just hot, you are also funny.

128
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,580
Hot and funny.

129
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,580
Can I ask you something?

130
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,960
How did you know this fatty?

131
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,400
He hit on me. I thought he was cute.

132
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,850
I fell for him after we talked.

133
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,930
Very cute.

134
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,970
Yok, do you have some kind of amulet on you?

135
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,730
You’re such a girl magnet.

136
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,670
I don’t need any amulets.

137
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,090
My pure little heart and my gorgeous face are all I need.

138
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,690
Awesome!

139
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,780
How hot!

140
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,990
Na Tang, should we go get something to eat over there?

141
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,550
You said you’re hungry.

142
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,710
Let’s go.

143
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,390
He’s running away from us.

144
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,210
Bye bye.

145
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,430
One second.

146
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,970
Hello.

147
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,200
(Duean, are you forgetting something?)

148
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,600
(We have a tutoring session tonight.)

149
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,580
That’s right. I forgot.

150
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,210
I'll be right there. See you soon.

151
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,130
Wait!

152
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,980
Are you henpecked?

153
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,920
No way! I’m not.

154
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,160
He totally is.

155
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,520
Look at your big brother.

156
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,670
He’s henpecked.

157
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,080
What a softie!

158
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,450
I am not henpecked.

159
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,500
I just need to do this report.

160
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,420
I must if I want to graduate.

161
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,120
My parents will be so disappointed if I don’t.

162
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,530
A group report!

163
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,740
All right.

164
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,100
Right. I’m leaving then.

165
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,310
Alright, you’re so under his thumb.

166
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,730
I’m just studying!

167
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,690
Talking to you guys is a waste of time.

168
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,890
I’m out!

169
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,890
What!

170
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
I need to study.

171
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,690
Hurry back because I’m keeping Pi hostage.

172
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I’ll come back. Don’t go anywhere.

173
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,450
Take care of Pi.

174
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,880
Goodbye, henpecked.

175
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,150
Let me go.

176
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,070
You’re fragile.

177
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,390
What’s up, hottie?

178
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,860
(Mork: I’m right in front of the club.)

179
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,530
Shit!!

180
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,590
What’s wrong?

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What’s up?

182
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,550
I’ll be right back.

183
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,710
Why are you here?

184
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,140
Where is your table?

185
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,910
I told you not to come.

186
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,190
I know. I’m not joining you at your table.

187
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,160
I will be somewhere nearby.

188
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,470
I’ll stay quiet and keep you from going wild.

189
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,350
That’s all.

190
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,090
Come on.

191
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,220
Crap! Koh is seeing us.

192
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,630
Where did Pi go?

193
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,770
I’m going back in.

194
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,990
Pi!

195
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
Don’t you want to be with me?

196
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,800
It’s not that I don’t.

197
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,790
I do.

198
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,760
But if someone catches us together,

199
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
it’s going to be a mess.

200
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,960
Then we won’t get to see each other again.

201
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,980
You do understand, right?

202
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,830
Bye now.

203
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,340
Let’s go back.

204
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,090
What?

205
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,230
What?

206
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,410
I’m going out for a cigarette.

207
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,260
Don’t smoke.

208
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,390
Let’s get back to our table.

209
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,120
Why are you fidgeting?

210
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
I am not. Come on.

211
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,490
Did you go out to see someone?

212
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,850
I didn’t.

213
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,920
Come on. Let’s continue.

214
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:58,380
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.11 - Changed but Still the Same)

215
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,030
Sorry I’m late.

216
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,100
Have you been drinking?

217
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,230
You smell like alcohol.

218
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,050
Don’t tell me you forgot our appointment and went out drinking.

219
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,330
No.

220
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
I ate sapodillas.

221
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,160
An old lady hawker was selling them in front of this building and I bought some.

222
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,550
How many glasses?

223
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,320
Just one with soda.

224
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,830
You can crack a joke now. You’re funny. I’m impressed.

225
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,150
Will you be able to study?

226
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,380
Of course, I will.

227
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,100
I’m not drunk.

228
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,190
Let’s go then.

229
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,240
Hold on.

230
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Where are we going? Aren’t we studying here?

231
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,310
The tutoring session takes time.

232
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,980
This place will be closed by the time we finish.

233
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,050
Let’s go to my place.

234
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,460
(Duean: I don’t think I will go back. We’re going to read at Meen’s place.)

235
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,220
(Jeans: This little kid is wicked. He is bringing a guy home.)

236
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,420
(Koh: He is clearly not naive as he looks.)

237
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,490
(Jeans: Here comes a new TV series called The Bad Engineer and His Personal Tutor.)

238
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,440
(Jeans: This session is going to take all night.)

239
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,420
Let’s go.

240
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,940
Alright. Let’s go.

241
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,340
(Koh: He’s bringing you home so late. My dirty mind is thinking wild.)

242
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,810
Duean, are you tired?

243
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Let me give you a massage.

244
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,370
Wow!

245
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Your shoulders are very stiff.

246
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,530
I wonder if that thing...

247
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,060
is stiff too.

248
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,230
What thing?

249
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
I meant your neck.

250
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,920
Good then.

251
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
I’m sleepy, Duean.

252
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,110
Can we study in my bedroom instead?

253
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,750
I should just stay here.

254
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,430
It’s brighter here.

255
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
It’s bright in here?

256
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,220
It’s not.

257
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,010
It’s brighter in my bedroom.

258
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
What’s more important,

259
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,750
it is very nice and cool in my room.

260
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
But I like it hot. I’ll just stay here.

261
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,130
Duean,

262
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,860
let me sing you a song.

263
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
No. That’ll make me sleepy.

264
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,860
Stop playing hard to get!
Do you want me to go violent?

265
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,970
Don’t! I have people who care about me!

266
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,420
Duean.

267
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,090
Duean.

268
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,120
What?

269
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,490
Are you hungry?

270
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,710
I’m cleaning my saliva off my teeth.

271
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,970
Let’s go.

272
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,330
(Do I really think of this kid that far?)

273
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,530
(Have I already fallen for him?)

274
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,710
Duean, why did you stop?

275
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,350
(I’m so in trouble!!)

276
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,450
It’s not that I don’t.

277
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,260
I do.

278
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,690
But if someone catches us together, it’s going to be a mess.

279
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,550
Then we won’t get to see each other again.

280
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,600
You do understand, right?

281
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,970
Bye now.

282
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,800
(Maybe he isn’t that naive just like Koh said.)

283
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,750
Why aren’t we studying at a cafe that opens all night?

284
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
My place is a good choice.

285
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,370
It’s convenient to do things.

286
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,980
(It’s convenient to do things?)

287
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,370
And it’s quiet.

288
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,430
(And it’s quiet.)

289
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,410
Aren’t your parents home?

290
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,180
They are out of town.

291
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,300
(Everything clicks.)

292
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,980
(He is so going to do me.)

293
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,230
Meen!

294
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,480
Meen, what are you doing?

295
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,600
Doing what people always do at home.

296
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,250
Duean.

297
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,440
What’s going on?

298
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Nothing. I screamed because I’m hungry.

299
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,770
You screamed so loud. You made me jump.

300
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,270
Who’s there?

301
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,410
P’Mork.

302
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,930
Do you know this asshole, Meen?

303
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,310
How did you get in here?

304
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,460
Why can’t I?

305
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,290
What a mouth!

306
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,520
You are such a jerk.

307
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,920
You’re chasing my brother and messing with my boy here.

308
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,000
Duean, hold on.

309
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,850
I need to talk to this asshole.

310
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,620
Get out of here before I smack you in the face.

311
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,290
You have no right to kick me out.

312
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,570
Well, if talking can’t knock some sense into you,

313
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,010
I think we need violence.

314
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,600
Duean.

315
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Are you letting my boy defend you?

316
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,910
You think he’s pure and gullible?

317
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,850
Duean.

318
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,100
I told you not to talk.

319
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,750
I'm gonna deal with you later.

320
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,960
Duean, he’s…

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,460
Are you done?

322
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,610
Can I tell you now that he is my older brother?

323
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,990
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

324
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,540
All you said was ‘Shh!!’

325
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,830
I didn’t have a chance to tell you, did I?

326
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Meen, I’m gonna need to talk to him for a moment.

327
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,020
Why do you get yourself involved with Meen?

328
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,210
It’s your brother who shadows me everywhere.

329
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,430
Then can you please stay away from him?

330
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,590
If you want me to stay away from your brother,

331
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,460
how about you stay away from mine too?

332
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
I don’t think I can do that

333
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,060
because I…

334
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,680
I love Pi already.

335
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Very straightforward.

336
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,860
I’m seeing myself in the future with Pi, protecting and taking care of him.

337
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,240
And no matter what happens, I know for sure that I will never leave him alone.

338
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,310
But you,

339
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,790
I’m not so sure.

340
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,900
What are you not sure about?

341
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
Meen is different from other people.

342
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,210
He believes whatever people tell him.

343
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,990
I don’t want to see him get hurt.

344
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,130
Everybody in the university knows you're a player.

345
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,430
I used to be a player. I used to be bad.

346
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,410
You still are.

347
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,810
Don’t make me smack you.

348
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Bring it on.

349
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,090
I’m not as bad as I was.

350
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,250
Meen made me want to change and be a better person.

351
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,360
After he came along, I never had eyes for anyone else.

352
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,470
So that means…

353
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,480
you like him?

354
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,470
Is there a problem?

355
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,570
Please don’t fight.

356
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,700
P’Mork, Duean.

357
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,740
It’s nothing.

358
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,930
We’re all clear.

359
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,310
Is that right, my beloved bro?

360
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,410
Are you guys really cool?

361
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,650
We are.

362
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,030
Great. Then let’s start our study, Duean.

363
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,210
Okay.

364
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,710
This is yours.

365
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,030
I highlighted the key parts for you.

366
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Will you drink with me?

367
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,850
I think you should stop. You might get drunk.

368
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,920
But I want to get drunk.

369
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,140
I mean...drunk in love.

370
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,970
What’s wrong, man?

371
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,970
Choking on his cheesiness.

372
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,010
(He is so cheesy.)

373
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,980
Why don’t you eat anything at all?

374
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,210
Easy, man!

375
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,280
You don’t want him to choke to death.

376
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,790
He won’t.

377
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,310
Jeans, you said you had something to tell.

378
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,070
Ah! It's about someone named Golf who works at a massage parlor and has two kids already.

379
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,540
(Mork: I’m leaving then.)

380
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,310
(Shit! He sent this message almost an hour ago.)

381
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,640
(He must be so mad.)

382
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,650
(What should I do? Should I go home now?)

383
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,010
(But If I leave now, that means I’m intimidated.)

384
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,400
(Pi: I’m home now. Are you mad that I took so long to reply?)

385
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,880
(Mork: It’s okay. I understand.)

386
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,570
You sound upset.

387
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,840
I’m going to take a shower. I have to study.

388
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,080
I have an exam tomorrow.

389
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,790
You said you were going to drink with your brother and his friends.

390
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,930
I was but my brother left.

391
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,800
He said he needed to study.

392
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
He isn’t even home yet.

393
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,690
He is at my house.

394
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,660
Ah! So he is your little brother?

395
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,720
You know him?

396
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,500
Are you alright?

397
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,090
I am.

398
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,300
I’ve met him

399
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,550
but don’t really know him.

400
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,330
Let’s have a celebration meal together after the exam.

401
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,700
Do you think that’s a good idea?

402
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,500
If you’re afraid people can see, I have a plan.

403
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,050
Why are you here?

404
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,540
My brother will chew you out.

405
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,860
I’m not afraid.

406
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,140
Where is he?

407
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,450
Come on!

408
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,730
Hey, what’s the fuss all about?

409
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Are you here to see my brother?

410
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,870
Yes.

411
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,910
Good morning.

412
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,900
Good morning.

413
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,490
Are you taking him to the university?

414
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,160
I am.

415
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,220
As you wish.

416
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,170
Hey! Why are you not moving?

417
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,510
He’s been waiting for you.

418
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,210
Go. Move.

419
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,510
You’re so slow.

420
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Hold on, sir.

421
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,620
Let me get the door for you.

422
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,850
Please.

423
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,690
What have you done to my brother?

424
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,790
Why is he being so acceptant?

425
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,370
So that means you like him?

426
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Yes, I do.

427
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
Are you certain?

428
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,140
Yes.

429
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,160
If you ever hurt him,

430
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
you’re going to have to deal with me.

431
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
I will never hurt him.

432
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,270
Are we clear?

433
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,020
Not yet.

434
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,750
There’s one more thing.

435
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,900
What now?

436
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,010
If you try to make Pi stay away from me,

437
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I’ll make Meen stay away from you too.

438
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,080
Yeah!

439
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,860
Speak nicely.

440
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,820
Yes, sir.

441
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,600
Wow!

442
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,950
My brother must be so whipped for your brother.

443
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Even though Duean is okay,

444
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,500
what about other people if they see us going to the university together?

445
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,700
Don’t worry.

446
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,930
I’m going with you two.

447
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,130
Mork told me everything.

448
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,690
Let’s go together. People won’t get suspicious.

449
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,180
You think so?

450
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,070
Yes.

451
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,240
How did she manage to squeeze herself in there?

452
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,580
I want to spend time with you.

453
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,860
I want to go places with you all the time.

454
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,720
Bam is helping us cover it up.

455
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,430
Don’t you get it?

456
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,430
I do.

457
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Let’s go.

458
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,660
Sorry.

459
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,690
Wrong grabbing.

460
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,230
Do you want to sit here, Bam?

461
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,810
I’ll sit in the back.

462
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,060
Mork. You’re teasing Pi again.

463
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
Bam, take my seat.

464
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,190
Buckle up. Come on.

465
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,350
Damn! That one was tough.

466
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,000
Last year, the mean was 7.

467
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,700
What’s it gonna be this year?

468
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,690
(Mork: I’m at the mall already.)

469
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
(Pi: Okay. I just finished with the exam. Be there soon.)

470
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,350
- Do you want vegetables?
- No.

471
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,190
Salad?

472
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,780
- Japanese Salad? Chicken Salad?
- No!

473
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,850
I want that one.

474
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,160
Which one?

475
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,710
That one.

476
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,340
Meat?

477
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,010
You will get fat. Don’t order it.

478
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,950
I’m not fat. You can touch it.

479
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,500
Am I fat?

480
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,450
You are.

481
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,080
Don’t order meat.

482
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,280
I’m done talking to you.

483
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,140
You’re here.

484
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,950
How was your exam?

485
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,220
It was okay.

486
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,620
What’s the matter?

487
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,180
You’re afraid of people seeing us?

488
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,440
I picked a place far from our university.

489
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,300
Students from our university don’t usually come here.

490
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,990
Besides, we are just talking.

491
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,130
It’s not like I’m talking to you

492
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,710
and holding your hand.

493
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,010
Right?

494
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,090
People can see.

495
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
We have a table available there.

496
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,490
Let’s go have a seat.

497
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,610
Why are you grabbing my leg?

498
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,000
Why? Can’t I touch you at all?

499
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,500
Holding hands is okay but not this.

500
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,420
Why not?

501
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,220
Pi, you should sit over there.

502
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,570
I’ll protect you by sitting here.

503
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,290
Stop there, Mork.

504
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,590
Sit down.

505
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
Stop teasing Pi already.

506
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,660
Hi, guys. Here is your menu.

507
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Okay. Let me order first.

508
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,910
Can I have Pork Bulgogi Rice Bowl?

509
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,880
Again?

510
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,490
You just had it last time.

511
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,450
It’s good.

512
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,090
You don’t have to order, Mork. I’ll do it for you.

513
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,060
He will have The Grilled Pork Set with Karaage.

514
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,330
Of course.

515
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,200
How’s that?

516
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
You just know me so well.

517
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,880
Of course. Who am I?

518
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,670
I don’t know.

519
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,310
What a tease!

520
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,450
Don’t you want anything?

521
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,780
No. I can’t decide.

522
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,920
I’ll order something later.

523
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,930
May I recommend?

524
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,390
Sure.

525
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,970
I come here with Mork all the time.

526
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,450
So you guys have been here before?

527
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,720
Yes.

528
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,160
It’s Mork’s favorite place.

529
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,020
Their food is really good.

530
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,650
Recommend him something.

531
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
This menu.

532
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,360
Mork likes it.

533
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
How do you like it? Tell him.

534
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,910
It’s so good.

535
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,670
Holy shit! Yes!

536
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,410
Duean, are you okay?

537
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,450
What just happened?

538
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,950
Meen, can I get a hug?

539
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
What is this? Why are you hugging me?

540
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,760
Can’t I hug you?

541
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,980
I’ll kiss you instead then.

542
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
Duean, that’s enough.

543
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,810
Stop.

544
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,870
What are you playing at?

545
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,590
I am happy.

546
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Look at this.

547
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,250
I pass!
I got a ‘D’

548
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Just look.

549
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,150
How’s that?

550
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,990
Why are you so happy with a D?

551
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,250
It doesn’t matter how well you did.

552
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,920
Pass means pass.

553
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,430
In the end, people use this to live their lives.

554
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,370
What?

555
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,800
Brains.

556
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,640
I might get a D on the test, but my brains get…

557
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,690
...an F.

558
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,260
Thank you, kiddo!

559
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
Enough!

560
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,810
(Mork: Are you done with the exam?)

561
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,840
(Pi: Yes. I’m about to come down.)

562
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,610
(Is that page saying anything else?)

563
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,470
(Just ignore it.)

564
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,160
(I know what’s true and that’s enough.)

565
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,450
(Do I really not want to know though?)

566
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
(Do you think they’re dating?)

567
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,980
(I don’t know. But I’m rooting for them to be together.)

568
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,470
(I heard he’s seeing a second-year dentistry student.)

569
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,460
(I’ve heard about that too. But that was just some random ship.)

570
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,370
(Seriously, I’m not their fan. They don’t even look good together.)

571
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,530
(So you think Pi isn’t good enough?)

572
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,500
(Well, judging from what I see.)

573
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,850
Holy shit!

574
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Hey, you guys!

575
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,280
Pi, hold on!

576
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,940
Where are they now?

577
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,360
They are so quick.

578
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,630
So you are upset about this.

579
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
You looked at my phone?

580
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Just go.

581
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,980
If you don’t, I will.

582
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,240
Wait!

583
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,110
Let me go. People can see.

584
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,490
I’m not letting go. Screw those people who see us.

585
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,720
Of course, you can say that.

586
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,570
You’re not me who’s being criticized.

587
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,410
See? That’s why I don’t want them to know we’re together.

588
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,570
Why do you have to care?

589
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,670
I do. They are saying I’m not good enough for you.

590
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,700
And you believe that?

591
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,710
I do because I’m really not good enough for you.

592
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,990
Pi, I think you spend too much time on social media.

593
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,090
But we do need to listen to what other people think about us.

594
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,200
They don’t know you like I do.

595
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
They aren’t with us all the time.

596
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,890
But it’s not just us two in this whole world.

597
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,460
Pi, listen to me.

598
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,230
Stop reading, looking, caring about them.

599
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Your life will get better.

600
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,070
It isn’t about people on social media.

601
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,980
It’s me.

602
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,610
I’m weak.

603
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,610
I’m being paranoid.

604
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,700
I lack confidence.

605
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,350
I suck. I can’t handle this kind of stuff.

606
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,990
You’re not me. You don’t get it.

607
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,350
Oops! I’m sorry.

608
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,670
Who’s that?

609
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,060
Damn it!

610
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,140
I came here to hide and someone found me anyway.

611
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,460
I get it that you want to be alone.

612
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,710
But…

613
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,860
The color of your outfit is pretty eye-catching.

614
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,550
It's very noticeable.

615
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,450
What an ass!

616
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,910
What’s happened to you?

617
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,190
You look like a heartbroken man.

618
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,390
Damn!

619
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
You can tell?

620
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,190
Yes.

621
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,680
Don’t tell anyone about this.

622
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,050
People say Na Tang isn’t pretty enough and not right for me.

623
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,180
She was so upset and ended our relationship.

624
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,840
(Just the same thing I’m going through.)

625
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,870
I know I’m hot and gorgeous.

626
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,040
That’s why people think we aren’t a good match.

627
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:46,100
But I already told her I liked her for who she was inside, not her look.

628
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,490
You know what she said?

629
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,450
She said I didn’t care to protect her.

630
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:57,370
She said I made her accept and live with this shit.

631
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
I don’t know what to do now.

632
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,980
(That hits me so hard.)

633
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,540
I knew you’d be here.

634
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Mork told me you’re upset.

635
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,490
I get you.

636
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,540
I read those comments and thought they were too harsh.

637
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:29,130
Trash talkers gonna trash talk. Just don’t listen to them.

638
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,970
I am trying not to.

639
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,670
But I can’t help thinking about it.

640
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
I know.

641
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,290
Mork is popular. He’s been the center of attention since he was young.

642
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,380
Whoever is with him must go through this.

643
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,350
So don’t take it seriously.

644
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,110
I am trying.

645
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
You just need to care about Mork.

646
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,960
Today’s his birthday.

647
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,450
Have you got him a present yet?

648
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,110
It’s his birthday today?

649
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,440
Yes.

650
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,340
You didn’t know?

651
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,820
You can go get a present now. You still have time.

652
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,340
Let’s celebrate my passing grade. Cheers!

653
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:48,070
Duean, you finally completed your mission.

654
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,030
And Koh, you can do difficult skateboarding now.

655
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:59,150
James, you are now a member of an e-sport team.

656
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,740
Yok, you have a girlfriend.

657
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,470
(Damn! That hurts like hell.)

658
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,320
Look at me.

659
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,830
I’ve been to many auditions.

660
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,710
I never got any role.

661
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,410
How disappointing!

662
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:20,050
P’Jeans, my faculty is having a play.

663
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:23,280
I think if you go to the audition, you will surely get a role.

664
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,890
Right. Go on.

665
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,230
Give it a shot.

666
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,180
Not my style.

667
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,630
Come on.

668
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,900
You haven’t tried yet. How can you tell?

669
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,130
I agree with Meen.

670
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,470
Life is about trying everything.

671
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,830
Sounds good.

672
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,360
Whatever wifey says, hubby agrees.

673
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,600
What a yes-man.

674
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,550
What wifey? What hubby?

675
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,020
What are you talking about, P’Koh?

676
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,980
Don’t listen to him. He’s talking nonsense.

677
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,810
Now that we’ve come across the topic,

678
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,310
I’m gonna teach you some adult experience.

679
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,090
How?

680
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,600
With this. Expose yourself to an adult experience.

681
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,420
Duean, I don’t drink.

682
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,390
Well, you have to try it first.

683
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,380
Just a sip.

684
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,430
I know it’s bad. Why do I have to try?

685
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,500
You can’t stay good for the rest of your life.

686
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,980
Life is about good and bad.

687
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,820
This world isn't as clean as you think.

688
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,750
Come on.

689
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,490
Drink up.

690
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,280
No, Duean. I don’t want to.

691
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,780
Just a little.

692
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,460
I better not.

693
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,460
Come on. You’re making me irritated.

694
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,550
I don’t want to.

695
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,060
Duean, I said I don’t want to drink.

696
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Meen, where are you going?

697
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,920
What’s wrong?

698
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,660
I don’t like what you did to me.

699
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,890
I never forced you to do anything.

700
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,790
You made me talk so politely.

701
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,160
I only asked for your cooperation.

702
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,080
You couldn’t do it and I let it pass.

703
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,140
I just wanted you to be a better person.

704
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,100
Look what you just did to me.

705
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,410
You forced me. I didn’t want to do it a bit.

706
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,770
I had a good intention.

707
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,210
I wanted you to grow up.

708
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,860
You want to be yourself.

709
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,960
And I want to be myself too.

710
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:49,990
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.11 is over.)

711
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Yes?

712
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,350
Why do you keep switching the lamp on and off?

713
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,090
What?

714
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,090
Are you still upset?

715
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,560
You didn’t tell me it’s your birthday.

716
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,470
I’m calling to tell you that and I’m asking you to come with me.

717
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,570
I’ll introduce you to everyone.

718
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,550
Then I’m not going.

719
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:56,380
Pi, can you please stop caring about other people and just care about me?

720
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,530
You don’t have to care what people say.

721
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,290
I want you to care about me only.

722
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,660
Please, Pi.

723
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,690
Pi, it’s my birthday.

724
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,720
Are you really not going?

725
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,060
There!

726
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,210
It’s not clean.

727
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:14,420
So?

728
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,150
It’s sticky.

729
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,560
How about some mustaches?

730
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,750
Where are you going?

731
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,610
You’ve blown out the candles.

732
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,020
The party is over.

733
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,830
It’s not.

734
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,570
What are you doing?

735
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
Being unclean together.

736
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,730
It’s sticky.

737
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,460
What’s the matter?

738
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
Are you mad?

739
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,090
I am sorry.

740
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,740
I’m not forgiving you.

741
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,940
Why did you sniff kiss my cheek like that?

742
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,670
Weren’t you ashamed at all?

743
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,620
Well, I didn’t want to sniff kiss.

744
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,620
I wanted to kiss you for real.

745
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,570
You’re getting on my nerves.

746
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,530
You know it isn’t easy to clean up.

747
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,600
Let me help.

748
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,420
I didn’t want you to leave

749
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,200
so I tried to stop you.

750
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Was I that wrong?

751
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,650
If you’re sulking, just say it.

752
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,760
All right, I don’t like it.

753
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,620
You don’t like what?

754
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,670
You know it.

755
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,090
MorkBam fandom is saying you guys are a perfect match.

756
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:56,400
And I was there with you guys, feeling like a side character.

757
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,680
It’s a good time to tell people what we are then.

758
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,240
And then you can own me all you want.

759
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,440
Are you not getting the message I’m trying to tell?

760
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,640
I’m not jealous.

761
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,540
I just don’t want to be in your way looking worthless.

762
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,850
Pi,

763
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,340
it’s not that hard to accept that we are together.

764
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:29,370
I’m okay whether you want to tell people or not.

765
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,610
But I just want to love you.

766
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,340
I want to love you without caring what people think.

767
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,390
The kind of love that I can hug you when I miss you.

768
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,900
Kiss you when I'm tired.

769
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,830
Hold your hand without caring about the world.

770
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,610
But everything is up to you.

771
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,610
It’s up to what you choose.

772
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,820
Telling people or not is all your choice.

773
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:06,800
I didn’t say anything because I respect your decision.

774
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,500
But if my silence makes you uncomfortable,

775
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,580
I won’t stay silent anymore.

776
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,040
Meen!

777
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,580
Why do you keep calling me?

778
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,080
Pay attention in class.

779
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,000
I shouldn’t have done that to him.

780
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,300
For me?

781
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,420
I have something to say to you first.

782
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,750
Pi, don’t go.

783
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,940
Pi, stop!

784
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,630
This is what you call love?

785
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,300
Pi!

786
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,580
Do you think I won’t hit you?

787
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,580
You’re worried about other doctors’ cases.

788
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,450
What about your case here?

789
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,770
Let me give you a tepid sponge.

790
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,750
You don’t have to. I’m serious.

791
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,900
Don’t.

792
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,080
What are you doing to my brother?!

793
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,400
Calm down.
