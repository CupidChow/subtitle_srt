1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,750
I passed the test!

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,820
Can I get a hug?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,750
Meen is the reason I want to change and be a better person.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,550
Duean, I said I don’t want to drink!

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,830
I am weak.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,960
I’m being paranoid.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
I can’t handle this kind of stuff.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,410
Can you please stop caring about other people and just care about me?

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,180
You don’t have to care what people say.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,920
I want you to care only about me.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,410
EP.12 - FISH UPON THE SKY

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,550
Why are you here?

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,900
Why can’t I be here?

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,910
It’s for MorkBam fandom only, the real couple.

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,990
It’s Mork’s birthday today.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,770
MorkPi fandom is allowed too.

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,830
You guys are outnumbered. Bye!

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,140
I’m going in.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,650
You can’t go in yet.

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,020
I’m not carrying a weapon.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,840
Pi.

22
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,490
Pi, right here.

23
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,010
Come on. Sit here.

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,130
Hi, Bam.

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,170
It’s great you’re here.

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,810
Keep Mork company, please. I’ll be right back.

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,290
I’m really glad you came.

28
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,200
Come on.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,530
Of course, I’d come.

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,550
Here. Happy birthday.

31
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,140
Actually,

32
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,150
you being here is the best present.

33
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,850
Don’t take it then.

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,050
You didn’t get that old one from me directly.

35
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,180
But this one, I want you to have it.

36
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,410
If you want me to have it, can you wear it for me?

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
You can wear it yourself.

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,190
But it’s my birthday.

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,330
Can’t you just spoil me?

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,430
There’re many people here.

41
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,530
But it’s my birthday.

42
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,790
Come on.

43
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
What are you doing?

44
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,550
Mork!

45
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,250
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

46
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,020

47
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,180

49
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,130
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MORK

50
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,550
There!

51
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,670
Eat what’s left on your finger.

52
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,610
What are you doing?

53
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,400
Bam, it’s not clean.

54
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Hey, where are you going?

55
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,240
You’ve blown out the candles.

56
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,430
The party is over.

57
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,400
It’s not.

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
What are you doing?

59
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
Being unclean together.

60
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
Kleau!

61
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,590
It’s sticky.

62
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,300
What’s the matter?

63
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,050
Are you mad?

64
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,490
I am sorry.

65
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,110
I’m not forgiving you.

66
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,740
It isn’t very easy to clean up.

67
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,850
Why did you sniff kiss my cheek like that?

68
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,710
Weren’t you ashamed at all?

69
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,570
Actually, I didn’t want to sniff kiss.

70
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,510
I wanted to kiss you for real.

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
You’re getting on my nerves.

72
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,450
You know it isn’t easy to clean up.

73
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,730
Here, let me help.

74
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,730
I didn’t want you to leave

75
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,920
so I tried to stop you.

76
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,830
Was I that wrong?

77
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,670
If you’re sulking, just say it.

78
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,020
All right, I don’t like it.

79
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,660
You don’t like what?

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
I don’t like what you did with Bam.

81
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
What are you smiling at?

82
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,800
You know it.

83
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,540
MorkBam fandom is saying you guys are a perfect match.

84
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,490
And I am always there with you guys, feeling like a side character.

85
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,160
It’s a good time to tell people what we are then.

86
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,510
And then you can be possessive all you want.

87
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,250
Are you not getting the message I’m trying to tell?

88
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
I’m not jealous.

89
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,760
I just don’t want to see you guys do that annoying stuff.

90
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,180
Pi,

91
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,110
it’s not that hard to accept that we are together.

92
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,200
I’m okay whether you want to tell people or not.

93
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,980
But I just want to love you.

94
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,150
I want to love you without caring what people think.

95
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,740
The kind of love that I can hug you when I miss you.

96
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,860
Kiss you when I'm tired.

97
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,330
Hold your hand without caring about the world.

98
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,720
But everything is up to you.

99
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,910
It’s up to what you choose.

100
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Telling people or not is all your choice.

101
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,810
I don’t say anything because I respect your decision.

102
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,250
But if my silence makes you uncomfortable,

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I won’t stay silent anymore.

104
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Wow, you woke up really fast.

105
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,290
Yes, so?

106
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,830
What did you guys do?

107
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,450
Did you talk it out?

108
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,330
Yes.

109
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,800
We cleared things out.

110
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
Who did you hit on exactly, Mork?

111
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,400
Bam or Pi?

112
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,130
I like Pi.

113
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,170
Of course, I hit on Pi.

114
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,850
So, what are you guys now?

115
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,010
How about you ask him?

116
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,850
Pi, please tell us.

117
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,180
Um…

118
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,870
If you don’t tell them, I will.

119
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,440
We are...seeing each other.

120
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,380
What’s wrong?

121
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,800
Are you that shocked?

122
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Congrats, guys.

123
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,180
My duty is done here.

124
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,870
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MORK

125
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,110
Hi. I’m Prik Pao from MorkPi fandom.

126
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,330
The fandom that’s more real than any other fandoms.

127
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,400
Tonight is a very good night.

128
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,130
It’s the night our captain is sailing this ship himself.

129
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
There’s no more work for us to do.

130
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:41,450
But our team has made a short video as a birthday gift for Mork.

131
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:47,850
So may I...play the video to celebrate their grand opening?

132
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,470
(Sweet Glance)

133
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,980
(Soft-cheeked Boy)

134
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
(Our First Kiss)

135
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,940
Smile, smile.

136
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I’m smiling.

137
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
I want to scream, actually.

138
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,770
Just watch the video.

139
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,740
You look cute in every picture.

140
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,630
Prik! Look!

141
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,990
Pi, somebody is wrecking you online.

142
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,330
Wrecking?

143
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,570
Wow! He’s come so far. He looks completely different now.

144
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,310
True! I thought he was right for Mork.

145
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,560
But these pics are shocking me so much.

146
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,410
They say he had no friends at all.

147
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,290
Maybe he wants to build his new image.

148
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,070
I can’t take it. This is too much.

149
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,760
They aren’t a good match at all.

150
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,560
You’re so harsh.

151
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,760
Well, it’s true.

152
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,040
He’s come so far.

153
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,880
Look at his teeth back then.

154
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,110
Pi, hold on.

155
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,550
Please hear me out.

156
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,080
Pi, stop.

157
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,550
- No! Let go of me.
- Listen to me.

158
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
I didn’t do it.

159
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,720
You freaking did it.

160
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,610
You’re the only one who has those pictures.

161
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,790
Who else could have done that if not you?

162
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,090
Listen to me, Pi.

163
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,840
No!

164
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,450
I really didn’t do it.

165
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,170
Just believe me, please.

166
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,230
Please?

167
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,880
If you want us to remain friends at all, don’t follow me.

168
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,350
I don’t want to hate you.

169
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,090
(Mom: I saw it in your bag and cleaned it for you.)

170
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,870
Pi, I don’t think it’s a good idea.

171
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Give it here.

172
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,380
Are you sure you’ll be okay?

173
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,740
Come on.

174
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,390
It’s good to have a friend.

175
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,630
You know what?

176
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,260
You’re my first friend.

177
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,910
Now that we’re friends,

178
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,110
don’t you ever leave me.

179
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,650
Why was Meen so mad at me?

180
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,290
Pi.

181
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,510
Pi.

182
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,720
What’s wrong?

183
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Pi, who did this to you?

184
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,020
Pi!

185
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,350
Pi!

186
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,700
Are you up there?

187
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,330
I know you’re there.

188
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,830
Come out and talk to me.

189
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,480
Mork, you asshole!

190
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,280
Pi!

191
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,230
Duean!

192
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,530
Pi!

193
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,560
Please talk to me.

194
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,790
Why the heck are you shouting in front of my house?

195
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,720
Go home!

196
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,540
Can I talk to Pi?

197
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,910
He doesn’t want to talk to you.

198
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,250
Damn you!

199
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,930
He’s changed so much already.

200
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,060
But for me, he doesn’t have to change anything.

201
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,420
I love everything about him.

202
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,660
What you just did is what you call love?

203
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,980
I didn’t do it.

204
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Why would I want to hurt him?

205
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,650
Why would I want to make someone I love feel bad?

206
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,400
Pi!

207
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,390
Pi!

208
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,730
Stop shouting.

209
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,550
Pi!

210
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,620
Come out and talk to me, please.

211
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,990
Do you think I won’t hit you?

212
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,080
Pi, talk to me please.

213
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,210
Shut the hell up, Mork!

214
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,920
Pi, come out here.

215
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,990
I told you to shut!

216
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,170
Pi, please.

217
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,210
Damn you, Mork!

218
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,090
I shooed him away.

219
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,050
Can I please be alone?

220
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,870
I just want to love you.

221
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,350
I want to love you without caring what people think.

222
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,490
It isn’t about people on social media.

223
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:02,880
It’s me.

224
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,610
I’m weak.

225
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
I’m being paranoid.

226
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,420
I lack confidence.

227
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,950
I suck. I can’t handle this kind of stuff.

228
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,620
You’re not me. You don’t get it.

229
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,430
I didn’t do it.

230
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,020
Why would I want to hurt him?

231
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,560
Why would I want to make someone I love feel bad?

232
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,260
You want to be yourself.

233
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,410
And I want to be myself too.

234
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,320
So I did hurt your feelings, Meen?

235
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Duean, I said I don’t want to drink it!

236
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,180
Do you think what I did was wrong?

237
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,490
I shouldn’t have done that to him.

238
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,580
Take it back.

239
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,680
Pi, I really didn’t do it.

240
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,530
- Whatever.
- I didn’t.

241
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,110
All right, you didn’t.

242
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,550
Mork.

243
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,670
I have a confession to make.

244
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,500
Those photos,

245
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,510
I was the one who posted them.

246
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,290
I just snapped.

247
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I have to admit

248
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,490
I like you so much.

249
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,940
I like you…

250
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
more than a friend.

251
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:58,230
It’s not like I’m talking to you and holding your hand like this, right?

252
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,620
People can see.

253
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,870
You are jealous.

254
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,410
I am not.

255
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,300
You are.

256
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,380
You’re not just jealous.

257
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,170
You are aggressively jealous.

258
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,440
After seeing the result of what I did,

259
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,840
I feel really bad.

260
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,810
I shouldn’t have done it.

261
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,270
Mork, I am so sorry.

262
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,170
You have every right to end our friendship and hate me.

263
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
But Mork…

264
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,740
Please forgive me for this.

265
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,320
I really didn’t mean to.

266
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,970
I will do whatever you say.

267
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
Please, Mork.

268
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,790
It’s done.

269
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,500
It can’t be fixed now.

270
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,100
It can.

271
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,840
I will help you and Pi get back together.

272
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:20,290
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.12 - From Bad Luck to Beautiful Love)

273
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,790
Meen!

274
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,590
May I…

275
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Please…

276
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,210
Damn it!

277
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,090
Say whatever. Just be yourself.

278
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,810
All right then.

279
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,210
I bought you a snack.

280
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,580
It’s so good.

281
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,690
Let me open it for you.

282
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,450
Here.

283
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,710
Don’t you want it?

284
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,310
Why are you doing this?

285
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,010
I just want to say I’m sorry.

286
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
I shouldn’t have made you do such a thing.

287
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,610
From now on, I won’t force you to do anything.

288
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,880
Whatever you want to be,

289
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,080
or whatever you want to do,

290
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,520
It’s all fine by me.

291
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,820
I am sorry.

292
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,950
Are we cool now?

293
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,990
It’s really good.

294
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,690
You’re not mad anymore, right?

295
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,670
Duean, what did you just do?

296
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,190
I wanted to have some too.

297
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,190
But you already gave it to me.

298
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,070
Buy yourself another one.

299
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,030
Bye now. I don’t want to be late.

300
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,270
Meen!

301
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,670
Pay attention in class.

302
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,940
I know. Stop calling my name already.

303
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,630
Get to class safely.

304
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,100
I’m waiting for you to call me ‘Duean!’, ‘Duean!’ again.

305
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,210
I know.

306
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,110
Clear sky.

307
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,620
It’s just perfect for today’s mission.

308
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,560
My mission is to deliver love to people.

309
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,500
Crap! I don’t want to do this.

310
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
Pi, hello!

311
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,640
Hello.

312
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Not the people I love though.

313
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,890
I’m just their cupid.

314
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,060
Pi, the next surprise is about to take place.

315
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,960
Yeah?

316
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,750
Who?

317
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,300
A med student is going to confess to a dental student.

318
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,050
Where are they?

319
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,080
This way.

320
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Pi, take the balloons with you.

321
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,700
Sure.

322
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
Give them here.

323
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,640
Let’s go.

324
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,330
Duean, I’m your brother.

325
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,350
What the heck are you doing?

326
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,840
That’s right.

327
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,330
You’re my brother.

328
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,170
And I’m a pervert.

329
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
What a d*ck!

330
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,040
Not me!

331
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Look again.

332
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,110
What the hell are you looking at, Pi?

333
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
What are you guys doing? I’m confused.

334
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
We’re just misleaders.

335
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,600
The one who wants to confess is over there.

336
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,680
You didn’t want to see me.

337
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,450
So, I had to do it this way.

338
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,410
Fine. Say what you need to say.

339
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,080
Let’s get it over with.

340
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,400
Pi, just listen.

341
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,980
Those photos,

342
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,790
it was all me.

343
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,790
I know the password to Mork’s phone.

344
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,200
I posted them.

345
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,870
You did?

346
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,190
Yes.

347
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,950
If there’s anyone to blame, it’s me.

348
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,480
Whatever.

349
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,440
It’s over now.

350
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
But Mork wants to talk to you.

351
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,510
Say what you want.

352
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,590
You always think about other people.

353
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,580
You care what they think and what they say.

354
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,740
But for me, I want you to ask yourself.

355
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Ask yourself what you really think.

356
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Ask yourself if you want to be with me

357
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,420
As for me, it’s always been very clear.

358
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,060
I want to be with you.

359
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,390
Don’t you get it?

360
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,180
I never had friends.

361
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,070
I was never in love.

362
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
And then you came along.

363
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
I don’t want to lose you.

364
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
You are loved by so many people.

365
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,420
How can I say that…

366
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,020
you are all mine?

367
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,970
It just hurts. It hurts so bad to be judged by people.

368
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,440
But what hurts me more is you being judged by those people too.

369
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,010
If they hate you because you’re with me,

370
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,010
how can I be happy with that?

371
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,330
Pi, Pattawee.

372
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,010
Don’t be afraid I’d feel bad if they criticize me.

373
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,750
Be selfish all you want.

374
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,680
Because I’m so damn happy when I’m with you.

375
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,210
Those people don’t make me happy like the one I love does.

376
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Are you lying to me?

377
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
What can I do to make you believe me?

378
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,990
Be my boyfriend?

379
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,350
No more ships to sail.

380
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
Do you want to be shipped with me?

381
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
Hell no.

382
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,890
Want some drink?

383
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,490
You’ve been crying a lot.

384
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,470
I bought it for you. The ice cubes are melting.

385
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Are you hitting on me?

386
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,150
I’ll just be frank then.

387
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,210
I like you.

388
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,990
Can I hit on you?

389
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,640
Shit!

390
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,140
He’s hardcore.

391
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,780
Just let me know if you don’t want to be hit on. That will save me time.

392
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,350
But…

393
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,870
I’m a girl.

394
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,650
Aren’t you gonna give me a chance to play hard to get?

395
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,870
You wanna play?

396
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,610
Let’s go.

397
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,450
Go where?

398
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,840
Go play.

399
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,030
Come on.

400
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,680
You’re crazy. Who would want to play with you?

401
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,290
Are you serious?

402
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,630
Yes. Watch your step.

403
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,840
We have found a new ship.

404
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Take good care of my brother.

405
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,390
If he cries again, you’ll be crying too.

406
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,640
(Stop worrying about other people’s business. What about your own?)

407
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,130
Give me some time to think.

408
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,870
Don’t you freaking push me.

409
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,410
Damn you! You’ve been getting on my nerves since the first episode.

410
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,370
Why? Do I look like someone you can mess with?

411
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,510
Why are you still looking at me? I’m gonna beat you up!

412
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,560
Our Snow White will never wake up again.

413
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,410
My horse, who’s there?

414
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Is she Snow White?

415
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,290
Are you a prince?

416
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,680
Yes, I am a prince.

417
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,950
Hold my sword, please.

418
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,500
Snow White, why are you lying here?

419
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
Wake up and talk to me.

420
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Here he comes!

421
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,320
Snow White has woken up.

422
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,770
P’Jeans, you’re awesome.

423
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,870
You killed it.

424
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,210
- Really?
- Really.

425
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,950
Meen, my dream has finally come true.

426
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,610
Thanks so much.

427
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,670
You were incredible.

428
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,500
Yeah?

429
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,220
Yes.

430
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,230
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn’t be here.

431
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Name whatever you want to eat. My treat.

432
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,310
Let’s thank the audiences.

433
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,530
Is that for me?

434
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,620
No, not you.

435
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,200
It’s for Meen.

436
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,040
For me?

437
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,910
Yes.

438
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,270
Take it. It’s heavy.

439
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,790
Hold on, I have something to say first

440
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,040
What?

441
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
From day one until now,

442
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,550
I’ve been having this weird feeling for you.

443
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
My heart pounds when I’m with you.

444
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,280
I like your scent.

445
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
I like your annoying voice.

446
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,480
And you’re the reason why I want to be a better person.

447
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,370
Do you think it’s weird?

448
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,310
It’s not weird, Duean.

449
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,110
Do you get what I’m trying to say?

450
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,410
I do.

451
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,500
I am…

452
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
...feeling what you’re feeling.

453
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,980
So that means…

454
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,140
we feel the same way?

455
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,170
Yes.

456
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,920
Will you be my boyfriend?

457
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Okay. I will be your boyfriend.

458
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
This is the right moment to kiss.

459
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,600
The end of the story of a fifth-year student ep.12

460
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Have you seen this, Mork?

461
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Your brother belongs with my brother now.

462
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,160
What a grand opening Duean had there!

463
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
I guess Meen was okay with that.

464
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,460
Let’s talk about us.

465
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,440
When will you accept my friend request?

466
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,520
I…

467
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,320
I deleted it.

468
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,640
How can I accept it?

469
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,860
Send it again. I’ll do it now.

470
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,710
Done! Are you cool now?

471
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,710
No.

472
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,730
(Sutthaya Nithikornkul listed that you two are in a relationship.)

473
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,560
Do you want me to delete them?

474
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,390
Delete what?

475
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,700
Your photos.

476
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,700
No. Just leave them there.

477
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,300
Why not?

478
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,410
You don’t like these pictures.

479
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,380
I used to dislike them.

480
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,130
But I have changed a lot.

481
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,380
And I have no idea how much I’ll change in 5 years.

482
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,320
Whether I like them or not, they’re all me.

483
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,120
But for me, I like every part of your life.

484
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,120
Do you remember that you called an impossible love fish upon the sky?

485
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,300
For me,

486
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,840
my fish upon the sky is possible

487
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
because it’s you.

488
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,400
You’re making me blush.

489
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:22,010
Please stay with me for a long long time, fish upon the sky.

490
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,850
Okay. I’ll stay with you for a long, long time.

491
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,870
I’m envious.

492
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,910
Nan!

493
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,870
What’s up? You’d been gone.

494
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,090
You didn’t come to my birthday party.

495
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,020
I got something to do.

496
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,700
I did give you a present though.

497
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,600
I helped you guys figure out how you felt.

498
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:53,280
I heard you two metaphorized your love as fish upon the sky.

499
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,260
And yours?

500
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,070
Mine?

501
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,020
It’s probably a star in the sea.

502
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,120
It’s not possible.

503
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,060
It is possible.

504
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,590
If a fish can swim upon the sky,

505
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,040
you can find a star in the sea too.

506
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
How long will you stare at each other?

507
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,060
Congratulations.

508
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,090
2 YEARS LATER

509
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,780
Damn it, Sutthaya!

510
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,100
Aren’t you going to care for me just a bit?

511
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Do I really need to call you?

512
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,090
Hello, Mork.

513
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,250
What are you doing?

514
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,650
I’m in clinical practice.

515
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,330
What’s up?

516
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,180
Hey, aren’t you going to call me at all?

517
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,630
I’m tied up.

518
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,100
And I know you’re reading. I don’t want to bother you.

519
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
You’ve been occupied with other doctors’ cases.

520
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,250
What about your case over here?

521
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,840
What happened?

522
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,280
I sprained my ankle.

523
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,860
Really?

524
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,680
Really.

525
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,990
I’m home alone. I can’t walk properly.

526
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,590
I can’t move around and I’m hungry.

527
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,200
Nobody cares.

528
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,800
I gotta go now.

529
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,640
Sorry about that, sir.

530
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Even with the story I made up,

531
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,400
you still don’t care?

532
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,110
Fine, I’ll go find something to eat myself.

533
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,880
(Mom: I’m on duty tonight. Order something in for dinner, okay?)

534
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,290
All right, mom.

535
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,970
See you.

536
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,340
I’ll order something then.

537
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,190
Yes!

538
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,140
I’m coming.

539
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,910
What am I gonna do?

540
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,460
Why is my life so dramatic?

541
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,670
I know. I’m coming.

542
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,720
Just a sec!

543
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,380
Can’t you just chill? I’m coming!

544
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Coming.

545
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,790
You just can’t stop ordering stuff, can you Duean?

546
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,290
Damn! Why didn’t you come a bit faster?

547
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,150
Damn it, Duean! What are these things for? Are you opening a shop?

548
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,480
Duean, why did you order so many things!?

549
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,850
Screw it. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll just stay here.

550
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,710
What a shitty day!

551
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,200
Why did I have to hurt myself today?

552
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,860
I can’t walk and it hurts so bad.

553
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,010
Woah! Is it this bad?

554
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,660
You’re so late. It’s better if you didn’t show up at all.

555
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,240
I am sorry.

556
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,710
Come on. Let’s go eat.

557
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,020
Let me help you up.

558
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,820
Don’t. I can walk myself.

559
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,850
You can’t.

560
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,280
I can.

561
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,060
Be still.

562
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,310
Sure I can. I’ve been taking care of myself all day.

563
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,410
Don’t be stubborn, Pi.

564
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,530
It doesn’t hurt. I can walk.

565
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,340
I’ve walked myself all day.

566
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,730
I better help. Come on.

567
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,180
Slowly.

568
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,640
I’ve been alone all day. I don’t need help.

569
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,630
You came so late. You shouldn’t have come at all.

570
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,730
I am sorry.

571
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,500
You didn’t reply to my messages.

572
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,460
What are you smiling at?

573
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,570
What?

574
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,270
I can just look at you all day.

575
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,290
Do you want me to feed you?

576
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
No way!

577
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,000
My hands are working fine.

578
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,370
I can eat.

579
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Hey, stay still.

580
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Sweet.

581
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,130
Legs up.

582
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
Thanks, Mork.

583
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,880
Hold on.

584
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,200
Take medicines and get some rest.

585
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,380
Support your leg with this. It will help with the healing.

586
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,520
Yes, doctor.

587
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,660
I think…

588
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,500
you need tepid sponge.

589
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,960
No. You don’t have to do it.

590
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,780
Hey, what are you doing, Mork?

591
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,000
Don’t try to resist.

592
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,560
Mork, I’m not kidding.

593
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,500
You don’t have to do it.

594
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,400
Damn you!

595
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Is that your basket?

596
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,380
Are you happy now?

597
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,880
Pants now.

598
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,850
My pants? We don’t need to do this.

599
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,180
Just don’t.

600
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,550
Watch your leg.

601
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,070
No. No way.

602
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,690
Mork, it hurts.

603
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,730
It does so stop moving.

604
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,380
Slowly.

605
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,780
I got them.

606
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,620
Are you happy now?

607
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,960
You can give me tepid sponge now.

608
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,830
Underwear too.

609
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:22,770
Underwear?

610
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,220
Mork, don’t! Stop!

611
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,540
Stop it.

612
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,720
Mork, stop it!

613
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Be still. Don’t move.

614
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,840
I’m so naked.

615
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,520
I have nothing to hide.

616
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,190
Please. I just want to see your room.

617
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,080
P’Mork!

618
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,790
Pi!

619
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,380
Duean!

620
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,070
Meen!

621
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,300
Stop calling each other, damn it!

622
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,940
Mork, you asshole. What are you doing to my brother?

623
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,140
Meen, close your eyes.

624
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,380
Mork, you’re so dead!

625
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,830
Are we really doing this?

626
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:16,920
We are.

627
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,930
If not with you, who else would I do this with?

628
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,280
But I have never done it.

629
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,840
Me neither.

630
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,030
You’re my first.

631
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,920
We will go through it together.

632
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,130
Will it hurt?

633
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
No. I’ll be gentle.

634
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,670
Promise?

635
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,050
I promise.

636
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,090
Okay?

637
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Okay. Open your mouth.

638
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,340
Wider.

639
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,850
That’s good.

640
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:21,800
See? The longer we’re together, the cleaner your teeth get.

641
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,350
Okay. Great.

642
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,710
A little suction.

643
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,710
Okay.

644
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,150
And we’re done.

645
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,890
Can I check?

646
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,090
Always take advantage of me. You kissed me again.

647
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,790
So?

648
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,560
So?

649
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So it’s my turn.

650
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,480
2 3 and…

651
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,840
4.

652
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,400
Can’t I get more?

653
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,100
Come on, we’re in a public place.

654
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,100
So?

655
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,760
I normally kiss you in public places, don’t I?

656
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,630
Hey, don’t push your luck.

657
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,700
Quickly.

658
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,560
No.

659
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,940
No one is here.

660
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,750
What are you afraid of?

661
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Just one?

662
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,110
Yes.

663
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:37,910
THE TREATMENT HAS BEEN COMPLETED
