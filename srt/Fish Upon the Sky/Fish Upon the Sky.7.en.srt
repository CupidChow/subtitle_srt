1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,200
I really like you.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,170
But I can only be your friend.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,250
I don’t want you to waste any more time on me.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,260
I want to take care of you, Pi.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,780
Dental Student Pattawee Panichapun

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,360
I’ll just try searching by his name.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,400
I’m such a jinx.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,330
I’ll never succeed at anything.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,520
I just can’t…

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,720
I can be your vaccine, Pi.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,930
Want some?

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,420
No.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,310
Not in the mood.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,130
It’s all mine then.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,720
(Damn! Why did I have to cry in his arms?)

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,600
(My tough image was ruined.)

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,600
This is so good.

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,170
Now I know why you like it.

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,450
Are you sure you don’t want some?

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,340
It’s yummy.

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,500
All right. I’ll have some.

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,820
Where did you know it from?

23
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,580
My elder brother started eating it first.

24
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,870
He let me try some.

25
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,090
I liked it immediately after a bite.

26
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,810
It has become my favorite since then.

27
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,710
Sometimes, I eat this and forget to eat real food.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,080
My mom never quits complaining about it.

29
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,780
I think…

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,370
she must be feeling worse than I am right now.

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,080
I just wanted to make conversation

32
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,270
but you led us back to this topic.

33
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,230
Has she ever banned you from eating this snack?

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,290
She just complains about it sometimes.

35
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,660
I eat this and forget to eat real food.

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,200
But never really says no?

37
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,080
Then don’t be afraid she’d be mad at you.

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,760
Has she ever banned you from eating She says things because she loves you.

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,900
And because she loves you,

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,090
she lets you eat this.

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,570
She knows you like it.

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,520
So, whatever you like,

43
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,850
you can tell her.

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,650
I don’t think I’m ready.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,300
This is too much for her.

46
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,560
Hey!

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,080
I’m thirsty.

48
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,720
Can you do something for me?

49
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,920
What?

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,940
Are you sure you want it?

51
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,730
Yes.

52
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,610
You better not.

53
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,290
I don’t want to carry you again.

54
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,940
You said you were my friend.

55
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,800
Can’t you do this for a friend?

56
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,950
Pi,

57
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,970
I don’t think it’s a good idea.

58
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,380
Give it here.

59
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,500
But last time, you blacked out.

60
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,740
My brother told me that I get drunk easily with an empty stomach.

61
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,580
But my stomach isn’t empty now.

62
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,160
Fine! I’ll have just one gulp and you drink the rest.

63
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,540
Are you sure you will be okay?

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,830
I am.

65
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,600
EP.7 - COMPLICATIONS

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,450
Hey, look!

67
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,680
We have a dance game here.

68
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,920
This is cool.

69
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,350
Come on. Play with me.

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,510
Sorry about him.

71
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,410
Sorry.

72
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,910
Shit, Pi! Be quiet. Don’t disturb people.

73
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,530
Okay. I’ll be quiet.

74
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,740
Hey!

75
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,630
Come on. Aren’t you my friend?

76
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,450
You shouldn’t stop me.

77
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,360
What you should do is dance along.

78
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,240
Let’s dance.

79
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,090
Which song do you want?

80
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,260
Let’s do it.

81
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
1 2!

82
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,550
Mork, you suck at it. Keep it up!

83
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,020
Yes!

84
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,680
You’re such a nerd.

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
You just said that because you lost.

86
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,910
The loser has to be a dog.

87
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,850
Come here.

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
No. I asked for your hand.

89
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,850
I know.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,540
I just wanted to bug you.

91
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,300
Are you sure you’re running?

92
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm going as fast as I can, soft-cheeked.

93
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,380
Go faster. Run run!

94
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,540
Hold on tight then.

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,340
That’s right.

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,140
Faster!

97
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,090
Let’s go!

98
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,000
What’s the matter, Mork?

99
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,570
Aren’t you going to smile at all?

100
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,360
Hey,

101
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,940
Mork!

102
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,710
You just let me drink alone.

103
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,680
You didn’t drink with me just a bit.

104
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,020
I paid for it.

105
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,320
And now you’re ignoring me.

106
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,010
Stay still.

107
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,840
You don’t want to fall off.

108
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,480
It’s good to have a friend.

109
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,680
You know what?

110
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,690
You’re my first friend.

111
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,980
Now that we’re friends,

112
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,600
don’t you ever leave me.

113
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,920
Hey!

114
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,580
You’re tired already?

115
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,810
Why so weak?

116
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,030
Yes,

117
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,570
I am weak.

118
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,920
I’ll give you that.

119
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
Here. Drink.

120
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,070
It’s 4 in the morning.

121
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,380
Don’t you think we should stop being so hyped up?

122
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,630
Fine.

123
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,310
I’ll give you a 5-minute break.

124
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,880
1 2 3 4...

125
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,790
Can I have a 5-hour break?

126
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,640
What is going on with you?

127
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,810
Let go.

128
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,610
No.

129
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,790
Give me a break.

130
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,560
Hey!

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,840
You can’t go to bed without brushing your teeth first.

132
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,230
Let me.

133
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,680
Scoot over.

134
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,290
Do it.

135
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,160
Now move back.

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,980
Put your head right here.

137
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,010
Come on.

138
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,230
Let me brush your teeth.

139
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,950
This is a proper way to brush your teeth.

140
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,010
You have to…

141
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,610
smear a pea-sized amount of toothpaste onto your brush.

142
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,280
We don’t need a lot, just like all the dentists advise.

143
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,430
It’s all we need.

144
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,450
And then…

145
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,630
Open your mouth.

146
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,000
Open it.

147
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,040
Gently brush your teeth from left to right in circles.

148
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,640
Do it section by section.

149
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,960
Then the upper teeth.

150
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,460
Brush all over your mouth.

151
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,620
And we’re done.

152
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,520
Now let me check.

153
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,090
I think my teeth are already clean.

154
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,210
Oh! Come on.

155
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,390
(Can't you just say what your heart wants already?)

156
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,990
Awake now?

157
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,260
I bet you had a nice sleep.

158
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,920
Why am I in this position?

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,120
Because I made you sleep in this position.

160
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,080
Do you think you could do that yourself?

161
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,210
My legs are numb.

162
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
You were wasted last night. Do you know that?

163
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,740
I do, some of it.

164
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,120
But I couldn’t control myself. Sorry.

165
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Alright. That’s fine.

166
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,070
I get you.

167
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,700
What are you going to do now?

168
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,600
Are you going home?

169
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,170
No.

170
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,190
I don’t think I am.

171
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,890
I will study around here.

172
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,790
Looking like this?

173
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,680
You’re not in some cold country where you don’t need to clean often.

174
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,610
What a mess.

175
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,680
But I don’t want to go home.

176
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,970
Where else should I take a shower?

177
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,760
My house.

178
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,660
Not happy with the answer?

179
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,910
If you want to take a shower with me, just say it.

180
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,390
Sutt!

181
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,440
Sutthaya!

182
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,650
Shit! It’s cold.

183
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,790
Sorry.

184
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,840
I forgot to tell you the water heater wasn’t working.

185
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,260
It’s freaking cold.

186
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,010
Why are you just standing there?

187
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,880
Go do something to help.

188
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,920
Open the door then.

189
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,280
I’ll come rescue you.

190
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,860
No. I’m willing to freeze to death.

191
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,730
You don’t have to guard the door. Just go.

192
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,200
It’s freaking cold.

193
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,470
What’s wrong with this house?

194
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,430
The aircon is freezing.

195
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,540
The water is so cold.

196
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,650
Even the soap is cold.

197
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,320
No. I asked for your hand.

198
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,260
I know.

199
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,880
I just wanted to bug you.

200
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,170
(Shit! Why am I smiling?)

201
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,890
Hey, where are my clothes?

202
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,010
Outside on the drying stand.

203
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,200
You hung them for me?

204
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,950
No. I washed them for you.

205
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
What! What am I going to wear?

206
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,160
No need to shout.

207
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,700
You can wear mine.

208
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,750
Here.

209
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,320
My shirt and my pants.

210
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,730
You want underwear too?

211
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,270
No!

212
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,080
Do I really have to wear your clothes?

213
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,340
You can go out there naked,

214
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,630
if you’re bold enough.

215
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,970
That’s okay. I’m not bold enough.

216
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,620
You can put them on right here.

217
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,330
I won’t take a peek.

218
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,320
I’ll just take a picture.

219
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Sutthaya!

220
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,090
Wow! Let me try some of these.

221
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,850
It’s so good.

222
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,840
Eat up if it’s good.

223
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,220
This water spinach is just…

224
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,720
so crispy.

225
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,680
How about this Dried Shrimp Salad?

226
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,050
Dried Shrimp Salad...

227
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,800
Yummyyyy!

228
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,900
I’m not eating anymore.

229
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,540
I lost my appetite.

230
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,790
I’m trying to cheer you up, honey.

231
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,070
Relax. He will come home soon.

232
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,380
Honey,

233
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,400
Pi is acting weird, very weird.

234
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,560
He’s never been like this before.

235
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,720
He was not like this but it doesn’t mean he can’t be.

236
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,610
He’s growing up every day.

237
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,900
Whenever he’s ready to talk, he’ll come to us, all right?

238
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,630
Come on. Let’s eat.

239
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,770
We don't want to be late for work.

240
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,620
Okay?

241
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,160
Alright.

242
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,780
You eat more.

243
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,000
By the way,

244
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,610
Wan called the other day.

245
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,990
He said he’d come home this Saturday.

246
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,450
That’s great.

247
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,910
Did he say what he wanted to eat? We can prepare it for him.

248
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,740
He didn’t.

249
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,900
He only said he’d bring someone he’s dating.

250
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,920
This young lad!

251
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,180
So wicked.

252
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,130
See?

253
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,220
I told you he doesn’t like to come home because he has a girlfriend there.

254
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,170
I really want to see her.

255
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,420
Let’s see if our son can find someone as gorgeous as my love here.

256
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,880
Let’s just eat.

257
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,670
This is so good.

258
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,110
Can you just let me be for a few seconds?

259
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,580
Sure.

260
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,950
All right!

261
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,580
It’s the last day here.

262
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,630
Let’s get it over with.

263
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,000
(The Story of a Fifth-Year Student EP.7 - No More Gown)

264
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,620
Why is no one here?

265
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,780
We don’t have a dental check-up today.

266
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,600
Really?

267
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Yes. It’s changed to some other educational topic.

268
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,070
Is that right, Meen?

269
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,020
That’s right.

270
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,120
I changed today’s program.

271
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,480
That’s what people always do when they see someone choking

272
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,710
which is not quite right.

273
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,930
This isn’t right either.

274
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,580
This is also not right.

275
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,760
Show them the right way

276
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,120
before I die.

277
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,690
Be quiet.

278
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,200
Just help me like you said you would.

279
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
And that was the right way to help.

280
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Stand behind his back.

281
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,590
Support his chest with your hands.

282
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Then lift him up a little and jolt

283
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,940
until whatever blocking his airway comes out.

284
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,730
Like this.

285
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,550
That’s the proper way to help someone choking.

286
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,100
After this,

287
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,460
we need to talk.

288
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,470
Um.

289
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
Here. Drink it.

290
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,080
What are you looking at, my friend?

291
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,250
Nothing.

292
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,510
I just want to know why

293
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,320
someone like you wants to be my friend.

294
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,720
Why do you ask?

295
00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:00,520
I just want to know why a popular guy like you wants to be friends with a loser like me.

296
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,820
What?

297
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,700
Because to me,

298
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,660
you’re never a loser.

299
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,970
Why are you drinking mine?

300
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,970
You have your own.

301
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,290
Because I wanted to drink yours.

302
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,570
Besides, I don’t mind drinking after your lips.

303
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,160
We’re friends, aren’t we?

304
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,660
You’re crazy.

305
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,530
Shit!

306
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,970
What?

307
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,150
Someone is having me on their Live.

308
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,580
(Pi is wearing Mork’s clothes.)

309
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,320
How do they know?

310
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,880
(I remember.)

311
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,680
(So cute!)

312
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,890
(Alright. I’ll stop teasing.)

313
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,000
Where are they?

314
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,250
Mommy, take the hanging clothes inside. It’s about to rain.

315
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,310
Let me check my teeth.

316
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Oops! A guy just texted me.

317
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,500
I’m so out of here.

318
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,370
Hold on

319
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,390
It’s just a Live.

320
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,450
Don’t worry about it.

321
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,440
This is why people are misunderstanding.

322
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,470
It’s also why Muang Nan misunderstood.

323
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,940
Hey!

324
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,800
Nan made it very clear.

325
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,740
I should have moved on already, right?

326
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,500
You should move on.

327
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,630
Otherwise, people who care about you will be worried.

328
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,710
I am not feeling very well.

329
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,720
I’m taking off now.

330
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,610
- You, come here!
- Duean, you’re hurting me.

331
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,530
What is it?

332
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,600
I’m hurting you? Not as bad as you hurt me.

333
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Why did you change the plan without telling me?

334
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,430
You keep a secret from me too. You don’t tell me everything.

335
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,360
What secret?

336
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,440
You are not a dental student.

337
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,250
I am!

338
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,360
That name on the gown isn’t your name.

339
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,120
I looked it up and the owner wasn’t you.

340
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,450
Why did you lie to me?

341
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,710
I just borrowed his gown.

342
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,800
He likes to steal my underwear so it’s my turn to borrow something from him.

343
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,630
So how are you related to a guy named Pattawee?

344
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,870
Is he your little brother?

345
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,110
My big brother.

346
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,800
I’m a first-year student.

347
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
How can he be my little brother?

348
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,760
(What a smart brain I have here!)

349
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,640
But he looks younger.

350
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,600
That’s right!

351
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,990
I look so old!

352
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,530
You’re so mean. You keep saying I look old over and over.

353
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,540
Do you even have a heart?

354
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,480
(I’m super clever!)

355
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,010
Duean, where are you going?

356
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,320
To pack.

357
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,750
Don’t you follow me.

358
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,980
Duean, wait up!

359
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,620
Duean!

360
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,760
If you truly like me,

361
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,940
your heart should beat faster.

362
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,960
Pi, just think it through.

363
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,150
Did you confess to me

364
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,590
because you’re trying to run away from something?

365
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,170
I believe you used to like me

366
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,320
but I think now you’re scared.

367
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,230
You’re scared of falling for someone else.

368
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,680
Someone not me.

369
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,550
I like Muang Nan.

370
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,290
You didn’t go to work?

371
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,430
I’m not feeling well.

372
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,660
(Pi, you made your mom worry so much that she’s sick.)

373
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,090
(You’re such a bad son.)

374
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,110
These are not the clothes you wore yesterday.

375
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,830
I like Muang Nan.

376
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,210
I like Muang Nan.

377
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,290
I like Muang Nan.

378
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,100
Eww!

379
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,580
Junk!

380
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,800
This one is still okay.

381
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,330
It’s fine.

382
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,100
Hey,

383
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,350
are you leaving today or next year?

384
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,580
From the way you pack, I can tell you won’t be done by the end of 2021.

385
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,390
I’m talking to you here.

386
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,420
Are you ignoring me?

387
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,450
Okay.

388
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,270
If you don’t talk to me, I won’t let you ride home with me.

389
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,210
I know it!

390
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
You’re scared of being left alone here, right?

391
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,210
Am I right?

392
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,520
Scared, are you?

393
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,790
You can go, Duean.

394
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,610
I will find the way home myself.

395
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,980
What?

396
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,930
What’s wrong now?

397
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,290
Why being dramatic again?

398
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,610
I must have done many wrong things to you.

399
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,440
That’s why you don’t trust me.

400
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,410
That’s why you have to lie to me.

401
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,030
And you’re always annoyed by me.

402
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,310
Well, it isn’t that bad.

403
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
It’s okay.

404
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
You can go.

405
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,320
I don’t want to annoy you.

406
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,360
You said it yourself.

407
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,510
I am leaving then.

408
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,930
Some help?

409
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,260
That’s okay. It’s nothing at all.

410
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,220
I meant 'Help me, please. I need your love.'

411
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,490
That was super straightforward.

412
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,740
Sorry about him.

413
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,460
This fatty doesn’t have manners.

414
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,950
Are you bullying me?

415
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,460
We should fight fair.

416
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,940
- Fair?
- Yes.

417
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,240
Do you have a boyfriend?

418
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,080
No.

419
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,890
If there’re two men left in this world, me and this fatty,

420
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,800
who would you pick?

421
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,610
Don’t put pressure on her.

422
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,990
You’re such a jackass.

423
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
If you don’t know how to flirt, just go away.

424
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,500
Watch me.

425
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,950
Watch and learn.

426
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,450
Learn and apply.

427
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,760
Why do I need to listen to you?

428
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,010
Fatty!

429
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,950
Son of a *!

430
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,280
You call me fat one more time.

431
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,850
- Don’t!
- What are you gonna do?

432
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,520
Come on then.

433
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,440
It’s me.

434
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,790
Someone just sent me a game invite.

435
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,480
I play the carry role.

436
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,970
You’re the tank.

437
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,280
Sure.

438
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,130
Whatever you want me to be.

439
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,780
You guys suck.

440
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,370
Shocked, huh?

441
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,440
Come here.

442
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,430
Come down here.

443
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,890
Don’t be confused.

444
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,410
Going home?

445
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:17,940
Yes.

446
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,020
And your boyfriend?

447
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,130
Your dad’s boyfriend, you mean?

448
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,260
Daddy is mentioned again.

449
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,970
Alright.

450
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,350
Where is that Meen kid?

451
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,080
He said he’d go back on his own.

452
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,530
On his own?

453
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,890
How?

454
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,240
This is the countryside.

455
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,950
Right.

456
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,670
Worried about him?

457
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,240
You take him home then.

458
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,290
How can I?

459
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
I came here with my beloved friend, Koh.

460
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,850
So he’s your friend?

461
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,190
What about me who goes with you to every casting event?

462
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,450
Yok, my beloved friend.

463
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,450
Don’t talk to me.

464
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,530
You go with him.

465
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,640
I’ll go with Duean.

466
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,020
What the hell?

467
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,040
So this fatty is your friend?

468
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,510
You guys go together.

469
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,500
I’ll travel home by myself.

470
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,340
What?

471
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,910
Koh!

472
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,990
Hold on! I just finished the game.

473
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,660
What are you two fighting about?

474
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,410
I’ll tell you in the car.

475
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,360
- Can I go with you?
- No.

476
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,460
Come on.

477
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,380
No.

478
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,520
You’re being childish.

479
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,400
I am.

480
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,720
Ride with your beloved friends.

481
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Stop fighting. Get in already.

482
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,940
What was that all about?

483
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,370
Just drive.

484
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,080
I’ll tell you on the way back.

485
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,730
You guys are shitty friends!

486
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,010
How are you going to get home?

487
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,380
I have no idea.

488
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,720
Ride with me then.

489
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,510
Just move that bag to the back seat.

490
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,780
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.7 is over.)

491
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,820
Hey, are you busy?

492
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,810
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: No.)

493
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,570
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: You’d been gone.)

494
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,480
Are you dating someone and forgetting about me?

495
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,750
I am not.

496
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,120
Hey,

497
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,650
I need to ask you something.

498
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,610
Have you ever felt hesitant or unsure about something?

499
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,740
I have.

500
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,720
Sometimes, I want to have some rice but end up ordering noodles at a restaurant.

501
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,850
Not about food.

502
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,650
What is it about then?

503
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,330
About love.

504
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,890
About love?

505
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,290
But you just said you’re not dating.

506
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
Let me explain first.

507
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,790
There are two people.

508
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,170
The first one is very nice, the person of my dreams.

509
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,150
And the other one…

510
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,110
when I’m with him…

511
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,060
What?

512
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,580
He makes my heart pound.

513
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,960
This is easy.

514
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,220
Don’t use your brains to judge your feelings.

515
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,280
What do you mean?

516
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,400
Do you know what disease you’re having right now?

517
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,020
Wait a minute!

518
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,210
You’re talking like someone I know.

519
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,000
Who?

520
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,400
A heart disease.

521
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,690
Not a common heart disease though.

522
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,690
It only happens when you’re close to someone you love.

523
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,910
Hello, my beloved bro.

524
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,260
I am back!

525
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,830
Damn you!

526
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:18,610
You took my boxers and my gown with you.

527
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,930
I didn’t mean to.

528
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,850
I was in a rush and I grabbed your gown by mistake.

529
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,090
Here. Take it back.

530
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,020
It stinks so badly!

531
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,240
Once it’s washed, it becomes brand new again.

532
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,370
I’ll just put it in the basket and mommy will take care of it.

533
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,170
Hey!

534
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,740
What’s up?

535
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,550
I don’t want to bother her for that.

536
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,120
Did you guys have a fight?

537
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,060
Not exactly.

538
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,000
She came in here, opened this book and found this.

539
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,570
And?

540
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,810
I just don’t know what to do now.

541
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,610
How about we ask Wan?

542
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
He is smart. He should be able to help you better than me.

543
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,950
I’ll send him a voice message.

544
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,020
Wan,

545
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,140
I heard you’re coming this weekend.

546
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,580
Just hurry. Your brothers miss you here.

547
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Don’t overthink it.

548
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,430
Are you comforting or hitting me?

549
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,800
Comforting.

550
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,000
Comforting like adults.

551
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,330
It’s good to have a friend.

552
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,270
You’re my first friend.

553
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,620
Now that we’re friends,

554
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,410
don’t you ever leave me.

555
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,390
Being friends is good enough for now.

556
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,740
SATURDAY

557
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,140
My best recipe.

558
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,610
Stop! Don’t eat yet.

559
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,120
Can’t I have just one bite?

560
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,170
No.

561
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,510
Just a small bite.

562
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,220
Calm down.

563
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,760
Let’s wait for everyone to show up.

564
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,490
Wan will be here soon.

565
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
See? here he comes.

566
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,750
Let’s go see whom he brings home.

567
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,040
Don’t get excited. Hide your excitement!

568
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,130
My son.

569
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,480
Hi, dad. Hi, mom.

570
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,610
Hi.

571
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,690
Gifts from Hat Yai.

572
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,620
Wow! Why so many?

573
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,490
You don’t have to bring gifts next time.

574
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,680
Don’t need to bother.

575
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,510
No problem at all.

576
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,690
He bought us lump crab meat.

577
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,690
Let’s go eat. I’m starving.

578
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,260
Let’s go.

579
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,760
Hold on.

580
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
You said you’d bring someone home.

581
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,690
Where?

582
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,300
My date is clearing things in the car.

583
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,040
This is your type?

584
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,510
Is she older than me?

585
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,670
And she has a plus one.

586
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,630
Not her.

587
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,910
This way.

588
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,940
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

589
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,120
Hello.

590
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,560
(When the huge wave hits, no one gets to sit at the dinner table.)

591
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,060
Damn it!

592
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,640
My lump crab meat.

593
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,030
It’s gone!

594
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,100
I am hungry too.

595
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,010
But I don’t know if the war downstairs has ended.

596
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,970
What I know is that I don’t need a head rub.

597
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,620
Sorry. I didn’t realize it.

598
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,660
What’s up, you two?

599
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,790
You sent me a voice message the other day.

600
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,040
What do you want to talk about?

601
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,260
And did you take good care of my stuff?

602
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,750
No need to worry about that.

603
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,290
You have the nicest brother right here.

604
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,960
You can put your mind at ease.

605
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,540
I take care of everything for you.

606
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,410
See?

607
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,300
You can't find no brother as nice as me, Wan.

608
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,550
Let’s talk about you first.

609
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,020
Pi’s story becomes so little now.

610
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,140
It’s nothing.

611
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,180
We’re all clear.

612
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,700
Clear?

613
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,540
And your boyfriend?

614
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,730
He went home.

615
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,260
You’re awesome.

616
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,390
You’re a big brother and you always go big.

617
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,650
You’re so bold to bring your boy home like that.

618
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,650
You both know that I’m doing an internship in Hat Yai.

619
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,420
Do you have any idea what I have to live with?

620
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,320
I’m an ER doctor.

621
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,390
I see people die and nearly die every day.

622
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,520
Some people cut their wrists and blood was all over.

623
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,890
Do you know why they did that?

624
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,380
Because they were heartbroken.

625
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,170
They made me realize that

626
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,460
nothing in life is sure.

627
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,950
I might die today or tomorrow.

628
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,560
But I don't want to die just yet.

629
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,780
I still want to bring my lover to meet my loved ones here.

630
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,070
Why are you stunned?

631
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,310
Keep on massaging.

632
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,550
And more importantly,

633
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,710
do you really think mom doesn’t know who you are?

634
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,780
She raised you.

635
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,750
But I don’t think dad knew it.

636
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,900
He once said you had a girlfriend in Hat Yai.

637
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,500
I’m sure he’s quite surprised.

638
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,200
When elders get vaccinated,

639
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,270
they might get sick and tired in the first couple of days.

640
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
Once their bodies adjust to it,

641
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,510
they will eventually accept it.

642
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,770
Holy crap!!

643
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,190
What just happened to you?

644
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,060
I thought mom was mad at me because of who I am.

645
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,020
I was wrong.

646
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,020
Damn right!

647
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,980
You’re so stupid, dumbass!!

648
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,140
You’re stupider than him.

649
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,950
Dumbass!!

650
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,440
No more massaging.

651
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,470
I’ll give you 200 baht.

652
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,770
I was kidding.

653
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,100
My brother is tired. Of course, he can get a massage.

654
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,680
You can take a rest now.

655
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,030
I’ll do it.

656
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,000
Leave it to me.

657
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,740
Are you still mad at me?

658
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,140
Please don’t be mad.

659
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,240
Please.

660
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,910
Smile for me.

661
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,480
Smile, please.

662
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,620
You’re talking to me now?

663
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,730
I wanted to talk to you ages ago.

664
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,290
Will you give me a smile, please?

665
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,900
Let’s clean up.

666
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,270
Stop there.

667
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,630
Stop what you’re doing.

668
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,910
Honey, heat up all the food. I’m really starving.

669
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,410
Pi, go get your brothers down here.

670
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,900
Tell them I’m so hungry.

671
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,550
Hurry up.

672
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,050
Roget that.

673
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,640
Let me help.

674
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,160
Please. It’s heavy.

675
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,590
Aww!

676
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,160
Let’s go.

677
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,950
(I bet you’re happy too.)

678
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,400
(When everyone understands each other, things always get better.)

679
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,280
(There’s no such thing as a perfect family.)

680
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,040
(Sometimes, they fight and give each other's cold shoulder.)

681
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,190
(But in the end, family is family.)

682
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
(Love is still there.)

683
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,890
Thanks to you, Wan.

684
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,210
Without you, we won’t get to eat such good food.

685
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,740
Mom always cooks us fried sausages, stir-fried veggies, and omelets.

686
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,090
I’m so tired of those.

687
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:43,890
Hey!

688
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,920
Those are good food.

689
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,040
I want to eat what mom cooks.

690
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,300
I’m thinking of when we were kids.

691
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,750
We were so small we could sleep together in the same bed.

692
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,540
What’s your story by the way?

693
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,240
Just like I told you.

694
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,290
I don’t really know what to do.

695
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,470
I like this guy

696
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,530
but the other guy…

697
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,970
he always makes me feel better when I’m down.

698
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,040
And that gives me a good feeling about him.

699
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,160
You have to figure out whether you feel good about him

700
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
or feel good about what he does for you.

701
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,860
Are you guys speaking a human language?

702
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,000
I am so lost here.

703
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:33,720
Listen.

704
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,100
I’ll give you an example.

705
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,800
Do you know what Iatrogenic Disease is?

706
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,760
It’s caused by a misdiagnosis undertaken on a patient.

707
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,210
There was one case, a patient came to a doctor saying he had a bad headache and stress.

708
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,770
The doctor gave him a vaccine.

709
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,240
Time went by and the complications occurred.

710
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,660
He came back and was diagnosed with a brain tumor.

711
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,430
Now,

712
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,610
you have to diagnose if the vaccine you get is right for your disease

713
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,330
or you just assume that it is.

714
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,340
I get it now.

715
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,300
Thank you, Wan.

716
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,780
You get what?

717
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,570
So did he die?

718
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,380
You’re a dumbass!

719
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,460
Call me dumb one more time.

720
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,520
I’ll smack your balls hard.

721
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,800
No!

722
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,100
Duean! Easy!

723
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,870
Dumb, huh?

724
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,230
Don’t do that to your brother, Duean.

725
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,520
No!

726
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,650
Aargh!

727
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,690
Stop bullying him.

728
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,080
It’s your turn.

729
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,420
Pi!

730
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,420
You like this, huh?

731
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,480
(Mork: Did you miss so bad that you had to call?)

732
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:08,590
(Pi: I’m calling to say see you tomorrow. I have something to talk to you about.)

733
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,790
(Mork: Talk to me about what?)

734
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,470
(Pi: You’ll hear it tomorrow.)

735
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,180
I have something to say.

736
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,400
Why are you giving me this?

737
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,920
I don’t need it anymore.

738
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,730
I…

739
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,380
I will win over the real Muang Nan.

740
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,460
Thanks for comforting me that day.

741
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,620
But I don’t think you’re the right vaccine for my disease.

742
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,450
You’re the complication that happens to my body.

743
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,060
I’m not the complication.

744
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,020
I’m the right vaccine for your disease.

745
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,820
You’re stubborn.

746
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,810
I won’t make you like me anymore.

747
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,670
I will make you love me instead.

748
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,710
Watch me!

749
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,970
Let’s go study together.

750
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,130
Stop stirring things up.

751
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,610
I don’t need your vaccine.

752
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:56,440
I was so glad at first that you stopped following me around everywhere.

753
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,720
But now that I don’t get to hear your voice,

754
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,960
I feel very uneasy.

755
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,410
You said before that

756
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,630
Muang Nan was a fish upon the sky for you.

757
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,560
But you know what?

758
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,650
You are a fish upon the sky for me too.
