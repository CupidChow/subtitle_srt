1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,420
You said before that

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,720
Muang Nan was a fish upon the sky for you.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,440
But you know what?

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,690
You are a fish upon the sky for me too.

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,960
From now on, just stay away from me.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,690
Let me live my life in peace.

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,170
I was so glad at first that you stopped following me everywhere.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,550
Now that I don’t get to hear your voice,

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,620
I feel kind of uneasy.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,570
Who is this girl?

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,810
Why is she with Mork?

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,550
Let’s go study just the two of us.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,970
I can go.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,980
You can go back to your seat.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,940
I promise I won’t bother you.

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,610
I’ll be nice and quiet.

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,470
The only thing I’ll do is hold Mork's hand.

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,950
(Anyone, please take this girl away.)

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,340
Can you hear me?

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,170
I’m not the complication.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,280
I’m the right vaccine for your disease.

22
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,740
You’re stubborn.

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,390
I won’t make you like me anymore.

24
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,610
I will just make you love me instead.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,200
Watch me!

26
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,890
Pi, wait up.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,450
Pi!

28
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,420
Have you seen Pi?

29
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,890
Where did he go?

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,630
That way.

31
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,650
What’s going on?

32
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,720
You seem so serious.

33
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,580
Do you want to talk about it?

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,030
You were bold to confess to Pi in front of the whole university.

35
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,490
You’re awesome. You deserve my praise.

36
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,120
Wait a minute!

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,210
Don’t praise me.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,130
It was just a coincidence.

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,100
How?

40
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,370
Who would have thought there was a live camera backstage?

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,120
People usually set cameras in front of the stage.

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,140
And now people are having the wrong idea about that.

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,470
See?

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,200
You started out by teasing him.

45
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,410
No matter how serious you are now, he still thinks you’re just a tease.

46
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,300
I don’t want to rub it in your face.

47
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,610
But I told you before.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,310
When you like someone,

49
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,180
tell that person honestly from the start.

50
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,720
But I think, for Pi,

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,650
I can’t just do that.

52
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,820
Why not?

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,210
He’s my fish upon the sky.

54
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,250
If I said it straight,

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,850
I might have lost him already.

56
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,970
Why are you smiling?

57
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,610
I’m being serious here.

58
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,790
Nothing.

59
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,850
You seem to love Pi very much.

60
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,680
Give me your hand.

61
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,820
Here.

62
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,610
What is it?

63
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,940
Pi gave it to me.

64
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,130
But I don't think it belongs to me.

65
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,450
You should have it.

66
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,650
See?

67
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,970
Your fish upon the sky.

68
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,600
Come on. Cheer up!

69
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,700
Just smile.

70
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,290
You’re now famous.

71
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,710
Somebody just confessed to you on-air.

72
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,090
Nonsense.

73
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,090
Why do you think it’s nonsense?

74
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,930
Why are you cheering for him so badly?

75
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,120
If he’s that great like you just said, why don’t you date him yourself?

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,520
Because I want you to be with someone great.

77
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,460
You’re talking like you know him.

78
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:03,960
Bye now.

79
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,790
I’ll get back to my study.

80
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,410
Of course, I know him. He’s me.

81
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,480
How can I not know that I like you?

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,350
Do you have any idea how much I like you?

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,930
ONE DAY LATER

84
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,320
Hey!

85
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,450
Where is it?

86
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,570
Who took you home, Meen?

87
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,190
A friend from university.

88
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,710
What’s the matter?

89
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Have you seen that thing on the dining table?

90
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,020
Jelly?

91
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,220
Cookies?

92
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,060
Cereal?

93
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,010
No.

94
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,840
Placemat?

95
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,700
Fish sauce?

96
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,440
Sugar?

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,400
No, not them.

98
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,370
It’s a fish.

99
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,440
A seabass?

100
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,290
A snakeskin gourami?

101
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,160
A snake-head fish?

102
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
A goby?

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
A goldfish?

104
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
A fancy carp?

105
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,160
No?

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,380
Please don’t tell me yet.

107
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,490
Fish…

108
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,860
What fish?

109
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,730
Hey!

110
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,890
This is it!

111
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,960
A water bottle?

112
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,130
No. This thing.

113
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,760
It is yours?

114
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,130
You’re the one who took it?

115
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:48,870
Yes.

116
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,710
It was so cute so I clipped it on my water bottle strap.

117
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,460
But I’m sorry.

118
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,940
I dropped it today.

119
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,130
It's chipped a little now.

120
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,560
(Damn! It’s really chipped.)

121
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,680
(Just like my relationship with Pi.)

122
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,840
Are you okay?

123
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Is it expensive?

124
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,120
I can buy you a new one.

125
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,080
It’s cute.

126
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,720
Hey!

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
I’m kidding.

128
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,650
Don’t be stressed out. Let me help you.

129
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,290
And your stress will go away.

130
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
What are you gonna do?

131
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,180
You’re a medical student.

132
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,660
You know what a placebo is.

133
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,150
I can’t take this anymore. I’m out!

134
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,450
Excuse me. You can’t go yet.

135
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,460
Please store the book where it was before you go.

136
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,950
Let go.

137
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,690
You’re allowed to save me only.

138
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,810
(Damn you, Mork!)

139
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,050
(You’re keeping me awake.)

140
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,330
Let go.

141
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,060
(And what’s wrong with her mouth?)

142
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,170
(Her speaking doesn’t make sense!)

143
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,740
(What the heck!)

144
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,970
Just chill, man.

145
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,030
(I just want to kick you so bad!)

146
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,550
If you don’t stop, I’ll throw a punch.

147
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,580
In Mork’s face?

148
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,540
In your face!

149
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,530
(If you want to punch someone, just punch Mork.)

150
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,290
Alright. I’m so done!

151
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,970
I warned you not to.

152
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,450
Duean, don’t!

153
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,520
Don’t!

154
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,130
Duean!

155
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,400
Hello, everyone.

156
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,040
Welcome to MediZeed Festival 2021.

157
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,600
There are a bunch of booths by medical students here for you to shop from.

158
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,360
The money will go to hospitals for the poor.

159
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,400
Don’t worry about the money.

160
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,260
It’s not going to reach them. Just kidding!

161
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,660
They will surely get this financial support.

162
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,050
Thank you.

163
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,000
Try our delicious Mala sticks.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,010
Ten baht only for each.

165
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,010
They have Mala too?

166
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,720
Teddy Bear, I want some Mala.

167
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,310
Can I have that, please?

168
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,790
It’s you, Pi?

169
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,870
What a coincidence!

170
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,220
Is he the guy you said ‘just a friend?’

171
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,770
He is.

172
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,310
Hi. Walking around?

173
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:41,890
No,

174
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,340
I’m crawling around.

175
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,810
King of sarcasm.

176
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
They have plenty. Why are you picking the same one as I am?

177
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,680
I don’t want the others.

178
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,530
I want what you want.

179
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,470
Alright. Just take it.

180
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,780
You should go have a seat first, Teddy Bear.

181
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,590
I’ll meet you there when the food is ready.

182
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,950
Save a spot for your friend here too.

183
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,550
He should sit across from us

184
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,900
so he can see our sweet moments.

185
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,730
Of course, Pumpkin.

186
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,340
How spicy do you want?

187
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,240
We have level 2, 3, and 4.

188
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,690
Make it mild, please.

189
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,850
As for mine,

190
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,510
No mild, no spicy.

191
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
I want it super hot.

192
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,710
Because I like things hot!

193
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,840
Of course.

194
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,070
Wait a moment, please.

195
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,070
Sure.

196
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,170
Here you are.

197
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,190
100 baht, please.

198
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,900
250 baht for this one.

199
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,760
Thank you.

200
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,540
You’re welcome to sit with us.

201
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,890
But if you don’t want to see some heartbreaking moments,

202
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,510
you can sit somewhere else.

203
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
I’ve reserved the seats for us. Come and sit here.

204
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,280
Spicy, isn’t it?

205
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,180
You have zero tolerance for spiciness.

206
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,170
Don’t you feel spicy?

207
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,320
No.

208
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,500
It’s great.

209
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,090
Maybe you aren’t familiar with spicy food.

210
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,220
If you’re so tough,

211
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,030
try to eat them all.

212
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,550
What?

213
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,070
Are you afraid?

214
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,810
Do not challenge me.

215
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,490
If you’re tough, show Mork that you can finish them all.

216
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,370
Just don’t.

217
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,820
No.

218
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,880
Teddy Bear, don’t stop me.

219
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,270
I will eat them all.

220
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,240
Isn’t it spicy, Pumpkin?

221
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,770
No.

222
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,870
Go on.

223
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,370
Still not spicy?

224
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,400
No.

225
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,260
Keep on eating then.

226
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,280
Not spicy?

227
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,420
No

228
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,570
Eat more then.

229
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,690
I mean no, my tongue can’t feel anything anymore.

230
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,300
Shit!

231
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,270
What are you looking at?

232
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
There’s something on your mouth.

233
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,010
Where?

234
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,430
I told you…

235
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,690
I don’t like to see anything unclean.

236
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,380
I think…

237
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,940
you should go check on your girlfriend.

238
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,370
She’s dancing a hot dance over there.

239
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,480
What makes you think she’s my girlfriend?

240
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,770
I never said Bam and I are dating.

241
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,920
It’s pretty easy to tell.

242
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,240
There is a fan page of yours and the hashtag #MorkBamIsReal.

243
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,430
Well, well.

244
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,410
You care about social media gossip now?

245
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,130
It seems like you’re taking interest in my movements.

246
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,010
Interest, my ass.

247
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,440
The news was just on my feed.

248
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,640
Just admit it.

249
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,760
Don’t be so tight-lipped.

250
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Stop talking or I’ll poke your eye with this.

251
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,850
That’s okay.

252
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,970
Because I’m already blinded by love.

253
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,890
Such a king of flirting!

254
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,510
I’ll flirt until you warm up to me.

255
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,790
No way, sir.

256
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,790
I think…

257
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,700
You should take care of your girlfriend first.

258
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,030
I’m really worried.

259
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,550
This is your prize.

260
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,810
And yours.

261
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,240
Please stop by and play again next time.

262
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,520
The Story of a Fifth-Year Student EP.9 - Start Again

263
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,300
Why is no one coming to my booth at all?

264
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,700
Duean!

265
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:52,900
Hey!

266
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,170
Why is your booth so deserted?

267
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,560
Exactly.

268
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,540
My game is so easy.

269
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,990
You get it right and you get a reward.

270
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,210
Yeah?

271
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,970
Let’s try me.

272
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,990
Okay!

273
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,460
- You ready?
- Yes.

274
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,120
What do we call the orange and red pigments that support photosynthesis?

275
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,780
Pass.

276
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,750
What’s the name of a NASA intern who discovered a new planet?

277
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,400
Pass.

278
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,510
What is Varanus Salvator called, in other words?

279
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,460
Shit!! (water monitor)

280
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,970
That’s correct!

281
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,640
You’re smart.

282
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,330
That’s correct?

283
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,270
The answer is a water monitor.

284
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Was that a really correct answer?

285
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
It was.

286
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,050
Water monitor.

287
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,770
And your prize is…

288
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,700
Wow! You must love this very much.

289
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,370
What is it?

290
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,570
You get a pencil sharpener.

291
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,490
A pencil sharpener! Yeah!!

292
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,230
Damn it!

293
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,810
People need to answer those super difficult questions for sharpeners?

294
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,970
Are you crazy?

295
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,100
I am not.

296
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,890
Look! We have many colors of them here.

297
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,840
They are so cute. I want one too.

298
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,370
There’s no doubt why people don’t come here.

299
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,490
What? They are so cute.

300
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,200
Your quizzes are too difficult.

301
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,520
I have one more gift for you though.

302
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,530
What?

303
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,520
P’Duean!

304
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,190
What are you doing here, senior?

305
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,300
What’s wrong with your eyebrows?

306
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,010
Ah!!

307
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
You’re hitting on a first-year med student.

308
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,880
I see.

309
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,720
A super senior from Engineering has just one class.

310
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,550
You have plenty of time to flirt around.

311
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,690
Asshole!

312
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,080
You go back where you came from.

313
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,480
I don’t have time for you.

314
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,880
Alright, I’ll go.

315
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,700
Now!

316
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,020
I won’t bother your time to flirt now.

317
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,840
Go!

318
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,400
See you at the faculty.

319
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,980
See you!

320
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,110
People are weird these days.

321
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,680
They always call other people their seniors.

322
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,860
I can’t get away from this one, right?

323
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,090
Are you still going to lie after what I just heard?

324
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,320
I’ve known for a while that you’re a fifth-year student from Engineering.

325
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,480
DOLLAWEE PANICHAPUN, 5TH-YEAR, THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING

326
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,670
Your name was on the report cover.

327
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,180
You’re acting like I’m so stupid and clueless.

328
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,170
Have you known this for long?

329
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:11,940
Yes.

330
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,610
Right!

331
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,760
I’ll tell you the truth.

332
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,170
I’m ashamed that I’m dumb.

333
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,990
You said it yourself that there was a fifth-year student in your class.

334
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,780
I didn’t want to be that dumb dude.

335
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,970
That’s why I lied.

336
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,890
Do you think I was happy doing that?

337
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,740
And if I didn’t do the project with you,

338
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,260
I wouldn’t be able to graduate.

339
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,280
You know what, Duean?

340
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,870
All those times, I was willing to do anything for you

341
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,990
because I thought you were my friend.

342
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,780
But from this day on, I don’t think I can call you Duean anymore.

343
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,890
I should call you P’Duean.

344
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,270
Did I hurt your feelings that badly?

345
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,480
I am sorry.

346
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,940
But…

347
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,520
I always give people chances.

348
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,800
We can start over and get to know each other.

349
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,360
How?

350
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,970
Get to know each other for real.

351
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,200
Like what we should have done from the start.

352
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,100
I am Duean.

353
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,790
My first name is Dollawee.

354
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,490
I’m a fifth-year student from Engineering.

355
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,740
My name is Meen.

356
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,840
My first name is Sittha.

357
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,180
I’m a first-year Med student.

358
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,310
Once I hold someone’s hand, I won’t let go so easily.

359
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,340
So when I need to pee, will you release my hand and let me go pee?

360
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,310
Man! It was about to get very touching there.

361
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
You just don’t know how to be romantic.

362
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,780
Shit!

363
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,020
The story of a fifth-year student ep.9 is over.

364
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,900
- What else do you have?
- Pencil sharpeners.

365
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,390
I don’t want it!

366
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,870
I’m so moody.

367
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,570
I should eat something sweet.

368
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,750
Teddy Bear, I want this one.

369
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,610
(It’s them again!)

370
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,870
Which one do you want, Pumpkin?

371
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,250
This one.

372
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,350
I want the big one.

373
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:28,910
How big?

374
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,850
This big.

375
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,890
Show me something cute first.

376
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,300
Say ‘am I cute?’

377
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,950
Am I cute?

378
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,400
You are the cutest.

379
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,560
Which one?

380
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,660
This one.

381
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,210
Yeah!

382
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,570
You’re the cutest too.

383
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,700
Thank you.

384
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,250
(Something horrible must have happened to her tongue.)

385
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,890
I want this one too.

386
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,370
Show me your cuteness again.

387
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,950
Cute cute!

388
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,300
(My ass!)

389
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,240
Cute cute!

390
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,950
This one too.

391
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,260
This one.

392
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,500
And this.

393
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,050
This one. This, this, and that.

394
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,960
And this one!

395
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,060
Hey!!

396
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
Sorry!

397
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,230
Why are you blocking my way?

398
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,160
I’m going to wash my hands.

399
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,950
What’s up with her tongue?

400
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,070
‘Cute cute!’

401
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,580
‘I want this one and that one.’

402
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,540
So annoying.

403
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,490
If you’re jealous, just say it.

404
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,050
I am not.

405
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,040
You are.

406
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,110
I’m not.

407
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,400
You’re jealous.

408
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,980
I told you I’m not jealous.

409
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,920
You are.

410
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,560
I told you I’m not jealous.

411
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,570
Right.

412
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,000
You aren’t just jealous…

413
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,740
but you’re aggressively jealous.

414
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,500
‘Teddy Bear!’

415
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,440
‘Cute, cute.’

416
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,900
‘I want this! I want that!’

417
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,710
Damn it!

418
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,750
Why does she talk like that?

419
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,530
I’m not jealous. Jealous, my ass!

420
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,310
I don’t know either.

421
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,750
Do you have the schedule?

422
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,470
Mork!

423
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,150
It’s my turn now.

424
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,720
Teddy Bear, do you want some cake?

425
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,980
Here. Have a bite.

426
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,230
We can stop now.

427
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,200
Pi is gone.

428
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,470
I should speak normally then.

429
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,840
My tongue is so numb.

430
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,770
Nan, this is the shop where I bought you choux creams.

431
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,470
Come on.

432
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,920
They have choux creams today.

433
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,370
Excuse me, can I have the ones with cream filling, please?

434
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,080
It’s the filling you like.

435
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,290
I’d like some green tea filling, please.

436
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
You want them soft or crispy?

437
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,130
Crispy.

438
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,290
Soft.

439
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,830
Icing or maple?

440
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,580
Icing.

441
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,590
Maple.

442
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Big ones or small ones?

443
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,520
Big ones.

444
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,430
Small ones.

445
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,880
You don’t know your friend very well.

446
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,100
That’s alright.

447
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,470
One moment, please.

448
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,320
Let’s grab a seat.

449
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,090
Oops!

450
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,320
I’m sorry, Nan.

451
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,130
Are you okay?

452
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,910
I am.

453
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,860
Let’s go.

454
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,170
Are you sure you’re alright?

455
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,500
I am.

456
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:42,810
Come on.

457
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,620
I am sorry, Nan.

458
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,810
I think there's something wrong with my legs.

459
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,600
I think you need more Calcium.

460
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,010
Let’s go.

461
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,020
Thank you for your treat.

462
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,650
That’s fine.

463
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,130
For you, it’s no problem at all.

464
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,840
Let me ask you honestly.

465
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,570
Are you doing this just to get back at Mork?

466
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,170
No, I’m not.

467
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
He’s with his girlfriend.

468
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,440
And I happened to run into you, so I invited you for some dessert.

469
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,610
I know it.

470
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,820
Both of you, what are you guys playing at?

471
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,010
I am not playing.

472
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,080
Pi,

473
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,380
listen to me.

474
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,390
Pi!

475
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,840
Hey!

476
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,120
Where are you going?

477
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,490
Bam, we should quit playing now.

478
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,650
Excuse me.

479
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,440
Are you leaving already?

480
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
You haven’t paid yet.

481
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,050
It’s 2,000 baht in total.

482
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,430
Do you offer any discount,

483
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,930
Teddy Bear?

484
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,720
Can I join you?

485
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,570
It’s good you’re here.

486
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,920
I have something to say to you.

487
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,350
Why did you have to disguise yourself as ‘A Guy From Nearby Faculty?’

488
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,460
Pi,

489
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,190
listen to me.

490
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,170
Do you know a page called ‘A Guy From Nearby Faculty?’

491
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,620
I do.

492
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,930
Have you two been talking for a long time?

493
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,370
We have, pretty long.

494
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,940
Do you talk to him about everything?

495
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,710
He’s my first friend. We talk about everything.

496
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,600
Don’t tell me you’re the admin.

497
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,340
Not quite right, Pi.

498
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,110
The Faculty of Allied Health Sciences isn’t the one next to Dentistry.

499
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Which Faculty would that be?

500
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,640
Medicine.

501
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,180
That’s right.

502
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,580
Now you should be able to guess who he is.

503
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,610
I don’t think he meant to do that.

504
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,480
Are you taking his side?

505
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,740
No. I’m always on your side.

506
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,760
I’m asking because I’m worried about you.

507
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,350
If you make someone mad, how do you make up?

508
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,600
If you guys are really friends, just apologize.

509
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,110
We have to become friends in order to do that.

510
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,970
I think you do know that he really likes you.

511
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,730
Were you angry when you found out?

512
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,040
I was for being fooled

513
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,170
but it was just for a short while.

514
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,300
Nan told me…

515
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,420
Nan, can you give him this umbrella?

516
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,250
I don’t want him to walk alone in the rain.

517
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,290
Come on.

518
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Have you had eyes for me for all these times?

519
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,300
Yes.

520
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,870
If you really like me, then why did you get Bam involved?

521
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,570
To drive you to speak out what you feel.

522
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,040
Are you sulking?

523
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,870
I am not.

524
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,260
Let’s play a game.

525
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,340
What game? No!

526
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,700
You have to.

527
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,080
I’m forcing you to play.

528
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,820
You’re not gonna give up, are you?

529
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,210
When you hear the word ‘Pi’, what do you think of?

530
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,750
12 months. 365 days.

531
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,540
52 weeks. 8,760 hours.

532
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,870
To me,

533
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,700
it’s ‘Pi’ who’s in front of me.

534
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,210
It’s Pi, the nickname of…

535
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,460
Pattawee

536
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,160
Whenever I think of ‘Pi’,

537
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,880
I always think of you.

538
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,620
What about you?

539
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,860
When you hear the word ‘Mork’,

540
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,550
what do you think of?

541
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,390
Well…

542
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,170
Someone who likes to tease.

543
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,890
Get your hands off my head.

544
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,340
That’s how you want it?

545
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,420
Bothersomeness.

546
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,850
I wish for us to be friends.

547
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,860
I will never be your friend in this life.

548
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,290
Not just friends then.

549
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,480
I will wish for more.

550
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,100
No! You can’t wish for anything.

551
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
An annoying guy.

552
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,400
A rival.

553
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,480
Pi wants some pictures with you.

554
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,330
No, Mork!

555
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,250
I’m too shy.

556
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,410
And…

557
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,980
You’re my first friend.

558
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,140
Now that we’re friends,

559
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,820
don’t you ever leave me.

560
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,760
A friend.

561
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,450
No ‘boyfriend’ at all?

562
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,620
You told me that

563
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,050
If I wasn’t ready,

564
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,910
we could start by being friends.

565
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,820
You can’t just skip that step.

566
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,630
I wanted to be your friend at first.

567
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,950
But now,

568
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,660
I want to be your boyfriend.

569
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,230
Why do you like me?

570
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,970
I like it when you’re cranky.

571
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,730
It’s funny.

572
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,050
You don’t have to do anything.

573
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,730
Don’t talk. Don’t move. Don’t breathe.

574
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,570
And I like it when you try to act cool.

575
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,450
But you’re actually sucky.

576
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,650
You think you’re so cool?

577
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,110
You’re such a nerd.

578
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,860
Second-year students aren't supposed to know those things.

579
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,290
It might sound weird.

580
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,090
But when you put all your effort into something,

581
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,570
it is very cool.

582
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,970
I think…

583
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,190
My Serotonin works very well when I’m close to you.

584
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,110
More importantly,

585
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,890
I like a mole on your ear.

586
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,260
What are you talking about?

587
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,920
That’s it?

588
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,750
That’s all the reasons why you like me?

589
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,230
How should I say this?

590
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,030
I just never thought I could be liked.

591
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,810
I’m unpopular and awkward.

592
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,390
Did you just like me after I changed my look?

593
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,610
I have something for you to see.

594
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,730
I want to let you know that…

595
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,400
every time I'm with you,

596
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,250
my heart beats really fast.

597
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,030
I feel happy whenever I’m with you.

598
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,750
What about you?

599
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,560
How do you feel when you’re with me?

600
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,190
Do you feel good?

601
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,460
The terms of our dating probation,

602
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,210
We can’t tell people we’re together.

603
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,940
Are you two secretly dating?

604
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,960
- No.
- No.

605
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,460
We can take care of each other

606
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,690
but we can’t do it in the public eye.

607
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Have this snack when you’re hungry.

608
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:25,980
Here.

609
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,210
Something for you to eat as well.

610
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,490
You and I are together now.

611
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,910
But I haven’t stamped yet.

612
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,310
It isn’t an official contract, you don’t have to stamp…
