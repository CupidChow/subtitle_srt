1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,120
We’re here to transform you.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,710
Well, I’m quite hot.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,380
I was right to pair up with you, my friend.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,190
Heatstroke.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,260
Please stand clear.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,280
Give him more oxygen.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,780
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: I heard you got a new look.)

8
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,560
Want to meet me?

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,830
We can be friends without seeing each other in person.

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,320
Who are you exactly?

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,290
Who are you?

12
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,820
Who are you?

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,930
Why don’t you tell me who you are?

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,430
Who are you?

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,260
Who are you, exactly?

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,260
Pi.

17
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,730
Are you okay there?

18
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,240
How are you feeling now?

19
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,800
Are you feeling better?

20
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,840
(Better what?)

21
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,080
About the other day.

22
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,090
Ah!

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,160
I’m all right now.

24
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,050
That’s good.

25
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,510
I was so worried about you.

26
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,490
(He’s worried about me!)

27
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,830
When you don’t wear glasses and do your hair like this,

28
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,620
you look good.

29
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,070
(He said I looked good too.)

30
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,910
Hey!

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,340
Something in my teeth?

32
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:09,930
No.

33
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,080
I just noticed that you got your braces removed.

34
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,330
(He’s paying attention to me.)

35
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,500
(I should just follow Duean’s plan now.)

36
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,780
Pi.

37
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,020
You like to think to yourself?

38
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,470
What? No.

39
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,390
I was just wondering if you’re free this Friday.

40
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,920
I’m not sure.

41
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,550
Why?

42
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,370
Have you heard of the Blind In Love event?

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,840
I have. What about it?

44
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,990
Do you have a date yet?

45
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,070
No.

46
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,170
I wanted to go with my friends but no one is available.

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,060
Do you want to go with me?

48
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,190
Can I think about it?

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,920
I’m not sure if I’ll be available.

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,190
Pi, I have to go.

51
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,120
I’m already late.

52
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,070
Bye.

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,110
Hurry up.

54
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,400
Don’t be late and get chewed out.

55
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,990
Just don’t…

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,040
EP. 3 - OH MY GROSS

57
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,140
‘Let me think about it.’

58
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,360
What does it mean?

59
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,860
Of course, it means 'let me think about it.'

60
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,470
What else can it be?

61
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,160
How long will he take?

62
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,960
2 hours?

63
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,010
3 hours?

64
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,160
2 days?

65
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,700
2 days is alright.

66
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,740
Wait!

67
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,730
If he takes 2 days, that means he won’t go.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,670
Student,

69
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,190
please hurry up.

70
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,480
Do we have any spot left?

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,340
What are you doing?

72
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,450
You aren’t wearing the uniform properly.

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
I can do it myself.

74
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,850
You are late and loud.

75
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,920
Be still.

76
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,580
He told us to identify the submental triangle

77
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,450
which lies between the left and right anterior bellies of the digastric muscles.

78
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,610
Use the blade to cut the mylohyoid muscle along the midline raphe.

79
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,070
Then use a probe and forceps to open it and explore the internal structure.

80
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Hey! I think this is the lab.

81
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,350
The lab what?

82
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
The one in the gross lab tale.

83
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,230
They say you have to come here at midnight to make a wish.

84
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,980
Come alone with the lights off.

85
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,420
At 0:09, make your wish and knock your hand on a metal autopsy table.

86
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,300
Once someone knocks back, leave this lab at 0:13.

87
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,830
And your wish will come true.

88
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,910
They say you can wish for anything.

89
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,240
I think this is the lab.

90
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,810
Ouch!

91
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,770
Hey!

92
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,350
Are you okay?

93
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,160
Let’s go clean it first.

94
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,450
It’s going to hurt a little.

95
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,700
Does it have to be this high?

96
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,360
It has to be higher than your heart.

97
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,250
The bleeding will stop quicker.

98
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,160
I can do it myself.

99
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,430
Don’t. You can get infected.

100
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,730
Don’t move. Leave your hand like this.

101
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,770
After we clean it, I’ll take you to the emergency room.

102
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,830
You need an injection.

103
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,660
(The sweet moment pauses here, guys. Let’s go find some balance.)

104
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,340
(It’s time to meet Duean, the jackass brother.)

105
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,820
Who am I going to sit with today?
[THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT
EP.3 - THE DANGEROUS WATER BOTTLE]

106
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,550
Got a boyfriend already?

107
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,930
Super sweet!

108
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,490
A cute duo. I’ll sit right there.

109
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,890
They’re a couple.

110
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,110
Duean, Duean, Duean!

111
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,400
What?

112
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,880
Have you seen my water bottle?

113
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,920
What water bottle?

114
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,280
I brought a water bottle with me on the day we worked together.

115
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,530
I think I left it on your motorbike.

116
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,610
Oh!!

117
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,530
You recognize it? Can I have it back?

118
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,760
I gave it to a garland girl.

119
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,830
Do you want some jasmine garlands? They’re newly made.

120
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,250
It’s a Buddhist Holy Day today. Do you want some for praying?

121
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,990
I’m a sinful man. I’m irreligious.

122
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,930
No problem. An irreligious man might want a pen then?

123
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,630
I’m allergic to ink. I only use pencils.

124
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,300
An inhaler?

125
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,360
A balm?

126
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,920
Roasted chicken?

127
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,450
Fried pork balls?

128
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,590
I freaking said no!!

129
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,060
Aren’t you going to buy anything?

130
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,550
I’ve been in the streets since this morning. I have sold just a few.

131
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,650
I haven’t eaten anything all day.

132
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,880
Why does someone with an honest livelihood have to go through this?

133
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,610
Hey kid! I didn’t mean to.

134
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,690
My friends have all those luxury stuff but I’m unlucky.

135
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,720
I was born poor. This world is so unfair.

136
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,850
I’m thirsty.

137
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,640
Please stop.

138
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,840
I feel bad now, all right.

139
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,200
Whose bottle is this?

140
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,390
Whatever.

141
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,290
Here. It’s yours.

142
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,210
You’re giving it to me?

143
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,940
Yes.

144
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,140
Drink and regain your energy.

145
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,610
Quench your thirst.

146
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,370
Thank you.

147
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,770
Bye now

148
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,650
But that’s my water bottle. You gave it to a garland seller?

149
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,290
Right.

150
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,790
You weren’t there. You don’t get it.

151
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,610
But it’s my bottle. How could you give it to her?

152
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,460
Because I hate dramas.

153
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,520
I’m very sentimental.

154
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,020
Imagine a little girl selling things in the streets day to night.

155
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,580
She was thirsty. How could you be so cruel and ignore her?

156
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,710
Have some humanity, will you?

157
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,720
You’re such a mean guy!

158
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
(Shit! Am I being too harsh?)

159
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Duean, I am sorry.

160
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,050
I wasn’t in that situation. I didn’t get it.

161
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,050
It isn’t an expensive bottle or anything.

162
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,860
But it has sentimental value to me.

163
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,550
(Damn! Sentimental value what now?)

164
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,520
How?

165
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,650
My mom got me that water bottle before she went…

166
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,660
That’s it!

167
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,590
I’ll go get it back for you now.

168
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,600
Enough with the drama.

169
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,780
I will be right back.

170
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,590
Koh.

171
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,610
Don’t you have class? Where are you going?

172
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,310
Don’t you have class yourself?

173
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,390
No. I’m going skateboarding.

174
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,000
Great! Come with me.

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,610
Where?

176
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,030
Just go.

177
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,590
Where?

178
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,550
Stop asking.

179
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Excuse me. Do you have an adhesive bandage?

180
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,810
I don’t.

181
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,840
Do you have anything for cuts or wounds?

182
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,110
It’s okay then. Thank you.

183
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,110
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: How was your gross lab today?)

184
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,870
Damn!

185
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,960
I was so behind.

186
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,850
I cut my finger. The blood was all over.

187
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,120
Are you all right now?

188
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,630
Still bleeding?

189
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm okay. I'm using tissue paper to stop it.

190
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,620
What happened though?

191
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,260
How did you get cut?

192
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,960
Why weren’t you careful?

193
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,480
I was paying attention to the tale of the gross lab.

194
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,560
Do you know anything about it?

195
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,760
The tale that says any wish can be granted in the lab?

196
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,290
So it is real?

197
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,170
Have you heard anything else about it?

198
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,530
No.

199
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,940
You haven’t heard?

200
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,000
I don’t know.

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,740
What?

202
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,220
What are you going to wish for?

203
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,860
You have to zip it.

204
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,660
I’m going to wish for Muang Nan.

205
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,940
For what?

206
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,190
For him to accept your feelings?

207
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,250
Nah! Come on.

208
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,380
I’m wishing for him to go on a date with me.

209
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,280
And I can take it from there. Sounds good?

210
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,120
No.

211
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,310
Why not?

212
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,900
Actually, there’s more to the story.

213
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,470
Do you know why you need to leave the lab before 0:13?

214
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,920
Because?

215
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,000
Because if you leave later than 0:13, you will become the next cadaver.

216
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,210
And that spiral staircase sucks out human souls.

217
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,490
Shit! What an absurd tale! You’re lying.

218
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,890
You just said you didn’t know a thing about it.

219
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,070
I was playing you.

220
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,430
But it’s up to you if you want to believe or not.

221
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,510
Just don’t say…

222
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,840
I didn’t warn you.

223
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,950
I won’t get fooled, you liar!

224
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,530
Maybe I shouldn’t go.

225
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,500
Go where?

226
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,180
None of your business.

227
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,090
What?

228
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,260
Be still.

229
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,380
What are you doing?

230
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,180
I said be still.

231
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,930
Let me see.

232
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,100
Hold on.

233
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,630
It’s gonna hurt a little.

234
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,050
Are you really a doctor?

235
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,500
Your bandaging is very hurtful.

236
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,100
I told you not to move.

237
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,160
You can eat comfortably now.

238
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,940
Where did you buy it though?

239
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,760
I looked for it everywhere but couldn’t find one.

240
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,620
Outside university.

241
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,850
It took me so long to find one. It’s kind of weird.

242
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,020
It becomes rare when you need it.

243
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,700
What are you looking at?

244
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,240
If you want it, just say it.

245
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,010
Here.

246
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,940
I can share some with you.

247
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:14,930
No.

248
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,100
Who would want to share it with you?

249
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,590
You just burped.

250
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,430
I bet you have a bloated stomach.

251
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,970
It can help you with a bloated stomach.

252
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,100
I told you no.

253
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,410
Is that for me?

254
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,470
I told you I didn’t want it.

255
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,100
I will just feed you.

256
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,300
I said no.

257
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,620
I won’t stop until you drink it.

258
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,020
Okay, fine!

259
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,860
That’s it.

260
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,640
You just dropped your spoon.

261
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,810
You’re my friend, aren't you?

262
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,950
Go get a new spoon for me then.

263
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,110
What?

264
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,430
You can just drink what I gave you.

265
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,460
You can’t do that for a friend?

266
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,900
Fine.

267
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,480
I’ll go get a new one for you.

268
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,130
What’s the hurry, man?

269
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,000
- Koh.
- What?

270
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,360
Help me look for a garland girl around this intersection.

271
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,320
Why?

272
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,110
I gave her Meen’s water bottle the other day.

273
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,690
Now he wants it back.

274
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
So you’re looking for your boy’s stuff. Why do I have to be here?

275
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,210
He isn’t my boy.

276
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
I just don’t want him to cry because it’s so annoying.

277
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,420
You make Pi cry all the time.

278
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,210
Why do you even care now?

279
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,030
It’s different.

280
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,900
Ah!

281
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,520
You care about that kid.

282
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,750
I got it.

283
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,710
I do not.

284
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,380
Stop teasing me already.

285
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,700
I asked you to help,

286
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,560
so help.

287
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,750
Find a little girl with braids.

288
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,640
There.

289
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,930
Want some banana fritters?

290
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,830
Wow, Koh.

291
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,300
Can’t you tell the difference between kids and adults?

292
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,920
What an idiot!

293
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,200
It’s not that.

294
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,230
I was going to tell you to ask her about the girl.

295
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,540
I am older than you, you know?

296
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,460
I beat up guys a lot older than you before.

297
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,130
Sorry then.

298
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,760
Auntie!

299
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,830
How many do you want?

300
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,630
No.

301
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,280
But can I ask you something?

302
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,900
Buy first and I’ll answer.

303
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,960
Wow! You’re incredibly quick about this.

304
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,240
I have to, asshole.

305
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,390
Where is she?

306
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,230
Hey!

307
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,290
Is she the one?

308
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,800
Where?

309
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,480
Over there.

310
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,220
Damn right, she is.

311
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,810
What a relief!

312
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,570
Hello, braid girl.

313
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Remember me?

314
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,180
I do.

315
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,050
Drink it up.

316
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,560
Refreshing, huh?

317
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,840
It’s a thermos water bottle there.

318
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,390
Please don’t be mad.

319
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,700
But can I have it back?

320
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,430
Please.

321
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,020
No.

322
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,490
I’ll buy you a bigger one.

323
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,440
No.

324
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Why are you shouting, girl?

325
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,740
Mister?

326
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,990
Did you steal from people again?

327
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,980
I didn’t. He gave it to me.

328
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,190
Don’t you lie to me.

329
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,360
What did I tell you?

330
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,210
We’re poor but we don’t steal.

331
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,620
@#$%^

332
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,020
(What the heck is she saying?)

333
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,010
Give it back to him.

334
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,030
What did I teach you?

335
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,020
- A real king is greater than his crown...
- (She has eaten a dictionary, for sure.)

336
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,150
A real man is more than his clothes.

337
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,980
Perfect! Now, give him back.

338
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
No, I won’t.

339
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,780
Now.

340
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,700
No.

341
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,360
Now.

342
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,100
No.

343
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,330
Now!!

344
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,410
Alright. I won’t hold on to it anymore.

345
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,260
Koh.

346
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,280
I’m older. I order you to go get it for me.

347
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,040
Nope. I have a date.

348
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,450
Between a girl and a brother here, who will you choose?

349
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,450
A girl, of course.

350
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,280
Bye now. See you.

351
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,000
Koh!

352
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,910
Koh!

353
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,050
What am I going to do?

354
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,940
Hi.

355
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,550
Can you help me with something?

356
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,000
I guess I don’t have a choice.

357
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,510
Is this the right house?

358
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,460
Exactly what it says here.

359
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,340
This is it.

360
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,490
Meen!

361
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,110
Meen!

362
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,420
Meen!

363
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,840
Who are you here for?

364
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,350
I came to see Meen.

365
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,220
Is he here?

366
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,160
Meen.

367
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
Meen, you have a guest.

368
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,250
Duean.

369
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,810
What brings you here?

370
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,410
And why do you look like that?

371
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,160
You don’t have to know.

372
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,170
Here.

373
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,240
I had to dive to get it for you.

374
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,110
The water stinks.

375
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,210
Thank you, Duean.

376
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,130
you had to go through the trouble for this.

377
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,570
Look.

378
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,480
You still have something on your face.

379
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,730
How about you clean yourself up and change first?

380
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,630
That’s all right.

381
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,110
I’ll be dry by the time I get home.

382
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,650
Germs can’t hurt me.

383
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,940
If you don’t want to bother my mom, you can use the water hose out front.

384
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,700
Mom?

385
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,700
Don’t worry.

386
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,490
I’ll get you a towel and new clothes.

387
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,190
Come on Duean. Let’s get inside.

388
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,670
I must have duckweed in my ears or something.

389
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,750
I don’t think I heard him right.

390
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,110
He needs to clarify this.

391
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,860
Who did you say she was again?

392
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,000
My mom.

393
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,810
Your mom?

394
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,830
Didn’t your mom die already?

395
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,850
Why are you speaking of my mom like that?

396
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,950
It’s not that.

397
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,650
You said your mom got you that water bottle before she went.

398
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,740
That’s right.

399
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,290
Before she went abroad.

400
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,190
My mom got her Ph.D. from abroad.

401
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,550
What the heck is this shit?!

402
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,820
Done.

403
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,720
You can use this to clean up.

404
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,360
Ouch! Duean.

405
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,140
What did you just do?

406
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,420
Hey, I’m sorry.

407
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,140
My eyes hurt. What are you playing at?

408
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,400
I didn’t think it was that strong.

409
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,500
(You care about him, Duean. Just admit it.)

410
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,820
I don’t

411
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,150
Look at this.

412
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,390
It isn’t that bad. Are you fooling me?

413
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,250
(You’re just tight-lipped.)

414
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,580
I am not!

415
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,280
(The audience knows it.)

416
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,510
I said I wasn’t tight-lipped.

417
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,770
How is this, huh?

418
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,970
Will you believe me now?

419
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,740
Duean, stop playing.

420
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,690
Give it to me.

421
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:52,330
THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT EP.3 IS OVER

422
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,730
Damn!

423
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,490
It’s so dark.

424
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,890
Are they trying to save on the power bill?

425
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,540
Holy shit!

426
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,320
What are you doing, student?

427
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,570
Studying for an exam.

428
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,300
Fine.

429
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
But don’t stay until late.

430
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,490
Why?

431
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,280
Not telling.

432
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,850
Why so secretive?

433
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,690
Hello, cadaver.

434
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
I didn’t come to insult you or anything.

435
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,420
I came for love.

436
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,160
Who’s that?

437
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,560
It’s you?

438
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,370
What are you doing here so late?

439
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,180
Preparing for the upcoming exam.

440
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Not performing the ritual from that gross lab story?

441
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Your face says I’m right.

442
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,090
Yes. So what?

443
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,090
You’re not so different.

444
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,360
You said you didn’t believe it but here you are wishing for something.

445
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,990
I won’t have to wish for it,

446
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,100
if you just say yes.

447
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,690
All I wish for is for us to be friends.

448
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,340
No

449
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,400
No way.

450
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,670
I will not be your friend ever in this life.

451
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,500
Well, not just friends then.

452
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,620
I will wish for more.

453
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,360
No! Just don’t wish for anything.

454
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,180
Your wish will override mine.

455
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Shit!

456
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,280
You get scared so easily.

457
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,900
I’m not scared.

458
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,400
Hey!

459
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
Look at yourself. You’re scared too.

460
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,880
Hey!

461
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,640
What the heck?

462
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,270
Enough already!

463
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,940
When will you stop turning on and off?

464
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,000
It’s 0:09 AM.

465
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,630
It’s time.

466
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,650
Are you serious?

467
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,110
No one knocks back.

468
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,870
Maybe the tale is a lie.

469
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,820
I’m so out of here.

470
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,340
Anybody, help!

471
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,960
Why is it not opening?

472
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,480
Help!

473
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,220
Let me try.

474
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,910
No.

475
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Someone, please help.

476
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,770
What are you waiting for? Let’s go.

477
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,960
Hold on.

478
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,960
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,660
What?

480
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,710
That.

481
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,560
Where?

482
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,890
I don’t hear anything.

483
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,510
It’s all in your head.

484
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,300
Aren’t you going?

485
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,960
Go!

486
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,190
Run!

487
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,890
Let go of me already.

488
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,640
You should let go.

489
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,750
Just pull yourself together.

490
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,920
It was just an instinct.

491
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,000
An instinct told you to jump on me?

492
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,320
Maybe it’s true when they say you have to leave before 0:13.

493
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,670
Otherwise, you will be the next body.

494
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,140
I don’t think so.

495
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,610
It’s 0:11 AM.

496
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,730
It’s just too slow.

497
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,820
We have no time.

498
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,320
Let’s use stairs.

499
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,110
Aren’t you going?

500
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,310
What now?

501
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,730
Just go with me.

502
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,350
The elevator is too slow.

503
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,450
It’s almost 0:13.

504
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,860
Why are you not moving? Let’s go.

505
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,000
I don’t want to be the next cadaver.

506
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,230
Come!

507
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,850
Hurry up.

508
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,660
Are we gonna make it?

509
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,650
Ouch!

510
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,790
Are you all right?

511
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,550
Can you feel your leg?

512
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,450
Don’t touch it.

513
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,190
Come on up.

514
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,840
Let go of me.

515
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,180
It’s not the time to be tough.

516
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,600
Hop on.

517
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,050
My apologies.

518
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,400
I didn’t want to do that, actually.

519
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,230
You scared students again.

520
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,850
You saw that?

521
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,850
I’m sorry.

522
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,070
We’ve made it!

523
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,120
It’s 0:14. We took just a minute.

524
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,950
Hey! Get up.

525
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,060
What?

526
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,970
Get up. Trust me.

527
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,770
What do you want?

528
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,580
Just do it.

529
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,640
What are you doing?

530
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,610
Put your head right here so it won’t hurt.

531
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,240
You want me to rest comfortably, huh?

532
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,840
Stop bugging me.

533
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,470
Or I’ll knock your head on the floor.

534
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,670
Admit it.

535
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,410
Don’t be so stubborn.

536
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,570
I don’t care about you.

537
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,000
I’m paying you back for carrying me here.

538
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,250
Yeah?

539
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,060
If you don’t want to owe me anything, you can rub my leg.

540
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,670
I will stop being mad at you, alright.

541
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,800
But that doesn’t mean we’re friends.

542
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,560
What are you smiling at?

543
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,130
That’s good enough for me.

544
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,350
Thanks.

545
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,910
Thank me for what?

546
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,180
If you’re gonna talk this much, I’m out.

547
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,800
Ouch!

548
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,050
Did you forget that your leg hurts?

549
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,120
I’ve carried you all the way down here.

550
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,090
A ‘thank you’ would be very nice.

551
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,770
Thank you.

552
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,330
What? I couldn’t hear you.

553
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,250
Then that’s your problem.

554
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,670
But I heard that.

555
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,990
It’s your fault I got yelled at.

556
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,640
You hugged me first.

557
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,730
You held on to me so tight in the gross lab.

558
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,110
So? You were scared too.

559
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,860
So what? Why are you pushing me?

560
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,800
None of your business.

561
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,190
None of my...?

562
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,690
Push me harder

563
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,780
and I will…

564
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,050
You will what?

565
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,820
What?

566
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,510
Punch you in the face.

567
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,010
What?

568
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,090
Did you think I’d kiss you?

569
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,200
Sorry to disappoint.

570
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,320
Sutt (asshole).

571
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,130
You’re calling my name again.

572
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,190
Piss off, Sutthaya!

573
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,800
So that story isn’t real?

574
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,120
I hurt myself for nothing.

575
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,660
What are you doing? I’m not blind.

576
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Don’t play tough. Your leg still hurts.

577
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,720
I didn’t ask for your help.

578
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,420
Okay.

579
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,760
I was nosy.

580
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,690
But I can be because we’re friends.

581
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Hi. Can I have a double shot coffee, please?

582
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,030
Make it super strong.

583
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,680
Of course.

584
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,550
Stayed up late last night?

585
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,120
No, not that late.

586
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,710
I was just studying.

587
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,110
(What a shitty excuse there!)

588
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,840
Pi,

589
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,360
about the blind date you asked me,

590
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,460
I’ve changed my mind.

591
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,120
It’s tonight, right?

592
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,200
I’ll see you there.

593
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,930
I have to get going now.

594
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,540
Bye bye.

595
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,540
He’s going!

596
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,750
The tale is real.

597
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,620
Thank you, Mr. cadaver!

598
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,250
Thank you!!

599
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,060
Duean, let me give you a kiss.

600
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
What on earth happened to you?

601
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,120
Muang Nan said yes to the date.

602
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,020
Seriously?

603
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:17,920
Pi,

604
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,560
come and sit here.

605
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,750
Just a sec.

606
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,060
Alright. I’m ready.

607
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,970
I need to prepare you for tonight.

608
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,930
Listen.

609
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,600
Remember.

610
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,550
Apply.

611
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,000
First of all, you need to be confident.

612
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,750
Look! Why is that guy wearing sunglasses?

613
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,760
Exactly! Is something wrong with him?

614
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,320
Don't listen to people's gossiping.

615
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,850
When you see Muang Nan, try to be as cool as possible.

616
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,800
What’s up, Nan?

617
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,890
Hi, Pi.

618
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:11,710
Pi,

619
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,340
Is something wrong with your eyes?

620
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,230
Nothing. Why?

621
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,820
You’re wearing sunglasses.

622
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,260
I thought your eyes hurt or something.

623
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
Ah!

624
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,780
Come on.

625
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,140
Let’s go to our table.

626
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,690
If he doesn’t hold your hand, build your own chance.

627
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,120
Nan, my eyes are sensitive to light.

628
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,790
Can you take me to the table?

629
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,560
I’m afraid I might trip over something.

630
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,540
Sure. Come on.

631
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,980
I’ll never wash this hand for the rest of my life.

632
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,280
Excellent, bro!

633
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,770
Careful there, Pi.

634
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,400
Mork.

635
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,480
You’re here too, Sutt?

636
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,560
My name is Sutthaya.

637
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,420
And why can’t I come?

638
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,400
You own the place or what?

639
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,250
(Shit! It doesn’t go as planned.)

640
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,480
If the plan is jeopardized, your rival shows up,

641
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,690
use the magic potion.

642
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,670
What potion?

643
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,450
Liquor.

644
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,770
But I’m such a lightweight.

645
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,190
You’re drunk easily when you have an empty stomach.

646
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,830
Fill it with food and you’ll be fine. Trust me.

647
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,840
Drink it up and gain your bravery.

648
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,870
Then a huge obstacle will become very tiny.

649
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,360
Nan, let’s go somewhere else.

650
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,560
Pi, are you all right?

651
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,430
Pi?

652
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,000
I’m okay. Thank you.

653
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,500
Let’s go.

654
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,260
When you’re alone with him, speak to him very nicely.

655
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,920
Compliment him and make him fall for you.

656
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,140
I have something to tell you.

657
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,200
I…

658
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I like you, Muang Nan.

659
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,630
I’ve liked you for so long, .

660
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,310
but I could never bring myself to tell you

661
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,200
All the changes I have made are for you.

662
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,520
I always show up at your Faculty.

663
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,720
I’ve changed my looks.

664
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,170
I’m trying to be a better student.

665
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,230
All that just for you.

666
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,270
But I just realized that…

667
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,620
what I should have done a long time ago

668
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,010
was telling you that…

669
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:11,960
I like you.

670
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,840
How do I know if he likes me too?

671
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,420
You will get a signal, man.

672
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,810
What signal?

673
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,110
You’ll figure it out.

674
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,930
And when there’s a signal, go ahead and just kiss him.

675
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,750
Pi, you dipshit!

676
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,000
What did you do last night?

677
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,830
No!! My first kiss!!

678
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,510
It was a total misunderstanding.

679
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,660
Don’t listen to them.

680
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,580
Pi, you’re here too?

681
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,240
Find a chance to be alone with Muang Nan.
