1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,370
Give it to me.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,970
Don’t make me force you.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,170
Duean,

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,560
where are you going?

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,990
Don’t you know what other people are saying about you and me?

6
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,530
You have to delete that account.

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,150
Otherwise, I’ll need to report you.

8
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,490
You don’t like Muang Nan that much.

9
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,770
It’s just a matter of time.

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,170
You’ll surely fall for me.

11
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,900
EP.6 - GETTING VACCINE

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,660
I like Muang Nan.

13
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,370
I like Muang Nan.

14
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,590
It’s just a matter of time

15
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,690
until you fall for me.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,350
Why do I have to think about Sutthaya?

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,080
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.6 - Deadly Mosquitoes)

18
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,320
Hey, junior.

19
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,670
What are you doing?

20
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,790
I love you, my senior.

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,150
I’ve loved you ever since I first saw you.

22
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,580
Can I kiss you?

23
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,310
Duean, just stop.

24
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,870
You’re so loud. I can’t sleep.

25
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,210
I thought you fell asleep already.

26
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,120
I’m sorry.

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,600
I was too much into this e-comic.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,640
The wi-fi here is just so sweet...

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,340
I mean so fast.

30
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,340
Duean.

31
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,140
What?

32
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,170
I can’t sleep.

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,770
So?

34
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,010
Can you give me a head rub?

35
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,070
Why do I have to do that for you?

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,910
Because no one can fall asleep by doing that himself.

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,850
Please, Duean.

38
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,560
It’s 12:30 already

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,840
and I need to get up at 6 tomorrow.

40
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,270
If I don’t sleep in half an hour,

41
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,860
my Growth Hormone will stop working.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,970
Please.

43
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,910
Please.

44
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,370
Please give me a head rub.

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,850
Please. Please.

46
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,210
Please give me a head rub.

47
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,660
(Come to think of it, this guy is kinda cute.)

48
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,110
Fine!

49
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,220
Wait! What are you doing?

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Why are you sleeping on my lap?

51
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,320
I don’t usually sleep out.

52
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,810
Every night at home, my mom gives me a head rub before bed.

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,300
Duean, can I ask you something?

54
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,460
What now?

55
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Why did you choose Dentistry?

56
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,110
Because I don’t like talkative people.

57
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,340
And it’s always quiet whenever I visit dental clinics.

58
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,930
I like to work in a peaceful environment. I don’t like people who talk too much, like you.

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,400
I was just trying to make conversation.

60
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
My leg is numb.

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,060
Can you get up? I need to stretch my legs.

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,960
Put your head down now.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:15,930
Hey!

64
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,280
Duean!

65
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,240
What is it?

66
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,130
You have a tattoo?

67
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,120
Weren’t you scared when you got it?

68
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,380
I was but I like it.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,400
I’m a masochist.

70
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,450
Why this tattoo though?

71
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,250
My zodiac sign.

72
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,010
Really?

73
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,670
I’m a Pisces too.

74
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,130
That’s why my parents named me Meen (Pisces).

75
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,000
It’s another thing we have in common.

76
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,130
Look!

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,930
The fish.

78
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,610
- That’s enough.
- So cute.

79
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,190
I’m ticklish.

80
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,280
Stop touching my leg already.

81
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,590
Meen!

82
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,620
Or I won’t give you a head rub.

83
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,480
Alright.

84
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,690
Duean.

85
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,540
What now?

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,530
Thank you.

87
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,490
If you really want to thank me,

88
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,230
no more head rub and go back to sleep.

89
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,550
I wasn’t thanking you for this.

90
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,090
I thank you for all the help,

91
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,540
protection and care you’ve given me.

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,790
When did I ever do that?

93
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,060
That’s cool!

94
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,060
I didn’t know we could do this.

95
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,110
I’m carrying many things. Can you wear it for me?

96
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,190
And when you jumped into the water to get my water bottle.

97
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,070
Thank you so much.

98
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,430
No problem. It’s nothing.

99
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,730
Get some sleep.

100
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,160
(His skin is so nice.)

101
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,940
Duean.

102
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,790
I haven’t fallen asleep yet. Don’t stop.

103
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
You are just too much!

104
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,320
You don’t like Muang Nan that much.

105
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,190
Don’t act like you know so well.

106
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:40,980
But I do know.

107
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,430
It’s just a matter of time.

108
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,530
You’ll surely fall for me,

109
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,230
soft-cheeked boy.

110
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,590
There’s no way I’d like you, Mork.

111
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,610
I like Muang Nan.

112
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,270
Nan,

113
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,530
after school today,

114
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,490
I will hurry back home to look at you all night.

115
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,180
Of course, Pi.

116
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,980
Don’t forget to pay attention in class, Pi.

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,940
You too, Nan.

118
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,540
I’ll see you later.

119
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,390
Bye.

120
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,190
Damn it!

121
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,410
He didn’t only take my boxers,

122
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,120
but also my lab gown.

123
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,180
I need to wash them with a laundry disinfectant when he gets back.

124
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,670
Duean, have you seen my gown?

125
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,100
Did you take it?

126
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,200
(No.)

127
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,390
(I did not.)

128
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,750
I can tell from your voice that you did.

129
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,210
You like to steal my stuff, don’t you?

130
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,590
I will steal yours too.

131
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,940
This one is expensive.

132
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,830
Wait a minute.

133
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,990
Did you spray the perfume or pour it all over yourself?

134
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,010
It’s so strong.

135
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,800
Do you have a date or something?

136
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,810
Why so prepared?

137
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,540
It’s not a date.

138
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,510
Duean just likes to steal my stuff.

139
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,460
So I used his too.

140
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,570
Oh, yeah?

141
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,460
Seriously, Pi.

142
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,850
Aren’t you dating someone at all?

143
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,270
Dating? Not at all.

144
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,130
What? My son is very handsome.

145
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,270
I’m sure you’re flirting around with some people.

146
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,140
Flirting? Nah!

147
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,250
Let me tell you this.

148
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,380
If I looked this hot,

149
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,600
I’d strike.

150
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,830
Honey!

151
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,630
Nonsense!

152
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,840
It was a joke.

153
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,530
You just love saying such a thing.

154
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,860
You’re in a second year now.

155
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,130
You’re allowed to be in love.

156
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,140
I don’t mind.

157
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,920
Alright?

158
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,150
Are you going to answer those texts?

159
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,110
They keep coming.

160
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,670
Are they from the special one?

161
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,650
Read them now or your darling will be mad.

162
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,860
That’s okay, dad.

163
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,720
I’m taking off now.

164
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,320
Darling.

165
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,050
He’s acting weird.

166
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,020
No, he’s not.

167
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,460
Boys his age are all like that.

168
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,080
It’s time for changes.

169
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,780
Do you see how he sets his hair and changes his look?

170
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,120
It’s normal.

171
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,240
Just stop already.

172
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,770
(Why didn’t you accept Mork’s friend request?)

173
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,420
(Are you mad at him?)

174
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,970
(I’m crying! I love MorkPi so much. Please don’t sink my ship just yet.)

175
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,370
(Get back together with Mork, please please please.)

176
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,080
Damn you, Sutthaya! When will this be over?

177
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,270
(Mork, why did you ask them to delete the MorkPi fan page?)

178
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:21,880
(Sutthaya: I couldn’t say no to Pi. He likes to keep a low profile. He doesn’t seek attention and he’s a little stubborn.)

179
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,800
Stubborn? Your dad is stubborn!

180
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,870
Are you calling me?

181
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,130
No. It’s nothing.

182
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,550
Mork, you and I are going to have a real conversation!

183
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,130
Meen,

184
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,400
you forgot to wait for me.

185
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,130
Duean,

186
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,060
why is your toothbrush so old?

187
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,590
Because I’m economical.

188
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,410
Everything of mine is well-used.

189
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,640
And you’re done brushing?

190
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,880
Why so fast?

191
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,290
Dental students usually take good care of their teeth.

192
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,360
Because my teeth are already clean.

193
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,640
They don’t need extra care.

194
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,360
And they don’t take that long to rinse.

195
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,410
Fluoride is water-soluble. You need it for enamel.

196
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
I already brushed my teeth earlier.

197
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,180
Then I had some snacks.

198
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,560
This is my second time brushing, okay?

199
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,260
Duean,

200
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,430
you’re always careless.

201
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,400
Look!

202
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
You didn’t wash it all off.

203
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,610
You still have eye boogers here.

204
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,080
Are you all right?

205
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,270
No one has ever done that for me, except my mom.

206
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,530
No one has ever done what you did for me last night either,

207
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,560
except my mom.

208
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,490
We sure have things in common.

209
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,180
(Don’t!)

210
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,770
(Just don’t.)

211
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,650
(Come on, man!)

212
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,350
(Little Duean!)

213
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,960
(Please dont’!)

214
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,940
(I can’t take it.)

215
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,100
(I just can’t.)

216
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,010
(I’m so out of here.)

217
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,690
Duean,

218
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,280
where are you going?

219
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,040
Wait for me, Duean.

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,280
What’s the matter, Duean?

221
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,300
Duean.

222
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,320
Duean.

223
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,860
Duean, slow down.

224
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,300
Duean!

225
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,040
Good morning, Duean and Meen.

226
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,090
Good morning, Teacher Namphueng.

227
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,980
So I heard there was a gecko last night, right?

228
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,650
You guys needed to put up a tent outdoors.

229
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,490
That’s right.

230
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,600
It was under the blanket and it was so big.

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It’s like someone put it there on purpose.

232
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,470
I’m really sorry.

233
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,470
I thought I did a good check on that.

234
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,720
That’s alright, my beautiful teacher.

235
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,400
It’s just a gecko. I could take it.

236
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,350
But Meen was scared. That’s why we needed to camp out.

237
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,390
You should learn to tough it out.

238
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,130
Alright then.

239
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,160
I came to tell you that today should be easy for you

240
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,340
because we have four more volunteers coming.

241
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,440
Four?

242
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,690
Last night,

243
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,160
they called and said they’d be arriving this morning.

244
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,750
Here I am, waiting to welcome them.

245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,830
Four volunteers?

246
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,560
That sounds familiar.

247
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,540
Look.

248
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,750
I think they’re here.

249
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,800
Holy shit!!!

250
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,000
Really? Do you really have to bring them here?

251
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,450
What’s up, buddy?

252
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,980
My closet friend.

253
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,570
My beloved friend.

254
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,800
They’ve said it all. I’ve got nothing left to say.

255
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,130
I’m not your friend.

256
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,360
Hey!

257
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,790
Do you know what these five fingers mean?

258
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,990
Maybe they mean someone here is in his fifth year.

259
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,800
So…

260
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,690
You guys know each other?

261
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,600
We know each other very well.

262
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,090
Hi. My name is Koh.

263
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,800
Hi. My name is Yok.

264
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,210
I am Teacher Namphueng.

265
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,670
I’ll go get you guys some drinks.

266
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,000
Just make yourselves at home.

267
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,500
Of course.

268
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,020
Here’s some drinks.

269
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,000
Thank you.

270
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,510
How’s that iced lemon tea?

271
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,910
Very nice!!

272
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,630
What are you doing?

273
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,410
You two!

274
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,320
Come with me.

275
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,560
Just come with me!

276
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,700
Easy, man.

277
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,860
Back off for me.

278
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,840
No way.

279
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,020
There’re many strong men in this world...

280
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,410
You will fight me because of a girl?

281
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,320
That’s right.

282
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,490
But these two are weak...

283
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,220
Just bring it on.

284
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,890
Come on then!

285
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,130
They might think they’re hot...

286
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,240
I’m not fighting you. Please step aside.

287
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,040
Not a chance.

288
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,270
But soon, just like their dads, they'll get old and rot...

289
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,920
Your dad is old!!

290
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Stop with that stupid poetry!

291
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,480
Whatever!

292
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,350
Maybe Duean is stepping back, but I’m not.

293
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,510
Please, just do this for me.

294
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,670
But you already have your boy, Meen.

295
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,940
Why are you asking us this?

296
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,580
He isn’t my boy! No way!

297
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,480
Just please.

298
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,160
Where do you want us to put up a dental check-up table?

299
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,760
You told them you’re a dentist?

300
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,640
You've made a number of troubles.

301
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,030
I’ll go set up the table.

302
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,540
What a trouble maker.

303
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,600
Sutthaya!

304
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,310
We really need to clear things up.

305
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,480
There you are, Sutthaya!

306
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,760
We need to talk.

307
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,180
It’s you?

308
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,690
Let’s talk later.

309
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,220
Would you help me cross the street first?

310
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,520
What? You can cross the street yourself.

311
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,220
I lost my contacts.

312
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,720
I just can’t see anything.

313
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,920
Alright. Follow me then.

314
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,750
Hold on.

315
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,040
I helped you cross the street when your leg hurt.

316
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,550
Don’t grab my arm. Grab this bottle.

317
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,010
Aww! They’re so cute.

318
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,160
Let go.

319
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,880
My contacts just slipped off my eyes a little.

320
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,770
I thought I lost them.

321
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,840
Thanks a lot though.

322
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,760
I need to go now. See you later.

323
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,730
Sutthaya, come back here!

324
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,460
What a pain!

325
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,290
Did you just fool me?

326
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
Are you mocking me? Come back here!

327
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,680
GET THE VACCINE FOR FREE!
THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE

328
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,200
Where are you, Sutt (asshole)?

329
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,570
Are you calling me an asshole?

330
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,600
No.

331
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,580
I have…

332
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,070
a friend named Sutthaya.

333
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,680
Sorry about that.

334
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,530
Mork, we need to talk.

335
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,150
Have a seat, please.

336
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,180
You seem hot-headed.

337
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,690
You want some iced water to cool yourself down?

338
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,040
Stop that and talk to me first.

339
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,040
Drink this and cool down.

340
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,100
Here.

341
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,650
No.

342
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,680
Okay.

343
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,640
Roll up your sleeves.

344
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,400
I need to check your blood pressure.

345
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,260
I’m begging you. Just delete what you whined about me.

346
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,480
People are all misunderstanding.

347
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,630
If you don’t let me check your blood pressure now,

348
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,400
go get in line, please.

349
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,150
After this, we must talk.

350
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,120
Hurry then.

351
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,450
Stay still.

352
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,360
We must do this first.

353
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,770
Just say it. What do you want from me?

354
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,570
You have high blood pressure.

355
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,420
Of course. I’m so mad at you right now.

356
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,120
Hand, please.

357
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,700
Why?

358
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,100
May I have your hand?

359
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,790
And…

360
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,690
your heart is beating really fast.

361
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,360
Because I am so pissed over here.

362
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,930
Apart from risk of having hypertension,

363
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,930
you have one more risk.

364
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,390
What risk?

365
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,360
A heart disease.

366
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,720
Not a common heart disease though.

367
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,510
It only happens when you’re close to someone you love.

368
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,830
Pi,

369
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,910
your heart beats so fast when you’re with me.

370
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,120
Are you sure you don’t like me?

371
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,730
Just admit it.

372
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,980
The disease you have is called ‘In Denial.’

373
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,520
Do you want to get my treatment?

374
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,040
I can be your vaccine.

375
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,340
Damn you!

376
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,250
Tiger mosquitoes come in a rainy season.

377
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,340
You will have a fever if you get bitten.

378
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,270
Show us how you get bitten.

379
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,680
Medicines sometimes can’t help, and you’ll have red spots all over.

380
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,690
You need to prevent the fever. Don’t let mosquitoes reproduce.

381
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,520
Turn over any unused containers with water inside.

382
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,500
So today we’re here to give you information…

383
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,320
Aww!

384
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,690
You’re taking photos of this kid.

385
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,840
Do you secretly like him?

386
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,050
Do you love him?

387
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,190
Do you?

388
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,110
Like him, my ass!

389
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,450
I’m taking his photos because he looks funny.

390
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,740
Duean, this is Premchai. He has tooth decay.

391
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,370
Want to say hello to him?

392
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,240
Hi.

393
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,490
Gosh!

394
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,080
Sutthaya! Who would like you?

395
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,750
Your heart beats so fast when you’re with me.

396
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,140
Are you sure you don’t like me?

397
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,430
Damn you,

398
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,200
Sutthaya!

399
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,640
Crap! My mask!

400
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,560
Shit!

401
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,360
Where is it?

402
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,500
Here.

403
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,620
It’s mine!

404
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,810
Yes.

405
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,830
This mask is yours.

406
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,870
But in no time,

407
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,680
you will be mine.

408
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Let me see your teeth.

409
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,320
Wow!

410
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,380
Teeth or job's tears?

411
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,350
I don’t think I need this.

412
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,350
What should we do?

413
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,760
He brushes his teeth regularly but still.

414
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,950
I brush them every day. Why do I have tooth decay?

415
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,060
What do you think we should do?

416
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,490
First of all,

417
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,660
stop eating candies.

418
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,260
Seriously?

419
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,510
Are you a real dentist?

420
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,180
Why are you taking my kid’s candy?

421
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,090
Of course.

422
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,410
Don’t you see I'm wearing a gown?

423
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,310
Let’s go somewhere else, Premchai.

424
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,300
That’s right. I’m not a dentist. How can I give the kid a treatment?

425
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,010
Duean,

426
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,380
why are you wearing a gown?

427
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,360
We’re just students.

428
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,500
People might think you’re a real dentist.

429
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,000
That’s fine.

430
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,950
I’ll get to wear it when I graduate anyways.

431
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,360
It’s no difference.

432
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,780
Alright.

433
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,610
Open your mouth, please.

434
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,470
Yes. This mask is yours.

435
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,610
But in no time,

436
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,400
you will be mine.

437
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,030
Your cheeks are very soft.

438
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,180
How come your heart is so stony?

439
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,170
(No, Pi!)

440
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,150
(You can’t like him.)

441
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:33,980
(You like Muang Nan.)

442
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,980
Come on.

443
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,610
That’s it!

444
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,320
It’s time to make it happen.

445
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,910
Enough!

446
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,680
Stop splashing water at me.

447
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,150
Damn! I barely survived that check-up.

448
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,150
And why did you tell him you’re a dental student?

449
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,910
I didn’t mean to lie.

450
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,880
But he said there was a stupid super senior in his class.

451
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,220
I didn’t want to be that stupid guy!

452
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,500
So you told him you’re a dental student?

453
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,230
It was immediate. I had no time to think.

454
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,330
Why didn’t you just confess then?

455
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,030
He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount. You know?

456
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,040
So I just went with the flow.

457
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,410
You didn’t go with the flow.

458
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,890
You cared about Meen’s feelings.

459
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,260
You’re afraid he will hate you if you tell the truth.

460
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,290
That’t not true.

461
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,190
Stop arguing.

462
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,530
You like him.

463
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,430
I don’t.

464
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,360
Just admit it.

465
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,230
I won’t.

466
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,780
You didn’t go with the flow.

467
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,140
You cared about Meen’s feelings.

468
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,550
You’re afraid he will hate you if you tell the truth.

469
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,770
Holy shit, Pi.

470
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,290
Why do you still keep these worn-out boxers?

471
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,850
You came so quietly.

472
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,880
I brought you a new toothbrush.

473
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,230
The one you have is just so old.

474
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,260
I have an extra.

475
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,380
Here!

476
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,500
Thank you.

477
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,370
Thanks a lot.

478
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,500
You can do this, Pi.

479
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,500
You can.

480
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,510
You must say it.

481
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,690
Be confident. Be confident.

482
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,300
Hello, Nan.

483
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,910
What’s up?

484
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,500
Did I keep you waiting?

485
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,790
No.

486
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,050
I bought you food.

487
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,310
Wow!

488
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,800
That’s a lot.

489
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,780
Let’s put them here.

490
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,050
I was looking for you at your Faculty.

491
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,270
Your friends said you’re sick and resting at home.

492
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,910
Once I heard that, I rushed back out to get you food and came here.

493
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,500
These are your favorites.

494
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,770
I have Fish Rice Soup, Pork Congee, Ginseng juice, and some fruits.

495
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,370
And most importantly, choux creams.

496
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,620
Because I care.

497
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,150
Thanks a lot.

498
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,750
This is a lot.

499
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,280
Were they heavy?

500
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,820
They were. My hands hurt.

501
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,310
Give me your hands.

502
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,540
I can give you a massage.

503
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,820
So this is a sign Duean was talking about.

504
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,790
Does it mean there’s a chance he likes me too?

505
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,950
I’m so excited.

506
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,910
How should I even start?

507
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,790
Your left hand, please.

508
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,890
Nan,

509
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,140
Mork told me you don’t like to be alone.

510
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,610
Please don’t be mad.

511
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:20,270
It’s just that Mork told me you have some kind of issue with your family.

512
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,050
So when anything comes up and you need to go somewhere,

513
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,360
he tags along with you.

514
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
My point is

515
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,820
if you want to have someone to talk to,

516
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,310
you can talk to me.

517
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,340
I’ll be happy to be there for you.

518
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,430
You can think of me as your friend.

519
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,280
Don’t talk to Mork so much.

520
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,150
He isn’t a good guy. He doesn’t care.

521
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,410
He doesn’t even know you’re sick.

522
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,390
The only one who does is me.

523
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,670
What are you laughing at?

524
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,810
Nothing.

525
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:54,140
Do you realize you talk about Mork a lot?

526
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,170
(Crap! I didn’t realize that.)

527
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,510
No.

528
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,400
Actually,

529
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,350
I spend time…

530
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,170
I mean I meet him quite often.

531
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,590
He just likes to bug me.

532
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,870
See?

533
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,580
You’re talking about Mork again.

534
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,580
Hey!

535
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,900
I saw that MorkPi fan page.

536
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,930
People were so crazy over you two.

537
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,120
And you guys have good chemistry.

538
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,300
(Just don’t drag me into that topic, please.)

539
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,340
(This isn’t right!)

540
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,260
I think…

541
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:30,140
The reason why Mork likes to tease you so much is because he wants to be close to you.

542
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,360
(No way!)

543
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,700
(I need to confess now.)

544
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,700
Nan.

545
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,010
I have something to tell you.

546
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,030
I…

547
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,370
I…

548
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,720
I like you.

549
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,650
I’ve liked you for so long.

550
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,250
But I could never bring myself to tell you.

551
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,010
I think it is time.

552
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,000
You like me?

553
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,100
Yes, I really like you.

554
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,230
Thank you, Pi.

555
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,820
But I don’t think you do.

556
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,610
Why are you saying that?

557
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,040
If you truly like me,

558
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,030
your heart should beat faster.

559
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,780
Pi,

560
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,490
just think it through.

561
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,980
Did you confess to me

562
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,340
because you’re trying to run away from something?

563
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,340
I believe you used to like me

564
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,670
but I think now you’re scared.

565
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,680
You’re scared of falling for someone else.

566
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,850
Someone not me.

567
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,690
But…

568
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,670
I really like you.

569
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,720
But I can only be your friend.

570
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,770
I don’t want you to waste any more time on me.

571
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,610
Thank you for being honest.

572
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,720
I’ll be right back.

573
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,680
I need to go get my lecture notes.

574
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,440
Duean, you aren’t well-organized.

575
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,710
DS PATTAWEE PANICHAPUN

576
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,820
That’s fine.

577
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,130
I’ll get to wear it when I graduate anyways.

578
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,750
It doesn't make any difference.

579
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:18,000
Dental Student Pattawee Panichapun

580
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,500
I’ll just try searching by his name.

581
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,580
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.6 is over.)

582
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,120
Do I really not like Muang Nan?

583
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,270
You again?

584
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,070
Nan called and said you came to see him.

585
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,770
Wow! You guys are very close.

586
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,490
You tell each other everything.

587
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,130
And do you have anything to tell me?

588
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,040
Muang Nan will never like a loser like me.

589
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,000
He is still a fish upon the sky for me, no matter what.

590
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,760
Why fish upon the sky?

591
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Because it’s impossible.

592
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,250
Have you ever seen anyone catch a fish in the sky

593
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,510
or look for a star in the sea?

594
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,230
No matter how hard I try to change,

595
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,630
Muang Nan is still a fish upon the sky for me.

596
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,070
Want some?

597
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,820
No. I’m a lightweight.

598
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,830
Why do you like Muang Nan anyway?

599
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,290
He’s kind and good-looking.

600
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,190
Who doesn’t like him?

601
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,620
You must be insane not to like him.

602
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,000
That’s the true reason?

603
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,450
Um.

604
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,230
From what I’ve analyzed,

605
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,680
it’s not love.

606
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,440
It’s an obsession.

607
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,810
Obsession?

608
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,820
I'll give you an easy example.

609
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,610
You see those flowers?

610
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,430
If you think they’re pretty,

611
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,910
that means you’re starting to like them

612
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,450
or taking an interest in them.

613
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,830
If you want to own them,

614
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,810
that means you’re obsessed with them.

615
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,430
But if you want to take care and let them grow,

616
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,630
that means…

617
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,730
you love them.

618
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,470
Let’s say Nan is those flowers.

619
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,910
Can you tell me now what you think of him?

620
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,820
Well…

621
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,870
I want to take care of him, I guess.

622
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,320
Pi,

623
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,480
stop lying to yourself.

624
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,200
It’s a disease.

625
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,430
What disease?

626
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,200
There’s nothing wrong with me.

627
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,800
There is.

628
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,440
You’re so ‘in denial.’

629
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,340
No, I’m not.

630
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,020
Yes, you are.

631
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,760
I am not.

632
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,470
You are.

633
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,460
I’m not.

634
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,010
Your words can lie.

635
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,870
But your physical reactions can’t.

636
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,560
What?

637
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,630
Are you kidding me?

638
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,410
Pi.

639
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,060
Pi!

640
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,900
Damn!

641
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,360
It’s about to rain.

642
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,630
I want to take care of you, Pi.

643
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:21,700
Hi.

644
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,540
You’re awake, lightweight?

645
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,680
Just one gulp and you’re knocked out.

646
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,470
Where am I?

647
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,190
My room?

648
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,370
Your room?

649
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,250
What time is it?

650
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,040
Almost 2 in the morning.

651
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,370
Shit! I didn’t tell anyone at home.

652
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,700
My mom will yell at me for sure.

653
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,020
Why did you take me here?

654
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,790
It was about to rain.

655
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,050
I didn’t know you wanted to be left at Nan’s dormitory.

656
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,390
Who would know you wanted to feed the mosquitoes and play with a dog there?

657
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,620
I made an effort to carry you all the way here.

658
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,620
I took care of you and gave you a blanket.

659
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,900
Don’t you think you should at least say thanks?

660
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,540
Damn you, Mork!

661
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,440
I’ve run out of names to call you.

662
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,030
Pi.

663
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Are you that afraid to stay with me?

664
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,060
I have a headache. I need to go home.

665
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,800
You’re not running away from the truth, are you?

666
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,730
I’m not!

667
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,560
I’m not in denial, Mork.

668
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,260
You just don't know anything.

669
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,830
Did you open that book?

670
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:53,790
Yes.

671
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,580
It was about to fall off

672
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,540
so I…

673
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,010
You shouldn’t go through my stuff.

674
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,280
Where have you been?

675
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,810
Why did you come home this late?

676
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,130
Studying.

677
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,140
I can smell alcohol.

678
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,650
Are you drunk?

679
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,100
I’m not.

680
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,280
I was just with friends.

681
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,340
And why did you have to drink?

682
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,620
You shouldn’t go through my stuff anyway.

683
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,040
Why don’t you tell me what’s going on?

684
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,620
Do you realize that…

685
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,620
you’ve been distancing yourself from us.

686
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,150
You just don’t talk to me anymore.

687
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,270
You are not as nice as you were before.

688
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,580
Pi.

689
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,200
I will be out tonight, studying.

690
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,410
Pi.

691
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,600
Pi.

692
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,630
But I can only be your friend.

693
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I don’t want you to waste any more time on me.

694
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,760
Do you realize that…

695
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,430
you’ve been distancing yourself from us.

696
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,390
You just don’t talk to me anymore.

697
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
You are not as nice as you were before.

698
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,510
Are you okay?

699
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,790
Why?

700
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,790
Why does it have to be like this?

701
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,510
I don’t get it.

702
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,460
Why?

703
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,610
Why doesn’t Muang Nan like me?

704
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,010
Why can’t my mom accept who I am?

705
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,110
Why? I don’t get it.

706
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:37,620
Why?

707
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,620
Ever since I was a kid,

708
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,610
I’ve never done anything right.

709
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,600
I’m such a jinx.

710
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,770
I’ll never succeed at anything.

711
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,160
I just can’t…

712
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,770
I can be your vaccine, Pi.

713
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,030
Just don’t leave me.

714
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,420
Why does someone like you want to be my friend?

715
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,510
Because for me, you’re not a loser.

716
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,560
Now that we’re friends, don’t you ever leave me.

717
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Being friends is good enough for now.

718
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,420
How are you related to a guy named Pattawee?

719
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,370
Is he your little brother?

720
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,070
Let’s just wait for everyone to show up.

721
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,780
Wan will be here soon.
