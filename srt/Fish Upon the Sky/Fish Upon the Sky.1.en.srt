1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,970
Clear sky.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,910
Nice weather.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,470
It’s just perfect for today’s mission.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Pi, hello!

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,930
My mission is to deliver love to people.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,770
Not the people I love though.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,110
I’m just their cupid.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,460
Pi, the next surprise is about to take place.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,230
Yeah?

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,240
Who?

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,750
A med student is going to confess to a dental student.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,290
Where are they?

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,650
This way.

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,250
Pi, take the balloons with you.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,210
Sure.

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,400
Give them here.

17
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,050
Hey!

18
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,270
Wait!

19
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,350
What are you doing?

20
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,070
Yeah!!

21
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,290
EP.1 - THE CHANGE

22
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
A YEAR AGO

23
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,810
I hate this event.

24
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,350
Do you know what it is?

25
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,130
It happens once a year around Valentine’s Day.

26
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,550
It’s when people confess to their loved ones.

27
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,070
Pi, what are you standing here for?

28
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,520
Go get the next surprise ready.

29
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,030
Go!

30
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,070
For those who are too afraid to confess, they tell it to us instead.

31
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,760
The staff will select the top love stories and throw a free surprise for the people they like.

32
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,160
We say love for those who can’t say it.

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,640
How romantic is that!

34
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,230
I bet everyone likes that.

35
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,080
But I hate this event.

36
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Here comes the guy.

37
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,990
And here comes the girl.

38
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,760
Get ready to witness it.

39
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,880
Witness what?

40
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,160
You’ll find out.

41
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:39,320
♪ Sometimes I think heaven made us because we’re meant to be ♪

42
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,340
♪ I belong to you ♪

43
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,690
♪ We’re real soulmates that finally found each other ♪

44
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,210
Having goosebumps, aren’t you?

45
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,630
Me too.

46
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,010
I’ll never get a chance to experience this kind of love in my life.

47
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,140
I’m like an innermost molar.

48
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,390
In the back!

49
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,980
The back!

50
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,450
In the very back!

51
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,270
Because it’s strong?

52
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,550
No!

53
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,640
It lives under the gum,

54
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,820
waiting to be a wisdom tooth.

55
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,960
It will grow without its opposing tooth.

56
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,750
It’s a goddamn wisdom tooth! With no opposing tooth!

57
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,090
I’m no use. I grow just to be pulled out.

58
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,270
I have no worth.

59
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,890
I don’t even have friends, let alone a lover!

60
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,390
Pi’s brother should share his hotness and brains with him.

61
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,410
Exactly!

62
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,370
I can’t see any good things in him except his brother.

63
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,090
He is so hot.

64
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,470
Friends?

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,630
I was only a joke to them.

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,990
They talked badly about me.

67
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,480
Many of them approached me because I was nice and had a handsome brother.

68
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Some people got close to me because I was book smart.

69
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,780
I knew absolutely nothing about sociability.

70
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,920
They said I had bad taste and I liked to do weird things around people.

71
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
And what hurt me the most?

72
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,430
It’s when they said nothing in my life was decent, except my brother.

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
You, thick glasses!

74
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
What happened that day has changed everything.

75
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,380
I couldn’t look people in the eyes and trust them.

76
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,730
I quit thinking that people actually meant it when they gave me a smile.

77
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,480
I was afraid to show my true feelings

78
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,480
even when I wanted love, friendship, and support from other people.

79
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,790
So dramatic!

80
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,880
Let's get back and continue having goosebumps here.

81
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,800
A nice surprise and a song.

82
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Look! They’re even tossing rose petals.

83
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,730
What a huge surprise!

84
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,180
How about you two get married already?

85
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,680
Damn it!

86
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,530
Raining in February?

87
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,000
Everything must have gone crazy. Where will I get an umbrella now?

88
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,350
Here we go again.

89
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,890
They stink.

90
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,770
Here comes the second couple.

91
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,750
People in love stink.

92
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,860
And here’s the third couple.

93
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,160
I just want to push them down the stairs.

94
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,600
It’s burning bright. The rain might stop in just a few minutes.

95
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,790
ONE HOUR LATER

96
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,290
Damn it!

97
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,720
Hey! Don’t go out in the rain.

98
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,250
You might get sick.

99
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,690
Going home?

100
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,640
Let me walk you to the bus stop.

101
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,470
Actually, I…

102
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,830
Come on.

103
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,860
Let’s go.

104
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,330
Quickly.

105
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,580
I…

106
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,550
I…

107
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,880
Thanks.

108
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,870
You’re welcome.

109
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,960
Happy Valentine’s Day.

110
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,940
Well, I gotta go now.

111
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,090
Bye.

112
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,430
Shit!

113
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,680
So this is how love at first sight feels like.

114
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,720
People in love feel so good and fresh.

115
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,030
It’s like I’m showering with holy water.

116
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,820
I feel forever young.

117
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,730
Very young…

118
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,380
Super young…

119
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,040
When will you stop? I’m soaking wet already!

120
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,690
Oops!

121
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,270
Pi,

122
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,680
you’re home?

123
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,350
Yes.

124
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,840
Where are you going? Aren’t you going to have dinner first?

125
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,810
I’m full.

126
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,230
You are?

127
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,580
Yes. I’m full of love.

128
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,730
What?

129
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,650
Nothing. I didn’t say anything.

130
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,800
What’s with you?

131
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,650
Today was the first time I got to talk to someone I’ve always had a crush on.

132
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
His name is Muang Nan.

133
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
I want to go up north just by hearing his name.

134
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
MUANG NAN,
SECOND-YEAR, THE FACULTY OF ALLIED HEALTH SCIENCES

135
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,620
The more I look at him, the cuter he gets.

136
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,020
Muang Nan is like a star everyone wants to reach.

137
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,180
He just looks so good no matter what he does.

138
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,160
His favorite dessert is choux cream.

139
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,130
Aww! He’s so cute.

140
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,220
[Yesterday was sunnyyy. Today was rainy.]

141
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,900
'Sunnyyy?' You are just too cute.

142
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,160
[Sunnyyy, huh?]

143
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,710
[Sunnyyy, huh?]

144
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,630
[Sutthaya Nithikornkul: Sunny, huh?]

145
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,770
It’s you again, Sutthaya?

146
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,880
Damn you, Sutthaya!

147
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,360
All these times, this whole year that I’ve followed Muang Nan,

148
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,210
I always see this guy by his side.

149
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,870
You kept me waiting!

150
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,500
Why does he have to like the one I like?

151
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,800
MORK,
SECOND-YEAR, THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE

152
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,910
You like sweet drinks, huh?

153
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,580
I wish you choke to death.

154
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,350
You think you’re so cool just being a basketball player?

155
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,650
Don’t!

156
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,920
Muang Nan, don’t wipe the sweat for him.

157
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,410
He’s such a pain!

158
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,870
What the heck are you yelling at?

159
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,890
You’re freaking noisy.

160
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,770
This guy is my big brother.
[DUEAN, THE SECOND BIG BROTHER]

161
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,450
He isn’t the one my friends admire though.

162
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,490
I can’t poop now. What is going on with you?

163
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,440
Nothing.

164
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,430
Nothing my ass.

165
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,400
I saw you mumbling and mumbling over your phone.

166
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,400
Whatever. It’s not your business.

167
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,750
Just go poop. I’m out.

168
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,340
Being so secretive. Must be about love.

169
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,070
Are you secretly in love with someone?

170
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,220
Muang Nan, is it?

171
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,970
How do you know that?

172
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,000
How do I not know? I’m your brother. I see through you, man.

173
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,240
You are frustrated because you’re having a love rival.

174
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,040
You’re worried because you have nothing to compete with him.

175
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,750
You don’t go out. You’re anti-social. You like to stay home.

176
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,530
You can’t play sports. Actually, you can’t play anything.

177
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,440
Even a little kid beats you.

178
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,990
Just shut up.

179
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,300
You’re not helping. Don’t add insult to injury.

180
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,070
I’m out.

181
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,040
Nan, I know you like choux creams.

182
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,420
I happened to pass by a bakery today so I got you a box.

183
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,550
Happened to?

184
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
It doesn’t sound very sincere.

185
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,500
Nan, I know you like choux creams so I meant to buy some for you.

186
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,860
Meant to? Isn’t it too obvious?

187
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,780
Shit! How should I say it?

188
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,260
Happened to? I meant to buy?

189
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,930
Happened to? I meant to buy?

190
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,560
I know you like it, so I stole some for you.

191
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,130
Damn it!

192
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,260
What have you done?

193
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,840
Sorry.

194
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,510
Damn you!

195
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,440
My ear!

196
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,640
Eww!

197
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,150
I am sorry.

198
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,160
Let me buy you a new box.

199
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,050
What a shitty day!

200
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,180
My choux creams are ruined and my hand is dirty.

201
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
That was an accident.

202
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,200
But this is not.

203
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Are they from the shop in the white building?

204
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,360
I will buy you a new box.

205
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,240
No need. I can do it myself.

206
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,860
I’m late and I have no choux creams.

207
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,850
Hello, Nan.

208
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,270
Hello, Pi.

209
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,440
You know my name?

210
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,880
Of course.

211
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,110
On Valentine's Day, it was raining.

212
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,420
And I shared with you my umbrella.

213
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,710
You had a name tag on that said ‘Pi’.

214
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,880
He isn’t only cute, but also pays attention to details.

215
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,340
What?

216
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,640
It was just a sigh. What’s wrong with that?

217
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,480
The student who just walked in, which faculty are you from?

218
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,730
The Faculty of Dentistry.

219
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,880
Okay. We’re all here then.

220
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,560
Smart! I didn’t know that.

221
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,480
Can I sit with you when we have a lab?

222
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,920
Sure.

223
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,840
Smart.

224
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
Clever.

225
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,400
Friendly.

226
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
You’re gonna have to deal with me.

227
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,830
Hey!

228
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,190
You think you’re so clever, don’t you, Sutt?

229
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,230
Sutthaya.

230
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,010
You’re such a nerd.

231
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,390
Second-year students aren’t supposed to know that.

232
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,980
Did you read the seniors' textbook?

233
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,660
You don’t have to make yourself sound like that when you talk.

234
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,990
Aren’t you annoyed by your own voice?

235
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,670
Give it here. Stop doing that.

236
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,150
Are you bullying me?

237
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,350
Do you want a problem?

238
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,470
What are you guys doing?

239
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,850
Nothing.

240
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,300
I am wiping something off his shirt.

241
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,320
Be careful not to make it dirty next time.

242
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,770
Mork,

243
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,880
wanna go eat?

244
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,390
Sure.

245
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
I’ll be outside.

246
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,370
Do you want to eat with us?

247
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,050
No!

248
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,800
I’ll not be a third wheel.

249
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,390
Okay

250
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,590
Let’s stay here together then.

251
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,710
You, asshole.

252
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,840
Would you stop that?

253
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,520
Take it back, please.

254
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,700
Just go wherever you want.

255
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,890
Aren’t you going?

256
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,900
I can’t.

257
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,710
You’re blocking my way.

258
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,410
Just admit you want to be alone with me.

259
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,760
(If someone didn’t stop me first, he’d get punched in the face.)

260
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,990
(Who would believe that?)

261
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,700
I have only one friend in this university. I’ve never met him though.

262
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,770
He told me he was from a faculty nearby,

263
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,450
so I call him ‘A Guy From Nearby Faculty.’

264
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,710
Seriously, how am I inferior to him?

265
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Why did Muang Nan go with him, not me?

266
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,800
Do you really want to know why?

267
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,430
You have a few problems.

268
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,680
What?

269
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,690
One, your glasses are too thick.

270
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,320
Two, your braces make you sound unclear when you talk.

271
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,990
Three, you’re not confident. You’re always round-shouldered.

272
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,380
Four, you get scared so easily.

273
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,670
Seventeen, you’re nerdy. You don’t have many friends.

274
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,550
Eightteen

275
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,790
when you lose your glasses, you’re completely blind.

276
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,880
Enough already!

277
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,230
Am I that bad?

278
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,070
You’re not that bad.

279
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,770
I’m about to say your strengths.

280
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,930
Stop it.

281
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,470
Don’t you give me a kiss after a kick.

282
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,100
You said I had a few problems.

283
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,610
A few, my ass! You went on to 120 problems.

284
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,540
I’m not talking to you anymore.

285
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,180
I have more than a hundred problems?

286
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,430
That’s painful.

287
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,660
(This is a story of Pi’s older brother who is full of crap.)
THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT - EP.1 LEECH UPON THE SKY

288
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,540
(Let’s see how his life goes.)

289
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,730
Duean!

290
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,370
Duean!

291
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,860
No matter where I go,

292
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,550
What are you ordering? Can we make that two?

293
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,070
this kid is there calling my name, always.

294
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,940
Duean, Duean, and Duean.

295
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Why didn’t you say you wanted noodles?

296
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,550
My friends told me they have many tasty dishes.

297
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,810
Duean this and Duean that. I’m losing my mind now.

298
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,500
When he’s hungry, he calls Duean.

299
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,630
Ah! You want some rice.

300
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,090
This shop serves nice food too.

301
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,200
They have Stir-Fried Basil, Noodles in Gravy Sauce, Stir-Fried Macaroni.

302
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,130
Whatever you want, make that two.

303
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,270
When he wants water, he calls Duean.

304
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,340
When he needs to pee, he calls Duean.

305
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,930
So you decided to have noodles?

306
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,900
What kind of noodles do you want?

307
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,840
Egg noodles.

308
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,410
Make that two!

309
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,850
Two, my ass!!

310
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,160
Stop calling me already!

311
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,220
I’m done here!

312
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,310
Where are you going?

313
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,130
A toilet!

314
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,320
Why don’t you come calling me when I poop?

315
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,410
Duean.

316
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,090
What?

317
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,610
I need toilet paper.

318
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,720
Here.

319
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,460
Come on, Duean. What can this little piece of paper do?

320
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,230
Can I have more?

321
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Take this. I hope it’s enough for you.

322
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,060
Since when do I have a kid?

323
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,000
Do you want to know who this leech is?

324
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,680
I don’t know what I did in my past life to deserve this.

325
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,110
He’s haunting me like a ghost.

326
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
(That’s just an appetizer.)

327
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,960
(Stay tuned for more next week.)

328
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,000
Hold on, you piece of crap!

329
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,860
I’m not done telling my story yet.

330
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,600
What’s the hurry, jackass?

331
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,140
Duean, who are you talking to?

332
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,830
Not you, that’s for sure.

333
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,920
I heard you talked.

334
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,080
I talked to myself.

335
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,180
You can talk to me, you know?

336
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,680
La la la la…

337
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,650
I don’t understand what you’re saying.

338
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,400
La la la la la la…

339
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,590
Do you want to see donkeys?

340
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,140
La la la la la la…

341
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,720
I barely survived today.

342
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,520
Hey,

343
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,340
Pi!

344
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,600
What’s wrong?

345
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,890
Nothing.

346
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,380
You look like you need to poop.

347
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,860
I’m fine. Just leave me alone.

348
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,440
You’re lying to my face.

349
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,490
You’re not going to tell me, are you?

350
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,130
I told you it’s nothing.

351
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,840
That’s it.

352
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,780
- Tell me or I’ll fart right in your face.
- Duean, stop it!

353
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,060
All right. I’m telling!

354
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,850
Okay.

355
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,300
Have you ever had a crush on someone?

356
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,520
I have,

357
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,340
every day.

358
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,330
Girls from our U are so cute.

359
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,270
And what?

360
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,340
How do you know if they’re single or taken?

361
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,500
You have a mouth, don’t you? Just ask.

362
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,050
How can a dental student be this dumb?

363
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,750
It has nothing to do with being a dental student.

364
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,270
But you’re right.

365
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,750
I’ll never know if I don’t ask.

366
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,230
But he will know how I feel if I do that.

367
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,380
That’s easy.

368
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,270
Just tell him that your friend wants to know.

369
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,370
But I don’t have any friends.

370
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,230
Aww! My poor little brother.

371
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,080
I’m gonna tell you this honestly.

372
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,700
It might hurt you badly though.

373
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,150
Look at yourself.

374
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,430
Thick glasses and messy hair.

375
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,740
You don’t speak clearly.

376
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,810
You dress way too neatly.

377
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,830
People like good-looking people.

378
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
If you never think of changing yourself,

379
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
don’t expect anyone to like you, bro.

380
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,280
But when you like someone, you like who they truly are.

381
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,240
Don’t be so optimistic.

382
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,710
Even you like good-looking people too.

383
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,470
They call it the first impression.

384
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,900
Okay. I can’t argue with that.

385
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,890
But when you love someone, you love what lies inside.

386
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,230
You will learn it yourself eventually, bro.

387
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,240
You won’t listen to what I have to say today.

388
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,640
What a waste of time!

389
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,790
Maybe Duean is right.

390
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,670
I’m not hot. That’s why Muang Nan doesn’t like me.

391
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,070
But I think I am hot.

392
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,650
[Muang Nan: See you at the same place, everyone.]

393
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,540
My chance is here.

394
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,620
I’m going to prove I'm right.

395
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,740
Take it back, kiddo.

396
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,560
You’ve come to the wrong place.

397
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,820
We sell liquor here, not butterbeer like in Harry Potter.

398
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I’m old enough. Just let me in.

399
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,130
You don’t fit in here. Trust me.

400
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,580
I’m going in.

401
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,180
Just go home.

402
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,680
He is my friend.

403
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,500
His looks might not say it but he’s a very cool guy.

404
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,050
Let’s get in, buddy.

405
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,550
First time here, isn’t it?

406
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,140
Get your arm off my shoulder.

407
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,380
Watch where you’re going.

408
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,330
Otherwise, you might get hurt.

409
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,480
Go wherever you want.

410
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,190
I’m not going.

411
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,400
I’ll stay here.

412
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
I know you came to see Muang Nan.

413
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,680
Why can’t I?

414
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,610
There’re plenty of people out there.

415
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,880
Why do you have to like the one I like?

416
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,130
Why do you think that I like Muang Nan?

417
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,800
No matter where I go, you are there.

418
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,840
If you don’t like him, why are you always with him then?

419
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,520
Well, if you want to see Nan, you have to see me too.

420
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,500
Piss off, Sutt!

421
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,860
You call my name very often.

422
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,330
You like me?

423
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:51,570
Pi,

424
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,430
you’re here too?

425
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,000
Nan.

426
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,360
You look great tonight.

427
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,500
What?

428
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
You look great tonight.

429
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,260
Thanks.

430
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,120
You look great too.

431
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,500
How about some pictures for your keepsakes?

432
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,650
Nosy!

433
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:18,950
Nan,

434
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,890
Pi wants pictures with you.

435
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,980
Mork, no. I’m too shy.

436
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,680
Why giving me your phone then?

437
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,360
Okay.

438
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,790
Let’s take some pictures.

439
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,750
1 2 3.

440
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,100
Lean on his shoulder.

441
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,460
Happy now?

442
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,920
Here. Done.

443
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,430
Can I tag you?

444
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,610
Go for it.

445
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,690
Why did you two come in together?

446
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,910
We met out front so I kind of brought him in.

447
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,150
You dress up nicely. I don’t usually see you in this look.

448
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,860
Team Rock Star, you know?

449
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,590
Have you eaten anything?

450
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,940
I have, a little.

451
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,040
Want to order anything else?

452
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,980
I’m okay for now.

453
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,600
What is the matter?

454
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,730
I’ll be right back.

455
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,940
Hey! Watch it, glasses!

456
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,150
Look where you’re going, not your phone.

457
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,140
How about I teach you a lesson?

458
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,090
I am so sorry.

459
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,450
Damn! Careful dude!

460
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,590
That’s hilarious.

461
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,410
You’re such a loser.

462
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,030
He’s so weak.

463
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,190
What’s happening here?

464
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,650
I warned you. You don’t belong here.

465
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,150
You can’t protect yourself.

466
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,760
Hey! Are you okay?

467
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,900
Get off me!

468
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,440
You wanted this.

469
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,710
Wait!

470
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,100
What did I do?

471
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,570
Are you here to make fun of me?

472
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,540
I haven’t done anything.

473
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,280
I know it’s your plan. You’re such a clever guy.

474
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,180
Are you happy making me look like a clown?

475
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,670
What are you talking about?

476
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,960
Don’t play dumb.

477
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,170
I know I’m a loser. I wear glasses and braces.

478
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,640
But you convinced Muang Nan to take pictures with me because you want people to look down on me.

479
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,610
People look down on you?

480
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,650
Who?

481
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,820
Wait!

482
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,890
Let go of me! Don’t make me feel more pathetic.

483
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,410
[How dare he stand next to you, Muang Nan?]
[Don’t be near him. He makes you look bad, Muang Nan.]

484
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,960
[Know your place, loser!]

485
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,740
How about some pictures for your keepsakes?

486
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,430
Pi wants to take pictures with you.

487
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,170
Happy?

488
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,790
Okay. 1 2 3!

489
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,520
Look at yourself.

490
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Thick glasses and messy hair.

491
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,930
You don’t speak clearly.

492
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,560
You dress way too neatly.

493
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,650
If you never think of changing yourself,

494
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,560
don’t expect anyone to like you, bro.

495
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,110
You don’t fit in here. Trust me.

496
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,800
Loser!

497
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,900
He’s hilarious.

498
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,720
Loser!

499
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,030
Pi’s brother should share his hotness and brains with him.

500
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,950
I can’t see any good things in him except his brother.

501
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,120
His bro is so hot.

502
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,420
Swimming at midnight?

503
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,460
Your mom taught you this is called swimming?

504
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,450
My mom is your mom.

505
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,500
Tell me who bullied you.

506
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,490
I’ll beat the crap out of him for you.

507
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,180
Duean,

508
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,510
I got what you said to me now.

509
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,500
Someone like me is unlikable.

510
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,420
I don’t want to look like crap anymore.

511
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,230
I want to change.

512
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,300
Let me help you with that.

513
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,370
Just delete it.

514
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,910
[Muang Nan: Don’t worry, Pi. You’re fine just the way you are.]

515
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,940
[A Guy From Nearby Faculty: Gone to bed? I heard it wasn’t your day.]

516
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,480
Read those comments, haven’t you?

517
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,950
That Sutthaya dude wanted to make fun of me.

518
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,230
I don’t think he meant to do that.

519
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,840
Are you taking his side?

520
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,430
No. I’m always on your side.

521
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,290
I asked because I was worried about you.

522
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,800
Are you okay?

523
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,330
I am not.

524
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,930
Not at all.

525
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,200
I’ve always been insulted.

526
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,490
Even you can name more than 100 flaws I have.

527
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,050
I am sorry.

528
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,070
I didn’t mean to look down on you.

529
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,190
I will not give in anymore.

530
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,270
I’ll make myself worthy enough to be with Muang Nan.

531
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,610
That was an accident.

532
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,930
But this is not.

533
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,370
I’m such a loser. I wear glasses and braces.

534
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,520
But you convinced Muang Nan to take pictures with me because you want people to look down on me.

535
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,190
Don’t make me feel more pathetic.

536
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,790
I am sorry, Pi.

537
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,370
Smells great.

538
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,780
The food looks so good just like the one who made it.

539
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,400
Sweet!

540
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:14,620
I just wanted to prepare the best meal when I’m not on duty.

541
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,800
But I don’t feel like eating rice soup today.

542
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,780
What do you feel like eating then?

543
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
Let’s see.

544
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,400
The thing is…

545
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,690
we already have Wan, Duean, and Pi.

546
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,650
How about we make Winatee too?

547
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,370
Nope!

548
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,210
They’re sleeping.

549
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,850
What if they wake up and see what we’re doing?

550
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,130
They’re sleeping.

551
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,530
Then we better hurry.

552
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,220
Stop playing.

553
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,260
Go sit.

554
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,170
Pi is here. Sit down already.

555
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,620
- Have breakfast with us.
- Have a seat.

556
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,270
You don’t have class today. Why got up so early?

557
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
I’m going out with Duean.

558
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,780
According to the latest report from The Meteorological Department,

559
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:15,080
a heatwave will soon hit and that makes the next few days the hottest days of the year.

560
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,590
The temperature can go up to 43 degrees celsius.

561
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,390
Take care of yourself and avoid heatstroke.

562
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,700
If you’re going out, bring an umbrella and water with you.

563
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,910
We do care about you.

564
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,350
Here is your water.

565
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,070
You heard her, right?

566
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,270
Grab an umbrella and a water bottle.

567
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,280
Okay.

568
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,410
That’s great. You should go out sometimes.

569
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,790
Don’t study too hard.

570
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,720
You all should go and leave us here alone.

571
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,400
Honey.

572
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,110
I mean you still have time to go out now. Just go.

573
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:52,280
After you graduate, the internship program will keep you busy, just like Wan.

574
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,710
You won’t have much free time then.

575
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:58,440
Speaking of Wan, will he be coming home this month?

576
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,420
He’s been very quiet lately. He hasn’t called in a long time.

577
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,310
Trust me. He’s in Hat Yai, and very much in love.

578
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,150
Nonsense.

579
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,730
Let me.

580
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,050
I’m off now.

581
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,630
Where are you going? Eat first.

582
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,590
No time.

583
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,240
I have to meet my friends at 8 for our report.

584
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,190
What about me?

585
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,320
Don’t worry. Just wait at the same spot.

586
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,030
I’ve told my guys about you.

587
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,180
They are the Kitty Gang.

588
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,120
Adorkable and cutesy.

589
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,830
Bye now.

590
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,580
What?

591
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,060
And what is adorkable and cutesy?

592
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,660
Teenage slangs.

593
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,130
He’s too busy being adorkable. He doesn’t even eat.

594
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,010
When will they be here?

595
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,860
Did Duean lie to me?

596
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,670
I think my brother just tricked me.

597
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,570
Why?

598
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,950
He said he would help me.

599
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,050
He bailed on me and said he’d send his friends.

600
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,740
The Kitty Gang, adorkable and cutesy.

601
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,680
I don't see any cute face here. They’re standing me up.

602
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,740
I’m so pissed.

603
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,030
If you’re that pissed, just stop being his brother.

604
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,870
Stop being friends with you is much easier.

605
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,450
Are you serious?

606
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:53,930
Of course, I am.

607
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,270
I mean do you want to stop being friends with me?

608
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,550
Are you scared of not being my friend?

609
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,030
No.

610
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,270
Can I ask you something?

611
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,010
What?

612
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,750
If you make a friend mad, how do you make up?

613
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,090
There’re many ways, kid.

614
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,750
One,

615
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,650
write a letter.

616
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,940
Two, play your friend a song.

617
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,780
Three, go to your friend’s house and beg on your knee until you’re forgiven.

618
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,670
Or beg in the rain.

619
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,770
Four, follow your friend around until he or she agrees to speak with you.

620
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,960
Five…

621
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,610
Stop right there.

622
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,430
Your ways are so out of date.

623
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,150
Can I get a serious answer?

624
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,650
A real one.

625
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,880
Is that person really a friend?

626
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,150
Yes.

627
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,550
You sound so serious. Not just a friend, I guess.

628
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,110
Let’s get serious.

629
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,670
Have you apologized to this friend of yours?

630
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:00,950
Not yet.

631
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,800
What are you waiting for?

632
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,520
If you guys are really friends, just say it.

633
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,990
We have to become friends again in order to do that.

634
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,270
You're so worried. Clearly, you guys aren't just friends.

635
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,130
That’s it?

636
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,210
Iced-chocolate, double shot, please.

637
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,100
Why do I have to see you here?

638
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,710
What a horrible coincidence!

639
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,950
It’s not a coincidence.

640
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,750
I came to see you.

641
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,270
I…

642
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,080
I’m sorry about last night.

643
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,200
Don’t say it.

644
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,760
I just wanted you to have pictures with Nan.

645
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,660
- I didn’t want you to get those awful comments.
- Stop it.

646
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,390
I really didn’t mean to.

647
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,780
What can I do to earn your forgiveness?

648
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,030
You don’t need to do anything.

649
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,740
Don’t talk. Don’t move. Don’t breathe.

650
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,730
Are you literally doing it?
