1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,320
They say you have to come to this lab at midnight to make a wish.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,440
Who’s there?

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,110
Shit!

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,880
Go!

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,600
Run!

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,320
I’ll stop being mad at you.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,340
But that doesn’t mean we’re friends.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,710
That’s good enough for me.

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,350
About the date you asked me yesterday,

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,750
I’ve changed my mind.

11
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,960
I like you, Muang Nan.

12
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,590
I’ve liked you for so long.

13
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,850
But I could never bring myself to tell you.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,850
My sweet...

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,660
...first kiss.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,650
Pi, you dipshit!

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,490
What did you do last night?

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,830
Last night?

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,290
I did what you told me to do.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,040
What did I tell you?

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,720
You said if there was a sign, I could go ahead and kiss him.

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,930
I kissed Muang Nan.

23
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,530
Muang Nan, my ass!

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,720
Look!

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,760
Is this Muang Nan?

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,320
Shit!

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,160
How did Nan turn into this Sutthaya dude?

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,520
How did it happen? How did it happen?!

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,020
Let’s go somewhere else.

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,510
Pi, are you okay?

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,300
Yes, thank you.

32
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,830
Let’s go.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,000
No!

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,770
No!!

35
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,670
My first kiss!!

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,890
I’ve had eyes for you for so long.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,920
And I’ve changed myself just for you.

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,950
I like you very much!

39
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,430
You will get a signal.

40
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,390
(Here comes the signal, Duean.)

41
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,260
And when there’s a signal, go ahead and kiss him.

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,390
What’s going on with you?

43
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,640
Are you drunk?

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,430
They even give us a hashtag.

45
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,360
No!

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,640
Who did this?

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,720
Who did this?!

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
EP.4 - BUILDING A SHIP

♪ We will give this ship everything we have ♪

54
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,510
PluemChimon?

55
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,360
EarthMix?

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,330
Hello there.

57
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,340
Still incorrect.

58
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,640

60
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,360
We’ve finally and successfully built this ship.

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,760
Let’s post their new photo.

62
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,420
Write a good caption.

63
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,330
Got it!

64
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,220
My turn.

65
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,450
Are you seeing what I’m seeing?

66
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,460
Yep.

67
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,570
This way.

68
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,700
I’m seeing it too.

69
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,110
This is how their love begins.

70
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,470
Do you see the way Pi looks at Mork?

71
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,610
Their eyes are obviously full of love.

72
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,410
Hey!

73
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,480
Are you all right?

74
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,510
I’m feeling faint.

75
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,250
It’s very hot today.

76
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,680
I think you’re having heatstroke.

77
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,110
Really?

78
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,150
What should I do?

79
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,130
No worries.

80
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,790
I will give you first aid.

81
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,680
I trust you.

82
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,850
Damn! Picturing it just makes me want to puke.

83
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,770
[Pi’s eyes are full of love!]

84
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,430
Love, my ass!

85
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,920
I was dying there.

86
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Let’s post a new set of photos.

87
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,920
Go!

88
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,630
How did you find me?

89
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,780
My heart led the way.

90
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
We will always light up each other.

91
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,670
#MorkPi. #MorkPi.

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,930
Wow!

93
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,790
We have a lot of retweets.

94
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,790
It’s trending no.1 in Thailand!

95
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,930
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: I heard you kissed Sutthaya last night.)

96
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,470
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: When did you fall for him though?)

97
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,110
I didn’t fall for him.

98
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,230
I wanted to kiss Muang Nan. I kissed the wrong guy.

99
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,770
Are you sure?

100
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,700
Didn’t you want to do that?

101
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,120
Quit bugging me.

102
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,760
Did he kiss you back?

103
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,650
Why do you want to know?

104
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,400
Did he kiss you back?

105
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,880
Of course, he didn’t.

106
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,180
He doesn’t like me. He likes Muang nan.

107
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,250
How do you know that?

108
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,620
I can see it in his eyes.

109
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,070
Try to open your eyes for something else.

110
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,070
You might know something more.

111
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,860
Something more?

112
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,200
What?

113
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,880
Why aren’t you answering?

114
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,620
What is it?

115
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,840
Why are you not responding?

116
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,880
Silence going once.

117
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,470
Silence going twice.

118
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,370
Pi.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,370
Nan!

120
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,030
You just walked in at the right time.

121
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,060
How long have you stood there?

122
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,520
A while.

123
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,350
I saw you brushed your teeth so many times.

124
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
Is there something wrong?

125
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,330
No. Nothing is wrong.

126
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,130
I just…

127
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,430
...like to brush my teeth.

128
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,350
Don’t take this the wrong way.

129
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,090
I know you’re a dental student

130
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,770
and you like to have nice and clean teeth.

131
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,190
But this toothbrush can work just fine with a gentle brushing.

132
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,770
I know.

133
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,350
I don’t usually brush my teeth this hard.

134
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,540
Pi,

135
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,400
you’re so famous because of what happened last night.

136
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,120
It was just a misunderstanding.

137
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,410
Don’t listen to people.

138
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,780
I didn’t mean to kiss Mork. It was just an accident.

139
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,890
I…

140
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,150
Pi, relax.

141
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,210
You don’t have to talk so fast.

142
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,010
What I wanted to say was don’t listen to other people.

143
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,190
They’re making things up.

144
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,220
If you want to know anything, ask me.

145
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,810
I can tell you the truth.

146
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,490
Very cute.

147
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,010
Huh?

148
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
I meant that fish.

149
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,760
Where did you get it from? I’ve never seen one.

150
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,810
Can I see?

151
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
If you like it, you can have it.

152
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,090
It’s yours.

153
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,730
You’re not serious, right?

154
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,600
We can’t share the toothbrush.

155
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,830
That’s right.

156
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,980
So…

157
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,190
May I?

158
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,780
Sorry.

159
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,850
Thank you.

160
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,780
Now people can easily tell that this is mine.

161
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,160
I should get going.

162
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,080
I won’t bother your teeth brushing time anymore.

163
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,210
You didn’t bother me at all.

164
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,240
Bye.

165
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,370
He didn’t reject my gift.

166
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,580
That means he isn’t mad that I kissed Sutthaya.

167
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,440
That’s very nice of you, Muang Nan.

168
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,630
Awesome!

169
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,620
Pattawee, you’ve done it!

170
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,640
Done what?

171
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,590
Are you having a fistfight with someone?

172
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,960
Don’t butt in!

173
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,380
Why are you always moody when I’m around?

174
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,060
1 2 3…

175
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,160
4 5 6…

176
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,910
Bye.

177
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,160
Do you want a problem?

178
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,680
I don’t like to see anything unclean.

179
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,650
Why do you like to bug me so bad?

180
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,910
Why?

181
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,080
Are you afraid you can’t restrain yourself…

182
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,110
and kiss me just like last night?

183
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,760
Who are you two?

184
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,610
My name is Kluea Kang.

185
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
My name is Prik Pao.

187

192
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,280
So cute!

193
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,570
What MorkPi?

194
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,440
What moments?

195
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,620
Don’t feign innocence.

196
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,450
I know you’re shy.

197
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,510
He needs to see the evidence.

198
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,780
Here it is.

199
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,170
What are you doing?

200
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,030
You have a little something here.

201
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,160
Is it sweet?

202
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,100
Want to taste it?

203
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,590
Are you asking me out on a date?

204
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,190
Let’s fix your collar before we go.

205
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,740
You’re so caring.

206
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,170
I bet you love me already.

207
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,980
Right?

208
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,200
What you’re doing is so hubby & wifey!

209
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,220
Move aside. Our ship is sailing.

210
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,820
So it’s you guys.

211
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,490
Take it easy!

212
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,250
Let’s capture this moment.

213
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,480
Follow him, KK.

214
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,580
We’ll be back for you, Mork.

215
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,180
Pi!

216
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,710
Are you sure Pi is here?

217
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,400
I am.

218
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,480
But where is he now?

219
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,160
(What the heck is going on?)

220
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,180
(Why are people shipping me with Mork?)

221
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,890
(I don’t want him. I want Muang Nan!)

222
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,600
(I can’t let them ruin my first love.)

223
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,870
(Hold on! Why isn’t Mork frustrated about this at all?)

224
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,350
(Why isn’t he mad?)

225
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,720
It’s time to take out some trash.

226
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,290
(Don’t!)

227
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,890
(Don’t dump me with the trash.)

228
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,450
(Did you think I was in that black bag?)

229
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,890
(You’re wrong, hehe.)

230
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,060
Are you free this Saturday?

231
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,600
(That’s Muang Nan’s voice.)

232
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,390
I am.

233
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,320
(He’s with Mork, that asshole.)

234
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,710
Wanna go see a movie?

235
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,460
Sure.

236
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,600
(Why are you asking him, Nan?)

237
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,240
(And you said yes too quickly, Mork.)

238
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,470
(That’s your game, huh?)

239
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,000
(Let me call my adorkable and cutesy backup.)

240
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,740
(You’re so dead!)

241
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,180
That guy is so dead.

242
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,910
How dare he bullied our brother?

243
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,830
Where is that snobbish?

244
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,580
Where is he hiding?

245
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,730
If we find him, beat him up badly.

246
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,870
That’s right.

247
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,200
(Guys, calm down!)

248
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,770
I will kick his ass!

249
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,090
(Damn it! I am in here, guys.)

250
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,060
(I should just get out of here.)

251
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,840
Time to post a new photo.

252
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,400
Let me see.

253
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,090
Eyes locked. Heaven and Earth can’t tear us apart.

254
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,950
They love each other so much!

255
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,220
What do you think?

256
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,630
Perfect.

257
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,630
Just upload already.

258
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,520
Awesome! This pic is epic!

259
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,290
(I can’t get out.)

260
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,570
(They can’t see me now.)

261
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,570
This is our chance.

262
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,820
If we find them first, we see their moments first.

263
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
I must build MorkPi fandom bigger and bigger.

264
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,130
This has always been my dream.

265
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,650
I’ve always wanted to be an admin of a fandom page.

266
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,490
MorkPi fandom is going to be a hit!

267
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,920
A big hit!

268
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,980
Let’s go find him.

269
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,880
Let’s go.

270
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,580
(Ouch!)

271
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,430
(What did I do to deserve this?)

272
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,150
(What did this box ever do to you guys?)

273
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,630
(What are you kicking it for?)

274
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT
EP.4 - LEFT OR RIGHT

275
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,450
My eye is twitching.

276
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,680
Right eye twitching means bad, but left eye twitching means good.

277
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,350
Duean,

278
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,400
why are you talking to yourself?

279
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,220
You went out of class without waiting for me again.

280
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,490
Why did I need to wait for you?

281
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,850
I am hungry.

282
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,630
What’s wrong now?

283
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,320
Look at these stir-fried vegetables.

284
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,960
It’s very oily.

285
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,740
I think they put too much oil in it.

286
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,990
You’re such a picky guy.

287
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,160
Can’t you eat it?

288
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,660
I can.

289
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,320
Poor soul.

290
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,920
Take this. I’m sure you’ll love it.

291
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,970
Did you buy it for me?

292
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,330
Yeah! Obviously!

293
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,320
Thank you, Duean.

294
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,970
By the way, the professor assigned a group project

295
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,070
after you walked out of class.

296
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,240
So I just decided to include you in my group.

297
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,020
Who else is in this group?

298
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,450
Just you and me.

299
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
I’m so happy I get to work with you again.

300
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
(The two of us working together?)

301
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
That’s what you call ‘my group?’

302
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,870
Let’s do this.

303
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,250
Just choose a simple project.

304
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,300
Don’t make me work too much.

305
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,380
Don’t go too far.

306
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,310
I am lazy.

307
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,090
My project proposal was very easy.

308
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,400
It’s to educate people about dengue fever.

309
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
That is easy?

310
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,010
It doesn’t require a lot of work, does it?

311
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,520
Not at all.

312
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,170
I am thinking of educating only 50 villagers.

313
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,010
50?

314
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,600
But we don’t have to go too far, do we?

315
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,460
Not far.

316
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,820
The village is in Nakhon Nayok province.

317
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,820
Damn it!

318
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,680
It requires so much work and travelling.

319
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,540
Why didn’t you ask me first?

320
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,130
You already left the class.

321
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,570
And the professor wanted to hear some idea so I went ahead with what came up.

322
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,770
Was I so wrong to do that?

323
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,010
(Going soft on him again, aren’t you?)

324
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,800
(Oh look! Your expression says it all.)

325
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,730
Don’t be so dramatic.

326
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,120
You’re making my heart so weak.

327
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,770
I’m glad that you aren’t mad at me.

328
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,650
By the way,

329
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,740
the professor said there’s a fifth-year student in our class.

330
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,650
This class is very very easy.

331
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,960
I just can’t imagine how the senior got flunked.

332
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,670
(Right! That’s me.)

333
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,000
Exactly. That guy is so stupid.

334
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,400
I feel sorry for his mother and father for having such a dumb kid.

335
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,030
They shouldn't have sent him to school at all.

336
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,570
He’s so dumb.

337
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,950
Right, which Faculty are you in though?

338
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,810
You never told me.

339
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,170
(What am I going to do now? I’m screwed!)

340
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,430
(Wow! A cute girl with a bright and beautiful smile.)

341
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,590
(I have an idea!)

342
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,900
Dentistry.

343
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,390
You’re a dental student?

344
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,950
I might not look like it but I’m smart.

345
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,470
Okay.

346
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,650
I need your full name.

347
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,600
The professor needs to know the group members’ names.

348
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,030
Don’t bother.

349
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,870
I can do that.

350
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,200
You’ve done a lot. I bet you’re tired.

351
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,610
(If he finds out that I’m a super senior, I’m sure he won’t stop teasing me.)

352
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Phi Duean, we need to talk to you.

353
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,030
Why are they calling you Phi?

354
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,040
Are they younger than you?

355
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,160
No!

356
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,150
These are all my friends.

357
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,730
Right?

358
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,280
What’s wrong with your eyes?

359
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,350
Will you play along, asshole?

360
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,870
Am I right?

361
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,550
We’re friends.

362
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,540
(The story of a fifth-year student ends here.)

363
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,750
Hey! Don’t end it just yet.

364
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,230
I have just one scene here.

365
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,460
Can I have more airtime?

366
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,250
(Alright! I will give you more time.)

367
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,140
That’s great.

368
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,410
Pi got beaten up so badly.

369
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,590
Who did that to my brother?

370
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,520
Let’s go check on him.

371
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,080
My little bro!

372
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,010
THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT EP.4 IS OVER

373
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
Who did this to you, Pi?

374
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,890
I’ll beat him up.

375
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,850
If I can’t make him pay, don’t call me a man.

376
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,460
Who could be so dumb to do this to you?

377
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,350
Tell us and we will finish him for you.

378
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,790
It’s the four of you.

379
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,670
You guys just kept kicking that box.

380
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,530
I was in there.

381
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,610
Do you remember now?

382
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,450
Do you remember now?

383
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,750
Do I still need to finish them?

384
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,250
Hey!

385
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,850
Just let them go.

386
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,160
That’s one way to make merit.

387
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,900
Think about it.

388
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,440
Oh, right!

389
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,220
Whatever you want, just tell me, Pi.

390
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,130
If you want snacks, let me know.

391
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,530
He knows all about food.

392
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Why did you hide in that box anyway?

393
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,670
Some people were trying to get pictures of me.

394
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,010
I want to be shipped with Muang Nan.

395
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,910
Not that dude.

396
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,770
Why didn’t you say you and that dude weren’t dating?

397
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,420
My words alone aren’t very convincing.
He has to confirm that too.

398
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,370
And why doesn’t that dude deny the rumor though?

399
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,180
Exactly!

400
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,540
I’m the one trying here.

401
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,300
That asshole is so cool about it.

402
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,930
Maybe…

403
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,020
He likes you.

404
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,280
No way.

405
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,700
We’re rivals.

406
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,450
Maybe he doesn’t care because he’s about to get rid of his biggest rival.

407
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,780
How come?

408
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,850
What are you talking about? I’m not following.

409
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,290
Think about it.

410
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,240
The picture of Pi kissing him is all over the internet.

411
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,500
People must be thinking Pi already has a boyfriend.

412
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,960
But we hate each other.

413
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,650
That’s how he takes revenge on someone he hates.

414
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,580
Picture this.

415
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,610
This is you. You’re now hot and popular.

416
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,890
This is Muang Nan.

417
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,180
The new you can get Muang Nan very easily.

418
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,170
Mork can’t let it happen.

419
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,340
So he approaches you instead and lets people think you and him are a thing.

420
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,200
This way you will never get Muang Nan.

421
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,700
Got it?

422
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,210
I’m so clever, aren’t I?

423
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,760
But that blocks him from going after Muang Nan too.

424
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,810
That’s right.

425
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,170
Sorry.

426
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,620
Whatever.

427
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,460
Muang Nan asked him out for a movie.

428
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,230
What am I gonna do?

429
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,910
Find a chance to be alone with Muang Nan

430
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,210
and confess to him.

431
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,290
I have an idea!

432
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,380
I have an idea!

433
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,650
I have a plan.

434
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,370
You got a plan again?

435
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,580
Trust me. It must work this time.

436
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,530
Look at you!

437
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,600
Who would want to eat it now after seeing you do that?

438
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,820
You just smacked a smart brain.

439
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,730
Are you sure they will come to this cinema?

440
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,010
Of course.

441
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,810
When will they come?

442
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,310
No idea.

443
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,970
You, dumbass!

444
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,560
I thought you knew that.

445
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,890
Why do you always yell at me?

446
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,030
Just yell back, Pi. Don’t be scared.

447
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,330
Do that. I’ll beat you up.

448
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:47,880
Bring it on.

449
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,590
Hold on.

450
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,730
You said you weren’t free today.

451
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,590
I did?

452
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,940
I guess I’m too early.

453
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,530
I’ll just read while waiting then.

454
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,550
I am free.

455
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,790
Guys, here’s the plan.

456
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,630
Sit down.

457
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,650
You four stand by at the parking lot.

458
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,480
Then drive and try to block Mork’s car.

459
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,460
Mork will get out of his car to talk to you.

460
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,910
Then you guys must pretend to fight each other.

461
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,360
Mork will get caught in the crossfire.

462
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,870
That’s right, Koh!

463
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,510
Pi, you’re a hero in this situation.

464
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,670
Show up there and take Muang Nan away from the chaos.

465
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,670
Bye, Mork.

466
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,860
How does that sound?

467
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,050
My bro is so cool.

468
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,350
Muang Nan, please don’t leave me.

469
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,850
No one wants to listen to that, asshole.

470
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,680
Nan.

471
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,810
Nan.

472
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,120
No!

473
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,930
Awesome!

474
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,410
How is my plan?

475
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,030
Do we really need to punch him?

476
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,220
Are you worried about your enemy?

477
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,330
Do you like him?

478
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,380
Of course, I don’t.

479
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,030
I just don’t want to get in trouble.

480
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,430
You won’t be in trouble.

481
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,830
And we only have one car.

482
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,370
Where is the other car from?

483
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,810
I rented one for you.

484
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,520
You are so thoughtful.

485
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,140
With your money.

486
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,660
I used your card.

487
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,410
What the heck?

488
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,420
Well, I don’t have money.

489
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,700
He’s here.

490
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,970
We will go stand by.

491
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,210
Come on. Let’s go.

492
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,830
Pi, let me know when the movie is over.

493
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,840
We need to plan the timing.

494
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,750
Go!

495
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,770
Are you following me?

496
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:41,990
No.

497
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,520
I’m just chilling around here.

498
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,930
Ah!

499
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,690
I thought you wanted to see this movie too.

500
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,400
I bought an extra ticket for you.

501
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,270
It’s a no then?

502
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,550
Don’t.

503
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,230
Give it to me.

504
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,330
Mork, give it up.

505
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,980
I want it.

506
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,110
Pi.

507
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,650
You’re here too?

508
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,890
What brings you here?

509
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,680
Don’t tell me you asked him to see a movie too, Mork.

510
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,330
No.

511
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,260
I feel like watching a movie today.

512
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,330
So here I am.

513
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,530
Which one are you watching?

514
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,350
The one we’re watching.

515
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,200
I bought us all tickets.

516
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,500
Should we go get popcorn and drinks?

517
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,610
Sure. Let’s go.

518
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,110
Nan, you want some popcorn?

519
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,470
A family member is calling.

520
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,450
I’ll be right back.

521
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,950
Okay.

522
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,970
Why are you sitting here?

523
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,860
It’s Muang Nan’s seat.

524
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,260
Because I want to.

525
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,020
But I don’t.

526
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,780
Scoot over.

527
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,630
Relax. It’s fine.

528
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,620
Move.

529
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,950
Hey!

530
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,340
Scoot over!

531
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,620
Fine. You stay.

532
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,950
I will go.

533
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,870
I will wait for Muang Nan out front.

534
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,530
Where are you going?

535
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,550
Stay still, will you?

536
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,300
You’re bothering people behind us.

537
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,750
Please be quiet.

538
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,370
Let go of me.

539
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,830
Get your hands off my head.

540
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,040
That’s how you want it?

541
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,960
You can’t blame me.

542
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,810
You told me not to use my hands.

543
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,610
(Mork, you are such an ass.)

544
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,380
(You just love to make me tremble.)

545
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,950
(Pi!! You can't tremble.)

546
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,980
Pi.
(Just don’t!)

547
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,880
Pi.

548
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,590
Yes?

549
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,490
What is it?

550
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,160
I was going to ask if the movie was fun.

551
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,790
But you hurried out here before I did.

552
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,850
It was fun. Why?

553
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,430
Just curious.

554
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,830
(Try to focus, Pi.)

555
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,380
(You need to separate Muang Nan and Mork.)

556
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,590
Are you guys going home?

557
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,150
I think so.

558
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,100
We’re planning to read together.

559
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,410
I think we say goodbye here then.

560
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,710
See you.

561
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,470
Bye, Muang Nan.

562
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,830
Why is he running?

563
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,170
I guess I’m making him blush.

564
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,200
Nothing else.

565
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,280
Go easy on him, will you?

566
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,270
I know.

567
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,890
Come on. Let’s go.

568
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,660
Hello, Duean.

569
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,190
Our target is out now.

570
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,690
Tell everyone to get ready.

571
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,970
Roger that.

572
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,270
Wait! Who’s calling?

573
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,240
What’s up?

574
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,330
You forgot our work appointment.

575
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,370
Isn’t it tomorrow?

576
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,840
It’s today.

577
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,990
You’re so careless.

578
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,220
If you fail and have to enroll again,

579
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,730
just don’t say I didn’t warn you.

580
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,260
You don’t have to threaten me like that.

581
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,340
Koh, take charge.

582
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,290
Damn it! I’m so screwed.

583
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,370
I forget him again.

584
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,650
Bye now.

585
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,850
Duean, it’s been 3 hours.

586
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,100
You always forget my appointments.

587
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,670
A kitten.

588
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,360
Here they are.

589
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,770
James, they’re here.

590
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,780
Sure.

591
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,880
What role?

592
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,800
Why did you do that?

593
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,810
Do you see? They’re laughing at me.

594
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,520
It’s your fault!

595
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
You did it!

596
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,860
Shit!

597
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,500
Oh, no!

598
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,860
My friend here is such a terrible driver. I’m sorry.

599
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,230
Why didn’t you just drive yourself then?

600
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,290
Shit! The plan is screwed.

601
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,730
Whatever. I’m just gonna go with the flow.

602
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,770
What is happening?

603
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,930
They hit our car.

604
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,360
Woah! Look at your car, Mork.

605
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,100
Well, I happened to drive here.

606
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,130
I can drive you home, Muang Nan.

607
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,070
Ah! Happened to drive here?

608
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,980
Right! You stay and clear things out.

609
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,030
Muang Nan can come with me.

610
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,700
It’s not my car.

611
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,280
Whose car is it?

612
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,140
Muang Nan’s.

613
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,290
- What?
- What?

614
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
(Shit! My freakin’ plan!!)

615
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,500
Okay.

616
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,720
I’ll call an insurance company.

617
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,160
You can go home, Mork.

618
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,350
That’s okay.

619
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,440
Though this isn’t my fault, I will stay here with you.

620
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
But you’re having dinner with your family.

621
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,810
Don’t keep them waiting.

622
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,160
It’s fine.

623
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,510
I’ll let them know.

624
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,550
I’m not leaving you alone here.

625
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,910
I can keep you company, Nan.

626
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,320
No worries.

627
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,940
I’ll be fine on my own.

628
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
But if you really want to help,

629
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,660
you can take Mork home for me.

630
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,570
My place. Go!

631
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,930
THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT EP.4 (CONTINUED)

632
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,960
Meen! Where are you?

633
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,930
- Duean!
- Meen!

634
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,480
- Where are you?
- Duean!

635
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,040
Meen! Where are you?

636
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,650
I’m up here.

637
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,320
Shit!

638
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,720
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.4 is really over.)

639
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,430
Damn it! What are you doing, Mork?

640
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,840
No pictures. Give it to me.

641
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,130
Nope. you can’t have it.

642
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,560
Why are you doing this?

643
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,010
Muang Nan can get the wrong idea.

644
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
Mork, no!

645
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,250
Stop it already.

646
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,480
You have been doing this all day.

647
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,870
Doing what?

648
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,730
Why do you want my forgiveness so badly?

649
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,130
Because I want to be your friend.

650
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,060
And I’ll make you want that too.

651
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,850
I’ll stop being mad at you.

652
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,710
But this doesn’t mean we’re friends.

653
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,950
That’s good enough for me.

654
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,040
Thanks.

655
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,480
Stop messing with me.

656
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,440
You want to set me and Muang Nan apart, don’t you?

657
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,690
I’m not messing with you.

658
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,670
I did everything

659
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,840
because I like you.

660
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,140
What did you say?

661
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
I said…

662
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,340
I really like you.

663
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,580
If you are not ready to open up your heart,

664
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,900
we can start by being friends.

665
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,000
Whose phone is this?

666
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,240
Why are you here?

667
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,440
Give it to me.

668
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,130
Don’t make me force it out of you.

669
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,500
Stop playing around.

670
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,260
Don’t you know what people are saying about you and me?

671
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,630
I presented the project plan to the professor.

672
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,270
All we need to do now is go to the location.

673
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,240
I can’t sleep.

674
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,520
Can you give me a head rub?

675
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,290
Your cheeks are very soft.

676
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,430
How come your heart is so stony?

677
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,360
I’ll open my heart for Muang Nan only.
