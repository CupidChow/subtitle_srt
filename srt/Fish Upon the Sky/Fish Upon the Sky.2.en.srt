1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,090
Have you ever had a crush on someone?

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,550
Going home? Let me walk you to the bus stop.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,260
Shit! So this is how love at first sight feels like.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,340
I know you came here to see Muang Nan.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,030
Why can’t I?

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,110
Do you want a problem?

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,930
There’re plenty of people out there.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,500
Why do you have to like the one I like?

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,920
If you want to see Nan, you have to see me too.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Pi wants to take pictures with you.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,090
Can I tag you?

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,800
I wear glasses and braces.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,750
Yet you convinced Muang Nan to take pictures with me because you want people to look down on me.

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,620
If you never think of changing yourself,

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,850
don’t expect anyone to like you, bro.

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,460
I want to change.

17
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,050
I really didn’t mean to.

18
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,420
What can I do to earn your forgiveness?

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,650
You don’t need to do anything.

20
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,320
Don’t talk. Don’t move. Don’t breathe.

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,990
Are you literally doing it?

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,940
If that’s all you can do, then you’re not forgiven.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,250
Ah!

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,790
You want me to lose my breath so you can give me artificial respiration, right?

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,380
Are you out of your mind?

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,120
Who would want to give you AR?

27
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,850
Double Shot Iced Chocolate is ready.

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,860
Thanks.

29
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,850
Here. It’s on me.

30
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,470
I don’t want it.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,820
Just take it.

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,600
It’s Double Shot Iced Chocolate.

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,860
I don’t like it.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,570
Really?

35
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,620
But you just ordered one.

36
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,010
Just take it.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,060
This is to say sorry for making you mad last night.

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,250
We can be friends.

39
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:15,990
Yes?

40
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,760
No.

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,540
I don’t forgive you.

42
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,430
And I don’t even want to be your friend.

43
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,260
Duean, hurry up.

44
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,330
I've been waiting for so long.

45
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,810
Stop rushing me, will you? I’m almost there.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,150
Let me take a leak first.

47
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,020
Damn it! He even haunted me in my dreams.

48
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,050
3 HOURS AGO

49
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,390
What the heck?

50
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,830
[Duean]

51
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,340
[Duean!]

52
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,020
[Duean!!]

53
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,880
[Duean!!!]

54
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Are you afraid of forgetting my name or something?

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,910
[Duean, answer me too. Don’t just read.]

56
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,000
I’m not answering. What are you gonna do?

57
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,230
[You’re mean! Talk to me, please.]

58
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,990
[If you don’t, I’ll go right to your place.]

59
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,000
Find me if you can, you dumbass!

60
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,460
THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT - EP.2 HAUNTED DREAMS

61
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,960
Duean,

62
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,730
can I take a shower with you?

63
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,660
Shit!

64
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,890
Let me scrub your back.

65
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,330
Shit!

66
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,510
No!!

67
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,870
That was a dream?

68
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,550
Lucky me.

69
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,580
Damn it!

70
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,290
Will the dream become real?

71
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,650
No, Duean. You’re overthinking it.

72
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,960
Holy shit!

73
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,240
[Duean]

74
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,200
[Duean!]

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,540
[Duean!!!]

76
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,300
[Duean, answer me too. Don’t just read.]

77
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,230
I am about to answer you here.

78
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,590
[You’re mean! Talk to me, please.]

79
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,600
[If you don’t, I’ll go right to your place.]

80
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,030
Damn! Exactly like in my dreams.

81
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
[Wow! It took you so long to respond.]

82
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,680
I’m busy taking a poop.

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,420
Are you lying?

84
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,350
I am not.

85
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,760
I really am pooping. Can you see?

86
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,600
You don’t have to show me. I believe you now.

87
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,010
Why are you calling me anyway?

88
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,810
We need to do a group report today.

89
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,910
Seriously?

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,050
You’re giving me hallucinations.

91
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,120
EP.2 - THE KITTY GANG AND PI, THE GUY ON FIRE

92
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,380
I totally got ditched.

93
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,010
(Finally, the savage lads with such a conversely cute gang name show up.)

94
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,830
(The first member is a liquor man. Wherever he goes, trouble follows.)

95
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,770
You think you’re cool, huh?

96
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,280
Do you?

97
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,420
KOH
(He’s a super hot-headed man.)

98
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:03,210
(The second member, a Gangnam oppa who is such a sweet talker and girl magnet.)

99
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,790
YOK
(His hotness is such a trouble.)

100
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,790
Keep looking at me like that and I’ll kiss till you drop.

101
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,200
You want my kiss?

102
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,020
Cut! Don’t kiss my camera.

103
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,930
I’m sorry.

104
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,070
You just blurred my lens.

105
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,170
JEANS
(Jeans, the guy who wants to be a star but has no luck with that.)

106
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,750
(James, a true gamer and comic book reader)

107
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,970
(He doesn’t talk very much. Sometimes people think he’s mute.)

108
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,900
JAMES

109
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,580
Damn! I’m reading manga or what?

110
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,320
Are they the human version of Jojo?

111
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
We’re here to transform you.

112
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,440
Your outfit is so old-fashioned.

113
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,020
Take it off.

114
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,970
Let’s try minimal.

115
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,990
Not so different.

116
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,860
Boring. Let’s try a two-toned long sleeve shirt.

117
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,420
You guys move!

118
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,520
Make room for the God of Fashion like me.

119
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
How about a jean jacket?

120
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,760
Nice!

121
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,720
Let’s put on some more items.

122
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,670
I don’t want the glasses.

123
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,130
A hat is nice.

124
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,060
I mean an item inside the jacket.

125
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,740
You didn’t say it clearly.

126
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,490
Move away. I’ll make him look cool.

127
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,230
Aren’t you going to change his hair?

128
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,180
Right. He looks like Luffy diving deep underwater.

129
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,460
He’s looking great. Trust me.

130
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,070
Hold on, guys. Lisa is calling me.

131
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,010
Hi Lisa. We have a date today? For real?

132
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,130
Just don’t let your bangs down today. I don’t like it.

133
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,000
Let me tell my friends.

134
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,340
Guys, please continue. I’m gonna go tease Lisa about her bangs.

135
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,100
Get rid of the wig.

136
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,430
The hat and glasses too.

137
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,930
No sandals, please.

138
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,750
Make him look cool!

139
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,600
Wow! How literal!

140
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,500
No!! That’s not the ‘cool’ that I meant.

141
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,090
Do you want a problem with me?

142
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,310
That’s the right look, man!

143
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,860
Get his hair up.

144
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,650
Cool!

145
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,850
Damn it! We need to remove the braces.

146
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,540
What are you smiling at, troublemaker?

147
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,850
Yok left us for a girl. Damn him!

148
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,500
For him, girls come before friends.

149
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,050
You’re totally right.

150
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,680
I’d do the same if I were him.

151
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,070
Yeah? Don’t crawl back crying when you got dumped.

152
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,650
I’d beat you up and make you suffer even more.

153
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,180
Super savage.

154
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,340
How much longer do we need to wait?

155
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,650
Just a moment, please.

156
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,380
I’m out of here!

157
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Sit back down. Be still.

158
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,150
Are you running away? What a chicken!

159
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,850
Loser!

160
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,880
What a brat!

161
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,680
His mom is here!

162
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,090
Wansuk, please proceed to room no.3.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Watch and learn from me, kiddo.

164
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,190
Hey! Sit down.

165
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,220
That kid is braver than you.

166
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,290
You can’t go. We must remove the braces.

167
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,100
Sit and be still.

168
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Mr. Pattawee, proceed to room no.2, please.

169
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,280
Get up. Quickly.

170
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,000
Let’s just carry him inside.

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,400
No!

172
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,190
No!!

173
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,100
Do you want to know why I got followed around by the leech named Meen?

174
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,240
I was about to tell you guys the other day but didn’t get a chance.

175
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,420
I bet you all want to know but I’m not telling you today.

176
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,610
(This is how it happened. One month ago...)

177
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,030
I said I wouldn’t tell, you asshole!

178
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,100
(I’m just gonna mute you there.)

179
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:13,990
(Duean is a Civil Engineering student who is supposed to graduate in 4 years, but he has to continue for another year because he’s brainless.)

180
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,240
Brainless, my ass!

181
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,830
(He got F, F, F, and F)

182
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,940
(F4, apparently.)

183
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,990
That’s a different show, dumbass!

184
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,220
(Sorry for getting off the track.)

185
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:33,860
(Duean actually got just one F in Life Skills, the subject that teaches skills about life which he has none.)

186
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,330
(So this year he has to enroll again with a bunch of first-year students.)

187
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,990
Hey!

188
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,680
Which year are you? Fifth?

189
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,720
I’m a freshman.

190
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,860
Do I look that old?

191
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,330
Of course not! I’m a freshman too.

192
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,950
We’re at the same age.

193
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,530
Shit! He looks older than an uncle next door.

194
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,160
I better sit with someone cute.

195
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,660
Right there!

196
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,900
Damn it! Whose bag is this?

197
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,650
Sorry. It’s mine.

198
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,730
A med student?

199
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,330
Are you okay?

200
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,060
I am.

201
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,890
(Suddenly, the lazy ass realizes he should stick with this kid since he seems book smart.)

202
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,180
Hey!

203
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,480
Is the seat next to you taken?

204
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,840
No.

205
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,650
Are you seeing someone next to me?

206
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,210
No. I was going to ask if I could sit with you.

207
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,140
Of course.

208
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,850
(Duean thinks he can pass easily if he gets to copy this kid’s papers.)

209
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,970
I am Meen.

210
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,560
I am Duean.

211
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,770
(What a nice sleep he had there!)

212
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
The class is over?

213
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,590
It was over half an hour ago.

214
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,110
The instructor assigned a group report.

215
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,030
We’re in the same group.

216
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,850
I was waiting to tell you that.

217
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,210
Ah!

218
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,710
And here is the class paper…

219
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Oh! I just dropped the spoon.

220
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,710
Clean it a bit and you’re all set.

221
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,670
What? No!

222
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,900
You used your foot to pick it up.

223
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,780
And there are germs, bacteria, and mould all over the floor.

224
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,730
I can’t use this to eat. I might die.

225
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,590
Do you have an extra spoon then?

226
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,640
No.

227
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
How am I going to eat it?

228
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,780
Give it here.

229
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,280
Cool!

230
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,230
I never knew we could do that.

231
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,170
How did you know this trick?

232
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,100
Because I’m smart.

233
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,840
(And that’s how Duean gets followed around everywhere.)

234
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,020
(And that’s why he can’t meet Pi today as promised.)

235
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,580
I just rode past here but didn’t see you earlier.

236
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,430
Really?

237
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,060
I didn’t see you either.

238
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,570
Thanks for picking me up.

239
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,020
We can just meet at the workplace, actually.

240
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,100
Hey! Don’t worry. I am late.

241
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,860
This way we’re late together.

242
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,300
Have you had breakfast?

243
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,560
No. I’ve been waiting for you.

244
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,700
Breakfast is important. Let’s go find some nice food to eat.

245
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,080
Here.

246
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,650
I’m carrying stuff. Can you put it on for me?

247
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,790
Alright then.

248
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,160
This way.

249
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,890
- You look great.
- Do it properly.

250
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,230
I was just kidding.

251
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,690
What are you playing at?

252
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,090
(Sweet! They’re sweeter than sugar.)

253
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,340
(They can’t get any sweeter.)

254
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,250
Come on.

255
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,390
She’s cute and tiny. Just my type.

256
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,060
Hello, doctor.

257
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,860
Can we all stay here with him?

258
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,070
If you can stay nice and quiet, then yes.

259
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,920
Sure. We’ll behave.

260
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,090
We’re just afraid he’d run away.

261
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,420
Our bro here is quite scared.

262
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,280
He totally shouldn’t be.

263
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,550
The doctor seems very gentle. She won’t hurt him.

264
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,610
Pi is just too weak.

265
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,910
How about you become a patient instead?

266
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,160
Are you challenging me?

267
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,960
Wrong move, kiddo.

268
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,820
Now get up.

269
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,570
You have two wisdom teeth to be pulled out.

270
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,660
I just prepared to get a teeth-cleaning.

271
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,860
Loser.

272
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,560
Are you scared?

273
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,710
Of course not.

274
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,290
Taking out teeth is a small surgery that can be infected.

275
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,960
We don’t usually allow friends or families here.

276
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,800
But if you insist to stay, please be quiet and step back.

277
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,590
Sure.

278
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,200
Thank you so much and please take care of my brother.

279
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,790
Just let them stay, Doctor.

280
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,600
They should see how easy this is for me.

281
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,290
Okay then.

282
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,830
Open your mouth widely.

283
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,330
Okay.

284
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
This is milder than getting bitten by an ant.

285
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,270
One more time, please.

286
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,740
Now it’s like getting stung by two bees.

287
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,310
You’re tough, man.

288
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,730
Awesome.

289
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,080
If it hurts, raise your hand so I know.

290
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,640
I’m going to take them out now.

291
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,790
You are? Okay.

292
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,340
Raise your hand if it hurts.

293
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,810
Open your mouth wider, please.

294
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,630
Softly, softly.

295
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,870
Are you saying it doesn’t hurt at all?

296
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,950
I’m saying ‘do it softly.’ Damn it!

297
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,020
Are you talking to me?

298
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,880
No.

299
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,540
I told them to talk softly. I don’t want them to distract you.

300
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,270
Can I proceed then?

301
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,360
Please.

302
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,160
One tooth is enough, Doctor.

303
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Where did that tough guy go?

304
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,210
Can we stop at one tooth?

305
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,440
We must take out both.

306
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,710
Thank you.

307
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,500
Wow!

308
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,850
Why is it so expensive?

309
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,980
Let me see.

310
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,050
Don’t worry about the medicines. Worry about the swelling.

311
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,740
Am I having swollen cheeks?

312
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,290
See it for yourself.

313
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,800
Shit!

314
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,570
I told you.

315
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,680
I still look hot though.

316
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,450
Stop it.

317
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,970
How can you say that when you have those swollen cheeks?

318
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,780
Where is Pi?

319
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,570
Pi?

320
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,730
He’s getting his braces off with another doctor.

321
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,620
Okay.

322
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,890
Does it hurt anyway?

323
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,200
No.

324
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,360
No?

325
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,430
Let me prove that.

326
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,860
Son of a **!!

327
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,030
@#$%^&

328
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,070
How dare you do that to me?

329
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,500
@#$%^&...

330
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,510
Do you know...

331
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,190
@#$%^&

332
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,360
how long we’ve been friends?

333
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,040
@#$%^&

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,450
If you do that to me again,

335
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,800
@#$%^&

336
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,760
We’re over.

337
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,340
Motherf**er

338
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,000
What?

339
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,250
I love you forever.

340
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,690
That’s right.

341
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:28,670
@#$%^@#$%^&@#$%^

342
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,170
Stop!

343
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,680
You don’t make any sense.

344
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,130
Just sit.

345
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,420
Your cheeks are swollen. Just rest.

346
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,290
Thanks for dropping me off.

347
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,430
I already added my name to the report.

348
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,690
All we need is your name and we're one.

349
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,500
Awesome!

350
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,240
I was right to pair up with you, my friend.

351
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Enough. It hurts.

352
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,810
I am sorry.

353
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,350
Who would think that all it took was just one nap and the report is done?

354
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,340
Now you can go home and take a rest.

355
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,540
I will take care of the cover for you.

356
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,090
Duean, can you take it off for me? I can’t.

357
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,290
What? How did you wear it then?

358
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,270
You did that for me.

359
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,530
Will you try it first?

360
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,890
Try to do it yourself, will you?

361
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,860
Do you expect me to do it for you for the rest of your life?

362
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,240
Fine! I’ll take it off for you.

363
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,450
Get your stuff away.

364
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,130
Go home. Shoo!!

365
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,160
You’re always in my way.

366
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,320
Are you ever going to talk nicely to me?

367
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,240
This is just who I am.

368
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,140
If you don’t talk nicely, I won’t go home.

369
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,130
- You won’t?
- That’s right.

370
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,570
Fine. But I will.

371
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,340
Are you going to leave me here?

372
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,610
Can’t you walk yourself home?

373
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,850
If I say I can’t, will you take me?

374
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,010
No.

375
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,580
I’m off now.

376
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,430
My report is done. I have no reason to care.

377
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,330
(Oh wait! Meen’s water bottle is with Duean.)

378
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,840
(This is going to be a problem.)

379
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,030
(Stay tuned for the next chapter.)

380
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,890
THE STORY OF A FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT EP.2 IS NOW OVER

381
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,450
Are you happy making me look like a clown?

382
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,450
What are you talking about?

383
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,770
Don’t play dumb.

384
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,060
I know I’m a loser. I wear glasses and braces.

385
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,410
But you convinced Muang Nan to take pictures with me because you want people to look down on me.

386
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,670
I am sorry about last night.

387
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,860
Don’t say it.

388
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,130
What can I do to earn your forgiveness?

389
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,400
You don’t need to do anything.

390
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,960
We can be friends.

391
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,410
I don’t even want to be your friend.

392
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,060
He is so hot.

393
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,520
Who is this hot guy? Is he a dental student?

394
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,370
Don’t help me.

395
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,670
Hold on. That’s not the way to the Faculty of Medicine.

396
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,080
Where are you going? Are you going to see Muang Nan?

397
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,780
Yes!!

398
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,110
I’m here before you, Mork.

399
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,760
I win!!

400
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,110
I win!!

401
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,230
Where is Muang Nan though?

402
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,680
What is happening?

403
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,250
Shit!

404
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Pi, are you all right?

405
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,890
Pi!

406
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,880
Pi, are you okay?

407
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,420
I’m screwed. My new look is all ruined.

408
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,880
It’s a complete waste.

409
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,930
Heatstroke.

410
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Everyone, please stand clear.

411
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,260
He needs more oxygen.

412
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,460
Don’t! Don’t take off my clothes in front of Muang Nan.

413
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,140
Don’t touch that.

414
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,950
Seriously? Right there?

415
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,840
Why not make it more amusing and put it in my face?

416
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,290
Thanks for your mercy.

417
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,290
That feels great, Sutthaya!!

418
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,710
Mork, is he going to get better?

419
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,780
He should be okay after a while.

420
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
You make me look weak in front of Muang Nan.

421
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,590
I’m gonna get back at you.

422
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,510
You’re gonna have to pay for it.

423
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,040
Look at you.

424
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,830
How miserable!

425
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,590
Are you alright?

426
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,590
Do you want me to put some ice cubes on your body?

427
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,720
No. I’m good.

428
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,980
Are you sure?

429
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,150
Duean,

430
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,100
what’s wrong with your brother?

431
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,740
He had a heatstroke.

432
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,290
Look! He’s like a dog with dehydration.

433
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,830
Hey! Don’t compare your little brother to a dog.

434
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,090
What a mouth!

435
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,970
How are you, Pi?

436
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,430
- I was…
- Your body is getting cooler.

437
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,360
He’s getting better.

438
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,550
Tell me what happened.

439
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,910
I was just…

440
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,230
Pi, did you forget to drink water.

441
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,620
This is what happens when you’re dehydrated.

442
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,530
I drank water but I…

443
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,470
You clearly didn’t drink enough water, right?

444
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,300
That’s why you’re like this.

445
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,220
Now tell me what happened.

446
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,290
- I did drink water…
- Pi…

447
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,030
Okay!!

448
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,080
He was going to tell you, but you keep interrupting him.

449
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,250
Someone who talks this much shouldn’t be a doctor.

450
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,310
You should be a public speaker.

451
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,240
Public speaker, huh? So should you.

452
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,370
You talk back all the time.

453
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,880
Pi,

454
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,280
Am I talking too much?

455
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,130
Are you sure you can get up?

456
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,490
Pi.

457
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,850
You don’t look so great.

458
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,450
I wanted to catch a shuttle car, but it was too late.

459
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,570
So I ran after it in the sun.

460
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,500
I kept running and everything blacked out.

461
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,320
I was still conscious, but it was hot and I couldn't move.

462
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,220
Why did you have to run after that car?

463
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,840
It was burning hot outside.

464
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,960
You’re lucky Duean helped you.

465
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:42,960
No.

466
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,350
I didn’t help him.

467
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,560
You didn’t?

468
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,170
Nope.

469
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,260
Then who did?

470
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,810
Your friend?

471
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Stand clear, please.

472
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,300
He’s not a friend.

473
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,380
Just a student in the same year.

474
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,830
Tell him I said thanks. Without him…

475
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,360
You don’t have to thank him.

476
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,650
Why not?

477
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,660
Though he isn’t a friend, you have to thank him for his help.

478
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:16,910
No.

479
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,190
Just forget it. End of discussion.

480
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,860
Wait!

481
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,110
Don’t forget to say thanks.

482
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,530
Mom!!

483
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,990
What’s going on with him?

484
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,730
I think he’s annoyed because you talk too much.

485
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,880
What was I?

486
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,330
A karate player.

487
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:40,950
Are you scared now?

488
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,430
Nope!

489
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,610
Stop there!

490
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Are you feeling better?

491
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,390
Your cheeks are still red.

492
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,390
Here.

493
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,270
Don’t act tough.

494
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,750
This drink is fresh and cool.

495
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,220
It gives you refreshment.

496
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,760
Will you drink it or not?

497
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,530
Well, well.

498
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,790
You’re welcome.

499
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,440
No need to say thanks.

500
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,120
I haven’t said anything.

501
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,270
But your eyes are saying…

502
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,630
‘thank you.’

503
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,170
Thank you?

504
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,130
It was so embarrassing for me. Muang Nan was there.

505
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,880
You’re lucky I don’t yell at you for that.

506
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,720
Thank you, my ass.

507
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,270
Go ahead and yell then.

508
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,350
I’m ready for it.

509
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,040
You can punch me if you want.

510
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,090
Anything that makes you forgive me.

511
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,830
Do it.

512
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,380
Do it until you’re satisfied.

513
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,990
I…

514
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,160
I want to make amends for making you feel bad the other day.

515
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,630
Why do you want my forgiveness so badly?

516
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,820
Because I want to be your friend.

517
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,940
We can’t be if you’re still mad at me.

518
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,290
I told you I didn’t want to be friends with you.

519
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,450
You don’t

520
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,890
but I do.

521
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,600
And I’m going to make you want that too.

522
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,240
Do you really want to be my friend?

523
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,360
I told you I didn’t want to be friends with you.

524
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,220
But I do

525
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,910
and I’m going to make you want that too.

526
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,560
I’m going to make you want that too.

527
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,700
No!!

528
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,330
How about you spit it out before you talk?

529
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,270
Duean?

530
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,540
Yes, it’s me!

531
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,810
You didn’t recognize my gorgeous face?

532
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,100
Oh! That’s right.

533
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,060
You’re a hot guy now.

534
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,900
So, how’s it going with Muang Nan? Going just fine?

535
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,350
Just fine, my freakin’ ass.

536
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,980
I haven’t talked to him yet.

537
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,900
What should I do?

538
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,960
I did something so embarrassing and he saw it.

539
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,520
What should I do now? I can’t even look at him.

540
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,830
Help me, Duean!

541
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,070
Firstly, you need to stop shaking me.

542
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,460
I am not a milk carton.

543
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,340
I have a plan.

544
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,830
See this.

545
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,420
Blind In Love?

546
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,750
What is it?

547
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,040
It’s a party theme.

548
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,120
It isn’t something that happens every day.

549
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,750
This club will be pitch dark.

550
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,920
No lights.

551
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,670
How can you see with the lights off?

552
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
Just read their concept.

553
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,910
See?

554
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,510
Your eyes can’t really see but your heart can truly feel.

555
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,590
You will get to talk and flirt all you want.

556
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,630
How am I related to this?

557
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,930
My beloved bro

558
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
you are just so dumb when it comes to love.

559
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,190
You just told me you can’t look at Muang Nan.

560
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,680
Go to this party

561
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
and open a heart-to-heart conversation with him.

562
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:00,370
Not being able to see his face will reduce 50% of your nervousness.

563
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
If you can get Muang Nan to go to this party,

564
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:11,270
I am 99.99% sure that you can make him your boyfriend.

565
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,910
Awesome!

566
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,060
I will do anything to make him go.

567
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,670
I love you, bro.

568
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,330
That’s right.

569
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,750
Being in front of Muang Nan’s Faculty building this early,

570
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,630
I’m sure I’ll get to see him before class.

571
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,690
Well, I am quite hot.

572
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,340
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: I heard you got a new look.)

573
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,360
How did you know?

574
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,350
I’m smart.

575
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,550
You’re smart but I’m hot.

576
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,710
Do you want to see?

577
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,490
You’re obsessing.

578
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,900
I know you want to say I'm hot.

579
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,300
Just say it. Don’t be shy.

580
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,040
You’re so full of yourself.

581
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,790
Say it now.

582
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,920
Do it.

583
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,730
Compliment me now!

584
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,050
Alright! You’re so hot.

585
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,370
Happy now?

586
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,060
I look hot in the picture but I’m hotter in person.

587
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,270
Want to meet me?

588
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,540
Just admit you want to see me.

589
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,270
Don’t you want to?

590
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,970
No.

591
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,830
Why not? You’re the one that sent a friend request.

592
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,520
Well…

593
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,050
We can be friends without seeing each other.

594
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,590
I just want to be your friend.

595
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,510
I told you I didn’t want to be friends with you.

596
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,590
You don’t

597
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,130
but I do

598
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,080
and I’m going to make you want that too.

599
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,410
Hey! What’s up with you?

600
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,940
Who are you exactly?

601
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,930
What’s special about this lab?

602
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Haven’t you heard the gross lab story?

603
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,640
Make a wish here at midnight and it’ll come true.

604
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,980
Is it true?

605
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,710
I will wish for Muang Nan.

606
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,820
Holy shit!

607
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,400
I wanted to ask if you’re free this Friday.

608
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:32,120
About the date you asked me yesterday, I’ve changed my mind.

609
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,860
Thank you so much, cadaver!

610
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,170
I’m going to prepare you for tonight.

611
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,610
If you’re alone with him, try to talk sweetly and nicely.

612
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,470
Make him fall for you.

613
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,100
I like you, Muang Nan.

614
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,710
I’ve liked you for so long, but I could never bring myself to tell you.
