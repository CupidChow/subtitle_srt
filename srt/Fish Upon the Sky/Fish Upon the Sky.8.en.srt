1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,020
Why does someone like you want to be my friend?

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,570
Because to me,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,910
you’re never a loser.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,880
Now that we’re friends,

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,150
don’t you ever leave me.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,900
Being friends is good enough for now.

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,200
How are you related to Pattawee?

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,660
I looked the name up and it’s not you.

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,100
Why did you lie to me?

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,760
You can go, Duean.

11
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,710
I don’t want to annoy you.

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,100
You said it yourself.

13
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,390
Fine! I’ll go.

14
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,270
You said you’d bring someone you’re dating.

15
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:28,770
Where?

16
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,600
This way.

17
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,880
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

18
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,890
You have to diagnose if the vaccine you get is right for your disease

19
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,300
or you just assume that it is.

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,940
I got it.

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,980
Thank you, Wan.

22
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,330
(Mork: Did you miss so bad that you had to call?)

23
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,320
(Pi: I’m calling to say see you tomorrow. I have something to talk to you about.)

24
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,330
(Mork: Talk to me about what?)

25
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,130
(Pi: You’ll hear it tomorrow.)

26
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,260
The Faculty of Medicine is in the lead now.

27
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,220
Does anybody want to take down the champion here?

28
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,720
Anyone? Step up here.

29
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,190
Anyone?

30
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,510
Come on up.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,280
(Seriously, you wanted me to meet you here?)

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,740
(Fine then.)

33
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,340
We have one contestant over there.

34
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,690
Let’s give him a big hand!

35
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,370
(Bring it on. I’m coming.)

36
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
We have a hot guy joining.

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
This way, please.

38
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,240
And here we have a new challenger from Dentistry.

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,250
What is your name?

40
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,230
Pattawee.

41
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,320
Pattawee.

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,930
Alright.

43
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,600
Let’s see if Pattawee can take down our champion Sutthaya.

44
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,360
You know the rules?

45
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I do.

46
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,860
He knows how to play.

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,150
Our new contestant here will get to pick the number first.

48
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,630
Number 3.

49
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,090
He has picked number 3.

50
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,610
And it is…

51
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,690
Let’s take a guess, guys.

52
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,680
Let’s see!

53
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,500
“You”

54
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,350
Start your sentences with ‘You.’

55
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,750
Anything you can think of.

56
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,080
If you take longer than 3 seconds to think, you lose.

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,020
I see everyone is ready. Let’s start with our champion.

58
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,480
3 2 1. Go!

59
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
You are Pattawee.

60
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,550
You are Sutthaya.

61
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,460
You’re a dental student.

62
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,290
You were crowned the Med’s hottest guy.

63
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,190
You like desserts.

64
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,340
You like to steal my desserts.

65
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,560
You once forgot to bring your lab gown.

66
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,580
You lent me yours.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,120
You don’t have many friends.

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,580
You have many friends.

69
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,420
We are friends.

70
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,150
I don’t think so.

71
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,760
That’s right.

72
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,760
I asked to be your friend just because you didn’t allow me to be more.

73
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,380
But as days go by, my desire to be friends with you becomes lower.

74
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,160
I want to be more than that.

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,840
MorkPi. MorkPi.

76
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,860
Why am I blushing?

77
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,290
All right, guys.

78
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,210
Sutthaya just violated our game rules.

79
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,240
Pattawee from Dentistry is our winner!

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,650
That was superb!

81
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,120
Wait!

82
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,100
Hold on.

83
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,900
Why are you giving me this?

84
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,590
I don’t need it anymore.

85
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,250
I…

86
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,120
I will win over the real Muang Nan.

87
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,740
Thanks for comforting me that day.

88
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,450
But...

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,450
I don’t think you’re the right vaccine for my disease.

90
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,550
You’re the complication that happens to my body.

91
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,810
I’m not the complication.

92
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,750
I’m the right vaccine for your disease.

93
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,370
You’re stubborn.

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,180
I won’t make you like me anymore.

95
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,340
I will just make you love me instead.

96
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,530
Watch me!

97
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,810
They’re lovebirds.

98
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,050
Pi, wait up.

99
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
KK, come here!

100
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,550
What’s up?

101
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,330
Look! A video of Mork confessing to Pi.

102
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,940
(I won’t make you like me anymore.)

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,850
(I will just make you love me instead.)

104
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,700
Hey!

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,700
Let’s reopen our fan page.

106
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,120
Look at this.

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,440
The video was posted 2 minutes ago and it has 100K Likes.

108
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,020
Are you sure about that? We gave them our word.

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,540
Don’t you want the huge number of Likes,

110
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,630
the happiness when there are tons of comments,

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
the heart icons we will get?

112
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,710
We have hundreds of pictures of them sleeping on each other’s lap.

113
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,710
But we promised them.

114
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,250
The number of followers will increase every day.

115
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,070
No. I don’t want to break the promise.

116
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,000
From 10 to 100 followers.

117
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,490
From 100 to 1K followers.

118
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,610
From 1K to 10K followers.

119
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,590
From 10K to 1M followers.

120
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,260
And the MorkPi V2 Fan Page has just begun!

121
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,880
(I won’t make you like me anymore.)

122
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,820
(I will just make you love me instead.)

123
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,940
What an ass!

124
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,370
I can’t focus here.

125
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,690
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: You’re now famous.)

126
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,760
(A Guy From Nearby Faculty: Somebody just confessed to you on-air.)

127
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,420
Nonsense.

128
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,540
Why do you think it’s nonsense?

129
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,010
I think you do know that he really likes you.

130
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,460
But you just pretend to resist and turn a blind eye to him.

131
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,990
Yeah? So?

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,230
If you don’t like him, why didn’t you just turn him down?

133
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,670
Or…

134
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,210
Deep down,

135
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,740
you like him too?

136
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,900
You’re right.

137
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,590
Why didn’t I just turn him down?

138
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,710
How about you open your heart for him just a little?

139
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
It’s not like he’s a bad guy or anything.

140
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,950
Besides,

141
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,060
he has saved your life before.

142
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:08,950
That’s true.

143
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,580
He’s hot too.

144
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,710
He is a popular guy from Medicine.

145
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,220
Can’t argue with that.

146
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,030
You like him already, yeah?

147
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,050
Wait a minute!

148
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,480
Chill, man.

149
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,340
Why are you cheering for him so badly?

150
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,330
If he’s that great like you just said, why don’t you date him yourself?

151
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,180
Because I want you to be with someone great.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,500
You’re talking like you know him.

153
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,130
Bye now.

154
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,830
I’ll get back to my study.

155
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,380
When will I get to study?

156
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,920
Hello.

157
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,500
(I’m in front of your house.)

158
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,650
(Come on down.)

159
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,300
What?

160
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,150
What are you doing at my house?

161
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,490
How did you know where I live?

162
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,360
It isn’t something hard to find,  when you’re really interested in someone.

163
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,590
Are you stalking me?

164
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,300
You’re harassing me.

165
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,110
Right. And I’ll harass you in your room too.

166
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,410
I know where your room is.

167
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Sutt..thaya!

168
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,870
Why are you really here?

169
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,390
I’m bringing back your clothes.

170
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,310
Just put it right there and you can go.

171
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,990
I’m not kidding, Pi.

172
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,710
I am serious.

173
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,340
You said before that

174
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Muang Nan was a fish upon the sky for you.

175
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,280
But you know what?

176
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,730
You are a fish upon the sky for me too.

177
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,830
You get that?

178
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,420
Hello!

179
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,050
Pi!

180
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,310
That’s all you wanted to say?

181
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,070
I’m going back to my study.

182
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,130
You’re blushing, aren’t you?

183
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,800
That's why you’re running away.

184
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,200
Yes, I am blushing.

185
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,470
Goodbye.

186
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,370
Pi!

187
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,430
Don’t go yet.

188
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,730
Come back and talk to me first.

189
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,670
Pi!

190
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,830
(My heart!! Why are you pounding?)

191
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,900
(Pi, you’re so stupid!)

192
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,750
(Mork: I really like you, Pi.)

193
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,300
Hey, where are my clothes?

194
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,490
Outside on the drying stand.

195
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,680
You hung them for me?

196
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,380
No. I washed them for you.

197
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,490
Going to the U?

198
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,560
Ride with me.

199
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,960
It’s okay. I have a car too.

200
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,660
Come on, Dad!

201
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,600
Very bad timing.

202
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,700
Just get in.

203
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,030
Duean, take me with you.

204
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,880
Who is this dude?

205
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,710
This is Mork. He loves to bug me so much.

206
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,080
So you’re the one muddling my brother’s life.

207
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
I’m gonna beat you up, you asshole!

208
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Just let him go. We can go now.

209
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Just because my brother stopped me.

210
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
What are you looking at?

211
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,850
We’re going to have a problem.

212
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,600
(The Story of a Fifth-Year Student EP.8 - Withdrawal Symptoms)

213
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,970
Ignoring me, aren’t you?

214
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,190
Fine! I won’t sit with you.

215
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,410
Fine!

216
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,460
Fine!

217
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,320
Hello. Is this seat taken?

218
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,860
Can I sit with you?

219
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,270
Hello!

220
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,390
Someone likes you.

221
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,120
And I am that someone.

222
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,980
Come on, Jane.

223
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,770
We’ve been in the same class for so long. Aren’t you going to talk to me?

224
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,510
What an uppish person!

225
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,660
I will just sit here then.

226
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,370
Hello.

227
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,850
What?

228
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,720
Am I smelling?

229
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,350
I am not.

230
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,210
Ouch!

231
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,920
Did you just hit me?

232
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,870
You like me, don’t you? I can tell.

233
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,950
Meen!

234
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,820
Wanna grab something to eat?

235
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,400
No answer.

236
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,040
Hey!

237
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
I’m talking to you here. Are you ignoring me?

238
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,030
No.

239
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,120
Are you avoiding me?

240
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,680
No.

241
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
No, my ass!

242
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,730
You’re obviously avoiding me.

243
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,090
You were never like this.

244
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,090
Normally after class, you’d go ‘Duean, I’m hungry.’

245
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,330
‘Duean, I’m thirsty.’

246
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,040
‘Duean, can you wipe my ass?’

247
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,800
You were that guy.

248
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,220
I don’t want to annoy you anymore.

249
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,350
Did I say I was annoyed by you?

250
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,280
I’m always like this, loud and shouty.

251
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,560
You know that.

252
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,760
Okay.

253
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,640
I’m hungry. I’m going to find something to eat.

254
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,400
Fine!!

255
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,960
This is so great!

256
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,310
Now I don’t have someone shadowing me everywhere.

257
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
You go and eat alone.

258
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,590
I’m so relieved now.

259
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,660
Just go!

260
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,520
Go on! Walk faster!

261
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,180
I am sorry.

262
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,140
Are you alright?

263
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,120
I am. You?

264
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,120
I am okay.

265
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,610
Are you sure you’re okay?

266
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,770
I am okay.

267
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,260
Are you coming?

268
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,700
Wait! I am!

269
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,300
I am sorry.

270
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,280
Are you alright?

271
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,150
Pattawee.

272
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,540
The water.

273
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,710
What’s up, Narong?

274
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,320
So what’s going on between you and Sutthaya?

275
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
I see many girls screaming so hard for you both.

276
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,380
I just don’t get it.

277
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,740
That’s why I’m asking.

278
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,850
Nothing is going on between me and him.

279
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,740
Really?

280
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,660
Really.

281
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,540
Why are you asking?

282
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,810
Is that so?

283
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,710
What are they screaming and cheering for then?

284
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,090
I’m so confused.

285
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,510
Just two people meeting each other,

286
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,900
holding hands,

287
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,290
and eating together.

288
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,710
You guys are like normal friends.

289
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,680
I have no clue why they’re screaming over your photos on that page.

290
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,060
What page?

291
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Haven’t you seen?

292
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,080
Look.

293
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,880
It’s called MorkPi V2.

294
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,270
Do they think it's the Kamen Rider series?

295
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,200
V1, V2, and so on.

296
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,210
(I bet that tea is very sweet.)

297
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,570
(Look at the way Mork looks at Pi.)

298
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,350
(Friends don’t look at each other this way.)

299
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,290
(This isn’t just a ship. They’re a real couple.)

300
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,880
(They’re like Romeo and Juliet.)

301
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,490
(A doctor and a dentist, they should just run a hospital together.)

302
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,940
(His parents are doctors too.)

303
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,120
They know about my parents now?

304
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,230
(His eldest brother is a doctor too. He’s doing his internship in Hat Yai.)

305
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,780
(His house is next to my friend’s house.)

306
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,560
(I’ll go there and take pictures of his bedroom for you guys.)

307
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,980
My bedroom?

308
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,120
This isn’t right.

309
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,920
Hello.

310
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,620
Hello, everyone.

311
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:43,210
Today, we’re giving you an exclusive interview with Mork Sutthaya, our hottest guy from the Faculty of Medicine.

312
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,130
Sorry and thank you, Narong.

313
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,050
See?

314
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,610
Are you guys ready?

315
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,070
We have 38K viewers right now.

316
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,840
Once we hit 40K, we will start the interview right away.

317
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,150
Let’s take a peek.

318
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,480
Not yet!

319
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,130
We have 45K people watching now.

320
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,100
Let’s get started, guys.

321
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,050
Let’s go!

322
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,050
Hello, Mork.

323
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,280
Let’s greet 45K fans of yours.

324
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,300
Sawasdee krub.

325
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:34,160
Can you all see? Mork has such a warm and beautiful smile.

326
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,560
Don’t forget to tap the heart icon for us.

327
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,960
Let’s start with a hot topic.

328
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,000
The topic that got over 100K retweets,

329
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,560
with the hashtag #ICanBeYourVaccine.

330
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,440
And now, a bunch of people are getting in line waiting to get your vaccine.

331
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,430
Tell us about it.

332
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,880
Nothing much.

333
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,060
It’s really how I feel about him.

334
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,640
I want to take care of him

335
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,120
and treat him.

336
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,870
Why does he need treatment?

337
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,140
Because he doesn’t know what his heart wants.

338
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,560
Is it a disease or something?

339
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,450
It is.

340
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,880
It happens to someone not being honest with his heart and feelings.

341
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,890
Can you describe the symptoms?

342
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,980
Some fans here might be having the disease but don’t realize it.

343
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,990
Love but refuse.

344
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,310
He likes me but doesn’t want to accept it.

345
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,780
Pi, if you’re watching this, please know that there are many people envious of you right now.

346
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,740
Look!

347
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,550
Stop stirring things up.

348
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,870
You two as well.

349
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,520
I know you’re just pretending to be angry.

350
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,760
Pretending?

351
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,960
That’s fine.

352
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,810
Let’s resume.

353
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,340
Pi!

354
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,420
Why so many stuff?

355
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,680
Pi, those are my wet wipes.

356
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,130
Sorry.

357
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,420
Why did you throw them away?

358
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,120
Hey!

359
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,240
You stop stirring things up.

360
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,380
I don’t have a stony heart or any disease.

361
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,240
I don’t need your vaccine.

362
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,340
No matter how many times you ask,

363
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,850
I don’t like you.

364
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,770
Stop disturbing my life.

365
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,990
You guys too.

366
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,570
I’m not okay with what you’re doing.

367
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,950
You know that what you're posting and commenting on isn't true.

368
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,710
Things are getting out of hand now. People know about my family.

369
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,320
They know what my parents do. They know about my brother too.

370
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,800
They even say they’ll come to my room and I’m not okay with that.

371
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,210
Pi! Wait up!

372
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,860
Pi! Stop!

373
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,920
Stop!

374
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,700
Calm down.

375
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,080
You shouldn’t have said that to them.

376
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,070
Why can’t I?

377
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,750
I’m being harassed here.

378
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,440
I take full responsibility for that.

379
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,290
So that fan page is back because of you?

380
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,370
Do you have any idea that what you’re doing

381
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
gives people chances to harass me?

382
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,590
My dad’s, my mom’s, and my brother’s life too.

383
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,760
Do you know how I feel now?

384
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,090
Unsafe!

385
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,800
Pi, slow down.

386
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,070
Well, It already happened.

387
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,780
Okay.

388
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,460
I am sorry.

389
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,150
From now on, just stay away from me.

390
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,820
Let me live my life in peace.

391
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,910
See?

392
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,070
I told you not to reopen the page.

393
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,780
Pi is really mad now.

394
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,470
He is just too much.

395
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,950
People come to the page because they like him.

396
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,030
They don’t talk badly about him.

397
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,780
But there are some people who are actually harassing him.

398
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,640
They said they would go to his bedroom and take pictures.

399
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,840
Who would really do such a thing?

400
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,170
They didn’t mean that.

401
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,570
Well, we did follow him home once.

402
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,030
Though we didn’t get to see him.

403
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,720
So many problems!

404
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,630
I quit!

405
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,000
Your beloved Pi yelled right at my face.

406
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,710
He was so in denial and taking it on other people.

407
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,030
Because he wasn't okay with what we did.

408
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,980
We must understand him too, Kluea.

409
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,200
You can understand him all by yourself.

410
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,620
As for me,

411
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,700
Bye!

412
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,820
Kluea!

413
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,750
Hey!

414
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,630
Just take it easy.

415
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,310
It’s just stuff people say on social media.

416
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,990
If they really come to your house,

417
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,380
let me know.

418
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,100
I’ll beat them up for you.

419
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,360
You just told me to take it easy, but you seem more frustrated.

420
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,290
Don’t think too much.

421
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,260
Just quit thinking.

422
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,160
Are you alright?

423
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,170
I am. You?

424
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,320
I am okay.

425
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,620
Yo!

426
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,870
Still can’t get it off your mind?

427
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,960
You’re wondering how that kid had the clip, right?

428
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,030
I just want to know.

429
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,010
Know what?

430
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,330
If Muang Nan really threw this clip away,

431
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,410
does it mean he hates me?

432
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,670
Let me ask you back.

433
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,490
Is it the only one of its kind on this planet?

434
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,210
No.

435
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,760
(But I made it myself.)

436
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Even if it is

437
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,550
and he threw it away,

438
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,780
that means it had no value to him.

439
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,590
I think the answer is very clear.

440
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,760
What else do you expect?

441
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,910
Hey!

442
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,950
Just move on already.

443
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,240
Trust me.

444
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,010
It isn’t that easy.

445
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,600
Shit! Are you hurt?

446
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,640
You can’t achieve without pain.

447
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
(Man! Wise words come with a skateboard.)

448
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,400
(You must go through pain in order to move on.)

449
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
(What a sucky kid!)

450
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,200
(Damn! When will you get to go home?)

451
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,340
Hey!

452
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,520
Hop on. I’ll take you home.

453
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,340
No.

454
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,650
I can go home by myself.

455
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,230
Sure you can’t.

456
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,800
I was watching you there.

457
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,260
If you don’t fight for your spot,

458
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,420
you’ll never get to go home in this life.

459
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,060
You’re so weak.

460
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,570
Yes,

461
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,420
I am weak and slow.

462
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,450
But that’s my business.

463
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,500
And the line won’t be this long in the late evening.

464
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,340
So you will wait for the evening to come?

465
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,440
It’s hot out here.

466
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,620
Just hop on. I’ll take you.

467
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,790
No.

468
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,480
You will get annoyed

469
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,490
and leave me along the way again.

470
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,560
Hey!

471
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,380
Are you sulking?

472
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,420
You’re mad about that day?

473
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,570
Your silence says it’s true.

474
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,690
I will not leave you today, alright.

475
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,970
Fine! I am confessing.

476
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,990
I was so glad at first that you stopped following me everywhere.

477
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,450
But honestly,

478
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,130
now that I don’t get to hear your voice,

479
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,500
I feel kind of uneasy.

480
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,050
Really?

481
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,400
No. It was bullshit, duh!

482
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,200
Can’t you just say it nicely?

483
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,580
Hey, hey!

484
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,180
It’s just my style.

485
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,920
So…

486
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,450
You will not get irritated by me?

487
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,930
I’m starting to be if you still linger.

488
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,380
Hey, Meen!!

489
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,080
I’m just joking.

490
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,530
Take it.

491
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,630
Stop pouting.

492
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,220
Quickly.

493
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,710
Put it on.

494
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,480
Do it quickly.

495
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,650
Quickly.

496
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,010
You’re not going to leave me again, are you?

497
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,880
I’m not. I promise.

498
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,090
Come on. Let’s go.

499
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,920
Let’s go.

500
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,170
Go!

501
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,410
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.8 is over.)

502
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,340
You know what?

503
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,650
By doing nothing, you allow people to keep on harassing me.

504
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,880
From now on,

505
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,290
just stay away from me.

506
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,200
Let me live my life in peace.

507
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,920
Was I being too harsh on him?

508
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,010
It’s hot.

509
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,350
What a nice service!

510
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,130
So many people in the morning classes.

511
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,080
It takes forever to get in the elevator.

512
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,420
You should take the stairs to the 20th floor.

513
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,080
It’s okay.

514
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,380
I’m willing to get squeezed in the elevator.

515
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,100
(Damn! It’s you again.)

516
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,150
Aren’t you coming?

517
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,330
No. I want to do a little exercise.

518
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,120
(I’m wide awake now.)

519
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
(Is he following me?)

520
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,490
(I need to get out of this place. I see him everywhere.)

521
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,450
(Why didn’t he talk to me at all?)

522
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,870
(Normally, he’d say this and that.)

523
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,890
(But you told him to stay away, Pi.)

524
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,040
(No wonder.)

525
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,200
(That’s right.)

526
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,000
(But he’s never been like this.)

527
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,330
(Maybe he didn’t see me there.)

528
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,060
(Stop thinking, Pi!)

529
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,450
(Just go back to studying.)

530
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,440
(That bathroom was small. There’s no way he didn’t see me.)

531
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,160
What a dull day!

532
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,030
I can't focus on my study.

533
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,660
What are you doing?

534
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,930
Are you busy?

535
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Okay. I won’t bother your time then.

536
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,880
I am…

537
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,940
reading.

538
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,640
Seriously, how am I inferior to him?

539
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,000
Why did Muang Nan go with him, not me?

540
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,910
Do you really want to know why?

541
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,570
You have a few problems.

542
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,480
One, your glasses are too thick.

543
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,080
Two, your braces make you sound unclear when you talk.

544
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,730
Three, you’re not confident. You’re always round-shouldered.

545
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,630
Seventeen, you’re nerdy. You don’t have many friends.

546
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,190
Am I that bad?

547
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,830
You said I had a few problems.

548
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,880
A few, my ass! You went on to 120 problems.

549
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,670
How many will you call ‘a lot’ then? 700?

550
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,740
I’m not talking to you anymore.

551
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,560
There is one good thing about you though.

552
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,540
You have a kind heart.

553
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,410
And this one good quality you have…

554
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,530
made me fall for you.

555
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,210
I’ve missed you.

556
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,920
Guess who it is.

557
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,070
Bam?

558
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Have you missed me?

559
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,980
No.

560
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,220
No kidding, I’ve missed you too!

561
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,270
You just love to tease!

562
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,380
What do you have here?

563
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,430
They look yummy.

564
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,800
What should we eat first?

565
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,270
You choose.

566
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,670
Or we can eat them all.

567
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,770
Who is this girl?

568
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,960
Why is she with Mork?

569
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,990
They’re even feeding each other food.

570
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,210
This can’t be right.

571
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,690
I will take photos of them just in case.

572
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,590
My new fandom is about to happen.

573
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,270
Prik, I’ll create a new fandom.

574
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,350
I don’t need you anymore since you’re such a saint!

575
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
This is going to be fun!

576
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,450
Clinical crowns are teeth visible above the gingiva.

577
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,840
Their length is unstable and changeable.

578
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,770
Unstable?

579
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,070
Change?

580
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,150
Mork has changed too.

581
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,320
He is acting like he doesn't care.

582
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,310
Stop thinking about him!

583
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,630
Pi, have you seen that page?

584
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,250
What page now?

585
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,970
MorkPi page has already been deleted.

586
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,690
I deleted that page myself.

587
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,380
But someone set up a new page just to attack you.

588
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,560
♪ What we had before was just a ship ♪

589
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,720
♪ But this one is so real ♪

590
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,770
♪ Come closer and I’ll tell you everything ♪

591
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,010
♪ MorkBam is real, I promise you that ♪

592
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,920
♪ They are just so cute ♪

593
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,650
♪ They have known each other since high school ♪

594
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
♪ One was a sports player and one was a cheerleader ♪

595
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,760
♪ They both look gorgeous ♪

596
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,570
♪ MorkBam is real, follow me and you’ll see ♪

597
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,660
Wow! Perfect!

598
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,610
What is this?!

599
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,530
Excuse me, are these seats taken?

600
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:43,940
I think they’re available.

601
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,910
Mork, come here.

602
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,640
We can sit over here.

603
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,690
You’re here?

604
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,230
You know him, babe?

605
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,320
(Babe?!)

606
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,720
The guy I told you about, Sugar.

607
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,320
(Sugar?!)

608
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,060
The one that doesn't want anything to do with you, right?

609
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,110
We shouldn't bother him then.

610
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,770
Let’s study somewhere else, just the two of us.

611
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,230
(Why can’t she talk like a normal human being?)

612
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,690
(She lacks Calcium, I guess.)

613
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,250
(No! It has nothing to do with Calcium.)

614
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,580
- (Yuck! What an annoying voice!)
- I can go.

615
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
(Who on earth talks like that?)

616
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,650
Babe, I’m right here. Just look at me.

617
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,460
Stop playing.

618
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,880
What is it?

619
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,320
Are you afraid he’d get mad?

620
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,430
Exactly.

621
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,030
You played too much, Bam.

622
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,060
He won’t be.

623
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,160
We must create a situation to provoke him.

624
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,110
The plot ‘Bam, the ex-girlfriend’ must work out well.

625
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,390
We are going to make him jealous.

626
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,060
You don’t have to do anything, Mork.

627
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,260
Just stand there and let me touch you here and there a little.

628
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,330
That’s all and things will turn out great.

629
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,160
Okay?

630
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,430
Where has he gone, by the way?

631
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,340
I will just go and check.

632
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,490
Babe…

633
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,330
I want this one.

634
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,200
Show me your cute gesture first.

635
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,530
That ‘Am I cute?’ thing.

636
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,130
Just admit you’re jealous.

637
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,250
I am not.

638
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,100
You are.

639
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,600
I said I am not.

640
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,040
Do you know a page called ‘A Guy From Nearby Faculty’?

641
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,570
Don’t tell me you’re an admin.

642
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,650
When you like someone,

643
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,330
tell that person honestly.

644
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,760
At first, I wanted to be your friend.

645
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,200
I want to be a boyfriend now.
