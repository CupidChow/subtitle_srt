1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,870
I want this one.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,260
If you’re jealous, just say it.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,390
I’m not.

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,460
You are.

5
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,970
I said I’m not jealous.

6
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,250
Do you know a page called 'A Guy From Nearby Faculty'?

7
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,890
Don’t tell me you’re the admin

8
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,470
Not quite right, Pi.

9
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,010
The Faculty of Allied Health Sciences isn’t the one next to Dentistry

10
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,040
Were you angry when you found out?

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,800
I wanted to be your friend at first.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,400
But now,

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,110
I want to be your boyfriend

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,160
Do you know what my first impression of y ou was?

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
You probably forgot all about it.

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,360
But I never forget.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,120
A paper jam?

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,570
Here, let me.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,660
Thanks.

20
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,550
Hello, The Lord of the Copier

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,690
Very nice to see you here.

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,900
Here. Please take care of this.

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,100
Mine too

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,430
All of these.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Hey, why do you look like you don’t want to?

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,560
Can’t you just help your friends out, please?

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,740
Just help us.

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Come on, handsome

29
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,300
Well, pick them up.

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,230
These books are pricey. Pick them up.

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,990
Thanks for helping

32
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,220
Put them on my desk when you’re done

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,460
Let’s go, guys.

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,600
It started with empathy

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,040
But after that, I always watched you from afar.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,000
Can you add my name to your report?

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,770
Come on, my friend.

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,720
I’m sorry about the other day.

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,080
Please.

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,560
Add my name to the report, please.

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,760
I watched you every day

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,260
but had no courage to approach and talk to you

43
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,020
That’s why I had to become someone else

44
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,950
I was too afraid to tell the truth.

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,640
I was afraid of losing you if you found out how I felt.

46

[A Guy From Nearby Faculty sent you a friend request.]

You know what?

48
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,660
Every time I'm with you,

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
my heart beats really fast.

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
I feel happy whenever I’m with you.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What about you?

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,690
How do you feel when you’re with me?

53
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,170
Do you feel good?

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Thank you

55
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,030
but…

56
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,420
Everything is just so new to me.

57

I…

58
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,110
I don’t know how things are going to turn out for us

59
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,530
I need more time to think.

Step in, guys.

Hey, no kids allowed.

I’m kidding, you guys.

96

Okay then.

97
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,240
See?

98

If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t get this huge donation

Thanks, Duean.

100
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,790
Thank you so much, Phi.

101
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,210
Hold on

102
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,730
Why do you call me just Duean and call them Phi?

103
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,630
I’m even older than them

104
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,050
I’ve been calling you Duean for so long.

105
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,430
I’m used to it already

Look, my ass!

Wanna punch me?

112
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,210
No.

113
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,810
That’s what I thought.

114
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,050
Your friends are funny.

115
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,670
They are.

116
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,410
I almost forgot.

117
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,040
I have something for you.

118
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,890
What is it?

119
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,590
This.

120
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,110
I saw you had this fish on your motorbike

121
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,390
So I thought it’d be cute if we could find it a partner.

122
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,150
Can I have your keychain?

123
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,850
Sure.

124
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,570
See?

125
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,550
It’s very cute when they stay together

126
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,690
They are yours.

127
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,050
Thank you

128
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,120
I knew it. I knew it.

129
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,240
It’s a gift from the heart

130
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
I’m blushing for them.

131
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,990
From the heart, my ass!!

132
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,420
No?

133
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,490
No. Go clean up.

134
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,440
Go!

135
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,410
Move your ass

136
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,830
What?

137
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,960
Go help them.

138
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,050
No. I’m playing a game

139
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,060
And you?

140
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
Drinking and having a good time?
Why don’t you help them?

141
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,440
I’m lazy.

142
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,490
Lazy?

143
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Fair enough.

144
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Meen, what happened?

145
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,090
They are holding hands.

146
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,320
I think there are staples

147
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
From where?

148
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,370
On this board.

149
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Who the heck designed this board?

150
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,640
Tell me who.

151
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,730
It’s terrible.

152
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,790
Do you know who decorated this board?

153
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,940
I’m gonna staple his mouth with this

154
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
He’s gonna staple that guy

155
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,900
Calm down, man.

156
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,810
It’s no big deal. Why making such a fuss?

157
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Staple his mouth? That’s savage.

158
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,330
Are you angry for your boyfriend, Duean?

159
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,060
Boyfriend, my freaking ass!

160
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,580
I should just staple your mouths instead

161
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,380
Frustration

162
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,640
Duean, I’ve taken acting classes.

163
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,180
Of course, I can tell.

164
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
He’s giving me his pointy finger again.

165
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,120
I’ve been getting that all day

166
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,060
It’s a middle finger.

167
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,120
Yeah?

168
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,540
Let’s just clean up

169
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,950
How are you?

170
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,410
Bleeding just a little.

171
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,010
(Daddy and I are working the night shift.)

172
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,740
(We didn’t prepare dinner.)

173
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,900
(Fix yourselves something.)

174
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,830
Yes?

175
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,980
Hi. What are you doing?

176
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,150
Are you calling to get your answer?

177
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,600
You just asked me today.

178
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,720
Yes. I’m right in front of your house.

179
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Just a sec.

180
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,870
You…

181
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,180
can’t be very patient, can you?

182
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,010
You’re right.

183
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,330
I can’t argue with that

184
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,460
I must admit…

185
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,160
I can’t control my Dopamine right now.

186
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,230
Come on.

187
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,880
You don’t need to be so academic

188
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,280
What is it?

189
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,320
Have a read.

190
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,140
The Terms of our Dating Probation.

191
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,310
One, we don’t set the end time of this probation.

192
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,860
Two, people can’t know we’re together.

193
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Finish it.

194
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Three, we must not talk, tag, or mention each other on any kind of social media platform.

195
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,340
But I don’t do that anymore these days

196
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:42,650
Four, we can take care of each other but not in the public eye

197
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,290
Do you agree to these terms?

198
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,490
Don’t tell me you’d been gone because you spent time writing this

199
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,150
You just called me academic.

200
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,460
You are such a nerd.

201
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,150
You’re bullying me.

202
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,760
I agree to this

203
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,180
Are you sure?

204
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,780
Yes.

205
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,670
Then…

206
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,950
From this moment on

207
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
you and I are…

208
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,950
together.

209
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Don’t be an ass and hurt my feelings

210
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,320
We’re not done.

211
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,050
I agree to the terms, but I haven't stamped it yet

212
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,820
Come on.

213
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,130
It isn’t an official contract. You don’t have to…

214
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,480
I do.

215
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Because now we are…

216
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
officially together.

217
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,320
What are you smiling at, Sutthaya?

218
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,410
You are always the one to kiss first

219
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,620
Can it be my turn to kiss you now?

220
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,780
You are that bold?

221
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
We are right in front of your house

222
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,730
No one is home

223
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Come on then

224
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
What’s up, Duean!

225
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
Hey, who were you talking to?

226
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,480
No one. There’s nobody.

227
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,680
I saw someone.

228
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
You did not.

229
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560
Are you sure? I think I saw someone.

230
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,630
There’s no one.

231
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,850
Seriously, I saw someone just now.

232
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,570
No, you didn’t.

233
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,890
Trust me. It was nothing.

234
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,050
No.

235
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,330
I was wrong?

236
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
You were

237
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,980
I wasn’t.

238
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,480
You were

239
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,740
I wasn’t.

240
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,000
You were.

241
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,840
I was not!

242
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,270
Maybe it’s a ghost

243
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,000
It’s a guy, not a ghost.

244
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,030
Shit!

245
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,800
It’s a guy, not a water monitor

246
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,160
What are you doing here? Get out.

247
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,580
Mork, get out.

248
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,960
I’m serious.

249
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,590
Why are you in my house?

250
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
What are you doing?

251
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,980
Stretching.

252
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,940
I’ve been reading for so long.

253
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,070
My muscles are tense.

254
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,990
You are getting weirder every day.

255
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,510
I’m not.

256
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:04,480
By the way, mom left a note saying they’re working till the morning. We need to fix ourselves dinner.

257
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,260
Can you go get dinner for us?

258
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,400
I already ate

259
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,790
But I haven’t eaten. Can you go buy me dinner?

260
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,580
I don’t want to go out. Just order something in.

261
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,460
Please, my beloved big brother.

262
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,840
Will you go out and get me food?

263
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,980
Just order a delivery

264
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,080
Please.

265
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,310
It’s far.

266
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Come on. Just go.

267
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,990
Where did he go?

268
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,880
Where did what go?

269
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
I thought you left already.

270
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,370
I didn’t know where to hide.

271
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,710
Shit! Why are you hiding in here?

272
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,120
I wanted to get out.

273
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,870
But I heard that he was going out to get you some food

274
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,630
I was afraid to be seen.

275
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,540
So you decided to come here?

276
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,000
What were you thinking?

277
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,340
I wasn’t thinking.

278
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,810
I just wanted to be near you.

279
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,690
I just wanted to be near you.

280
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,160
No. It isn’t the time to be romantic

281
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
What did you say?

282
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,800
Nothing. I wasn’t talking to you.

283
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,310
What?

284
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Mork, get out.

285
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,500
Just go, Mork

286
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,150
Is this your toothbrush?

287
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,480
Yes.

288
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,220
So you have two clips?

289
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,680
Yes. Why?

290
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,170
I have one too

291
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
Where did you get it?

292
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,210
Muang Nan gave it to me.

293
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,350
What did you just say, Pi?

294
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,370
Damn it!

295
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
What did you say? I can’t hear you

296
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,370
Asshole, what are you laughing at?

297
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,200
Nothing, Duean. I wasn’t talking to you.

298
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,250
Who are you talking to then?

299
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,290
No one.

300
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,570
Duean, I’m pooping and there’s no toilet paper here.

301
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,800
Can you go get me some?

302
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,180
I didn’t hear that, Pi.

303
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,550
Do not come in

304
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,040
Can you please grab toilet paper for me? I am pooping

305
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,890
What’s with you today?

306
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,220
Alright, alright.

307
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
Quickly.

308
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,720
Here. Hide here.

309
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,680
Here is your toilet paper.

310
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,810
Thank you.

311
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,820
Wait a minute!

312
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,920
You just told me you were pooping.

313
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,810
I’m done.

314
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,130
How did you clean your ass?

315
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,990
I used a bum gun

316
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,360
Right!

317
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Then why did you ask me to go get toilet paper?

318
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,500
You must be hiding something from me.

319
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,260
What an asshole!!

320
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,960
Are you calling me an ass?

321
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,270
Yes, I am calling you an ass

322
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,350
What’s up with you?

323
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,130
Aren’t you going to take a shower?

324
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,680
I am about to.

325
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,690
You’re taking off your clothes here?

326
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,510
Of course. It’s not like you haven’t seen me naked before.

327
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,370
I don’t want to see

328
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,900
You’re horrible.

329
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,060
Don’t act like you haven’t seen.

330
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,410
Are you going to take a shower or not?

331
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,120
Don’t make me kick your ass

332
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,990
Go!

333
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,240
Your brother is gross.

334
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,670
Not just gross. He’s filthy

335
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,200
You can go now.

336
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,320
Duean will come out once he’s done showering.

337
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Why aren’t you going?

338
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Mork, I’m being serious. Run!

339
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,180
I’m in your bedroom right now, near your bed.

340
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,340
Do you think I can find a chance like this so easily?

341
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,540
No, Mork. You have to go now.

342
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,550
Duean will be out soon. Go!

343
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,530
He just got in there. He can’t be that fast.

344
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,830
He’s a fast shower-taker.

345
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,800
Come on, Pi.

346
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,260
No. I insist

347
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,370
You must go now.

348
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,800
Don’t make me force you, Pi.

349
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,470
Mork, no!

350
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,640
I am serious

351
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,760
Mork!

352
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,450
I just want one more kiss

353
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,530
We can make it in time

354
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,740
Gosh! Your brother took a shower really fast.

355
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,230
I told you

356
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,120
What did you say?

357
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,690
Nothing. I’m having irritation in my throat.

358
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,610
Duean, that was a really quick shower.

359
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,800
I’m saving water

360
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,670
It’s an economical shower, you know?

361
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,570
You’ve been acting weird today

362
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,750
No. I’m very normal.

363
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,090
Normal, my ass!

364
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,370
It’s very hot but you’re burying yourself under a blanket.

365
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,000
The aircon is pretty cold.

366
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,230
Is that so?

367
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,390
I’m turning the temperature up for you

368
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,410
Your feet.

369
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,370
Pi!

370
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,430
What?

371
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,810
Aren’t you going to take a shower?

372
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,870
No.

373
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,830
I’m too lazy for that.

374
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,700
You’re a lazy ass now?

375
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
What a mess! Disgusting!

376
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,680
Just go to bed, Duean.

377
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,070
Good night. See you in the morning.

378
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,220
You’re such a troublemaker.

379
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,930
Keep your voice down. Your brother can hear you.

380
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,050
Pi!

381
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,100
Yes.

382
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,260
Have you seen my power bank?

383
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,420
No. It isn’t here for sure

384
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,310
This is my bed.

385
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,550
Then where is it?

386
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,870
There!

387
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,980
You just said you haven’t seen it.

388
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Pi.

389
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,850
I’m sorry. Here it is

390
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,150
Hold on.

391
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,380
What now?

392
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,090
How did it get there?

393
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,340
I was doing my abs workout and it was pushed up here.

394
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
That’s awesome

395
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Pi! What’s happening?

396
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,600
I tightened my core so much that I’m having a cramp.

397
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,940
Let me help you.

398
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,000
No need.

399
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,670
You can go to bed now.

400
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,870
Can we swap beds tonight?

401
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,800
I pee quite often, and I don’t want to climb up and down

402
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,840
Damn it!!

403
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,170
Just go sleep in Wan’s bed.

404
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,670
Go!

405
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,320
Why are you shouting at me?

406
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,000
Stop asking questions already.

407
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,050
I need to sleep

408
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,670
Just go. I’ll take some rest

409
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,430
Go!

410
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,520
What’s up with you?

411
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
Once he falls asleep, you must go.

412
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,640
How much longer?

413
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Not very long. He falls asleep really fast.

414
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,310
1:00 AM

415
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,210
Hey!

416
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,660
Hmm.

417
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,690
Were you at the MediZeed Festival today?

418
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,050
No.

419
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,400
You said he fell asleep fast.

420
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,510
There was this poorly decorated board.

421
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,040
The staples on it cut someone’s finger.

422
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,290
I was so furious

423
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,640
Do you know who was in charge of this event?

424
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
I’ll throw a punch in his face

425
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
I don’t know

426
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,390
2:00 AM

427
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,140
Hey!

428
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,970
What?

429
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,750
Don’t forget to find out for me

430
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,160
Alright.

431
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,250
3:00 AM

432
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:24,930
Hey!

433
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,110
Damn!

434
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,560
Who are you cursing at?

435
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,570
A doll.

436
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,790
Fine then.

437
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,130
4:00 AM

438
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,130
Hey!

439
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,160
Yo, Pi!

440
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,010
Sleeping already?

441
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,150
What?

442
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
Fine, I’ll quit talking.

443
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,070
Pi.

444
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Hey.

445
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,900
Are you sleeping?

446
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,910
Aren’t you going to wake up?

447
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,180
Fine. I’ll bite you if you don’t wake up.

448
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,350
Ouch!

449
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,560
Shit!

450
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,540
Why did you bite me?

451
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,200
To wake you up.

452
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,050
Your brother fell asleep.

453
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,030
Get home safe.

454
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,390
Let me know when you’re home.

455
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,010
You care about me?

456
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,860
No, I care about a dog around here

457
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,770
So you sneaked in to see my brother?

458
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
What are you doing at my house at this hour?

459
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,250
That’s right. Deal with him.

460
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,350
He’s bothering me again

461
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,150
Right!

462
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,350
Right what?

463
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,870
You asshole, stop following my brother

464
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,400
I’ll never allow him to date you.

465
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,810
You came really late. It’s almost dawn now

466
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,110
Don’t you have some manners?

467
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,710
It’s so inappropriate.

468
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,600
Just get out of here, d*ckhead.

469
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,010
I’m leaving now.

470
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,250
See you.

471
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
See who? No way!

472
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,000
Just go already. Go!

473
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,850
Why are you still here? Go!

474
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,170
What are you looking at, Duean?

475
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,560
Mork, get going already.

476
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
Leave now

477
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,610
What the heck is going on with you?

478
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,660
Why?

479
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,850
Why are you whistling?

480
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,550
I’m good-looking and in a good mood.

481
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,540
Why?

482
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,760
Why did you set your hair?

483
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,150
I do it every day.

484
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,380
Yeah?

485
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,030
You’re in a good temper.

486
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,760
What?

487
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,070
Nothing.

488
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,290
Haven’t you seen someone so happy before?

489
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,060
(Pi: I’m about to leave home.)

490
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,870
I’m out, Duean

491
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,120
Alright. See you.

492
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,550
(Pi: I’ve arrived at the faculty. Where are you?)

493
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
(Mork: I’m at the faculty too.)

494
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,350
(P: The Faculty of Medicine?)

495
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,690
(Mork: Dentistry.)

496
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,670
Are you two secretly dating?

497
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,840
- No.
- No.

498
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
You guys were chatting. I can tell.

499
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,470
I’ve read a lot of BL novels

500
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,250
I think you are too into those novels.

501
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,670
I was playing a game.

502
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,110
Pi, I was so happy for a moment there

503
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,790
You know what?

504
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,220
MorkBam fan page has been uploading tons of photos.

505
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,470
I can tell that it’s fake

506
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,000
You two are way more real

507
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,610
I can feel it.

508
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,630
I can smell it

509
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,530
My senses are never wrong.

510
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,510
I think your senses are wrong this time

511
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,870
We aren’t together.

512
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,470
You can ask Mork

513
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,870
I stopped chasing after Pi. I swear.

514
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,840
I told you my ship is real.

515
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,420
MorkBam is real.

516
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,570
Damn it!

517
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,330
Alright, guys.

518
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,950
That’s it for today.

519
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,780
See you next week.

520
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,170
Do we need to hold it so high?

521
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,740
It should be held above your heart

522
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,310
The bleeding will stop faster

523
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,810
What is it?

524
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,180
Your hair is stiff.

525
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,200
Don’t forget to wash the formalin off your hair when you get home

526
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,500
I know.

527
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,460
Don’t stand so close

528
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,660
I’m here just to talk to you.

529
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,150
Why were you just standing here and not washing your hands?

530
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,790
Nothing.

531
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,520
It was just thinking about something.

532
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,980
Tell me or I will…

533
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,940
Don’t.

534
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,410
People can see

535
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,820
People are all gone

536
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,860
I already checked

537
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,710
Are you sure?

538
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,660
Yes.

539
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,200
Will you tell me now?

540
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
Nope.

541
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,230
All right.

542
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,060
I was thinking about us in the Gross Lab with Professor Ben.

543
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,660
And?

544
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:24,810
And I think the Gross Lab story is true.

545
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,930
You do?

546
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,580
So you got what you wished for?

547
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,450
Um.

548
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,070
What did you wish for?

549
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,030
I wished for…

550
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,430
a relationship with someone good.

551
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,960
That means I’m a good guy.

552
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,370
I didn’t say that.

553
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,080
You just assumed it.

554
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,050
What’s holding you back?

555
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,050
Just wash your hands already.

556
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,530
Let me do it for you.

557
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,880
Some things just never change.

558
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,660
Duean, why do you keep staring at me?

559
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,040
When you focus, you are kind of cute

560
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,950
What are you reading?

561
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,660
I’m preparing for the upcoming exam.

562
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,900
Which subject?

563
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,220
The one we have together.

564
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,170
Have you studied for the exam? I never see you read

565
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,850
I don’t need to.

566
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,940
I have taken this class twice.

567
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,160
Why don’t you just test me right now?

568
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,280
Are you sure?

569
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,040
Yes.

570
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,000
Alright then…

571
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,600
Define the 21st Century?

572
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,000
Easy.

573
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,300
It's a post-industrial age.

574
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,430
The 21st Century is the era of internationalization, self-development,

575
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,420
digital networking, aging society, advanced technology, and collectivism

576
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,780
How’s that? Am I clever?

577
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
See? I’m smart.

578
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,450
Stop.

579
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,740
Alright, you’re smart.

580
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,070
Throw your questions at me. Come on.

581
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,030
Okay.

582
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,310
Describe the Torrance Theory. What’s it about?

583
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,770
Who is Torrance?

584
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,990
I don’t know

585
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,770
Then tell me about Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory.

586
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,050
Guilford who?

587
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,560
I don’t know Torrance. Do you think I know Guilford?

588
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,520
I have no idea.

589
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,760
Then…

590
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,540
The characteristics of an outcome of creative thinking?

591
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,510
I don’t know.

592
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,010
You just said you’re smart

593
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,480
All I know is today…

594
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,180
you are very cute.

595
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,990
Come on, Duean.

596
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,460
It isn’t the time to play around. We’re studying.

597
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,910
The exam is very soon.

598
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:11,640
If you don’t take it seriously, you might fail and become a sixth-year student.

599
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,280
...six-year student…

600
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,020
And if you are still like this, you might end up being a seventh-year student.

601
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,410
...seventh-year student…

602
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,260
Dumbass!

603
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,430
I am not dumb. Stop calling me dumb.

604
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,280
Duean, what’s wrong?

605
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,360
Duean

606
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Duean

607
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,890
I was just joking.

608
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,840
Don’t be scared. I will help you.

609
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,180
You will pass easily. I will be your tutor every single day.

610
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,610
Really?

611
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,560
Really.

612
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,760
Come on. I’ll help you

613
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,820
Don’t abandon me.

614
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,140
I know. I know.

615
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,560
You will surely pass

616
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,540
I’m not dumb.

617
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:09,200
(The story of a fifth-year student ep.10 is over.)

618
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,260
Some snacks to eat when you’re hungry

619
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,710
I have some snacks for you too.

620
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,480
What are you looking at?

621
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,860
I don’t know you.

622
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,860
Why did you raise your eyebrows at me? I don’t know you

623
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,210
It’s my business

624
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,130
You can’t let people know that we know each other.

625
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,140
Okay!

626
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,850
You can’t tell people either that we know each other

627
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,950
I’m going to read by myself somewhere quiet

628
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,180
Don’t follow me

629
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,220
Of course, I won’t

630
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
I’m not in the same place as you

631
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,820
I’m not in the same place as you either.

632
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,150
Hold on a second.

633
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,730
What are you doing?

634
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
I’m thirsty.

635
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,370
That’s mine.

636
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,030
Because it’s yours. That’s why I want to drink it.

637
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,380
It’s like I get to indirectly kiss you

638
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Well then.

639
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,880
It’s my turn to kiss you back

640
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,090
So?

641
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,790
The food I bought for you, is it good?

642
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,970
It is.

643
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,660
I wasn’t sure at first.

644
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,940
I thought it might be too hot for you.

645
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,050
This tasty dish is better than plain meals at home

646
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,090
It’s okay.

647
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,090
I didn’t know you wanted something hot.

648
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,440
Otherwise, I’d have gotten you something else.

649
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,680
What?

650
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,220
Me

651
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,550
I'm going to get some drinks. Do you want anything?

652
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,180
Surprise me. Guess what I want.

653
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,290
Fine. Just don’t complain afterwards.

654
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,230
I’m okay with whatever you bought me.

655
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,410
I’ll be right back.

656
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Sit back down, Pi.

657
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,500
What is it, Duean?

658
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,660
Are you two secretly dating?

659
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,240
Where did you get that idea?

660
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,900
From these.

661
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,970
Duean, I’m your brother

662
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,140
What are you doing?

663
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,730
Of course, you are

664
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,380
And I’m a pervert.

665
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,130
What a d*ck!

666
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,050
Not me!

667
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,430
Look again

668
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Meen, can I get a hug?

669
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,080
Why do you get yourself involved with Meen?

670
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,310
It’s your brother who shadows me everywhere

671
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,210
Then please stay away from him.

672
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,600
How about you stay away from my brother too?

673
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,280
What is the fuss all about?

674
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,500
Can you please stop caring about other people and just care about me?
