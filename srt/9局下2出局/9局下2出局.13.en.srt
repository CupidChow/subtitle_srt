00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:55,226
- What is this?
- What?

3
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:57,147
What's up with this rental list?

4
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,679
Please don't go through my desk drawer.

5
00:00:58,788 --> 00:00:59,765
I am asking you what is this?

6
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,054
Well, how long can we live like this?

7
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:04,288
I've saved some money now.

8
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,175
How much money have you saved?

9
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:07,967
I've saved enough..
even to your standards.

10
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:08,804
Why?

11
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:11,572
Why are you trying to leave now?

12
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:14,072
Is it that you're trying to avoid me
now that I've got a girlfriend?

13
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:15,641
It is because of that too.

14
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:18,387
Your passion for her runs deeper than for me anyway.

15
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,642
I won't be dating her at home,
so don't worry about it.

16
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:23,030
Why are you raising your voice?
You're supposed to leave when your time's up!

17
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,087
Well, your time's not up yet!
You can stay for another month or two!

18
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,638
What's so important about how long I stay?

19
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:29,522
Anyway, since you returned to Korea,
the agreement is considered as void.

20
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:30,391
No way.

21
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,248
What?

22
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,119
For someone who was so anxious about
nearing the end of the contract,

23
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:37,159
- Why are you trying to go through this now?
- Hey.

24
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,486
You've tried to rent places before.

25
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:40,365
Did you ever find a place worthy enough to live in?

26
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:43,384
Unless you get a place where you get
some sun and the air gets circulated.

27
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,886
Don't move out.
I'll find a place for you.

28
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:47,194
Do you think I can afford that?

29
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:49,896
You said that the books were selling well!
You said you think you're going to get a bonus!

30
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:52,150
You can leave at that time.
It'll be ok then, wouldn't it?

31
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:54,161
Why are you being like this?

32
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:56,662
Why are you moving out so rashly?

33
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,874
Do you know how disappointed I was
whenever I hear that?

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,029
Will you not miss this place?

35
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:02,155
It's not like you're going to be here all that long anyway. Just stay!

36
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,443
We're trying to step into it and so don't
you think we each need to prepare ourselves for it?

37
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:07,120
So how is it that you think you can
do this however you want?

38
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:24,626
Because I'll miss this place too much.

39
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:29,271
This was just a temporary place for me to stop in.

40
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:31,632
I think I forgot that.

41
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,406
That...

42
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,382
Why is it that you only realized that just now?

43
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:40,135
We've come to our limit.

44
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:43,916
If we keep going like this,

45
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:47,996
next time, when it is really time fore me to move out,

46
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,782
I am afraid I won’t be able to take it.

47
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:55,087
You are right.

48
00:02:55,386 --> 00:03:00,482
When someone moves in or out,
both parties need some time to prepare.

49
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:07,798
So, you have to be prepared too.

50
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:25,313
<i>when you're sleeping on my shoulder</i>

51
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:32,054
<i>Looking at you</i>

52
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:39,477
<i>Without being said, it can be felt that</i>

53
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,348
<i>The one I love is you</i>

54
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:47,324
<i>Oh...</i>

55
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,900
<i>Like a fool</i>

56
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:53,766
<i>Because of pride</i>

57
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,920
<i>Not a word was said</i>

58
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:05,889
<i>Telling myself this is not love</i>

59
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:09,386
<i>Lying to myself that this is not possible</i>

60
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,719
<i>But in my heart, there was already  you</i>

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:22,809
<i>I can’t face you again</i>

62
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:27,200
<i>this is the one that is yours,
don’t get it mixed up</i>

63
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:32,302
<i>because I love you too much</i>

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,991
Yeah..

65
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,077
<i>I'll pick you up in a while.</i>

66
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:48,211
No, I'll come to you.
When will you be done?

67
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:51,291
<i>Didn’t you say to meet at 3 at the branded bookshop?</i>

68
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:52,888
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:55,366
I heard that there's going to a signing
for that author from Nan Hee's company.

70
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,789
Didn't anyone tell you?

71
00:04:58,174 --> 00:04:59,514
No, I didn’t know.

72
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:02,953
Mi Kyung mentioned it to me while I was talking to her.

73
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:10,021
They're dating again.

74
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:12,895
Wow! So soon after meeting up again?

75
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:14,639
Well, this…is a good thing, right?

76
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,489
They must be dating because they like each other.

77
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,184
That means it is a good thing.

78
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:20,657
Hyung Tae, sure is one lucky guy!

79
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:23,094
Do you have any idea how much Sung Ah earns in one year?

80
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:24,321
So what if she makes a lot?

81
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,397
Hey! What does it matter how much it is?

82
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:28,553
Honestly speaking, I feel that it's a little pitiful for Hyung Tae.

83
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,768
Does he have low self-esteem?

84
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:33,316
I just cannot understand it.

85
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:36,404
Chun Hee, you should try falling in love yourself once.

86
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:40,717
Since you can't understand the reasons for it,
just experience it by yourself.

87
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:43,787
You have no idea how flawless Chun Hee's heart is?

88
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,683
There is not even a scar,
so lively and heartily jumping around.

89
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,481
-Thank you
-Thank you...

90
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:06,120
-Hello
- Hello...

91
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:08,354
The book is really good.

92
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,995
There are really a lot of people here.

93
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:22,022
Hold on.

94
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:28,803
At a time like this, you're supposed to make a keepsake of it.

95
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:32,573
Jiang and Comics revival.

96
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,977
- President.
- Do I look good?

97
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:40,352
I think President Nam looks too pleased.

98
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:45,212
Should we print more copies of the books?

99
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:46,756
I'm going to see how things are going.

100
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:50,987
You really have no idea how this works, do you?

101
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:53,738
I will go check on author Shin. I'll be back.

102
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,352
It's all going so well.

103
00:06:57,587 --> 00:07:00,250
And there doesn't seem to be any problems.

104
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:03,096
But why am I getting this uncomfortable feeling?

105
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,824
What about?

106
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,187
I am not sure too.

107
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:11,059
You know the feeling you have when
you forget something really important?

108
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:13,455
That sort of feeling.

109
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:18,428
I'm going to go over to that side of the room.

110
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,580
Nan Hee.

111
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:24,247
Sung Ah, So you came?

112
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:28,863
The author must be really popular.
The line is really long.

113
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:32,820
She is popular but she's also obnoxious.

114
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,714
Don’t pull the long face.

115
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,858
Hey!

116
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:49,728
Is it ok for me to get her signature too?

117
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:51,590
It'd be an honor

118
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:54,040
Although I'm not sure if she'd realize that or not.

119
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:57,026
Hey you guys!

120
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,285
All of you came.

121
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:03,332
Hey, hey, hey, don’t ask too many questions.

122
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,272
Will this do?

123
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,586
Let's buy the book first and then get in line.

124
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:18,917
Congratulations.

125
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:25,156
Well, I shouldn't be getting that greeting, but thank you.

126
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,029
See you in a while.

127
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,786
Thank you.

128
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:42,276
She doesn't seem to be ordinary, does she?

129
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:47,753
Nan Hee really fought with her over a guy before?

130
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:50,077
Look at the color of the cover.

131
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,195
Can’t be designed by Nan Hee can it?

132
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:54,677
Hey, take a look at the content.

133
00:08:54,735 --> 00:09:00,364
It's filled with the author's self interest.

134
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:06,204
Manager Hong. So those people over there are your friends?

135
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:07,925
Yeah.

136
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,996
I don't think it's all that bad being in your 30's.

137
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,519
So charismatic.

138
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,499
Wow! You guys sure seem extraordinary!

139
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:18,948
Hmm…

140
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:22,466
I guess so, now that I've taken a step back to look at them.

141
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,493
They're not completely mature,

142
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:27,815
but you can tell they've had their share of bitterness in life.

143
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,898
The pain of youth seems to have settled
somewhat comfortably with them.

144
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:35,804
The agony of the youth time etched on the face.

145
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:39,209
That's not too bad either.
Do I look like that too?

146
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:42,826
Who's your roommate amongst those people over there?

147
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:44,384
That guy?

148
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,482
No. The one over that side.

149
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,847
Oh...

150
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,478
She…

151
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,165
She knows that we live together!

152
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,974
- Nan Hee.
- Get up, Get up.

153
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:04,790
- Oh, Ajusshi.
- Oh, hello.

154
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,485
- Author Shin.
- Manager Hong.

155
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:10,084
Your roommate came too?

156
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:13,540
What?

157
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:20,900
Roommate?

158
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:31,899
So what do you want me to do about it?

159
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:34,926
What more do you want to hear?
I'm telling you, that's all there's to it!

160
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,862
Ok, let's break this up.
Everybody go home!

161
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:40,803
What, and leave the two of you alone?

162
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,234
How long are you going to live like this?

163
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,475
I'll be moving out pretty soon.

164
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,012
Hey, stop being so relentless.
Nan Hee is feeling bad.

165
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:54,939
Sung Ah.

166
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,496
I should be addressing this issue with you
and not to the rest of these guys.

167
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,823
But I have to keep the promise I made to Nan Hee.

168
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:02,786
I was dependent on her financially.

169
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:06,974
So what you're saying is…you used
Nan Hee's money to try to come see me.

170
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:08,623
So that's why things turned out like this.

171
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,893
That's exactly what I'm saying!

172
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,215
Just make sure you remember that I'm a victim
to your sickeningly disgusting love!

173
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:14,963
You have to hold me in remembrance.

174
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:18,928
Considering the circumstances,
I guess it could happen, right?

175
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:24,217
The bathroom…over there?

176
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:35,556
Hong Nan Hee, are you crazy?

177
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,340
What?

178
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,113
You want us to believe that nothing
happened between the two of you?

179
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:39,453
She is my friend.

180
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,909
-Does that even make sense?
-Yeah!

181
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:46,758
But…does it REALLY not make sense?

182
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,993
That’s right. Everyone should have Chun Hee’s attitude.

183
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,580
Who do you think we are?

184
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:51,795
Nan Hee,

185
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:55,245
If there's even a possibility of him asking
you out, don't even think about it.

186
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,645
I know how experienced he is at chasing after skirts.

187
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,168
4 months is his limit.

188
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,654
Hyung Tae is not that kind of person!!

189
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,940
Thank you.

190
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,838
This is why we kept it a secret from all of you.

191
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:11,560
Do you think they can understand?

192
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,821
Are you a fool? You should have made sure
that little girl kept her mouth shut!

193
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:16,641
That's because you started it with all your quarreling
this morning and I forgot about it!!

194
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:17,633
What sort of excuse is this?

195
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:19,704
I am also very frustrated by this.

196
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:52,156
<i>this is the one that is yours.
Don’t get it mixed up</i>

197
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:59,847
Stop saying anymore.
Alright, I'm an idiot. satisfied?

198
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,741
So what do you want me to do about it now?

199
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:03,893
How many times do you have to
keep repeating the same thing?

200
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,105
So stubborn…

201
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:06,308
Whatever…

202
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:11,184
Hey! You know, now that I think about it,
you're always like this!

203
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:13,114
What? What am I ALWAYS like now?!?

204
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:14,701
How is it that you never lose an argument?

205
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:15,983
Does it mean you're always right?

206
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:17,122
What about me?

207
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:19,195
Aren’t you like this every time?

208
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:22,415
Really like a couple.
How can that be just friendship?

209
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:24,730
Something's going on here, isn't it?

210
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:33,560
You guys shared a secret while I was gone, right?

211
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:36,792
No way!

212
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,181
I don’t mind. Nan Hee is not an outsider.

213
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:43,937
-Of course! Yes!
-It's just Nan Hee! It's ok!

214
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,604
I am a woman too.

215
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:54,864
I'm not even considered to be a possible threat?

216
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:56,171
What are you saying?

217
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,890
Everyone seems to be too reassured of me.

218
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:01,693
I am not worried about,
Hyung Tae as a guy and Nan Hee as a girl.

219
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:05,724
Even if something had happened,

220
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,243
both of you will take it as nothing happened right?

221
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,889
Because their friendship is too valuable.

222
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:12,252
Don’t be so sarcastic.

223
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,078
It is not being sarcastic.

224
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:18,751
Hey! You guys keep talking about
an accident or making a mistake,

225
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:21,253
but it's rubbing me the wrong way.

226
00:14:21,632 --> 00:14:23,783
So just stop it.

227
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:27,698
Do you think that is so simple?

228
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,388
Let's go eat.

229
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,160
Let's eat. Eat.

230
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:43,337
What?

231
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,483
Eat like this. Looks delicious.

232
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:48,649
- Eat more.
- Thank you.

233
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:00,219
Why did you react so seriously?

234
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:03,803
It's irritating that they'd talk about us like that.

235
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,463
So how did you think they'd react?

236
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:10,211
It's because they're our friends that
they'd tell us how they feel.

237
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:13,515
Our neighbors have been giving me
the glare for some time now.

238
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:14,454
Who?

239
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,387
Why?

240
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:16,896
Are you going to stand out for me again.

241
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:20,284
Forget it. Let them think however they want.

242
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,727
Why did you raise your temper at Sung Ah?

243
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,065
Because she's mocking the woman inside of me!

244
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:31,846
How are you a woman?

245
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,395
Help me out here.
I am confused.

246
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,399
Why should I help you?

247
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:53,312
Yeah, you should throw that card away.

248
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:55,941
I want that one very much.

249
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:58,723
When I was just about to throw that card down,
I felt you about to jump on it,

250
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,565
so my heart's still burning…you know?

251
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:03,415
Miss Hong.

252
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:07,895
Please use that sort of thinking to think
about important matters in life.

253
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,255
Is that considered playing cards?

254
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,749
If they keep at it, their eyes will release a poison.

255
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,262
You idiot! Why did you throw away that one?

256
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,557
Thank you.

257
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:30,198
Match the 9

258
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,227
5 here.

259
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:32,850
get rid of the 10…

260
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:37,461
No one else is going to take any?

261
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:40,494
Then I guess it's my turn.
Let's take a peek here…

262
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,616
All we're doing are playing cards…

263
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,827
he seems so lacking…

264
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,755
Just be quiet, will ya?

265
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:56,093
If you think you can beat a 5, then call "stop"

266
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,100
Stop.

267
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,815
Let's see it.

268
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:22,066
So good.

269
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:27,314
Every time I challenge you, you'll mess up.

270
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:33,844
13th inning.

271
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,941
<i>Reality and wrong intuition, truth and imagination, and getting poisoned</i>

272
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,529
Hmm…that's not Hyung Tae's cell phone ring.

273
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:18,480
Hello?

274
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,648
For you.

275
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:22,605
Thank you.

276
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:24,722
Go in.

277
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:26,903
Jun Mo.

278
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:29,203
What?

279
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:33,001
Could we talk for a bit?

280
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:40,873
I'm not sure what I should say in situation like this.

281
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,804
I know.

282
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:47,599
I was trying to remember the way we felt.
I tried looking into your window.

283
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,378
I guess it was an empty room.

284
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:52,957
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,773
I feel that I should apologize to you.

286
00:18:57,988 --> 00:19:01,437
Is your friendship really that deep or
because both parties attraction power is too weak?

287
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:03,599
I think that our remaining friendship,

288
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:06,445
is balanced with a healthy dose of attraction.

289
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,630
This friendship between men and women.

290
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:16,708
It seems harder to maintain than those
who are in a romantic relationship.

291
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:21,661
But, I think it is worth it.

292
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,602
I guess the amount of attraction has increased.

293
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:27,544
Slightly…

294
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,475
I didn't think that you would admit so quickly.

295
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:36,492
That day…I said I'd drive Hyung Tae
and ran out that way.

296
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,342
So how can I deny it?

297
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:45,387
Even though I knew I shouldn't have,
still I couldn't stop myself.

298
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:47,304
Slightly…

299
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:52,673
Sometimes the feelings come over me so suddenly.

300
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:56,624
But not enough to give up or lose the
friendship over a relationship.

301
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,492
I don't wish to lose Hyung Tae
because of a love relationship.

302
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:06,722
Thankfully, there are enough kind elements
that tie my feet together from doing it.

303
00:20:06,977 --> 00:20:08,726
But I see that you are a little angry towards Sung Ah.

304
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:11,813
If someone steps on my foot,
of course I'm angry.

305
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:16,943
What happened to your hand?

306
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,691
Oh, this?

307
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,600
I hurt it when I was making furniture.

308
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:21,906
You even know how to make furniture?

309
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:23,768
You know I like doing stuff like that.

310
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,422
It is very meaningful.

311
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:29,446
You can visualize it, draw it out,

312
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:33,061
and then without any accidental mistakes,
you put them together with nails.

313
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,685
When I do that, I don't have time to think about anything.

314
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:39,691
So you're secure about your single life, eh?

315
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:41,649
Those match-making…

316
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,794
Are you serious about them?

317
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:45,889
Of course.

318
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:52,601
Do you know? When I heard you decided
to get married, I thought I'd feel shocked.

319
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:57,224
But I felt ok with it.

320
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:01,731
I think if I suddenly hear news about you,
I would be shocked.

321
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:04,294
Are you talking about Hyung Tae now?

322
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:06,854
I'm just speechless.

323
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:12,049
You know I've been rather sensitive about it.

324
00:21:12,826 --> 00:21:15,781
I have no idea why I was so impatient.

325
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:19,632
There's something I always wanted to tell you.

326
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:27,426
While I was with you, I was always devoted only to you.

327
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,217
It's true.

328
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:37,140
Love is supposed to be joyful.

329
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:41,944
But I'm very sad that at the end,
I only hurt you.

330
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,507
So I feel very sorry towards you.

331
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,705
I know.

332
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:58,615
I think it would've been great if we could've met in
our 30's rather than when we were 17.

333
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:02,817
I mean, I have so much more now than I did back then.

334
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:07,511
When I was young, I hated the me
that always seem to be shaken.

335
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:13,314
After I got the strength to control myself,
I can take everything easily.

336
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:17,409
I have the confidence to make my woman feels secure.

337
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:24,546
Recently, I'm rather cautious about marriage these days.

338
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:32,194
But even then…actually…
I will think of you very often.

339
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:40,676
I know that today probably is not a good time to discuss this.

340
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:43,855
But…what is timing?

341
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,763
You're supposed to say it when you're ready.

342
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:50,464
I don't think I'm a passionate kind of guy.

343
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:54,213
I don't know how to express myself passionately.

344
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:59,827
Even if I lost love, I wouldn't think
that it is the end of the world.

345
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:08,448
Furthermore, I can never replace
Hyung Tae's place in your heart.

346
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,375
You'll get courage when there's nothing else to lose.

347
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:21,392
Why are you so stiff like that?

348
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:27,128
If you're really serious about getting married,

349
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:34,424
just throw me in as one person you should consider.

350
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:40,231
When you go to those match-making sessions,
you realize they're all the same, don't you?

351
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,932
Just listen to what I'm saying for now.

352
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:51,430
Get ready to do everything you need to do to complete it.

353
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:54,663
And then consider what I've said.

354
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,665
What are you doing out here?

355
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:46,173
Huh?

356
00:24:46,477 --> 00:24:49,980
Were you with…Jun Mo?

357
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:52,666
Yeah.

358
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,634
Why?

359
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,488
You go in first.

360
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,986
I will go in a while later.

361
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,112
Why?

362
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:07,078
Don't bother about me.

363
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:09,201
Go on your way.

364
00:25:09,446 --> 00:25:12,185
What did you talk about that makes you like this?

365
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:16,673
Nothing to do with you.

366
00:25:24,637 --> 00:25:26,480
I get it.

367
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,519
Oh, Sung Ah.

368
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:48,832
I'm lying in bed, getting ready to sleep.

369
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:53,859
Oh, sorry, what did you say just now?

370
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,509
I was thinking about something else.

371
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:19,552
<i>If you're really serious about getting married, </i>

372
00:26:19,784 --> 00:26:25,763
just throw me in as one person you should consider.

373
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,205
<i>Hey.. oh,</i>

374
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:30,838
<i>Come and catch me.</i>

375
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,158
When did I lay down?

376
00:28:52,286 --> 00:28:54,193
Why do you keep falling asleep at the desk?

377
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,952
Your back must be killing you.

378
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:58,768
Hmm, a little painful.

379
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,212
Do you want me to massage it?

380
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,518
It's ok.

381
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,356
Hyung Tae,

382
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:09,853
If I find a place, I'm going to move out, ok?

383
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:20,307
Yeah…you should.

384
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:26,725
I think if we keep going like this
for much longer, it'll be hard for me too.

385
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:35,464
But let me ask you for two favors.

386
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:36,726
What are they?

387
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:40,618
Firstly, Until your scenario is done,
you'll still stay for half a month, right?

388
00:29:40,806 --> 00:29:42,791
So until then, don't think about anything else.

389
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:44,185
Ok.

390
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,227
And when you're trying to find a new place, I'll go with you.

391
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,168
Ok.

392
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:18,245
<i>You are really just too much!</i>

393
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:19,930
Let's just barter.

394
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:21,776
For what?

395
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,230
The mystery of seducing a younger man for a manuscript.

396
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:28,409
Who the hell is it?

397
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:32,309
Another younger man?

398
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:34,563
Are you talking about that bowling instructor?

399
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:38,066
The one who showed up in one of
your comic book with almost no hair?

400
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:45,569
No wonder! I always did think that story was a fun one.

401
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:48,042
Really? It was good, wasn't it?

402
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,530
Does that guy reappear again in this volume too?

403
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,320
I felt that his character was just too precious to disappear.

404
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:55,660
Then…keep going for the time being?

405
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:58,468
And it if works, until forever?

406
00:30:59,432 --> 00:31:00,914
Do you know what happens to this character in this volume?

407
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:02,041
Wait!

408
00:31:02,252 --> 00:31:03,765
Don't say another word.

409
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,812
If I hear it in advance, then it won't be any fun for me.

410
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:09,626
Nam Jung! Let's make kimbap!

411
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:12,416
She [Kyung Ah, the comic book writer]
likes kimbap along with the other side dishes!

412
00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:14,746
Ok. What?

413
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:18,012
You just focus on getting that manuscript done tonight.

414
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:19,450
I'll tell you all about that “mystery”.

415
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:22,487
Ok. I think I'll be comfortable with that.

416
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:24,463
Turn on some music.

417
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,227
This is so dirty, I just can't stand it!

418
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,803
What is?

419
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:29,965
Do you have any idea how much she looks down on me?

420
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:32,503
She doesn't even let me take charge.

421
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:33,972
Like this situation, for example.

422
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:37,611
I've tried everything to get her t
o write but nothing, and then?

423
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,651
You come along and all of a sudden she starts!

424
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,294
So incredible.

425
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:47,174
Yeah! I just realize what it feels like
to be someone who's older.

426
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:51,095
When I first started, I felt the same way you did.

427
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,318
Really, she is so spiteful,
I just can't stand it!

428
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:56,271
While I have no idea about the
mystery of seducing a younger man,

429
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,180
but I do know something about the
mystery of dictating to an author.

430
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:00,772
What's that?

431
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:04,507
It doesn't matter whether a person is the devil or a murderer..

432
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:07,834
if they praise the author's work,
they're automatically considered friends.

433
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:09,767
She's so rotten!

434
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:11,776
What would be good to put in?

435
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:22,971
Is The only food she got are side dishes?

436
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,222
Rather than the fact that she likes
the side dishes to be put into her kimbap?

437
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:28,790
There are some ramen powder
that I've gathered in that drawer there.

438
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,419
Use that to make some refreshing soup.

439
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:40,809
Do you know that this author talks to the radio?

440
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:43,953
I've actually seen her scolding her teakettle!

441
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:48,550
Let's not become like her.

442
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:51,024
Let's each get married quickly.

443
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,202
What's going on that you'd show up at this time of the day?

444
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:34,040
Aren't you glad that I just showed up unannounced?

445
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:36,115
I do welcome it, but I'm in the middle of a meeting.

446
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:37,793
You can't even stay for 10 minutes?

447
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:40,815
I have to practice tonight
so I won't be able to see you.

448
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:44,500
Ok. Let's play for 10 minutes.

449
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:59,137
I was looking at your material
but it looked really hard.

450
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:03,671
You know, you're really heavily acknowledged.

451
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:11,460
I've never done it before
but can I even rival you?

452
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,985
Hey…I like that attitude!

453
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:21,992
What we can do together is stuff like this.

454
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:22,993
What's this?

455
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:24,877
I bought all the scents that I use.

456
00:34:25,057 --> 00:34:26,467
You used to wear it before as a set.

457
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,477
Cologne?

458
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,034
Yeah and shampoo, too.

459
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,972
You know yours is a little strong.

460
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,605
Then should I exchange them for something milder?

461
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:35,331
No. I'll just use these.

462
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:41,997
Look into my eyes.

463
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,250
Do you listen to my music?

464
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:54,166
More or less.

465
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,410
It's half because of work and half because of you.

466
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:03,012
Can we be like this in front of the office building?

467
00:35:03,354 --> 00:35:05,045
Should we go somewhere farther?

468
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:07,377
If we go somewhere far,

469
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:11,017
you have to bring me back in 7 minutes.

470
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:19,714
Oh! What about that author, So Eun?

471
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:22,298
Excuse me? Oh…not yet.

472
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:24,458
I'll leave another message.

473
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:26,253
What are you doing?

474
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:30,237
I just remembered something
so I was just typing it out.

475
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:31,711
Ms. Hong!

476
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:32,806
Yes, ma'am?

477
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,162
Come see me for a moment.

478
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,450
Why are you acting like this again so suddenly?

479
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,760
Just eat.

480
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:51,292
By any chance, did our bestselling author get promoted?

481
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,086
There are still a lot of chances yet.

482
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,283
So is it the problem of investment again?

483
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:59,270
The deadline for your manuscript is approaching, isn't it?

484
00:35:59,419 --> 00:36:03,973
You seemed so idle so I decided to
find out what was going on

485
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:06,170
and I discovered that there's only one week left.

486
00:36:06,371 --> 00:36:08,226
Yes. I'm sorry.

487
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:13,409
Why try to be discreet about your writing
when my office doesn't even pay you regularly?

488
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,267
You should just go about it openly.

489
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:22,917
Don't come into the office
until you've finished it.

490
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,775
Do you know what this eel signifies?

491
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:34,723
It means seducing an author.

492
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,636
No wonder the office keeps losing money
when you do crazy stuff like this.

493
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,059
Let's just see whether it turns out crazy or not.

494
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,662
Thank you so very much.

495
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:06,302
Hey, department proxy!

496
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:09,849
I heard you have a dinner meeting tonight.

497
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,323
I'd rather be the department rep instead.

498
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:14,395
What are you saying?

499
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:19,205
Then he wouldn't be shaken by one woman or the other.

500
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:22,759
How many loves do you have in there?

501
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:26,042
Can't you stop touching me in that sly way?

502
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:01,451
The degree of difficulty keeps getting
higher as it goes along, doesn't it?

503
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:13,378
Try to master the art of public appearance
before you move out, ok?

504
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:18,542
Hai Ya!

505
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,983
What are you trying to do?

506
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:23,293
You want to go up against me one time?

507
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:28,718
What are you so happy about?

508
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:31,471
Our CEO is too cool!

509
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,207
What's so cool about her?

510
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:36,085
Did she say that she acquired a
dinky little place in the next village?

511
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:38,803
She told me not to come to the office
until I finished my manuscript.

512
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,996
Oh…

513
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:43,006
Do you think I can do a good job?

514
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:48,150
Yep. Miss Hong can do everything well.

515
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:52,063
You're coming back from your dinner meeting?

516
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:56,680
But why did you drink so much?

517
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:03,074
Did something bad happen today?

518
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:15,209
Let me make you some honey water.

519
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,689
I'm really drunk.

520
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:54,368
I'm not going to remember anything.

521
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,972
Let's stay this way for just a moment.

522
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:10,472
Hyung Tae!

523
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:20,451
What are you going to do
if I really start falling deeply for you?

524
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:22,235
Hurry up and let's eat!
You're going to be late!

525
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:30,078
I don't think I should stay up all night anymore.
My mind gets too dull.

526
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,110
Is it going pretty well?

527
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:38,175
I'll show you once you come back from home.
Read it through for me.

528
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,119
I'll do that.

529
00:43:45,485 --> 00:43:48,754
It looks like you've organized the bathroom.

530
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:53,953
Yeah…'cause I couldn't get sleepy.

531
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,907
It looked like you got some presents.

532
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:06,655
Uh…yeah.

533
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:29,988
Oh!

534
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:31,802
Oh!

535
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:34,602
What are you doing here?

536
00:44:35,002 --> 00:44:37,116
I'm here to take care of some materials.

537
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:42,076
If you haven't had breakfast,
shall we get some together?

538
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,617
Let's do that.

539
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,898
Aren't you uncomfortable, living in the hotel?

540
00:44:49,128 --> 00:44:50,265
There's no discomfort,

541
00:44:50,543 --> 00:44:53,940
but now that I'm going to be here a while,
I'm looking around for a place of my own.

542
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:56,300
Now that I think about it, I find it strange.

543
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,536
What is?

544
00:44:57,714 --> 00:45:02,507
He's got the girlfriend staying in a hotel
while the friend gets to live with him.

545
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:06,152
That's because the friend doesn't have
enough skills to stay in a hotel.

546
00:45:08,034 --> 00:45:09,968
Yes, thank you.

547
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:34,693
If there's anything more you need,
just let us know.

548
00:45:34,802 --> 00:45:36,469
Thank you.

549
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:40,235
The brunch menu here is delicious.

550
00:45:40,562 --> 00:45:42,981
Since I'm dining with a VIP,
we even get service at a buffet!

551
00:45:43,203 --> 00:45:45,579
So you don't have a girlfriend?

552
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:47,141
No, I don't.

553
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:49,297
I wonder why.

554
00:45:51,157 --> 00:45:53,690
You do like women, right?

555
00:45:53,816 --> 00:45:56,438
Is there a man who doesn't?

556
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:59,044
Then it's one or the other.

557
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:04,382
You're either too picky
or there's just too many.

558
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:10,229
I just got off.

559
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:12,659
I have to work late.

560
00:46:13,006 --> 00:46:16,832
I'll stop by your practice studio briefly on my way home.

561
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:18,441
Ok.

562
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:30,894
It's nice to come outside, right? So refreshing.

563
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,616
I think the housing cost is going to go down around here.

564
00:47:39,897 --> 00:47:41,338
Hello!

565
00:47:42,298 --> 00:47:47,515
From what I'm seeing right now, it doesn't
seem like you're in your right mind.

566
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:52,710
Since they withstood the dog days of summer,
they deserve to get some air.

567
00:47:52,942 --> 00:47:56,635
Why didn't you act like you knew me at the book event?

568
00:47:56,848 --> 00:48:00,309
Oh, well you didn't either.

569
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:05,834
It looked like you were hesitating so…
I guess the timing got lost.

570
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:09,236
I had no idea you worked at Nan Hee's office.

571
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:12,708
Look, let's not talk about this anymore.

572
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,837
I was threatening your credit card company
to try to get some money out of it,

573
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:21,633
so if my assistants knew about it,
I'd only be humiliated.

574
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:28,289
You're not going to the PC room today?

575
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:35,987
Would you like to drink some banana milk?

576
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,456
I guess you're almost done.

577
00:48:56,721 --> 00:48:58,276
How is it?

578
00:49:00,202 --> 00:49:03,649
So anxious. Am I a judge or something?

579
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:05,101
Just tell me.

580
00:49:05,249 --> 00:49:06,793
How are you going to end it for this character?

581
00:49:06,939 --> 00:49:08,148
He's keeping a secret.

582
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,548
- Oh…you mean Sung Hwi?
- Yup.

583
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:12,141
I'm writing that out now.

584
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:16,051
I'll show it to you when I'm done.
Don't talk to me for just a second.

585
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:19,117
Nan Hee!

586
00:49:19,468 --> 00:49:20,609
What?

587
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:22,899
Listen to this.

588
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:29,015
You know that Sung Ah's a performer, right?

589
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:31,236
Just listen to it carefully.

590
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,797
That middle part is an adlib.

591
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:35,377
I don't know anything about that.

592
00:49:35,535 --> 00:49:38,863
Doesn't this part sound like a melody
that Seung Wan used to whistle?

593
00:49:39,988 --> 00:49:42,612
Whenever I listen to this,
it reminds me of Seung Wan,

594
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:45,363
so I keep wanting to listen to it over and over.

595
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:47,443
Now that I'm listening to it again…

596
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,902
I guess it does sound like that whistling melody…

597
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:51,267
I'm not really sure.

598
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:53,159
You don't think so?

599
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:56,968
Look, I'm busy.
I have to finish all this today.

600
00:49:57,192 --> 00:49:59,492
And I only have 4 days to scan through this stuff.

601
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:01,329
I'm so anxious.
I feel like throwing up.

602
00:50:01,523 --> 00:50:03,497
Ok, I get it, I get it.

603
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:08,038
Hey!

604
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,789
It doesn't sound like the whistle at all.

605
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,088
Hello?

606
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:03,145
Is Hyung Tae there?

607
00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:04,597
He's not picking up his calls.

608
00:51:04,668 --> 00:51:06,504
Oh, he's getting cleaned up.

609
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:09,387
I just wanted to see his face for a little while.

610
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,900
Would it be alright if I came up?

611
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:13,833
Of course!

612
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:15,693
Should I go buy something for you?

613
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:18,004
No, just come over.

614
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:20,757
Ok.

615
00:51:28,507 --> 00:51:29,800
Hello!

616
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:31,936
Come on in!

617
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,694
Hyung Tae! Your guest is here!

618
00:51:37,865 --> 00:51:38,796
Guest?

619
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:40,332
Meeee~~!

620
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:42,513
Sit down.

621
00:51:42,773 --> 00:51:43,786
That's ok.

622
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,308
Were you in the middle of writing?

623
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,196
I heard you don't have that many days left.

624
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,173
Yeah…Do you want some tea?

625
00:51:51,392 --> 00:51:52,969
Why are you trying to entertain me like a guest?

626
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:54,709
It's not like it's the first time I'm visiting.

627
00:51:54,954 --> 00:51:55,940
But still...

628
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,550
Go ahead and keep working.
I won't bother you.

629
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:04,191
Hyung Tae! Hurry up and get out here!

630
00:52:22,081 --> 00:52:25,499
Are we like this because it's the first time
Hyung Tae's girlfriend has come up here?

631
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:28,880
I'm not quite sure what to do.

632
00:52:29,148 --> 00:52:32,305
Were you like this when Jung Joo came over too?

633
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:35,511
Huh? Well...

634
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:38,930
For some reason, I feel like an intruder.

635
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:39,963
What are you talking about?

636
00:52:40,085 --> 00:52:41,916
A guy comes out of the bathroom
just having had a shower…

637
00:52:42,178 --> 00:52:44,650
a woman who's only wearing pajamas…

638
00:52:44,855 --> 00:52:46,372
I'm a little shocked over it.

639
00:52:46,557 --> 00:52:49,453
Why are you being like this?
Now I feel uncomfortable.

640
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:53,242
I'm just going to use the bathroom.

641
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:06,792
What are you doing here?

642
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:09,233
I forgot all about our appointment.

643
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:13,131
You were in so focused on practicing that
I left after watching you for a while.

644
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,279
It smells like my shampoo.

645
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:20,561
Hey, what's wrong?

646
00:53:22,627 --> 00:53:25,554
Hey! Did you eat something bad?

647
00:53:25,766 --> 00:53:27,660
Why is she like this?

648
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:30,172
Is it because of your writing?

649
00:53:32,388 --> 00:53:33,961
Don't make me talk!

650
00:53:34,196 --> 00:53:37,027
Hey, it's going to get your hair. Your hair!

651
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,697
Hey, are you feeling better?

652
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:45,565
How can I help it if I have an allergy to it?

653
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:50,130
How is it that you're ok with everything else
EXCEPT when it comes to that shampoo?

654
00:53:50,326 --> 00:53:53,667
I'm kind of susceptible to things like that.

655
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,256
I've always used it myself so were
you like this whenever we met?

656
00:53:59,576 --> 00:54:01,981
It's mixed up with water so the smell is…

657
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:04,439
My goodness. 

658
00:54:05,503 --> 00:54:07,474
I'm sorry.

659
00:54:07,657 --> 00:54:09,635
What are you sorry about?

660
00:54:10,236 --> 00:54:12,035
I don't know!

661
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:18,232
Since I feel like I'm being rejected by
Hyung Tae's friend, I feel a little…you know.

662
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,143
Why are you being like this now?
Making me feel so awkward.

663
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:23,670
She said it was just an allergy.

664
00:54:27,457 --> 00:54:28,871
I don't think this will do.

665
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:31,631
I'm going out for some fresh air.

666
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:51,925
Why am I reacting to that smell now?!?

667
00:54:52,204 --> 00:54:55,440
Oh, it makes me so mad!

668
00:55:12,019 --> 00:55:13,473
What are you doing?

669
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:20,523
What is she doing out there like that?

670
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:27,413
Jun Mo said that he's waiting for a woman he's proposed to.

671
00:55:30,124 --> 00:55:32,924
Don't you think that's Nan Hee?

672
00:55:38,508 --> 00:55:40,483
You washed your hair again.

673
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:42,015
Yeah.

674
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:45,613
I guess we should change our perfumes.

675
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:47,469
I'll use it in a few days.

676
00:55:47,671 --> 00:55:48,873
Let's just leave it as it is.

677
00:55:49,036 --> 00:55:52,013
No, let's change it.

678
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:54,402
I dislike it now.

679
00:55:54,654 --> 00:55:57,331
Let's go.
I'll take you home.

680
00:55:57,797 --> 00:55:59,146
I brought my car.

681
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:01,396
I'll drive you.

682
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:59,486
<i>Even though living is hard </i>

683
00:56:59,805 --> 00:57:02,024
<i>Even if I fall in love</i>

684
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:07,026
<i>But someday a good day will come to me too</i>

685
00:57:07,483 --> 00:57:09,574
<i>This is the beginning</i>

686
00:57:09,918 --> 00:57:13,866
<i>The star of life is me</i>

687
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:19,757
<i>Don’t forget, who you are</i>

688
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:33,980
<i>It's okay, don't worry </i>

689
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,688
<i>It's suppose to be hard for everyone </i>

690
00:57:38,267 --> 00:57:41,124
<i>After one night's sleep</i>

691
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:45,159
<i>Everything will be fine again </i>

692
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:49,121
<i>{\a6}I don't know how to give up</i>

693
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:52,953
<i>{\a6}I'm fine and strong</i>

694
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:56,629
<i>{\a6}Always cheerful and happy</i>

695
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,991
<i>{\a6}I will patiently endure it </i>

<i>{\a6}Smile again
</i>

709
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:50,195
Did you stay up again?
You’re starting to get used to it.

710
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,043
I can sleep for the next few days.

711
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:55,106
Is there anything I can help you with?

712
00:57:55,385 --> 00:57:56,932
Can you get me a cup of coffee?

713
00:57:57,187 --> 00:57:58,176
A cold one?

714
00:57:58,477 --> 00:57:59,442
What?

715
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,260
I'll figure it out.

716
00:58:01,464 --> 00:58:02,803
Thank you.

717
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:07,230
Thank you.

718
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:09,694
Do you have any doubts?

719
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:14,109
No matter how many times I look this over,
I'm still not satisfied with it.

720
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,926
You really want to be an author that badly?

721
00:58:17,614 --> 00:58:18,922
Yeah.

722
00:58:19,507 --> 00:58:25,501
If I could cut 2 years of my life
to make you into an author, I'd like to be able to do it.

723
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,124
Sung Ah said she'll buy us dinner.

724
00:58:29,368 --> 00:58:30,626
Jun Mo said he'll be coming too.

725
00:58:30,724 --> 00:58:32,817
I know. I got a call.

726
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:33,825
Will you go there directly?

727
00:58:34,064 --> 00:58:35,681
I'll meet you there on time.

728
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:37,737
- I'm going.
- Ok.

729
00:58:45,904 --> 00:58:49,257
<i>It’s alright, just wait and see </i>

730
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,672
<i>Even if I fall ten times </i>

731
00:58:53,328 --> 00:58:56,515
<i>I will bravely get up</i>

732
00:58:57,155 --> 00:59:00,011
<i>I'm going to fight through this again </i>

733
00:59:00,511 --> 00:59:04,657
<i>Even if the rainstorm pushes me away</i>

734
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:07,842
<i>I'm fine and strong</i>

735
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:11,611
<i>Always cheerful and happy</i>

736
00:59:12,192 --> 00:59:15,067
<i>I will patiently endure it </i>

737
00:59:15,757 --> 00:59:16,519
<i>I believe</i>

738
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:17,949
<i>Even though living is hard </i>

739
00:59:18,494 --> 00:59:20,012
<i>Even if I fall in love </i>

740
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,733
<i>I will never cry or complain</i>

741
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:25,799
<i>This is the beginning</i>

742
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:28,908
<i>The star of life is me</i>

743
00:59:29,386 --> 00:59:31,289
<i>I never don't cry</i>

744
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,139
<i>Sad tears goodbye </i>

745
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:35,097
<i>Hard worries goodbye </i>

746
00:59:35,585 --> 00:59:38,884
<i>The beautiful day that I have imagined last night, here I come</i>

747
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,288
<i>Today is the beginning</i>

748
00:59:41,736 --> 00:59:44,855
<i>I am going to do well</i>

749
00:59:45,721 --> 00:59:47,524
<i>Smile again </i>

750
01:00:21,975 --> 01:00:24,642
What are you doing standing here all dazed like that?

751
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:27,247
Did you turn it in alright?

752
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,863
Yeah.

753
01:00:29,154 --> 01:00:30,833
You sure did suffer through it.

754
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,505
I feel so despondent.

755
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:36,819
This is the 11th time I'm hearing that.

756
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:40,928
Hey, we're late. Let's go.

757
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:55,710
- You're here!
- Yeah.

758
01:00:58,078 --> 01:00:59,434
There must've been a lot of traffic!

759
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:00,581
A little.

760
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:01,654
Did you already order?

761
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:03,351
No, not yet.

762
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,272
Get me a bottle of champagne.
A good one.

763
01:01:09,348 --> 01:01:10,025
Who do you want me give it to?

764
01:01:10,117 --> 01:01:12,620
Give it to me. I'll take it over personally.

765
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:14,124
Yes sir.

766
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,100
How many people submitted their manuscripts?

767
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,362
I think about a thousand.

768
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,473
Wow! I guess it really is difficult!

769
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:25,336
Hyung Tae!

770
01:01:25,446 --> 01:01:27,957
After we're done eating, let's go see a movie.

771
01:01:28,213 --> 01:01:29,817
Yeah, let's do that.

772
01:01:42,623 --> 01:01:43,529
What's this?

773
01:01:43,773 --> 01:01:46,124
I wanted a way to thank these two people here.

774
01:01:46,298 --> 01:01:47,452
Thank?
