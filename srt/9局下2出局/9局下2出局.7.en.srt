00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:06,269
Brought to you by WITH S2
Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad

2
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,860
You came?

3
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,327
I came here immediately from the airport.

4
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,025
Oh.

5
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:19,047
Sorry for not calling you.

6
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:20,705
There was a problem.

7
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:25,598
It's okay.

8
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,348
Did you eat? Let's go inside.

9
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,784
No.

10
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,892
I'll tell you right here.

11
00:00:34,714 --> 00:00:35,923
Noona.

12
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:40,039
We...

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,675
Let's get married.

14
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:45,212
Oh.

15
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:48,609
What?

16
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,503
You sure are working yourself hard.

17
00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:00,697
Careful problems don't occur.

18
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:04,357
Nan Hee.

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,290
What happened between you and that fella?

20
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,526
Ms. Hong.

21
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:41,527
7th Inning

22
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,653
<i>Oppa.</i>

23
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:15,715
<i>I am Joo Young.</i>

24
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:17,009
Oh.

25
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:21,051
<i>What did Manager Hong say?</i>

26
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:24,185
Joo Young.

27
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,398
<i>Yes?</i>

28
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,847
The incident that happened in America,

29
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,676
You have to keep it a secret.

30
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,103
Promise?

31
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,601
Can we meet now?

32
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,316
I am nearby your hostel.

33
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,829
Let's have a chat.

34
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:48,005
<i>Did he has some kind of
funny thing going on with her?</i>

35
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:49,399
<i>With that little writer?</i>

36
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,010
What are you say?

37
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:52,560
He proposed me.

38
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:54,724
That is too sudden.

39
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:56,381
The test result isn't out yet, is it?

40
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:58,680
Even the chance to join the American
baseball league has gone down the drain.

41
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,997
It is a little sudden.

42
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:04,803
Did you show your anxiety
because you are getting of age?

43
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:07,869
My mom said it out without wanting to cover it.

44
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:08,867
She found out?

45
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,077
So is that why you are rushing things?

46
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:14,222
Oh my gosh, if it has to come,
it will come eventually.

47
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,248
Hey.

48
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:18,670
She didn't object totally, right?

49
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:20,450
She was shocked.

50
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:22,622
Let her give us some time.

51
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,184
What shall I do?

52
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:27,056
But why are you wearing a mask?

53
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,776
You got a flu?

54
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:36,632
It is the side effects of the beauty equipment.

55
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,271
It's worth watching.

56
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:40,496
Says it will vanish very fast.

57
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:44,440
But it looks like the wrinkles are
a bit better, don't you think so?

58
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:49,386
That... it is the message given from above.

59
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,821
It is telling you, your love will
have the huge side effect.

60
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,991
It is because I was not too careful
and over used the equipment.

61
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,278
Should be that the kid was way too young, right?

62
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,672
Don't fool around, you bad girl.

63
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:04,894
You guys, I am really upset.

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,512
You guys always ignore me and just listen
to my love life story to kill time.

65
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,400
But it is not like that.

66
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:12,840
You guys.

67
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,434
Can't you give me some encouragement?

68
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:16,723
Nan Hee.

69
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:20,298
Go with your heart.
That is the answer, everything will be fine.

70
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,830
Can't you say that?

71
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:25,145
If majority of the people say that this is
a ridiculous love with point and stare,

72
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,587
I am willing to take it.

73
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:28,735
Even my mom's hot temper,
I am willing to withstand.

74
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,062
But, can you not treat me like this?

75
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:33,965
I also object.

76
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:36,451
What are you waiting for?

77
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:39,976
You are really... you can't treat me like this.

78
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:42,859
This is really nice, where did you buy it?

79
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:44,133
Do you want to take some home?

80
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,634
I ordered over the internet,
and later they were delivered.

81
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:48,752
Oh, thank you.

82
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:50,823
But you ate too much.

83
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:52,416
How many have you eaten?

84
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:53,981
So lonely.

85
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,344
Feel so isolated.

86
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,017
You pigs!

87
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,285
Eating so much potato,
aren't you afraid of getting diarrhea?

88
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,187
To be discovered is a good thing.

89
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:05,072
Just take it as letting the cat out of the bag.

90
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:09,015
30 years old and still having a relationship
of this sort. Don't you feel a little uneasy?

91
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,607
Put your mind to it and find a marriage partner.

92
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:12,512
Okay?

93
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,742
Did you not hear what I said?

94
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,056
I don't wish to break up with Jung Joo!

95
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,348
Look at the mirror, still can't get an answer?

96
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,601
The price of snatching away the youth of that kid,

97
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:29,432
if you use a lifetime's supply of beauty equipment,

98
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,433
you'll have to get botox every season.

99
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:34,615
Furthermore, you have to
watch him, always on your toes,

100
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:36,616
to see if he has extra-marital affairs.

101
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:37,825
Like a tigress.

102
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,744
My mom said it so many times.

103
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,138
You still are able to jump up,
looks like it has not been said enough.

104
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:43,580
All of you...

105
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,035
Park Sang Hoon.
Jun Mi Kyung.

106
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:48,135
How can you treat me like this?

107
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:50,523
When you were in your early 20s,
you got married without any foundations,

108
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,524
I supported you whole heartedly.

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,641
It is really touching.

110
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:56,839
That's right, let's hear it from you.

111
00:05:56,931 --> 00:06:01,059
A guy who has not served his military service,
what right do you have to marry him?

112
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:03,760
Does he have the ability to decide on a place to stay?

113
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,752
Both of you don't have this power.

114
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:08,281
It is entirely someone's situation seven years ago.

115
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:09,662
Isn't that right?

116
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:11,503
When you both got married,
did you have insurance?

117
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:12,685
None.

118
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:15,079
At least, there was a definite progress.

119
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,608
Isn't he just a small fry baseball player?

120
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,922
His life or where is he heading,
who can guarantee it?

121
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,902
He could have a one shot up to stardom
or he could just be nothing.

122
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,712
He still can do his best.

123
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:26,643
He failed six times already.

124
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:27,717
Hey.

125
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,633
You can also get unlucky?

126
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:33,248
Didn't I say you said it wrong?

127
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:37,422
All those you have said,
I have already thought of a 100 times.

128
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,340
But the mind is still...

129
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,268
Yes.

130
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:46,841
At my age, saying that I did not
think about these, it will be a lie.

131
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,555
But...

132
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,519
Don't you know.

133
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:51,823
This heart...

134
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,805
In here...

135
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:55,644
That is because the words
from there are too much.

136
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:58,557
When you were 20, you already had suffice it.

137
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,812
Without regrets, you did it all.

138
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:04,201
Now... can't you listen to your brain.

139
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,459
Look at you.

140
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,178
Aren't you living well?

141
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,541
Without any plans, got married at 22.

142
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,474
Now you got a baby.

143
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:12,485
You love each other, living a happy life.

144
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:14,722
- What are you saying?
- What are you saying?

145
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,113
You quarreled, right?

146
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:20,353
No wonder the atmosphere is not right.

147
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,414
Why did you have to quarrel today of all days,
in front of this huge problem?

148
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:28,695
Didn't you say you will always listen to me?

149
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:31,608
You say we are happy?

150
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,296
Stop daydreaming.

151
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:42,147
I... if only I can turn back time, if I really can,
I'll not make that decision.

152
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:44,510
Definitely not, get married.

153
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:46,556
You are really...

154
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,029
Hey,

155
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:49,916
What are you doing?

156
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,986
Because I fell in love with Mi Kyung,
my life is controlled by her now.

157
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,561
Do you now how many things of hers I dragged?

158
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,341
Parents, brothers, future.

159
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:57,909
Now...

160
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,873
You are really useless.

161
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:01,914
Not making effort, it is really revolting.

162
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:05,189
My marriage was so haphazard, now I know it.

163
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,235
Not that you know it now,
you knew it much earlier.

164
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:10,992
It's just you and me,
just take it as we don't know it.

165
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:13,350
Once the lid is opened...
afraid of being disappointed,

166
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,351
Afraid about feeling bitter
against each other, afraid of all these.

167
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:16,035
Yes.

168
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:17,877
That's right. That lid is now opened.

169
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:19,503
Then just go according to you
backing out, that will do.

170
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:20,501
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:22,188
- That's too much.
- That's too much.

172
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,431
What a joke.

173
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:26,423
It is okay to back out,
why did you still let the time drag on?

174
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:30,813
Using this style to complain in front of them,
do you feel very happy?

175
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,984
If we just walk off like that, it's okay?

176
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:39,308
If we see something more ugly,
they will feel even more embarrassed.

177
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:40,785
That's right too.

178
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:42,197
Where's the mask?

179
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,256
What?

180
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:44,406
It should be okay, right?

181
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,542
It's okay.

182
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:46,601
That's right.

183
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:50,268
But, our Nan Hee didn't find the right days.

184
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,894
That's right.

185
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:55,194
Came here in search of help.
In the end, what is this?

186
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,695
But what's up with them?

187
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:59,426
They never had this before.

188
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,635
Deep down, how can there be nothing.

189
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,935
But it is because Mi Kyung's pride is too strong,
she didn't express it out.

190
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:09,195
If Sang Hoon was to find a job,
it will be a bit better, right?

191
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,068
So old, yet no experience.

192
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,848
Really not easy.

193
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,702
So confused.

194
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,648
Not like other's feeling, right?

195
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:23,264
[Jung Joo]

196
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:24,538
<i>Love</i>

197
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:28,497
<i>Even if you don't say it,
you can feel it</i>

198
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,417
<i>You should be able to feel it...</i>

199
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,937
Not picking up?

200
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:33,750
I haven't thought of an answer,

201
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,834
I don't have the strength
to pick up the call with a smile.

202
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,397
Everything I have to fret over.

203
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:42,358
About Jung Joo, is he for real?

204
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:45,409
Can you feel if this is a real situation?

205
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,624
Is it because he is too young and said it casually
but he doesn't have a plan, that sort.

206
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:54,104
Everything is exhausting.

207
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:59,446
But can you guess how many
potatoes Mi Kyung ate?

208
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,407
In this situation, you still have
the mood to crack jokes?

209
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,788
She ate ten.

210
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:04,970
That much.

211
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:07,732
Maybe due to too much stress.

212
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:09,616
If it is so, its good.

213
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:10,829
What is it?

214
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,378
Nothing.

215
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:13,729
Chun Hee.

216
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:17,514
I am not quick enough but I am trying.

217
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:19,018
I agree.

218
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,829
But why?

219
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,284
Why treat me like this?

220
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:24,435
Why?

221
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,985
I don't know too.

222
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,084
But I get angry for no reason.

223
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:30,247
What are you doing?

224
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:31,659
I say!

225
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:34,142
I am really unfortunate.

226
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:37,672
My life is too much a pity.

227
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:41,459
Crazy! You want to get in the front page?

228
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,899
You can't treat me like this.

229
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,538
<i>The only space on earth that belongs to me.</i>

230
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,622
<i>This unlimited freedom grounds.</i>

231
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,369
Once more.

232
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:53,625
The voice is too passionate.

233
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,116
Okay.

234
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:55,957
Hold on.

235
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:58,868
Hyung Tae, I wish to change this area.
What do you think?

236
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,910
Okay, just add on one more.

237
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:05,276
<i>When it was fixed we didn't realize,
the audio sounded a little awkward.</i>

238
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:07,808
<i>This sound is really not pleasing.</i>

239
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,618
<i>Oh, headache.</i>

240
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,471
Where would there be
enough time to correct it again?

241
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:15,278
Even during my off days,
I am made to work. You are too much.

242
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:18,117
I am sorry because of you,
there is a better production outcome.

243
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:20,278
Let's go for a meal before going back.

244
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,812
Is it still early?

245
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:24,329
I already have a date with someone.

246
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:29,454
It's good to be young.

247
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:33,126
The world has no boundaries, beautiful.

248
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:36,087
Rascal.

249
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,003
Hyung Tae, you have a date with someone too?

250
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:40,555
Well, not really.

251
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,831
But I feel a little tired.

252
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:43,810
Last night, I worked all night.

253
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:48,429
Then I think I can only rent
a box of movies and go home.

254
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:50,260
Why must there be weekends...

255
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,094
Sunbae!

256
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:55,485
Yes?

257
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:57,242
I will give you a treat on Sunday.

258
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:59,662
I will fork out a little more, treat you to a buffet.

259
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:00,659
Buffet?

260
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:02,102
Salad buffet.

261
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:03,467
Rascal.

262
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:05,033
See you.

263
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:05,923
Bye.

264
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:25,694
Rascal.

265
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,868
Didn't I tell you not to be like this?

266
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:34,349
Why not? Secretly having some
skin contact, isn't it enjoyable?

267
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:36,988
You are really...

268
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:39,858
<i>Do you feel bad neglecting Chief Yoon?</i>

269
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:41,957
Feel sorry for her.

270
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:43,553
Asking her to come out in a weekend.

271
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,363
That won't do too.

272
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:47,512
The previous day's meeting
was also cancelled by you.

273
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:48,709
I know.

274
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:50,734
Anyway, she is gone.

275
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,825
Where are you going?
Aren't you going to the supermarket?

276
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:55,452
Going near by your place.

277
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:56,802
See you at the supermarket entrance.

278
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,677
<i>Okay.</i>

279
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:03,661
Oh right, I applied for a new ID and invited you
to join in as a good friend. Didn't you see it?

280
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,438
Why? Don't you have an ID already?

281
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:08,783
If we chat in the office, we have
to take note of what the others think.

282
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,408
ID is called...

283
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,555
I will see you in awhile, will tell you then.

284
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,660
Okay.

285
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:22,471
Drive safely.

286
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:24,021
You too.

287
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:38,759
I have the grocery list.

288
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:46,002
[Italian spaghetti]

289
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:50,981
Of all things, why did she learn spaghetti?

290
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:53,974
Worked the whole night,
my stomach is not feeling well.

291
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:54,726
Ah.

292
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:06,329
It has been a long time since I dated.
Dating is also very tiring.

293
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,873
<i>Considering it carefully,</i>

294
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:27,753

a marriage proposal and I don't even have a ring.</i>

295
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:45,235
<i>Considering it carefully,</i>

296

<i>although the person I love proposed to me,

and living room, monthly rent: 2 million]

00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,274
<i>I am indeed unfortunate.</i>

300
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:13,382
<i>Compared to the wedding dress, I am looking
at room rentals first, I am so unfortunate.</i>

301
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:20,227
<i>Living life seriously, but not having much savings,
one can be considered unfortunate.</i>

302
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:24,966
<i>Feels that all the headache belonged to me,
hence I feel unfortunate.</i>

303
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:43,970
<i>My unstoppable love, unfortunate.</i>

304
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,727
Hello.

305
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,995
Recently, you have been coming quite frequently.

306
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,788
If I stay at home all day, I will grow fat easily.

307
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,028
You must persist to come, if not, it will be a pity.

308
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,732
I have that intention.

309
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,113
I am coming to do a swimming card.

310
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,939
<i>Yes, hold on.</i>

00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:08,993

Sorry, that time is already full.

The rest of the time slots are available.

314
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:17,495
How about 7.00pm?

315
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,106
7:00pm?

316

We have to finish off soon.
Where did she go?

320
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:03,331
Did she go swimming again?

321
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:07,234

What are you doing?

334
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:13,122
Hey! Are you crazy! You scared me to death.

335
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:14,423
Why don't you pick up the phone?

336
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:16,933
Your mom is waiting outside
for more than an hour.

337
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,525
- Why?
- I don't know too.

338

Mom is really...

339
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:22,152
Why doesn't she give a call before coming?

340
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,044
Precisely! Why did you have to turn off the phone.

341
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:25,345
Right.

342
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,758
What is wrong with today?

343
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:31,879

You are here too.

Hey.

349
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:43,041
Why did you come here?

350
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:44,893
After I met up with Jung Joo oppa...

351
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:53,474
Why couldn't I contact you?
I was worried, so I came over.

352
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,443
Hey! Hey! Quiet, quiet!

353
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,989
Hurry and give your mom a call.

00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:59,229
That's right.

What?

359
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:13,932
Why?

360
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,213
Mom, where are you?

361
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:17,911
At your doorstep.

362
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,053
Why?

363
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:20,951
I am out.

364
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,390
<i>Where are you?</i>

365
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:24,655
What do I say?

366
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:26,409
Kang Nam.

367
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,001
Yang Pyeong.

368
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,052
Kang Pyeong.

369
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,867
Quick, tell me the number combination.

370
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:37,684
I will put the things in the house and then leave.

371
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,531
Number combination.

372
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,839
You say you can't use the number combination.

373
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:45,176
You've locked the top one too.
You can only use the keys.

374
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,275
Mom, you can give the things
to the security guards.

375
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:49,254
What?

376
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,280
I got it.

377
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:52,377
I have to get home quick.

378
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,045
Really tiring.

379
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:55,162
Your leg hurts?

380
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:58,631
Then why did you bring it here?
I can go over to get it.

381
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:00,207
Hyung Tae's mom.

382
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,315
She sent over some tile fish,
hence I brought it here.

383
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:06,967
We also received a lot, tile fish...

384
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:09,569
What we?

385
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,260
Hyung... Hyung Tae.

386
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:24,668
Mom.

387
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:26,597
What's wrong with you?

388
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:29,168
She sent tile fish to you too?

389
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:31,499
Then I shall call to thank her.

390
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:33,550
No. No it's not like that.

391
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:37,545
She sent tile fish to Hyung Tae too.
He gave me some.

392
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:40,809
What is she saying?

393
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:43,411
Mom, where are you?

394
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:46,426
I can't hear clearly.

395
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:48,783
The reception in the elevator isn't good.

396
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,635
Anyway, you can eat it.

397
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:52,160
Contact you again.

398
00:21:55,604 --> 00:21:56,415
This...

399
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:58,298
Hey.

400
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:01,451
I will go delay that ahjumma.

401
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:03,480
Too late.

402
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:28,890
Lucky.

403
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,957
Why did both of you...

404
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:37,224
Both of you... meet?

405
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:38,479
Nothing.

406
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:43,484
Can I sit like this?

407
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:44,463
Of course.

408
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:46,910
I will do it well.

409
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:48,945
What can you do well?

410
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:50,935
- Peel off the skin.
- Okay.

411
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,512
This is done, right?

412
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,593
Only need to wash it with water.

413
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:57,786
This one, you only need to peel off the skin, right?

414
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,056
Oh, yes.

415
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,169
Give me the knife. You are lack of practice.

416
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,791
Why? I want to do it.

417
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:04,698
Give it to me, dangerous, dangerous.

418
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:07,178
Jung Joo oppa, you know how to cook?

419
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:07,851
Of course, I...

420
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:10,943
Well done. Oppa, can I do it too?

421
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,647
No.

422
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:14,243
Oppa, are you doing spaghetti?

423
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:16,171
I don't know what I am doing too?

424
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,687
Oppa, what do you like to eat?

425
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:18,467
I like to eat anything.

426
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:20,840
Unexpectedly she has one more oppa, so happy.

427
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:25,303
She doesn't use formal speech with Jung Joo.

428
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:40,566
Irritating.

429
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:43,750
My life is a disaster.

430
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:50,287
When did you two start dating?

431
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:51,741
Already a week.

432
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,583
Great.

433
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:55,653
See, I knew it will be like this.

434
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:58,944
When I first saw you both, I have that feeling.

435
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:00,046
Feeling.

436
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:01,882
Do you know how to write it?

437
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:04,325
F E E L, you think I don't know?

438
00:24:05,963 --> 00:24:08,549
Ji Sun, call the police to arrest him.

439
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:10,233
Go on and call.

440
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:15,697
This one, I took it first.

441
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:17,794
No way, I saw this first.

442
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:19,064
Give me.

443
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:21,131
Jung Joo.

444
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:23,466
Take this over to unni to do it,
if not she will be bored.

445
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,522
Okay.

446
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:26,328
Noona.

447
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:32,400
Don't feel bored?

448
00:24:36,991 --> 00:24:39,119
Feels like I am in MT*.
(*a group field trip.)

449
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,163
Yes.

450
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:44,908
I didn't even praise you for working so hard.

451
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:47,234
The test must be difficult, right?

452
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:51,450
Although I didn't pass it, but I don't regret.

453
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,210
I already gave my best.

454
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:56,531
Really something, my Jung Joo.

455
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,383
Really that scary?

456
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,205
I am saying about us getting married?

457
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,833
Yes.

458
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:04,067
I also feel a little sorry towards you.

459
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,751
Why sorry?

460
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:11,876
Because of me, you had to make decisions
that shouldn't be made at your age.

461
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:12,917
Noona.

462
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:13,774
I...

463
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:16,300
I know how you feel.

464
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,193
But sorry is still sorry.

465
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:24,220
All done.

466
00:25:26,547 --> 00:25:28,139
What else do I need to do?

467
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,511
Help prepare this.

468
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:33,481
But oppa.

469
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:37,185
Does Manager Hong's mom know
that you proposed to her?

470
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:39,711
Getting married?

471
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:43,231
Just now, oppa has no reason to hide.

472
00:25:44,338 --> 00:25:45,562
Could it be...

473
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:49,067
She objected?

474
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,985
You don't need to know.

475
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:56,683
No.

476
00:25:57,586 --> 00:25:59,821
I don't know you can't say it.

477
00:26:00,203 --> 00:26:03,035
Frankly, oppa's parents might likely to disagree,

478
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:06,617
But Manager Hong's parents would be thrilled
to welcome you into their family. Isn't it?

479
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:10,183
Joo Young, how could you...

480
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,816
So disappointed in the both of them.

481
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:15,804
Being disrespectful is not some kind of talent.

482
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:17,580
How can you act so in tune?

483
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,340
Of course objected.

484
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,697
I don't have anything.

485
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:23,896
How could it be that oppa has nothing?

486
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,452
If you can get into professional arena,
you will be able to get a name.

487
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,967
Nan Hee.

488
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,681
The red wine is at the balcony.

489
00:26:29,784 --> 00:26:32,646
Oh! I'll go take it.

490
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:44,045
<i>Hyung Tae, I can't find the red wine.</i>

491
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:46,494
That side, should have it.

492
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:51,254
Hyung Tae, the wine is not here.

493
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:52,739
Not here.

494
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,295
That little miss is really not easy.
She obviously has intentions.

495
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:58,065
Then why let her into the house?
Before I come back, chase her away.

496
00:26:58,142 --> 00:26:59,351
She came with the rascal.

497
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:00,392
Then why did you say so much.

498
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:01,678
Did you say everything to the rascal?

499
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:03,018
He will be vexed.

500
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,345
Do you want me to tell him casually?
Pretending I don't know? It's so noticeable.

501
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:07,932
No. My pride will not allow it.

502
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,941
Should not be. I will be squeezed out by that girl?

503
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:13,237
Will be.

504
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,668
Then have a big quarrel.

505
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:18,046
That.

506
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,128
Because of a guy, quarrelling with a little girl.

507
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:22,096
It is too mean and miserable!

508
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:23,504
Feeling.

509
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:26,673
It feels like... I'm having a dog fight in the mud.

510
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:28,473
How can that idiot not know?

511
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,693
She gave so many flirtatious glances.

512
00:27:30,907 --> 00:27:31,642
Hey.

513
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:34,953
When you were not home, in the car,
they were so misbehaved.

514
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,034
Jung Joo... he is a little simple.

515
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:39,514
She says she is an avid fan,
will not leave easily. What can he do?

516
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,284
That rascal is not easy to chase away.

517
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:43,839
He proposed to me.

518
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,104
Have you ever seen a wolf handle women carelessly before?

519
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:47,574
She is the crazy one.

520
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,436
Actually not using polite speech with Jung Joo,
who does she dare to talk to like this?

521
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,104
Like an old couple.

522
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:58,570
After the book is successfully published,
I will pay back everything to her.

523
00:27:58,662 --> 00:27:59,917
Bad girl.

524
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:01,861
Hey.

525
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,422
What is this?

526
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:04,516
Where did the ring come from?

527
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:06,078
Ji Sun gave it to me.

528
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,445
Unfortunate.

529
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:12,087
Wine.

530
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:13,266
Not here.

531
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,473
- None?
- No.

532
00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:18,201
To talk bad about her, I lured you out.
I am stifling here.

533
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:20,589
Yes, I feel a little better too.

534
00:28:20,757 --> 00:28:22,395
<i>Where is the bathroom?</i>

535
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,729
<i>That is the bathroom.</i>

536
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:26,398
<i>Don't know if I can say this?</i>

537
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:28,341
What is she going to say again?

538
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:31,035
Don't say it. Don't say it,
please do not say anything at all.

539
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,248
<i>There is two toothbrush, two towels.</i>

540
00:28:33,371 --> 00:28:35,621
<i>Like a couple living together.</i>

541
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,488
<i>Aren't you two jealous?</i>

542
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,340
That rascal.

543
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:41,927
Don't get agitated.

544
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:44,828
Okay. Okay.

545
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:48,143
What is there to be jealous of?
They are friends.

546
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:52,016
- Unni, come here to try the taste.
- Yes.

547
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:57,428
Really delicious!

548
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:58,974
Try a little more.

549
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:04,050
Oppa, don't you mind?

550
00:29:04,188 --> 00:29:08,917
By right, guys can't stand his woman
having friends from the opposite sex.

551
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:10,662
They are so close.

552
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:14,488
What do you mean close?

553
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:16,080
Still not close?

554
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:17,778
That is right.

555
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:20,885
Don't know if I should say this.

556
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:24,722
If you don't know to say or not, it is better not to.

557
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,544
Joo Young is right.

558
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:28,472
This is not normal.

559
00:29:28,564 --> 00:29:29,896
I really don't like it.

560
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:31,197
Frankly, noona.

561
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,404
Why are you being like this again?

562
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:34,930
Afraid of being discovered,
already suffered so much.

563
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:36,629
Why should you still stay together?

564
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:39,430
Okay. I will say it all out.

565
00:29:39,506 --> 00:29:40,471
I was traveling.

566
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:41,557
Oppa, enough.

567
00:29:41,643 --> 00:29:44,765
Do you have to persuade her?
I can understand it all.

568
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:49,342
How do you dry your undergarments?

569
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,020
Not a couple.

570
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:53,897
Do you dry it in your own rooms?

571
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,724
Why are you looking at me like this?

572
00:29:58,478 --> 00:30:00,208
Enough.

573
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:04,034
Yes, I have no money,
hence I have to stay at a friend's place.

574
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,392
Do you have to embarrass someone so much?

575
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,151
Jung Joo, I was strutting out of the house.

576
00:30:10,212 --> 00:30:11,559
But I don't have money with me...

577
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:13,151
I know.

578
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,380
You!

579
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,278
Don't say anymore, got it?

580
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:20,161
I was only asking because I was curious.

581
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:22,518
If you are curious,
do a search in the internet.

582
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:23,559
You.

583
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:26,046
Set the table.

584
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:28,863
Let's quickly eat and go home, I am very tired.

585
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:32,414
Jung Joo, you go over to set the wine glasses too.

586
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:39,445
I say...

587
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,960
To provoke Jung Joo...

588
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:43,394
I know. I saw it immediately.

589
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:44,984
Unni.

590
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,876
Definitely can't let her snatch Jung Joo away.

591
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:53,146
That kind of person, better watch her well.

592
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,886
Why bother about what a child says?

593
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:59,250
If we bother, we will become like her,
the entire atmosphere will be ruined.

594
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:01,362
Hey.

595
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,046
Your girlfriend is great.

596
00:31:03,107 --> 00:31:04,515
Of course.

597
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:07,178
Right. Did you call your mom?

598
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:09,483
Such a hot day, she waited so long.

599
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:10,631
Right.

600
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:13,172
Oppa.

601
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:15,684
You are arrogating.

602
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,179
This should be done by Jung Joo.

603
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:20,138
Only because...

604
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:22,863
It's because her mom waited for so long.

605
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,250
Hold on.

606
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:33,975
We should yell something like, "Because of..."

607
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,811
- Forget it.
- Forget it.

608
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:40,381
Hey. Aren't you going to put your glass down?

609
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:42,523
I will be a university student soon.

610
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,988
But now you aren't.

611
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,330
I got it.

612
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:53,556
Let's just say once.
I am doing it for the first time.

613
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:54,673
Let her do it.

614
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,672
Do it then, since you want to.

615
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,376
I still have something I want to do.

616
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:01,111
What?

617
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:03,063
Never mind. Just like this.

618
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,966
For the idol that belongs to me only.

619
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:08,910
Me?

620
00:32:10,572 --> 00:32:12,654
So embarrassing. Why are you doing this...

621
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:16,190
Next time, you will be an idol for thousands,
but now, you only belong to me...

622
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:17,460
Got it.

623
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:18,719
For Jung Joo,

624
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,158
I'll do it.

625
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:24,045
For the idol that belongs to me.

626
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:35,529
Oh my! What shall I do!

627
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:38,131
- Carry on acting, acting.
- What to do? What to do?

628
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:51,478
Hey, you are still young,
how dare you do such thing?

629
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,947
Unni!

630
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,290
I won't see.

631
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,514
What is wrong with you all?

632
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:01,091
You didn't wear any undergarment.

633
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:02,178
I wore.

634
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:03,417
Everything is exposed.

635
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,156
I will lend you my clothes,
come to my room.

636
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:06,778
- It won't fit.
- I don't think it will fit.

637
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,324
- Kim Jung Joo!
- Oppa!

638
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:10,008
Hyung Tae... you.

639
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:11,355
Hyung!

640
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:13,245
Oh.

641
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:14,378
You.

642
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,368
Wait and see.

643
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,793
Put this on first.

644
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:34,089
Hyung.

645
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:35,736
What?

646
00:33:36,011 --> 00:33:36,899
Have a talk with me later.

647
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,062
What?

648
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:41,454
I was not saying about undergarments...

649
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:43,414
Eat up, oppa.

650
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:46,092
This is...

651
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:54,729
Going nuts.

652
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,403
Why at the most crucial time,
you go to the wrong place?

653
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:22,883
What?

654
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:26,991
Sorry.

655
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:30,220
Because I spilled the wine.

656
00:34:32,118 --> 00:34:33,802
But.

657
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:36,525
Just now.

658
00:34:38,086 --> 00:34:39,877
Manager Hong...

659
00:34:41,156 --> 00:34:42,963
About that...

660
00:34:47,774 --> 00:34:49,955
What is so funny?

661
00:34:49,993 --> 00:34:50,774
Eat up.

662
00:34:50,842 --> 00:34:52,251
Please just eat up quickly.

663
00:34:52,312 --> 00:34:54,638
Eat up quickly so you can leave.

664
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:58,413
Why is this day so long?

665
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:08,781
Thanks for your dinner,
no need to send me off.

666
00:35:11,628 --> 00:35:13,128
Who wants to send you off?

667
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:15,225
Why are there still people like you?

668
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:16,597
What is wrong with her?

669
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:18,357
She only accidentally spilled the wine.

670
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:19,612
But who do you think you are?
(note: Jung Joo is using informal speech to Hyung Tae)

671
00:35:19,673 --> 00:35:20,286
What?

672
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:23,485
Why are you interested in
girls undergarment size?

673
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,946
Hey, didn't he say he didn't mean that?

674
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:28,502
You got it wrong, Jung Joo.

675
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:29,604
Hey.

676
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:32,084
You think I am an idiot?

677
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,404
She's bad luck.

678
00:35:43,123 --> 00:35:48,087
Because you are oppa's friend,
I don't want you to hate me.

679
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,847
But I don't like both of you
staying together too.

680
00:35:53,995 --> 00:35:55,204
Ji Sun.

681
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,081
Not dislike.

682
00:35:57,249 --> 00:35:58,244
I can understand.

683
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:00,019
Ji Sun and Jung Joo.

684
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:01,305
Unni.

685
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:03,304
I have money.

686
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:06,411
Can I help you find a place?

687
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:09,228
Park Ji Sun.

688
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:19,297
Tomorrow you will be moving
back to your old house?

689
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:20,598
Yes.

690
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:25,127
Come to think of it, you haven't been back
to your old house since you came back from the test.

691
00:36:25,342 --> 00:36:26,444
Yes.

692
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,722
I am not good enough.

693
00:36:34,013 --> 00:36:34,855
What?

694
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:40,380
Jung Joo.

695
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:42,232
Why are you like this?

696
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:46,650
If I had some capability,
I will not let you continue staying there.

697
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,759
Jung Joo.

698
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:58,448
People need to prepare
and live accordingly to their age.

699
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:01,739
I couldn't do it.

700
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:04,503
This is not something you can do for me.

701
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,548
Always like this.

702
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:16,305
Keep saying that I am not
someone who can protect you.

703
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:19,397
It is determined this way.

704
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:29,290
Noona said it like that just now.

705
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:34,335
Sorry for letting me make a decision that
I should not be deciding at this age.

706
00:37:34,427 --> 00:37:39,784
That, is something that I think of
every night but am unable to say it.

707
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:42,147
After going out with me,

708
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:46,148
Noona is also facing a situation that you should
not be having headaches about at this age.

709
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:49,590
If you met a person who has
a career and is prepared,

710
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,591
That sort of situation just now
wouldn't have happened.

711
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:56,317
But.

712
00:37:58,628 --> 00:38:03,955
If I were to say sorry,
I'm afraid that noona will leave me...

713
00:38:04,793 --> 00:38:06,063
That's right.

714
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:09,920
I shouldn't be experiencing
this kind of situation now.

715
00:38:10,073 --> 00:38:11,145
I am told.

716
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,847
Noona is not afraid, right?

717
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,796
Not afraid of breaking up.

718
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:23,699
Why do you think like that?

719
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,427
You already left a few times.

720
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,942
It is because I insisted, that was
why we got back together.

721
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,028
Until now, I still have that feeling.

722
00:38:42,394 --> 00:38:43,910
Jung Joo.

723
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,802
Do you know?

724
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:52,098
Noona, you never said I love you.

725
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:57,594
Regarding the proposal...

726
00:38:57,995 --> 00:38:59,995
Though I have given you
time to slowly think about it,

727
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,670
But that's because by doing it like that,
I would look more like an adult.

728
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:08,660
Like a man.

729
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,400
I feel I should do that.

730
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,955
But seriously speaking, I feel unsettled.

731
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:19,552
It is because I snatched noona away,

732
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:22,445
But because of that statement,

733
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:24,848
I am afraid noona will leave me.

734
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:40,110
I say.

735
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:43,942
I.

736
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:49,942
Never thought that we can get this far.

737
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:54,354
Actually.

738
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,818
The first time I agreed to date you,
I was already prepared.

739
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,725
Since I agreed to a love like that,

740
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:09,788
There will be a day when we break up.

741
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:12,328
I can't sink too deep.

742
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:20,501
But Jung Joo...

743
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:24,236
I...

744
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:28,684
Love you.

745
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,613
Now I can only say these.

746
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:42,250
But it is like if you didn't say sorry.

747
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:46,876
I will also find it difficult to say it out too.

748
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,509
I love you.

749
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,062
Nan Hee came?

750
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,842
Hi.

751
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:30,755
Farewell.

752
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:33,036
Hong Nan Hee.

753
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:41,832
Next time, let's find a chance...

754
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,613
If you leave now, it feels strange.

755
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:55,659
I have been waiting for you.

756
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:00,480
I know, I know.

757
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:03,993
Let go and have a seat first.

758
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:16,333
Seating separately again?
What is wrong with you two recently?

759
00:42:16,395 --> 00:42:17,803
Something happened?

760
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,425
Yes.

761
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:21,577
Give me a soju.

762
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,046
Oh, you want soju?

763
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:31,725
It is more embarrassing than I thought.

764
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,712
Sorry.

765
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:03,956
Today, the day is so long.

766
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:23,099
Don't cry.

767
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:26,757
Why are you crying?

768
00:43:32,161 --> 00:43:33,493
Shall we go to a Noraebang*?
(*karaoke place)

769
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:35,268
What?

770
00:43:35,437 --> 00:43:36,569
Noraebang?

771
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:58,369
No need to run.

772
00:43:58,461 --> 00:43:59,863
No one is coming.

773
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,332
Hold on.

774
00:44:01,424 --> 00:44:02,404
Not coming after us.

775
00:44:02,863 --> 00:44:06,732
Hey, this is also not something costly,
they won't chase over.

776
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:10,954
Weren't we brought to the police station once?

777
00:44:11,055 --> 00:44:13,077
Just tell them honestly, won't that do?

778
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:15,970
Just say we are not satisfied
with the society, hence we did it.

779
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:17,960
This society won't like you too.

780
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:19,744
I think so too.

781
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,453
Do you think love can be ever lasting?

782
00:44:33,624 --> 00:44:34,910
Don't think so.

783
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:36,288
How can I?

784
00:44:38,798 --> 00:44:41,522
When I was 27, I realized that.

785
00:44:42,732 --> 00:44:44,772
All thanks to you.

786
00:44:46,073 --> 00:44:49,624
In actual fact, it should be because of Sung Ah.

787
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:53,971
You two, I thought that
your love will be everlasting.

788
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:58,610
But Jung Joo,

789
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:00,615
He still believes in it.

790
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:03,064
That is not...

791
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:05,161
Anything big.

792
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:07,070
Of course it is huge.

793
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:14,922
If we break up, Jung Joo will
understand that is not believable.

794
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,860
That kid that everyone likes.

795
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:18,758
You want to break up?

796
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:21,804
Don't know.

797
00:45:23,748 --> 00:45:25,738
You know the strike zone, right?

798
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,007
Don't you think that love will have those too?

799
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:35,660
When you first fall in love with someone,
good ball range is so big.

800
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:39,117
Feeling is good, appearance is good,
the capability is good too.

801
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:42,148
Good intelligence, good talent,
good leadership ability.

802
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:47,000
When you first fall in love with someone,
the strike zone becomes this big.

803
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:50,041
You had a one-sided love for the class monitor, is it?

804
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:51,633
You...

805
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:54,541
There is a path that has to be taken.

806
00:45:55,721 --> 00:46:01,522
A strike zone like that becomes
narrower as years passes by.

807
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:05,394
Know that love cannot be everlasting.

808
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:09,195
Know that things that love can do is not a lot.

809
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:14,583
Know that there is a lot more things
that should have higher priority.

810
00:46:15,296 --> 00:46:20,111
All these always appears.

811
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:25,781
Because of me, the things
that Jung Joo will lose.

812
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:30,265
Because of Jung Joo,
things that I will lose.

813
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:37,189
I was weighing that on
the opposite side of love.

814
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,990
That is of course.

815
00:46:40,474 --> 00:46:42,999
Falling in love is now.

816
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,938
Marriage is the future.

817
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:48,402
Yes, that's right.

818
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:51,472
After I weigh my future,
I am too pitiful.

819
00:46:52,452 --> 00:47:02,142
But if I can't do even that,
I will think that I am too useless.

820
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,092
Matured quite a lot.

821
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:05,770
Yes.

822
00:47:06,611 --> 00:47:09,229
Because of going through a long day.

823
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:13,810
Next time, I will not be the
useless Hong Nan Hee anymore.

824
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:15,739
Bye bye.

825
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:24,113
<i>Another day has passed</i>

826
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:32,558
<i>Because youth is forever</i>

827
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:41,087
<i>In my blurred memories</i>

828
00:47:43,713 --> 00:47:49,530
<i>Nothing is left</i>

829
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:53,004
The show has not ended.

830
00:47:58,328 --> 00:48:00,441
You can't move out from my place.

831
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:04,512
[Park Ji Sun]

832
00:48:06,226 --> 00:48:07,451
Decided.

833
00:48:07,573 --> 00:48:08,859
Are you crazy?

834
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:12,227
It wasn't easy for you to start your love life again,
because of me you're going to break up?

835
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,528
I think so too.

836
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:14,875
Are you joking?

837
00:48:14,982 --> 00:48:16,405
No.

838
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,405
After serious consideration,
started to date again.

839
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:20,425
But now, I am also very serious.

840
00:48:20,578 --> 00:48:21,772
This is crazy.

841
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:23,945
Why is this so?

842
00:48:24,062 --> 00:48:26,327
If you don't move out,
there won't be any problem.

843
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,434
Why do you have to push the decision on whether
to retain or stop the relationship to me?

844
00:48:29,526 --> 00:48:32,404
I have enough headaches
with my own problems.

845
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,773
There is nothing difficult about it.

846
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:35,104
So simple.

847
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,803
Only remain status quo for three months.

848
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,518
You have the right.

849
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,140
You idiot!

850
00:48:40,272 --> 00:48:42,277
You have the mood to remain status quo?

851
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:44,053
If it was you, will you be able to chase me out?

852
00:48:44,114 --> 00:48:45,905
Who is chasing anyone out?

853
00:48:45,951 --> 00:48:47,282
It is me who wants to leave.

854
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,707
What are you saying about leaving yourself.

855
00:48:48,768 --> 00:48:49,457
Ah!

856
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:51,524
To break up or not, it's up to you.

857
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:54,416
If it was so easy to break up,
why start in the first place?

858
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:55,304
Okay.

859
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,275
Let's think about it again.

860
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:03,837
When you say you will start dating,

861
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:06,485
I feel very consoled.

862
00:49:08,086 --> 00:49:11,606
Frankly, I feel a little sour.

863
00:49:12,831 --> 00:49:16,370
Feels like someone snatched away my toy.

864
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:21,437
Such feelings will exist between friends.

865
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:25,646
Not matter what,

866
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:30,039
It wasn't easy for you to forget Sung Ah,
to start your life again.

867
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:33,595
You have to start dating again.

868
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:35,860
But I am obstructing you now.

869
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,661
So, it has made you decide.

870
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:40,676
Why are there still people like...

871
00:49:42,268 --> 00:49:45,543
What the others say, you just listen.

872
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,079
Not only because of Ji Sun.

873
00:49:49,182 --> 00:49:51,126
I don't wish to put Jung Joo
at a difficult spot too.

874
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:52,351
So?

875
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,980
If you pack your bags and crawl
back into your mom's house,

876
00:49:54,981 --> 00:49:57,081
You don't think Jung Joo
will have a hard time?

877
00:49:57,356 --> 00:50:00,325
Hands and legs are tied,
you can't even see Jung Joo.

878
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:06,521
You.

879
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:09,399
Heard that you broke up
with Jun Mo because of me?

880
00:50:10,951 --> 00:50:12,925
You idiot.

881
00:50:13,813 --> 00:50:18,420
If I chase you out like this,
will I still be able to date Ji Sun?

882
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,748
How important you are to me.

883
00:50:24,008 --> 00:50:26,808
Because of a friend,
you are even willing to give up on love.

884
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,861
It's a little mushy.

885
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,770
The sun is out.

886
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:44,230
Quick make a decision.

887
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:46,541
I still have things to do.

888
00:50:46,648 --> 00:50:47,582
What?

889
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,469
I still have to go persuade my girl.

890
00:51:05,038 --> 00:51:08,589
[Come out for awhile, Byun Hyung Tae]

891
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,599
In my past life, I could have been a bomb.

892
00:51:31,782 --> 00:51:35,670
Why is there so many people who
have been blasted by my bomb?

893
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:38,664
All around are casualties.

894
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:17,911
Oppa!

895
00:52:19,717 --> 00:52:20,972
Joo Young.

896
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:23,727
Your interview hasn't ended?

897
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:25,748
I have finished my book.

898
00:52:32,043 --> 00:52:34,094
The pink baseball field.

899
00:52:37,669 --> 00:52:39,062
My hands are burning, right.

900
00:52:39,215 --> 00:52:39,949
Yes.

901
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:43,546
Because the excitement has yet to fade.

902
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:48,102
The feeling of completing a book is great.

903
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:50,489
Feels like the whole world belongs to me.

904
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,145
This time the book is very meaningful.

905
00:52:56,329 --> 00:52:58,640
Because the main character is
the idol that belongs to me.

906
00:52:58,778 --> 00:53:00,033
Enough.

907
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:01,956
I'm embarrassed enough already.

908
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:05,614
Noona must be so happy.

909
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:09,149
But... I never buy books.

910
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,378
I don't know when this book will start selling.

911
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:15,204
This could be the first time in your life that
you read a book from the start to the end in one shot.

912
00:53:15,265 --> 00:53:16,628
Really cool.

913
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:18,235
Then do you have the confidence?

914
00:53:18,336 --> 00:53:19,055
Oppa.

915
00:53:19,147 --> 00:53:19,974
Oh?

916
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:22,805
When we were in U.S.

917
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:26,693
After you came back from the testing ground,

918
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,243
You said you touched Curt Schilling's cap.

919
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:31,921
You were so touched, you cried.

920
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:35,380
Come to think of it, I was too emotional.

921
00:53:36,192 --> 00:53:38,720
The main character and Curt Schilling,

922
00:53:38,857 --> 00:53:44,414
in the same baseball game is on the last page.

923
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:53,032
The main character started out
from a hobby, gave up all his youth.

924
00:53:53,114 --> 00:53:56,822
Finally manage to stand in
the same field as that person.

925
00:53:57,555 --> 00:54:07,284
Previously, he only managed to touch the cap,
you were so touched to be with Curt Schilling.

926
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,678
Oppa gave up his dream
because of Manager Hong.

927
00:54:10,877 --> 00:54:13,357
It will be completed by my main character.

928
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,255
You are really bad.

929
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,015
Will you not regret?

930
00:54:17,122 --> 00:54:18,332
Not regret.

931
00:54:18,474 --> 00:54:22,453
Anyway, you did not think that you could join
the American professional baseball team so fast.

932
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,438
Anyway, you passed the test,
you should just bravely go forth.

933
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,183
So what if I passed?

934
00:54:27,366 --> 00:54:28,989
I would be in the Minor League.

935
00:54:29,053 --> 00:54:31,395
What is wrong with starting at the lowest level?

936
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:34,991
I say, so what if it is failure.

937
00:54:35,114 --> 00:54:36,645
You are still young.

938
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:37,884
Everything can start a fresh.

939
00:54:37,946 --> 00:54:39,507
That is your dream.

940
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,099
I don't wish to take risks.

941
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:45,400
An athlete that can't support myself.

942
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,675
I don't wish to do that.

943
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:52,609
Manager Hong, she didn't give
you an answer yet, right?

944
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,961
So evil.

945
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,940
The time that the other side is giving you,
is not much time left.

946
00:55:02,801 --> 00:55:04,362
Don't say anymore.

947
00:55:05,143 --> 00:55:06,964
Thank you for keeping this secret.

948
00:55:07,163 --> 00:55:09,535
I can't do without noona.

949
00:55:10,285 --> 00:55:12,330
Now that the book is done,

950
00:55:13,493 --> 00:55:15,529
Don't come looking for me anymore.

951
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:40,456
The smell of rice.

952
00:55:41,832 --> 00:55:43,439
How can you sleep so long?

953
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:45,521
It is already five.

954
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:50,097
How is Ji Sun? She is okay?

955
00:55:51,352 --> 00:55:52,806
Sorry.

956
00:55:54,287 --> 00:55:56,736
It is all my fault.

957
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:04,873
Maybe, I will leave this house.

958
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:06,740
What again?

959
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:08,653
It ended.

960
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,248
I have already though about it.

961
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:18,733
The decision is still to live together with Jung Joo.

962
00:56:22,994 --> 00:56:24,647
Congratulations.

963
00:56:25,244 --> 00:56:27,739
Still you are the best to me.

964
00:56:27,938 --> 00:56:32,218
Next time, I will meet with more difficulties.
You must say that to me more often.

965
00:56:38,959 --> 00:56:40,979
So that taste is like this.

966
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:47,550
One's toy getting snatched away.

967
00:56:50,764 --> 00:56:52,096
You...

968
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:54,790
Really can cook?

969
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:52,048
Jung Joo!

970
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,152
Jung Joo.

971
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:55,591
My baby.

972
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,172
Mom.

973
00:58:00,998 --> 00:58:03,049
Have you eaten?

974
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,702
Oh, I have eaten at the bus stop.

975
00:58:04,778 --> 00:58:05,605
Dad?

976
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:07,705
Still at school.

977
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:09,312
Come back soon.

978
00:58:11,057 --> 00:58:13,935
Well done, Jung Joo.

979
00:58:14,868 --> 00:58:18,802
Keep wishing for it,
now you finally succeeded.

980
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:19,997
What are you saying?

981
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:21,282
You rascal.

982
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,461
Such good news, why don't
you call home to tell us?

983
00:58:25,537 --> 00:58:29,808
Your dad couldn't hold it any longer,
so he gave them a call.

984
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:30,635
What?

985
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:32,808
Heard that you went to U.S.

986
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:33,880
Heavens.

987
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:37,171
Thank heavens.

988
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:39,191
That.

989
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,222
It is not, mom.

990
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,862
I'm not going.

991
00:58:44,413 --> 00:58:45,607
Why?

992
00:58:50,095 --> 00:58:53,631
Did I wake you?

993
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:55,636
<i>No, I am not sleeping.</i>

994
00:58:56,336 --> 00:58:57,729
What are you doing?

995
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,275
Nothing.

996
00:58:59,412 --> 00:59:00,438
<i>In your room?</i>

997
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:01,356
Yes.

998
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,759
It is where you grew up, right?

999
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,902
Yes, nothing has changed.

1000
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:08,198
That is great.

1001
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:09,775
Tell me about it.

1002
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:11,168
My room?

1003
00:59:11,735 --> 00:59:13,235
That...

1004
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:15,179
There is a desk.

1005
00:59:16,005 --> 00:59:17,612
A bed.

1006
00:59:17,851 --> 00:59:21,218
And a glass cabinet.

1007
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,693
Ah, there is still a glass cabinet.

1008
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,040
Are there any trophies?

1009
00:59:26,161 --> 00:59:28,212
A lot.

1010
00:59:28,763 --> 00:59:30,799
The outstanding phoenix award.

1011
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:33,278
The President's Cup most outstanding pitcher.

1012
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,314
Golden cup outstanding award.

1013
00:59:35,437 --> 00:59:36,554
<i>Outstanding youth award.</i>

1014
00:59:36,661 --> 00:59:38,222
<i>There is really a lot.</i>

1015
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:39,692
You got it all?

1016
00:59:39,768 --> 00:59:42,875
And a lot of autograph balls by star players.

1017

Noona.

1018
00:59:46,004 --> 00:59:47,887
I found something interesting.

1019
00:59:48,407 --> 00:59:50,963
I signed on the ball.

1020
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:54,193
Still remember.

1021
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:57,616
I wrote it for the time when I become famous.

1022
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:59,912
I kept on practicing my signature.

1023
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:03,616
<i>And the first glove I've used.</i>

1024
01:00:03,785 --> 01:00:05,000
You still have that?

1025
01:00:05,092 --> 01:00:07,082
Glove. Ball.

1026
01:00:07,235 --> 01:00:08,949
And baseball attire.

1027
01:00:09,071 --> 01:00:10,571
Baseball bats.

1028
01:00:10,709 --> 01:00:12,301
And base.

1029
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:14,413
Everything I started to use
when I was young is still here.

1030
01:00:14,468 --> 01:00:15,815
Nothing is short.

1031
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,917
Your life, is all in your room.

1032
01:00:20,101 --> 01:00:23,361
When you say it, is sounds like my room is so cool.

1033

1034
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:27,687
<i>Yes.</i>

1035
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:34,715
Did you think a lot?

1036
01:00:40,746 --> 01:00:44,435
Because of me, you are in vexed, right?

1037

Yes.

1042
01:01:04,464 --> 01:01:07,279
Good or bad news?

1043
01:01:08,381 --> 01:01:10,386
You can say it now.

1044
01:01:10,493 --> 01:01:12,315
It is better to say it face to face.

1045
01:01:12,391 --> 01:01:13,861
I wish to do that.

1046
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,056
