<i>Even though living is hard</i>

3
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:12,703
<i>And you fall in love</i>

4
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:17,613
<i>But someday a good day will come to me too</i>

5
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:20,001
<i>This is the beginning</i>

6
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:24,201
<i>The star of life is me</i>

7
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:31,382
<i>Don't forget forever</i>

8
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:41,024
<i>You cannot relax even one moment.</i>

9
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:44,646
<i>It's okay, don't worry</i>

10
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:48,120
<i>Anyone can go through hard times</i>

11
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:52,272
<i>After one night's sleep,
everything will be fine</i>

12
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:55,361
<i>The flow starts the topic.</i>

13
00:00:55,362 --> 00:01:03,679
<i>I don't know how to give up. I'm fine and strong</i>

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,833
<i>Always cheerful and happy I will patiently go on</i>

15
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:15,982
<i>There is a saying when one thing goes wrong,
everything else goes wrong.</i>

16
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:23,569
It is important to have a vision for the brand
on how to take care of the brand.

17
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:33,520
This information comes from ISDK's many years
of experience in marketing.

18
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:41,140
<i>Sometimes we have to subvert others
with our sure-win tactics.</i>

19
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,683
Are you going to gamble again?! Huh?

20
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:46,762
You're taking me on for a fight now, are you?

21
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:50,311
<i>Are you saying you want do something
with me right now?! Hey you!</i>

22
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:54,197
<i>There are times when you must wait
and help out in the background.</i>

23
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,248
Oh, no customer…

24
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:01,898
I always listen to your comments carefully.

25
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,215
<i>Yes, he caught that well,</i>

26
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:07,453
This kind of ball shouldn't be given away,
otherwise all your weak points will be exposed.

27
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:12,971
Looking back, there were some chances actually.

28
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:21,230
<i>The rule of thumb in baseball is,
if you don't seize the opportunity... it becomes a crisis.</i>

29
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:40,167
<i>I will not think about the past hardships.</i>

30
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:13,928
<i>Life is just like baseball.</i>

31
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:16,323
<i>At age 30, I am standing at 9 ends and 2 outs.</i>

32
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:19,877
<i>30… My youth is coming to an end
at 9 ends and 2 outs.</i>

33
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:26,778
1st Inning

34
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,196
<i>Nan Hee, have you come?</i>

35
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:33,662
You didn't sleep?

36
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,691
<i>Why are you always so late?</i>

37
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:41,221
Deadline days are always like that.

38
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,987
The winning ball.

39
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:55,958
Congratulations… you're not hurt anywhere, are you?

40
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,583
You said your shoulder was hurting yesterday.

41
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:09,358
When I see you, Noona,
it doesn't hurt.

42
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,730
- Lock your door.
- Why?

43
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:19,027
I want to go in there.

44
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:21,133
Are you crazy?

45
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:23,074
It's because I want to hug you.

46
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:25,977
I'll just hug you once and leave, huh?

47
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:31,791
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

48
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:40,965
What is this?

49
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:44,854
Ah, I found it at the playground.

50
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,182
Doing useless things.

51
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:50,419
You are already 30 years old
why are you playing with balls?

52
00:04:50,420 --> 00:05:00,170
Oh my goodness,
I am crazy for caring whether you ate or not.

53
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:09,119
Jung Choo, Jung Choo are you okay?
Jung Choo?

54
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:17,742
<i>The last night of 2006… the last night.</i>

55
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:25,047
<i>With the one you love…</i>

56
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:59,945
- Give me a beer please.
- Yes.

57
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:04,043
Do you know me?

58
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:05,135
No.

59
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,339
It seemed like our eyes keep meeting,

60
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,355
so I thought maybe you were someone I knew.

61
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:11,871
I'll buy that beer.

62
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:18,156
- It's okay.
- Look there.

63
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:21,359
If I am able to guess the action
that girl is going to do next,

64
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,631
will you let me buy you that beer?

65
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:31,188
She is going to put her hair behind her left ear.

66
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,329
That's too easy to guess.

67
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,763
Pulling back hair that has fallen to the front.

68
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:43,250
Next, she is going to tap her guitar exactly three times…
exactly three times.

69
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:49,999
If I guess correctly this time,
I am going to get three inches closer to you.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,297
Now.

71
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:59,028
Wow. How did you know?

72
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:03,189
Ahjussi, that is not a live broadcast, right?

73
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,826
<i>I'm not sure…</i>

74
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,012
I think my left ear is wrong.
My hair keeps falling down.

75
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:20,395
Look again.

76
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,286
I feel good.

77
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:26,264
You know you also have a habit of tapping your fingers.

78
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,937
Fingers?

79
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:36,555
When you play the guitar you always do it… three times.

80
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:43,990
I didn't know, do I?

81
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,939
Like this?

82
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,410
And you close your eyes like this.

83
00:07:56,421 --> 00:08:02,448
I close my eyes like this and...

84
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,919
You've seen this before, right?

85
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,882
It's a live broadcast. Still 2006.

86
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:18,828
This time you'll have to down it if I get it correct.

87
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,364
Now the girl is going to...

88
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:25,180
Yes, I am nervous. Really thank you.

89
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:31,783
I wondered whether a day like this would come in my life.

90
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:37,723
Even if I die now I will have no regrets.

91
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:40,263
When I think about how after my book is published,

92
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:46,989
people will read it and put it in their hearts…

93
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,544
I cannot express my excitement with words.

94
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:56,751
This was my tenth project.

95
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:01,948
After many failed projects, I gave up many times.

96
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:05,730
But whenever I feel the weather turn cold,

97
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,235
I remember that the Spring Literary Festival is coming.

98
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:18,795
And again like an idiot,
I held up my pen and sat in front of the desk.

99
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:23,276
I also got in a lot of trouble,
people said I had no talent...

100
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:26,694
and that it must be hard just trying to waste my time away…

101
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:37,158
Mom, now my writing is making me money.

102
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:58,419
Crazy girl.

103
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,567
Mom, thank you so much.

104
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:09,048
I only have you, mom.

105
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:15,205
Mom, you know when I was little I only thought of you…

106
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:17,907
Even sleeping she makes a commotion.

107
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:25,094
Mom, I want you to be happy.

108
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:37,810
What? What happened?

109
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:40,593
My notebook?

110
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:42,496
Mom, what are you doing right now?

111
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:43,978
Mom, why are you doing this?

112
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:45,850
Give it to me…

113
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,088
Mom, are you crazy?!

114
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:48,946
You can't give up yourself!

115
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:50,827
What am I going to do?

116
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:53,186
Holding onto these useless things,
not even getting married and wasting time.

117
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:56,432
How can I just watch this continue?

118
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,786
What?

119
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:01,882
I see that writing is also an addiction.

120
00:11:01,883 --> 00:11:04,540
It's no different from gambling.

121
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,728
I am going to see an end to this.

122
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:06,990
Just like a mother with a gambling daughter may cut off,

123
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:09,087
her daughter's hands to end her gambling addiction.

124
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:09,927
I didn't get selected at Gong-Wo Jun*,
(*writing competition)

125
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:12,123
a competition I really wanted to get into,
and this is what you do?

126
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:16,515
Instead of cheering me up, how can you this?

127
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,338
Do you know what this is to me?

128
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,515
It's all the writing I have done all my life!

129
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,872
It's my soul and heart.

130
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:24,896
I am home.

131
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:28,439
This… what is…?

132
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,097
Do you at least feel embarrassed in front of my son in-law?

133
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:30,686
Mom.

134
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,436
You say, How can you do this?

135
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:35,138
I say, "How can you do this?"

136
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:39,767
Mother in law.

137
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,275
Stop now, okay.

138
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:44,171
After tonight and when the sun rises you will be 30.

139
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:48,419
If you have failed for ten years,
you should know your position and try to get married.

140
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,278
I gave my best efforts to find you that guy,
and you say you don't want him because he's bald!

141
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,693
What's wrong with a bald guy?

142
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,673
What's wrong with a bald guy?

143
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,175
So all this is because of the matchmaking session?

144
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,919
Because it didn't work out you are making all this fuss?

145
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,174
If you were in your right mind,

146
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,329
you wouldn't live like this just out of sheer embarrassment.

147
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,382
At that age, living off your younger sister who is married,

148
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,503
are you comfortable?

149
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:10,112
Your soul can rest so peacefully in that kind of situation?

150
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:13,163
Yes, it's embarrassing. I am embarrassed too.

151
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:16,562
Even if you don't say anything here and here are all frayed.

152
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,898
So stop, I will take care of it myself.

153
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,828
What are you going to take care of?

154
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,269
I'll become independent, okay?

155
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,422
Rubbish… Crazy girl.

156
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:30,799
If you had the ability to do that,
why would I do this?

157
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,409
Mom. All the neighbors will hear.

158
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,665
Tell them to hear.

159
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,238
There is no one in this neighborhood who doesn't know,

160
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,368
this useless girl is living off this house.

161
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,374
Working for a company that barely sometimes give pay.

162
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,723
Useless girl, just quit there also.

163
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,775
There is no use working for a publishing company
that does not even pay to cover expenses.

164
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:50,231
You will just keep your hopes up if you keep working there.

165
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:52,064
How can you be so cruel?

166
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:53,035
How about you?

167
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:55,079
How can you do this to me?

168
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,163
Did I educate you less? Made you hungry?

169
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:58,322
Or not give you clothes?

170
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:00,541
How come you can not be like other people's children…

171
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:03,594
Where are you going?

172
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:08,469
I'll disappear!
You said it was your wish!

173
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,228
Do as you like.

174
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,938
<i>I call that a child.</i>

175
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:20,109
<i>I am a criminal.</i>

176
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:34,230
[Jung Joo]

177
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:38,357
Oh, Jung Joo?

178
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,784
Noona, wait… let me go.

179
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:42,914
Stop pushing…

180
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:46,277
But still, it's the last day.

181
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,656
Don't you even want to be with me, Noona?

182
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:52,670
Just go with your friends…

183
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,333
Yes, they said the weather was going to be nice,

184
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,240
and that you'll be able to see the sun rising.

185
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:02,228
Look at the sun, and receive a lot of energy.

186
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:05,741
This is a important year for you.

187
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:07,305
So, where are you going?

188
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:13,552
Hey, where did you say we were going?
Ahm Myung Doe* (*Korean island)

189
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:17,086
Jung Joo, that is in the west,

190
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,181
how are you going to see the sun rising?

191
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:22,961
Oh, you're right. We're going to Jung Dong Jin*.
(*Korean beach)

192
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,216
I got it confused.

193
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:30,131
<i>Ah… really.</i>

194
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:34,612
<i>There's six of us in this car,
it's totally crowded in here.</i>

195
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:36,176
<i>I love you, Noona.</i>

196
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:38,737
<i>- Love? It's so hot!
- I love you, noona.</i>

197
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:45,335
<i>If you love her, turn off the heater. Turn it off.</i>

198
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:57,743
[Nahm San Tower 11 o'clock, Nan Hee ]

199
00:14:57,744 --> 00:14:59,868
Why Nahm San?

200
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:03,165
What are you talking about?
You're the one who sent a text message.

201
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,851
What?

202
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:09,119
Then, you got the same message?

203
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,337
Maybe its spam.

204
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:14,260
Oh, I guess it's nothing.
Hang up, I'm busy.

205
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:19,587
Busy? You're probably flirting with a girl in a hotel.

206
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:21,988
I guess you're not home, it's loud.

207
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:28,860
Hyung Tae, should I just marry the bald guy?

208
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,409
Celebration.

209
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,931
I think I tried my best living.

210
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,086
You're going to talk long, aren't you?

211
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:45,358
Why is the last day of my 20's ending like this?

212
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,180
What?

213
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:51,642
Nahm Sahn... a few years ago we requested
a reservation text message.

214
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,364
The last day of age 29… Nahm San tower.

215
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:55,361
- The last day of age 29, Nahm San tower.
- The last day of age 29, Nahm San tower.

216
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:58,931
Ah, we did….

217
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:02,417
That day has already come.

218
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:03,873
Keep your promise.

219
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:08,323
What?

220
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,496
I can't do this.
This doesn't make sense.

221
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:24,720
Just a little longer.

222
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:27,822
Even though we are friends. We're boy and girl.

223
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:32,129
Perhaps, energy will pass through us.

224
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,696
Excuse me, but my body does not react to you as a girl.

225
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:38,965
You said let's get married if we were 30 and both still single.

226
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,573
Hey that…

227
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,185
I didn't know it was really going to work out this way.

228
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:44,965
Since it's like this, let's just do it.

229
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:46,170
It's a good thing.

230
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,300
Hey, what is good?
I have no feelings toward you.

231
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:53,016
I was joking, and with that it is now self-destroyed.

232
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:56,669
Really? No feelings?

233
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,161
You? You have feelings?

234
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:04,344
I don't need those.

235
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:10,197
Now I just want to end my uncertain future, hopeless dating,

236
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:14,578
and the tears and sighs of uncertainty.

237
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,310
Now in a few minutes I will be 30,
and my future days are dark.

238
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:23,411
I just want to marry anyone,
but instead of just any guy,

239
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:26,578
I think you are better.

240
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,773
Hey, we have been friends for like 30 years,

241
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:33,988
Isn't it time for a change, now?

242
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:37,764
Hey, are you doing a gag?

243
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,737
How long are you going to keep holding
onto the first love that has left?

244
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:41,827
Just at this time...

245
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,754
At this time what? What?

246
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:47,301
Hong find your common sense.

247
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:51,649
Red Sun*.
(*one snaps their finger, the other person gets hypnotized)

248
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,332
Hey, feel... quickly.

249
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,014
Hey, you…

250
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:59,720
Feel… try putting your arms around me.

251
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:06,491
You… You…

252
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:17,120
Look at those shoes and outfit,
exactly what am I suppose to feel?

253
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:30,934
Hey?

254
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:35,713
Ms. Hong?

255
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:51,106
I haven't done anything and I have turned 30.

256
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:56,516
That…

257
00:18:56,517 --> 00:19:02,206
Scares me.

258
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:31,500
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

259
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:38,622
You needed a friend, not a man at this time.

260
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,450
Let go.

261
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:52,877
What are you going to do?

262
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:55,373
See if I go back into this house!

263
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:58,898
Do you have somewhere to go?

264
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:03,926
Can you let me sleep at your house?

265
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:05,401
What are you trying to do?

266
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:09,183
I said I'm not going in, why did you push it?

267
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:12,621
<i>Who is it?</i>

268
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:15,169
It's me, who else.

269
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,055
Fighting!

270
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,720
<i>You said you were going to disappear.</i>

271
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:24,551
If that's your wish.

272
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:30,278
Mom, open the door?

273
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:34,354
It's cold.

274
00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:40,225
I'll go over the gate.

275
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,051
<i>I have arrived at Jung Dong Jin.</i>

276
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:07,457
<i>The noona I love. It is past 12.</i>

277
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:13,038
<i>Happy New Year.</i>

278
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,604
What money do I have?

279
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,079
Are you in big trouble again?

280
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,247
Even if I wanted to, I lack the funds to do it.

281
00:21:58,248 --> 00:22:00,632
What is the norm for the amount of money,

282
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,656
a 30 year woman should have in her savings account?

283
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:07,575
<i>Well, according to the marketing data
it should be a pretty developed number.</i>

284
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,464
<i>Why? Did you have another fight with your mom?</i>

285
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:14,225
She says my life is bankrupt.

286
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:17,101
Is that something to say at the breakfast table?

287
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:21,044
She is better than our copy writer in catching the concepts.

288
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:24,196
<i>Booguh gook or Gom gook*, which one do you want?
(*Both Korean soups)</i>

289
00:22:24,197 --> 00:22:26,350
I guess it'll be booguh gook.

290
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:28,319
<i>She made bahn chan* again for me?
(*Bahn chan: Korean side dishes)</i>

291
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,551
<i>There's still some left over from last time.</i>

292
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:33,508
Today, the orders came from your mom.

293
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:38,798
<i>Did you talk to mom?</i>

294
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:43,571
Call her and don't you know she worries
about you around this time?

295
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:50,679
<i>Okay. I was going to call her.</i>

296
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:57,460
I guess you weren't alone last night either.

297
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:01,777
If I took a picture and sent it to them,
will they be reassured?

298
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:04,337
<i>Take your mind off it.</i>

299
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:11,460
Drinking and girls, do you not gamble?

300
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:31,623
Evil girl, if you just leave like that
what about the person left over.

301
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:44,708
Chief, it's the printing company.

302
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:48,414
They're mad saying get you on the phone
because they know you are here.

303
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:50,785
Hong Nan Hee, there's a telephone call for you.

304
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:54,716
Me?

305
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:57,243
Yes, this is Hong Nan Hee.

306
00:23:57,244 --> 00:23:59,840
Yes…

307
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:01,488
Yes, I am so sorry.

308
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:03,525
Because we have not collected fully yet either.

309
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:07,560
Yes, of course we will take care of our bill with you first.

310
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:09,804
Yes…yes... I am really sorry.

311
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:13,367
Yes.

312
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,174
Chief!

313
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:18,199
Sorry. Sorry.
I was busy.

314
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,884
You are playing Go Stop,
what do you mean you're busy?

315
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:23,274
You should at least settle things
with the printing company.

316
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:25,563
If you don't pay the bill on time they make threats
on taking our machine.

317
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,700
<i>Everyone, one moment.</i>

318
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,186
It's my niece.

319
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:31,097
She's going to start working here today,

320
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:33,323
so Nan Hee please teach her well.

321
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:36,329
Hello, I'm Kim Nam Jung.

322
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:42,592
Your seat is next to Nan Hee.

323
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,547
Chief.

324
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:52,918
Looking at a young girl and thinking she is fresh…

325
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,328
means I am old, right?

326
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,820
This is the first time since we have met,

327
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:03,729
that we have felt the same way
about the same thing we looked at.

328
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:09,570
Welcome to my world.

329
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:12,236
- Hey, newbie.
- Yes.

330
00:25:12,237 --> 00:25:16,793
Come out.

331
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,896
Why can't the music fit in here?

332
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:22,393
Do you want me to put in something else?

333
00:25:22,394 --> 00:25:24,095
I do have something prepared.

334
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:26,380
Oh really?

335
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:27,882
You know Yoon Sung Ah, right?

336
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:31,342
The classic guitarist playing in Spain.

337
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:32,262
Yes.

338
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:34,894
Of course, since there is all this media buzz about her,

339
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:37,094
I guess you would know her.

340
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:39,109
Have you heard her play?

341
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,030
No.

342
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:42,801
Listen. It's remarkable.

343
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:53,057
But because it's not copyrighted in Korea,
it may be a bit difficult.

344
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:56,049
How is it?

345
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:02,340
Ah, yes. It's nice.

346
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:07,765
I am calling from ISDK in Korea.

347
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,790
Yes.

348
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:14,653
My name is Byun Hyung Tae.

349
00:26:14,654 --> 00:26:19,299
By any chance are you Yoon Sung Ah?

350
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:24,343
Hold on let me transfer you to the person in charge.

351
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:27,971
Hello? May I help you?

352
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:31,168
I'm calling regarding using some of your music.

353
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:39,008
There is some song that I really want
to use in my commercial.

354
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:04,226
Let's go.

355
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:06,947
Quickly.

356
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:08,239
Our book.

357
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,956
What are you doing?
Quickly look for our books.

358
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:13,275
It should be around here somewhere.

359
00:27:13,276 --> 00:27:15,360
Oh, this came out?

360
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:19,966
Hey, move out of the way.

361
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:24,851
Here it is.

362
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:36,626
[Spring Literary Festival
Collection of Newly Short Listed Works]

363
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:46,335
- Why?
- Oh, nothing.

364
00:27:56,548 --> 00:28:02,537
Wow, she sure is firm.

365
00:28:02,538 --> 00:28:03,924
Where are we going now?

366
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:06,790
Huh?

367
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:12,382
Do you have a boyfriend?

368
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:14,514
Why?

369
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:17,815
If there is a good guy are you going
to introduce him to me?

370
00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:22,108
Hey, hey. Let's keep order.

371
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:30,586
After I am taken care of, then you come next.

372
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:34,107
Sunbae. Sunbae, Sunbae.

373
00:28:34,108 --> 00:28:35,987
What are we eating for lunch today?

374
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:40,206
What should we eat?
Something not fattening.

375
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:44,640
Why?

376
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:47,549
<i>Noona, are you not done yet?</i>

377
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,607
You misspelled the text.

378
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:54,001
<i>I love you.</i>

379
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,590
Boyfriend?

380
00:28:56,591 --> 00:29:02,479
Yes... It is.

381
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:10,838
[I almost done. Right now at the terminal. ]

382
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,258
Oh, Jung Joo.

383
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,316
<i>I am also near the terminal, where are you?</i>

384
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,697
Oh, I just came out of the book store.

385
00:29:16,698 --> 00:29:18,193
And I can also see the mall.

386
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:20,399
Oh, I can see the mall also.

387
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,790
The mall with the bookstore in the basement.

388
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:25,246
Yes. Where are you?

389
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:30,048
Where?

390
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:45,892
Noona!

391
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:53,710
Wow, he's so amazing?

392
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,556
Right?

393
00:29:55,557 --> 00:29:58,617
He's really your boyfriend?

394
00:29:58,618 --> 00:30:05,234
That wonderful guy is mine.

395
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:09,317
But is he a college student?

396
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:14,018
Don't open the door of reality.

397
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:16,677
<i>Even though living is hard</i>

398
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:19,206
<i>And you fall in love</i>

399
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:24,134
<i>But someday a good day will come to me too</i>

400
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,588
<i>This is the beginning</i>

401
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:30,804
<i>The star of life is me</i>

402
00:30:30,805 --> 00:30:38,100
<i>Don't forget who you are</i>

403
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:55,912
You're bored, right?

404
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:57,852
No, I am okay.

405
00:30:57,853 --> 00:30:59,518
Come here.

406
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,242
Quickly come here.

407
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:06,539
Hold this and try hitting it.

408
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,197
This?

409
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,750
It's a newly completed ball.

410
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:16,228
Oh, I can't hit. It's hard.

411
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:18,800
This is from a soon to be major baseball player.

412
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:23,551
Look closely.

413
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,309
Oh, Noona.

414
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,370
- Are you okay?
- Wow. It's great.

415
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:41,233
Really?

416
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,682
I'm so ecstatic.
You know how long I've been trying to get a ball like this?

417
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,942
My tears are almost flowing down.

418
00:31:44,943 --> 00:31:46,672
- Are you that happy?
- Of course.

419
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,997
How should I say this?

420
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:52,540
I love you.

421
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:55,373
<i>I have loved many times.</i>

422
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,469
<i>When I look back there are loves that I regret,</i>

423
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,367
<i>and loves that I was not able to finish.</i>

424
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:05,292
<i>There were also meaningless people in my life.</i>

425
00:32:05,293 --> 00:32:08,840
<i>But my body always moved according to my heart,</i>

426
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:13,816
<i>and so I never worried about that.</i>

427
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:20,076
<i>This is the first time I have worried
whether it is okay to start this love.</i>

428
00:32:20,077 --> 00:32:27,904
<i>And so, it has been the first time it felt unfair to be old.</i>

429
00:32:46,974 --> 00:32:51,484
Let's see here…

430
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:54,703
Hmm… You're lonely.

431
00:32:54,704 --> 00:32:58,251
Your fate is lonely.
And your life is hard.

432
00:32:58,252 --> 00:33:02,093
Yes, it's very hard.

433
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:05,382
Let's see here.

434
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,266
- It's your parent!
- What?

435
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,519
- You live together, right?
- Yes.

436
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,426
Separate quickly, quickly.

437
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:14,438
You two are hurting each other.

438
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:18,201
Oh, oh my. I knew it would be something like this.

439
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:20,749
You are both blocking each other's good fortune coming in,

440
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,242
there is nothing working out for both of you.

441
00:33:24,243 --> 00:33:26,165
What should I do?

442
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,287
Would it be better if we lived separately?

443
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:29,506
Drink, drink.

444
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:34,348
Drink.

445
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:37,502
Did you go back into studying law?

446
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:40,344
Who? Jun Mo?

447
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:41,786
<i>He's in Korea?</i>

448
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:46,311
Yea, he called me earlier.
He said he's back permanently.

449
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:52,024
Hong Nan Hee.

450
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:54,881
Wait, how many years has it been?

451
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:56,321
It should be about ten years.

452
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:58,595
Oh, Jun Mo!

453
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:04,385
<i>- Hey nice to see you.
- It's been a long time…</i>

454
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:09,403
Have you been well?

455
00:34:09,404 --> 00:34:11,493
Yes… hello.

456
00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:14,637
<i>Hey, why are you so shy?</i>

457
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:18,519
Wow, you haven't changed at all.

458
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,759
You've changed… the change seems good.

459
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,904
Really Jun Mo has become charismatic.

460
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:27,672
You must feel a little bad, Nan Hee.

461
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:30,839
A little? It must be a lot.

462
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,430
Stop it, you guys.

463
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:33,545
Let's drink.

464
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:39,146
Yeah, let's drink...

465
00:35:53,964 --> 00:36:01,894
<i>Again another day is going far away</i>

466
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:06,086
<i>My youth is gone</i>

467
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:09,820
- Oh, Hyung Tae has come.
- Hello.

468
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:13,864
<i>Gone in my forgotten memories</i>

469
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:17,715
Are you a traveling play act?
Why are you singing in a public place?

470
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:20,938
<i>I do not have anything left</i>

471
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:22,507
Ahjumma, can I get a bottle of soju?

472
00:36:22,508 --> 00:36:28,755
<i>The seasons can never return</i>

473
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:31,146
That's weird that you guys are sitting separately.

474
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:38,947
<i>My love that has gone away</i>

475
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:49,959
Why? Meeting your first love is making you perplexed?

476
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,745
- Hey, Byun Hyung Tae.
- Yes.

477
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:54,458
Poop shape!
(She calls him that because his last name means poop)

478
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,930
Yes, what?

479
00:36:55,931 --> 00:37:02,069
You, also living so unaware will become regretful one day.

480
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,531
If you should suddenly meet Sung Ah one day,

481
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:10,733
then your world will come crashing down.

482
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,527
Do you still have feelings left for Jun Mo?

483
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:17,164
Am I like you?!

484
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:19,962
But still…

485
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:26,920
I thought at least,
at least when I would meet Jun Mo again.

486
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:31,302
I would not be in this kind of state.

487
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:37,052
I thought I would have a nice and
warm-hearted husband next to me,

488
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:46,610
Maybe even a pretty child.

489
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:52,285
Maybe your article would get published too.

490
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:55,703
Yes.

491
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:59,007
I thought I would have at least one novel already…

492
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:03,455
Maybe not a best seller,

493
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:09,120
but a novel that some people would have really loved.

494
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,362
Should I go over there?

495
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:16,690
There are no empty seats here.

496
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:21,134
Here, my hope is sitting.

497
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:25,254
And here, my sadness is sitting.

498
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:31,282
And here, my fear is sitting.

499
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:34,013
I wondered why a van was just sitting outside…

500
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:36,324
I guess it was there preparing to take away one crazy girl.

501
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:41,653
Oh, there sits my youth.

502
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:46,045
It sure is sitting far away.

503
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:53,098
You guys… let's just us drink… one shot.

504
00:38:53,099 --> 00:39:00,490
Instead of a flower at least put this on.

505
00:39:03,735 --> 00:39:10,712
- Oh, it's cold.
- Cold? Wear this.

506
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:14,488
Hey it's been a long time, let's sing that song.

507
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:18,283
No…

508
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:23,949
I told you I don't want to.

509
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:29,001
<i>Really, at first I just called</i>

510
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:30,573
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

511
00:39:30,574 --> 00:39:33,378
<i>It was raining, and I was feeling kind of blue</i>

512
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:35,456
<i>Is it raining a lot? It must be cold</i>

513
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:40,278
<i>Really. It's not a lie</i>

514
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:48,432
<i>I'm sorry. I'm in front of your house</i>

515
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:51,535
You have to say I love you.

516
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:54,607
Instead you are vomiting?

517
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:57,572
Hey, are you okay?

518
00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:59,520
Nan Hee, are you okay?

519
00:39:59,521 --> 00:40:01,247
- Your hair…
- It won't come out.

520
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:05,242
- It won't come out?
- It won't come out.

521
00:40:05,243 --> 00:40:06,885
Hey, who is this?

522
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:09,334
Is this Yoon Sung Ah again?

523
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:11,192
Why is her face plastered all over the walls?

524
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:13,607
Who is she to cover the whole city?

525
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:17,517
Evil girl.

526
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:20,659
This is our company's advertising.

527
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,765
Really?

528
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:24,522
Then you have met Sung Ah?

529
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,394
No it wasn't our team.

530
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:31,644
Oh, but still it must have felt weird.

531
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:33,086
But we talked on the phone.

532
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:35,397
What did she say?

533
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:38,258
She pretended like we didn't know each other…

534
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:44,080
Very easily.

535
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,743
Unfairly she has touched up her photo,
she used to have a mole this big right here.

536
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:02,803
- Don't do it.
- Why? It's fun.

537
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:08,942
- I told you don't do it.
- You try it to, do you want a pen?

538
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:14,883
I think there was another one here.

539
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:21,918
I think there was also hair on it.

540
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:31,641
And here double moles.
Evil girl!

541
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:39,955
Hyung Tae, have you seen this before?

542
00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:17,903
This is…

543
00:42:17,904 --> 00:42:20,946
Vandalizing is a crime of causing
damage to public property,

544
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:23,472
and it is also a crime of interfering
with law enforcement.

545
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:25,688
And the penalty is high also.

546
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:27,971
Oh, I think I'm going crazy.

547
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:29,401
How much is it?

548
00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:34,054
Minimum of five years, the fines are $7,000 and $15,000,

549
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,447
so it is at most $22,000.

550
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:37,638
You mean, I'll be locked up?

551
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,942
What are we going to do?

552
00:42:39,943 --> 00:42:43,809
I just… doodled a little.

553
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,955
Is that such a big crime?

554
00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:51,513
Excuse me, truthfully I didn't want to say this
because I didn't want to seem pathetic but…

555
00:42:51,514 --> 00:42:53,525
I didn't do it, only she did it!

556
00:42:53,526 --> 00:42:55,235
Hey, are you really going to be like this?

557
00:42:55,236 --> 00:42:56,329
I didn't do anything.

558
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,847
I'll erase it. I will clean it off good.

559
00:42:58,848 --> 00:42:59,969
Can't I do that, Ahjussi?

560
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:03,263
You're name?

561
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,481
Hong Nan Hee.

562
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,729
Age?

563
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:13,404
Hey, let go… let go I said…

564
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:16,292
Noona.

565
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:21,262
Uh, uh…uh, Jung Joo.

566
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:26,513
Noona, why are you here?

567
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:30,358
Hey Sung Soo, it's my girlfriend.
Say hello…hello…hello.

568
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,724
Isn't she extremely beautiful?

569
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:35,994
Aren't you two lovers?

570
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:41,257
I told you no, Ahjussi.

571
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:47,026
- What the?!
- Who are you?

572
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:48,574
Stop.

573
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:49,718
Stop…

574
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:52,793
Stop.

575
00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:58,154
Why are you doing this?

576
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:03,642
Name?

577
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:05,505
Name?!

578
00:44:05,506 --> 00:44:09,976
Kim Jung Joo.

579
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:12,599
You wait. I'll see you later.

580
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,829
Jung Joo.

581
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,837
Why the heck are you still using informal speech towards me?

582
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:17,547
Hyung Tae, calm down.

583
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:20,914
I will explain it all.

584
00:44:20,915 --> 00:44:23,222
You, take off Noona's clothing immediately.

585
00:44:23,223 --> 00:44:25,207
Oh, okay. Take it off.

586
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:27,314
Ugh, he's really…

587
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:29,661
Exactly who is he?

588
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:34,394
Yes, calm down a little.
You're the adult.

589
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:35,816
Age?

590
00:44:35,817 --> 00:44:38,035
22.

591
00:44:38,036 --> 00:44:43,351
Wait a minute. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30…

592
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:45,504
You're eight years apart.

593
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:52,266
Wow, Ahgassi*, you have skills.
(*Young Lady or Miss)

594
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:58,299
Jung Joo, sit down, sit down.

595
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,191
He's just a friend, why are you overreacting?

596
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:04,942
Are you crazy?

597
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:07,769
I'm on the verge of going crazy.

598
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,508
First of all Jung Joo, turn your face this way.

599
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:14,302
And so why was he wearing my girl's clothing,
making me mad.

600
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:16,384
It must hurt.

601
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:19,611
Why are you going around fighting?

602
00:45:19,612 --> 00:45:21,121
Freaking playing around.

603
00:45:21,122 --> 00:45:22,553
Hey you!

604
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:26,284
Why are you still using informal speech?
He's eight years older than you.

605
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:29,458
And you… you are eight years older than him.

606
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:32,366
Hyung Tae, I know.

607
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:36,033
Please try to understand me who couldn't say anything
because I was too embarrassed.

608
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,323
Noona!

609
00:45:37,324 --> 00:45:38,755
What's embarrassing?

610
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:43,984
Is loving a crime?

611
00:45:43,985 --> 00:45:45,608
Exactly, how old are you?

612
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:46,737
Ah, really.

613
00:45:46,738 --> 00:45:48,563
You can't use the informal you
when addressing him, Jung Joo.

614
00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:52,055
Then what? I should call him hyung?

615
00:45:52,056 --> 00:45:56,306
Noona, you just sit still, so we men can talk.

616
00:45:56,307 --> 00:45:59,649
Are you the same age as noona?

617
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,597
Yes.

618
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:02,512
Since when and what kind of friend are you?

619
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:06,176
Friend?

620
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:10,523
- I'm going crazy.
- Why do you keep looking at noona?

621
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:13,033
Since when and what kind of friend are you? Say that first.

622
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:14,691
Do I have to keep answering this?

623
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:19,409
Jung Joo, so we have been friends
for 30 years since we were little.

624
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,205
Our parents know each other, and…

625
00:46:21,206 --> 00:46:26,016
What that means exactly is that,
we were friends before you were born.

626
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:29,823
Maybe even before your parents met each other.

627
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:31,909
You? What are you trying to say?

628
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,114
Are you saying you have a more
deeper relationship with her than me?

629
00:46:34,115 --> 00:46:39,744
Jung Joo… Jung Joo… please stop.

630
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:51,975
You saw that, right?

631
00:46:54,086 --> 00:46:56,539
How long has he been that he's so passionate?

632
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,663
- One year.
- Huh? 391 days.

633
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:07,837
So when you were 21? Second year of college?

634
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:16,604
Ahgassi, you have amazing skills.

635
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:24,476
Stop looking, you're going to make a hole
through my face from looking at me too much.

636
00:47:24,477 --> 00:47:28,421
I don't think so.

637
00:47:28,422 --> 00:47:32,618
The doodling… all I have to do is erase it, right?

638
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:39,743
And you had the nerve to give me
warnings about my lifestyle, huh?

639
00:47:39,744 --> 00:47:44,072
Ms. Hong, let's think back carefully.

640
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:48,155
Is it okay to live like this?

641
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:52,573
Leave.

642
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:23,168
<i>She doesn't want to do it?</i>

643
00:48:23,169 --> 00:48:25,765
They say they have no marketing plan yet
to enter the Asian market.

644
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:27,653
They say they want to prepare more before entering.

645
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,741
They don't want to debut by a song in an ad.

646
00:48:29,742 --> 00:48:31,265
I guess so.

647
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:33,596
Oh well…

648
00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:35,955
What song are we going to use instead?

649
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:37,049
I'm sorry.

650
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:40,111
Sorry? If we just look for different music... we will find it.

651
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:41,487
Director.

652
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:42,938
Yes?

653
00:48:42,939 --> 00:48:46,030
This project, now is going to be led by Choi Jin Sung.

654
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:47,572
I know.

655
00:48:47,573 --> 00:48:52,230
You requested for vacation time, right?

656
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:54,593
- Again?
- Yes.

657
00:48:54,594 --> 00:48:57,132
<i>This girl just suddenly disappearing once in a while,</i>

658
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,344
<i>each time I don't know what to do.</i>

659
00:48:59,345 --> 00:49:01,737
She must have something to think about.

660
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:05,188
Yes, don't worry.
I will look for her.

661
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:07,190
Father, it's me.

662
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:12,570
Is Nan Hee at Jeju Island by any chance?

663
00:49:12,571 --> 00:49:15,122
You're not hiding her are you?

664
00:49:15,123 --> 00:49:17,007
Where is Noona?

665
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:22,675
Yes, father. I understand.

666
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:26,120
Annoying guy, how did you find out where I work?

667
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:28,147
Don't be like that and tell me, please.

668
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:29,658
You know where she is, right?

669
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:34,595
Because you are in a hurry now you can use proper speech?

670
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,927
Yes, hyung nim.

671
00:49:35,928 --> 00:49:38,478
Hyung nim.

672
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:41,067
For four days I haven't been able to contact her,
of course I am in a hurry.

673
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:41,907
I don't know.

674
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:43,809
Hyung, don't be like that and let me know.

675
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,251
Really, I don't know.

676
00:49:46,252 --> 00:49:49,500
Do you really want to see me go crazy?

677
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:53,633
Pick this up and put it in the trunk, I'll take you.

678
00:49:53,634 --> 00:49:56,393
Look at that, you know.

679
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,724
You are going to Noona right now, aren't you?

680
00:49:58,725 --> 00:50:07,011
If you keep being like this I am not going to just stand by.

681
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:19,130
Hey! Hey! Hey!

682
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:25,389
I can't seem to like him…

683
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:29,981
Here.

684
00:50:29,982 --> 00:50:33,084
Wow, how do you know how to do something like this?

685
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:34,740
I started doing it when I was six years old.

686
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,056
If you want to catch the big ones,

687
00:50:36,057 --> 00:50:38,011
it seemed like this rice cake was better than shrimp.

688
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:39,379
Oh, really?

689
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:46,267
- Now I can cast it in?
- And don't cast too far.

690
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,506
Ahjussi, don't use this rice cake,
I will give you some of mine.

691
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:55,039
Thank you.

692
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,353
Yes.

693
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:15,487
You made me go all the way to Gangwon Province.

694
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:16,600
What?

695
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:21,793
At least you have to tell me and disappear
in order for me to find you at once.

696
00:51:21,794 --> 00:51:24,769
Do you have ramen?

697
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:29,588
Of course.

698
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:33,774
- Vacation?
- Yes.

699
00:51:33,775 --> 00:51:35,294
For about six months I was going to take a vacation,

700
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,495
and organize things that need to be organized.

701
00:51:37,496 --> 00:51:40,616
And was going to think how to live healthy in my 30's.

702
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:44,457
That's so cool, poop shape.

703
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:46,686
What did you think about for four days?

704
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,888
You said…

705
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:52,177
Am I okay this way…

706
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:55,399
If I and Jun Mo had not broken up…

707
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,133
Don't you think I would have been
very different right now?

708
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:02,987
No, I don't mean like that…

709
00:52:02,988 --> 00:52:05,117
Do you think everyone in this world is like you?

710
00:52:05,118 --> 00:52:08,745
Hanging on to their first love so dearly?

711
00:52:08,746 --> 00:52:10,798
Then what?

712
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:17,032
I just looked back on the path I did not take.

713
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:20,444
After imagining that path,
do you regret it for not taking it?

714
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:26,776
That is… no I didn't.

715
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:31,972
Being in this state and form in front of Jun Mo
was painstakingly embarrassing,

716
00:52:31,973 --> 00:52:37,221
but I thought whichever path I had taken,
I think I would be in this spot.

717
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:39,794
Your ability to understand things is becoming stronger.

718
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:43,682
And so I have made a decision after contemplating.

719
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:45,361
What?

720
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,259
I want to do my best.

721
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:52,175
That is the only answer, mom.
I want to try one more time.

722
00:52:52,176 --> 00:52:54,552
If I just give up like this,
I think I will regret it all my life.

723
00:52:54,553 --> 00:52:57,009
You finally have to drive me bonkers, don't you?

724
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,595
And that's why I said I will live independently.

725
00:52:58,596 --> 00:53:00,715
Mom, when you see me you go bonkers, right?

726
00:53:00,716 --> 00:53:03,579
I also want to write without being bothered.

727
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,972
You constantly say independence.

728
00:53:05,973 --> 00:53:08,707
But what money do you have?
What skills do you have?

729
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,261
I'll live according to what I have.

730
00:53:10,262 --> 00:53:12,798
I am going to keep working and
so I am going to spend as I work.

731
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:14,847
Are you going to chase a dream your whole life?

732
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:18,284
You are 30 right now, soon you'll be in your 40s.

733
00:53:18,285 --> 00:53:20,376
Until I can accept it.

734
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:23,903
When I know I can't do anymore,
that is when I will quit.

735
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:26,895
When I am so tired that I do not have any regrets…
that is when I will quit.

736
00:53:26,896 --> 00:53:28,662
Rubbish.

737
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:32,476
Your dad did he know his writing limits?
He didn't know even to his death.

738
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:35,155
Writing, just grosses me out.

739
00:53:35,156 --> 00:53:36,661
Please stop.

740
00:53:36,662 --> 00:53:39,484
And so I am saying don't look at me.

741
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:41,426
I will try to live on my own.

742
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,704
And so love and dreams I will carry on by myself.

743
00:53:43,705 --> 00:53:49,260
No way. A girl becoming independent?

744
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:52,980
Brother in-law, business is not going well right now, right?

745
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,742
Huh?

746
00:53:54,743 --> 00:53:57,372
Uh…

747
00:53:57,373 --> 00:54:02,132
Yun Hee, even though you are working at it
you can't seem to get pregnant, right?

748
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:06,306
What's wrong? What is it you want to say?

749
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:10,186
Mom, after you quit working,
have your joints gotten better at all?

750
00:54:10,187 --> 00:54:12,495
Is she trying to make fun of us or something?

751
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:14,671
He said, all those problems are because of me.

752
00:54:14,672 --> 00:54:21,620
Because your fates and my fates do not match well.

753
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:26,212
Of course it's not true, there is no such things.

754
00:54:26,213 --> 00:54:28,602
But as I was saying it even I started to believe it.

755
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:29,918
Even looking at me and my mom,

756
00:54:29,919 --> 00:54:33,087
it doesn't seem we can live together any longer, right?

757
00:54:33,088 --> 00:54:36,873
Hey, how far are we going down?

758
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:42,423
I mean it's not a underground tunnel, right?

759
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:47,703
Ahjussi, aren't you turning on the lights?

760
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:49,527
Ah, the electricity must have gone out.

761
00:54:49,528 --> 00:54:51,715
It's larger than what you thought, right?

762
00:54:51,716 --> 00:54:53,665
We can't see anything.

763
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,124
What is this? What is this?

764
00:54:56,125 --> 00:55:01,726
Bug… is it a bug…?

765
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:07,609
Ahjussi, which way do we go out?

766
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,985
I think I was looking to down upon Seoul.

767
00:55:13,986 --> 00:55:18,400
Yes, you do have that tendency. Just give up.

768
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:21,696
It must be nice. I want to go on vacation too.

769
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:24,627
Indeed you haven't been on one
for a long time, have you?

770
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:27,132
What money are you going on vacation with?

771
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:28,213
You said because you took out a loan to buy a house,

772
00:55:28,214 --> 00:55:30,414
you didn't have any extra money.

773
00:55:30,415 --> 00:55:32,820
I will rent out my house and leave.

774
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:36,242
Ah, your house is empty.

775
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:41,112
Why didn't I think of that?

776
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:42,871
Don't think of that.

777
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:46,557
Hyung Tae, while you are gone
I will live in your house.

778
00:55:46,558 --> 00:55:52,160
I will take care of it preciously
and keep it clean. Hey, Hyung Tae?

779
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:53,937
Do you have $8,000?

780
00:55:53,938 --> 00:55:56,222
My monthly rent is $1,300.

781
00:55:56,223 --> 00:56:02,453
Wow, you look like a rich real estate tycoon.

782
00:56:02,454 --> 00:56:09,279
Hyung Tae, can you lower the price just a little bit?

783
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,095
We've been friends for 30 years…

784
00:56:13,096 --> 00:56:17,566
If we want to be friends forever,
there are two things we should not do.

785
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:19,230
Have a money relationship and a love relationship.

786
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:20,895
Even if I have a love relationship with you,

787
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:23,073
I will not have a money relationship with you.

788
00:56:23,074 --> 00:56:24,931
Hey, what does that mean?

789
00:56:24,932 --> 00:56:28,932
Jung Joo, you came.

790
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:31,293
Why did he come?

791
00:56:31,294 --> 00:56:32,417
Are you Jjang Ga*?
(*Korean Anime character)

792
00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:37,552
Yea, I am Jjang Ga, what?

793
00:56:37,553 --> 00:56:39,472
This is your room?

794
00:56:39,473 --> 00:56:42,157
It's the cheapest in this neighborhood.

795
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:44,642
Don't spend too much money, just live here.

796
00:56:44,643 --> 00:56:47,580
Since I am here, it will also be secure.

797
00:56:47,581 --> 00:56:49,140
She said they also have a room.

798
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:51,911
Ahjumma will come soon, go ahead and take a look.

799
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:54,500
How come you do not even have a single book?

800
00:56:54,501 --> 00:56:57,477
I don't read books.

801
00:56:57,478 --> 00:57:03,158
But still don't you need it
to at least kill cockroaches?

802
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:05,614
I can catch them with my hands.

803
00:57:05,615 --> 00:57:11,839
Yes, you could.

804
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:22,283
You scared me.

805
00:57:22,284 --> 00:57:24,237
It's nice, right? Look at this.

806
00:57:24,238 --> 00:57:28,117
These are all the places the train will pass through.

807
00:57:28,118 --> 00:57:31,384
I saw your travel itinerary,
and you were wasting too much of money.

808
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:34,309
There are so many good places to visit in this world.

809
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,757
I have been just taking vacations for ten year, believe me.

810
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:39,711
No.

811
00:57:39,712 --> 00:57:42,099
You were interested in art history, right?

812
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,681
I have also thought of that.

813
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,484
Come here.

814
00:57:49,485 --> 00:57:51,052
Look at all this.

815
00:57:51,053 --> 00:57:55,131
All this you can enjoy in 180 days for only $4000.

816
00:57:55,132 --> 00:57:57,620
This includes your sleeping, eating and visiting,

817
00:57:57,621 --> 00:58:00,753
and of course I included your plans.

818
00:58:00,754 --> 00:58:04,020
I just took a few places out that
you were thinking of traveling.

819
00:58:04,021 --> 00:58:06,743
I mean it's just expensive to go there… waste of money.

820
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:13,718
- Look at... isn't it…
- I told you I don't want to.

821
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:28,664
I even put all of this month's pay.

822
00:58:35,926 --> 00:58:38,765
What is this? It's not even $4000.

823
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:39,847
Hyung Tae…

824
00:58:39,848 --> 00:58:40,786
What?

825
00:58:40,787 --> 00:58:42,485
Hyung Tae?

826
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:46,572
What?

827
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:49,203
Okay, $700-$800 is missing what can I do?

828
00:58:49,204 --> 00:58:55,180
Can't our friendship cover it?

829
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,026
Don't even say such useless things.

830
00:58:58,027 --> 00:58:59,837
Hyung Tae?

831
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:02,394
No. No.

832
00:59:02,395 --> 00:59:08,405
Definitely, definitely no.

833
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:13,678
Isn't today a great day?

834
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:20,831
You preparing for a healthy 30's
and I preparing for a regretless 30's.

835
00:59:20,832 --> 00:59:23,324
You have to take care of the maintenance fees, okay?

836
00:59:23,325 --> 00:59:24,409
If you get behind, you're dead…

837
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:29,723
Of course, of course.
Don't worry.

838
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:32,150
I am going.

839
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:37,264
Go.

840
00:59:38,615 --> 00:59:44,982
I hope you'll have a great trip without any regrets.

841
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:48,676
All of this you could afford?

842
00:59:48,677 --> 00:59:49,879
Of course.

843
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,523
Of course, I splurged a little from my savings.

844
00:59:52,524 --> 00:59:57,005
I thought you just went around spending,
but I guess you are not a total idiot.

845
00:59:57,006 --> 00:59:59,724
This is reassuring right, mom?

846
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:03,540
Yes security is also here,
I guess it wont be too dangerous.

847
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:07,270
Why did you bring rice?
I can buy it myself.

848
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:10,087
For you to live well.

849
01:00:10,088 --> 01:00:14,021
Thank you. I will live well.

850
01:00:14,022 --> 01:00:19,026
This is how a normal mother-daughter
relationship should be, right?

851
01:00:19,027 --> 01:00:22,855
I am thinking one last time,
and I am letting you try one last time.

852
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:28,874
I want to also brag that my daughter is a novelist.

853
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,311
Yes, I will do well.

854
01:00:31,312 --> 01:00:34,385
I also packed Hyung Tae's stuff, take it to him.

855
01:00:34,386 --> 01:00:37,532
No, let me take it, tell me his address.

856
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,572
No.

857
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:42,304
Why are you taking it from me all of a sudden?

858
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:46,564
Oh... Hyung Tae went on a vacation.

859
01:00:46,565 --> 01:00:52,129
He said it's going to take long, mom.

860
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:01,298
<i>Even though living is hard</i>

861
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:03,047
<i>And you fall in love</i>

862
01:01:03,048 --> 01:01:06,768
<i>But someday a good day will come to me too</i>

863
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:08,657
<i>This is the beginning</i>

864
01:01:08,658 --> 01:01:12,050
<i>The star of life is me</i>

865
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:14,205
<i>I'm never going to cry</i>

866
01:01:14,206 --> 01:01:16,129
<i>Sad tears goodbye</i>

867
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,955
<i>Hard worries goodbye</i>

868
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:21,767
<i>I will not think about the past hardships</i>

869
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:24,048
<i>Today is the beginning</i>

870
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:28,255
<i>I am going to do well</i>

871
01:01:28,256 --> 01:01:29,545
<i>Smile again</i>

872
01:01:29,546 --> 01:01:33,084
<i>Because I have you I am smiling again today</i>

873
01:01:33,085 --> 01:01:36,751
<i>You are a precious friend who stayed by my side</i>

874
01:01:36,752 --> 01:01:41,616
<i>Fly high and higher until you reach the end of the sky</i>

875
01:01:41,617 --> 01:01:49,092
Sorry for locking you up for a while.
Let's do well from now on.

876
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:56,077
Noona…

877
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:57,158
Noona…

878
01:01:57,159 --> 01:01:59,899
No, why do you keep saying it?

879
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,802
Why not?

880
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,611
I don't want to get messed up
because I am living by myself.

881
01:02:05,612 --> 01:02:07,836
I didn't say I was going to live at that house.

882
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:10,003
I just want you to make me a meal.

883
01:02:10,004 --> 01:02:12,862
You said it was sad that I was always eating ramen.

884
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:15,820
Noona, I want to eat food you make me.

885
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:22,775
But still, once or twice and you'll have other thoughts…

886
01:02:22,776 --> 01:02:25,918
Other thoughts…?

887
01:02:25,919 --> 01:02:32,751
No, it's not like that can't I just have something to drink?

888
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:37,330
Just go...

889
01:02:37,331 --> 01:02:42,305
Goodbye.

890
01:02:50,456 --> 01:02:54,206
Are you on the way?

891
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:58,247
Arrive safely on the way there.

892
01:02:58,248 --> 01:03:01,224
Jung Joo, be careful when you go into practice.

893
01:03:01,225 --> 01:03:04,530
Don't get hurt, okay?

894
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:08,610
I won't see you for 15 days.

895
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:13,445
Do well in your game.

896
01:03:13,446 --> 01:03:18,075
If you win, I will make you a meal.

897
01:03:18,076 --> 01:03:22,432
Really?

898
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:32,586
No matter what, he just too stubborn.

899
01:03:32,587 --> 01:03:38,150
How come I am his first love?
So much responsibility.

900
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:41,296
But still even in high school?

901
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:45,062
You went to a boys and girls high school…
you still didn't have one then?

902
01:03:45,063 --> 01:03:47,039
Really. You are my first, Noona.

903
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,476
I mean. You didn't even like anyone?

904
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:52,955
What about you, Noona?

905
01:03:52,956 --> 01:03:57,225
Noona, what kind of person was your first love?

906
01:03:57,226 --> 01:03:59,476
It's a secret.

907
01:03:59,477 --> 01:04:01,685
You ask me everything.

908
01:04:01,686 --> 01:04:03,559
That's all my know-how.

909
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,836
You don't age for nothing.

910
01:04:05,837 --> 01:04:14,187
I don't want to call you noona anymore.

911
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:18,321
I am just going to… call you by your name.

912
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:21,385
Yes?

913
01:04:21,386 --> 01:04:25,500
Do as you like.

914
01:04:25,501 --> 01:04:29,087
Really. I am now going to say Nan Hee.

915
01:04:29,088 --> 01:04:32,075
Yes.

916
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,897
If we are done eating, lets drink tea.

917
01:04:35,898 --> 01:04:41,453
One moment.

918
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:48,164
I am going crazy.

919
01:04:59,635 --> 01:05:03,884
Go.

920
01:05:03,885 --> 01:05:05,683
Go.

921
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:06,951
Let me hold you just once.

922
01:05:06,952 --> 01:05:10,042
Jung Joo, one moment. Don't do this.

923
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:12,201
Jung Joo.

924
01:05:12,202 --> 01:05:15,167
Nan Hee.

925
01:05:15,168 --> 01:05:17,727
<i>Look at that…</i>

926
01:05:17,728 --> 01:05:19,110
<i>Is it going over?</i>

927
01:05:19,111 --> 01:05:22,047
<i>Yes, it's going over, homerun.</i>

928
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:24,153
<i>Yes, he did it.</i>

929
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:29,752
<i>Even though it's two outs it will be hard to catch up,</i>

930
01:05:29,753 --> 01:05:35,753
<i>and that is why baseball is so unpredictable.</i>

931
01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:49,770
<i>Yes. Baseball is unpredictable, and life...</i>

932
01:05:49,771 --> 01:05:53,239
<i>is also unpredictable…</i>

935
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,388
Try catching me.

936
01:06:03,389 --> 01:06:04,430
What is going to start?

937
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:06,752
I am finding a surprising side to you.

939
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:12,869
Who is this person?

940
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:16,073
She is my girlfriend, she is beautiful, right?

941
01:06:16,074 --> 01:06:19,460
<i>Lie.</i>

942
01:06:19,461 --> 01:06:23,475
And so, you bought those kinds of clothes
and acting like that?

943
01:06:23,476 --> 01:06:25,906
What a useless love.

944
01:06:25,907 --> 01:06:27,234
Let's break up.

945
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:28,955
It's because of that guy, right?

946
01:06:28,956 --> 01:06:31,662
Byun Hyung Tae?

947
01:06:31,663 --> 01:06:33,904
Wait.

948
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:36,630
I guess you go by that name only at night?

949
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:39,462
Sometimes I also use the Chief's name.

950
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:42,486
I want to see him so badly.

951
01:06:42,487 --> 01:06:47,549
I want to see him.

952
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,120
Hong Nan Hee!
