00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:26,783
My mind is a blank.

3
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,160
Oh.

4
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:42,684
Can't think of anything.

5
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,297
What is it?

6
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:30,949
Being able to be together
with you like this is great.

7
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,375
I feel a little over my head with ecstasy.

8
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,669
Don't you feel that it is a little strange?

9
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:40,092
It seems like it is already a habitual feeling?

10
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,593
Yes.

11
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:47,859
Instead, I feel that your countless
experiences are shining at this moment.

12
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,502
Is that a compliment or an insult?

13
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:55,607
I love you.

14
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:01,619
These words, how can you
say them so suddenly?

15
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,169
It is already all the way up here,
so I just said it.

16
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:11,837
Next time, I will not just suppress it.
I will say whatever I feel.

17
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:15,804
I missed you very much.

18
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:18,332
I missed you,

19
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,385
and wanted to talk to you.

20
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,139
Hyung Tae.

21
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:37,043
My essay wasn't chosen again.

22
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,763
It's alright.

23
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:43,235
Player Kim Joo Hwan hit a home run.

24
00:03:43,428 --> 00:03:44,628
I saw that too.

25
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:45,962
Do you think he was very suave there?

26
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:50,190
I went to look for you to tell you the news,
but you weren't home.

27
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:53,806
You went to my house?

28
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,851
I was already prepared
to be chased out by you.

29
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:09,743
The whole day I was looking
for you everywhere.

30
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,182
Nan Hee.

31
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:27,781
I now completely understand my heart.

32
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,529
Say it.

33
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:44,643
I love you.

34
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:49,167
So mushy.

35
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:54,189
I...

36
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:58,438
Only when it was all the way up here,
I was able to say it.

37
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:01,923
But you had a heavy heart, right?

38
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,946
Don't make wild guesses.

39
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,784
From now, I want to believe.

40
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,559
The Oppa's lies.

41
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,849
Come in.

42
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,593
I know what the feeling of Sung Ah is like now.

43
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:42,174
All this is all my fault.

44
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,075
I am already so old,
yet I still fought with people.

45
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,892
Fought?

46
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,063
You got into a fight?

47
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:55,951
With Jun Mo.

48
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:57,995
Exchanged heavy blows?

49
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,958
Did Jun Mo really hit you?

50
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,678
Did you instruct him to do that?

51
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:08,621
Would I get beaten up by Sung Ah too?

52
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,664
Looks like love, there can only be one.

53
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:13,543
One?

54
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:19,464
Best if it is so.

55
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:24,608
But, all the things that
piles up within time...

56
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:26,809
looks that they are intolerable.

57
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,762
Be it two or three.

58
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,649
I can understand.

59
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:35,926
It is not that I don't know that fact.

60
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:41,923
You had a hard time getting over Sung Ah.

61
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:46,788
even till the point of considering death.

62
00:06:48,902 --> 00:06:51,831
I am afraid that you will
regret because of me.

63
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,980
Afraid that you will lose the chance.

64
00:06:57,235 --> 00:07:00,020
So I pushed you aside.

65
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:02,121
Nan Hee.

66
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:10,328
If I didn't have you,
what would my life become?

67
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:15,955
What's wrong?

68
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,546
I don't know.

69
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,874
These words sound better than I love you.

70
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:30,522
I drank the cold medicine and drank alcohol.

71
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,942
I feel like I'm drunk.

72
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,491
You caught a cold?

73
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:36,953
Not feeling well?

74
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:38,454
Oh.

75
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,974
If I faint off halfway while talking,
don't be alarmed.

76
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,322
Then lie down.

77
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,406
I want to stay like this.

78
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,286
Be careful, you might catch the cold from me.

79
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:58,747
Us... next time, we aren't friends anymore, right?

80
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:04,295
I have failed in love with a lot of guys.

81
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,435
But those words hurt me the most.

82
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:12,014
Now, I know you like me.
So we are friends, that is correct.

83
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:17,307
Me too, roughly about 3 times?

84
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,837
Loved you one-sidedly before.

85
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:25,853
That time, I really wanted to
give up being friends with you.

86
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:31,489
I... I said that that was the
6th time I fallen out of love.

87
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:36,621
- You don't know who that person isâ€¦
- I can roughly guess it.

88
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:40,368
When was it?

89
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:45,674
That time, you were really fresh.

90
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:53,454
Hey! Your hands are very hot.

91
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,290
You are having a fever.

92
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:58,894
Just a while more will do.

93
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:03,476
I put in all my effort to submit
an essay but still failed.

94
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:07,045
And confessed to you with so much difficulty.

95
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:11,927
And I am very thankful that
I can understand how you feel.

96
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:14,551
I want to talk to you,

97
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:18,872
use up all my remaining energy,
then have a good sleep.

98
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:21,675
Tomorrow is the weekend.

99
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:23,894
Okay.

100
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:28,351
When you go to bed at night,
do you feel afraid?

101
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:31,379
Till now, I still leave the desk lamp on to sleep.

102
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,659
I knew it.

103
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:42,841
I am not used to not hearing any sound.

104
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,734
Give it.

105
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:22,403
The weather is so good.

106
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:32,391
Hey, you hugged it the whole night,
one whole night.

107
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:35,690
What's so great about that guitar
to be holding so tightly onto it?

108
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:39,258
Even if you spent the whole night playing the guitar,
Seung Won's standard will still be better than yours.

109
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:41,207
Why are you saying what mothers will say?

110
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:43,792
Looks like you are more interested
in guitar than your major.

111
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:44,969
Which direction are you going
to pursue your career in?

112
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:47,130
Such a good thing,
why should it become a career?

113
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,679
I will only fall in love with the guitar.

114
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:50,644
What?

115
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:53,017
You are such a playboy.

116
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:55,930
We shouldn't be raised by eating
healthy rice or else we'll become like him.

117
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,686
What are your dreams in the future?

118
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,501
What's yours?

119
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,125
I have three dreams.

120
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:08,800
I will live a little longer before deciding.

121
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:15,522
Able to have 3 dreams,
you are really a lucky chap.

122
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,783
<i>You look really happy.</i>

123
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:20,976
<i>Hey, I always have three women
that appear in my dreams.</i>

124
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,259
<i>My dream is to get married.</i>

125
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:48,124
So cold.

126
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:52,557
Looks like the cold is not a slight one.

127
00:11:54,641 --> 00:12:00,506
<i>When my body is not feeling well,
I will dream of Seung Won occasionally.</i>

128
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:04,189
<i>Always the same dream.</i>

129
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:08,241
<i>The conversation was one
that we really had before.</i>

130
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:15,761
<i>Why did Seung Won say that he wants
to live a little more, this sort of words?</i>

131
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:20,005
<i>That time, we were just freshmen.</i>

Baseball is a game of chance.

133

Nan Hee.

134
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:50,774
You have fallen for her?

135
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:52,819
Yes.

136
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,146
What shall I do?

137
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:05,188
Sung Ah.

138
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,522
I'm sorry.

139
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,150
There are still lots of things I haven't done.

140
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:27,677
I always felt that this period of
separation has a huge effect on you.

141
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,585
So there were some things I didn't dare do.

142
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,910
Wasn't able to enjoy thoroughly together.

143
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,265
Sung Ah.

144
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:47,651
I'm like that too. Because I loved you...

145
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:53,808
Hence I asked you to stay.

146
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,390
But now, I don't know what I can do for you.

147
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:08,641
For this, I am sorry.

148
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:31,239
<i>As time goes by, we meet new people</i>

149
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:44,507
<i>Everyone says that it will be
forgotten and become indifferent</i>

150
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:48,458
<i>The tears doesn't stop</i>

151
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:53,174
<i>But the time stops and doesn't go</i>

152
00:14:53,568 --> 00:15:01,400
<i>You say you are very happy</i>

153
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:08,141
<i>Letting me go, but you are
smiling and saying thank you</i>

154
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:15,410
<i>You are afraid that saying
you loved me will hurt me</i>

155
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,896
<i>Only saying thank you</i>

156
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:22,667
<i>Wishing that I meet a better person</i>

157
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,901
<i>Stay, I am not in time to say</i>

158
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:32,261
<i>I wasn't in time to get near to you</i>

159
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:39,041
<i>I always get choked up and can't say a thing</i>

160
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,861
<i>Thinking of you so much I can't breath</i>

161
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:47,042
<i>Until the state that I forgotten what to say</i>

162
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,901
<i>You loathe the foolish me</i>

163
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:55,874
<i>So you are leaving me</i>

164
00:15:56,285 --> 00:16:01,799
<i>I will be waiting for you here</i>

165
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:09,578
<i>Stay</i>

166
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,442
Where did you go?

167
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,733
Ah.

168
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,502
Do you wish to be alone?

169
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:49,570
Do you want me to leave?

170
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,779
Did you eat the medicine?

171
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:05,428
What do you mean by go?
You just stay by my side.

172
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:08,293
Looks like you really caught
the cold from me.

173
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,689
So cold.

174
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:16,107
Let's just switch off the phone and
lie down the whole day, okay?

175
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,930
Next time, when I am with you
the phone will not ring.

176
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:27,698
So cold.

177
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:26,577
<i>New York Yankee's rookie league player Kim Jung Joo,</i>

178
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:30,578
<i>has a very good track record and
has been getting a lot of attention.</i>

179
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:39,015
Are you feeling better?

180
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:40,455
I am much better.

181
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,399
Looks like the cold is better.

182
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:45,098
That is good.

183
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:54,089
You... and Sung Ah, is it alright?

184
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,999
That consequence should also be bear by me.

185
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,017
Quickly eat up.

186
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:02,677
Make a trip back home,
after that you have to get to work.

187
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:03,813
I will send you there.

188
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,304
Okay.

189
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:09,032
But, do you want to put a few clothes here?

190
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:11,841
No.

191
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:14,775
What is the matter?
Didn't you use to live here before?

192
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:18,544
Hence the line is too blurred.

193
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:19,977
What do you mean?

194
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,320
I didn't do anything.

195
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,206
I don't mean that.

196
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,082
I am already independent.

197
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:29,451
Without my parents watching over me,
I want to have a bit more freedom.

198
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:32,000
You really know how to torture.

199
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,250
I love you.

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,097

00:20:46,404 --> 00:20:50,614

00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:57,857

<i>{\a6}Hard worries goodbye</i>

236
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:00,624

00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:04,830
<i>{\a6}Today is the beginning</i>

240
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,395

the round the world concert,

242
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:08,259
But aim of the first concert is to release the album.

243
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:13,543
After Japan and China, we will return
to Korea to hold the finale.

During that time, we will then hold
a large scale concert. We will do it this way.

246
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:19,670
Okay. Give the VIP guest list to me.

247
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,458
I will distribute a separate invitation.

248
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,328
Yes.

249
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:24,580

251
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,954

<i>{\a6}Even if I fall ten times</i>

253
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,416
This song. Although it's not in the album,
she wants this song on the instrumental list.

Seeing one's man with like this,
do you know how much it hurts?

277
00:22:47,522 --> 00:22:49,316
When a man is in a dilemma,

278
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:54,043
stand by the side, using the same eyes and
same sort of feeling, look together afar.

279

That sort of women, should be available, right?

280
00:22:57,824 --> 00:23:00,269
How much goodwill did you
accumulate in your past life?

281
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:02,700
You are actually wishing for that?

Why? What is going on?

285
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:12,845
Both of you are getting married?

286
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:14,099
Oh.

Ah, so envious.

291
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:25,048
I want to get married too.

292
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,123
Is it?

293
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:29,181
Oh, Hyung Tae.

295
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:44,913
Can you have a chat with me?

Me.

297
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:50,810
I am quite afraid of you recently.

What is going on?

299
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:57,488
Thank you for taking time off to chat with me.

300
00:23:57,551 --> 00:24:00,901
And thank you for helping me
pay off my late rent fees.

301
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:03,169
I've wanted to treat you
to a meal long time ago.

302
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:05,079
Then you have more too.

303
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:07,805
You helped me so much.

304
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,482
But it's a pity I didn't have any achievements.
I'm very sorry.

305
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,774
What is there to be sorry about?

306
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:12,793
Come.

307
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:13,849
Cheers.

308
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:15,011
Okay.

309
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:26,030
You must be feeling terrible, right?

310
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,564
Yes.

311
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,320
Writing.

312
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,376
You know perfectly that you can't do it.

313
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:34,759
But you can't stop.
That really caused people headaches.

314
00:24:35,777 --> 00:24:38,463
Working at the publishing firm
has made it unstoppable, right?

315
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,812
You are thinking, why isn't it possible?

316
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:44,540
I write better than this person.

317
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:49,016
Oh my, really.

318
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,380
Come. Might as well cry it out.

319
00:24:53,764 --> 00:24:55,713
No, it's fine.

320
00:24:55,906 --> 00:25:01,115
It's only listening to your
true feelings, I am thankful.

321
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:04,517
The next essay, are you still going to
continue taking up the challenge?

322
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,648
Not at the moment.

323
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:13,310
With my situation now, I am afraid I can't do it.

324
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,307
Then, you have made up
your mind to become an editor?

325
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:23,300
I am not that sure.

326
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:31,292
But, I want to be someone like you.

327
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,278
Hey, you're making me embarrassed.

328
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:41,519
How come you are in such good mood today?

329
00:25:43,112 --> 00:25:43,873
Switch on the music... music.

330
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:45,878
Okay, what music would you like?

331
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:50,245
Country Kko Kko.  Wishing that
they will get back together.

332
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:52,181
Awesome.

333
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:00,768
Don't you think this character is just great?

334
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:02,595
Who are you saying?

335
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,728
All are perfect.

336
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:07,276
This Barista.

337
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,458
<i>It is just great.</i>

338
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:16,080
Let him be a little sexier
by having 3 buttons open.

339
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:28,557
But, can you tell me how come
you are in such a good mood?

340
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:32,700
Then I will help you maintain the mood now.

341
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:35,395
I received a call from a guy in the afternoon.

342
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:38,576
You finally found someone you fancy?

343
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:42,115
No. It is just a normal internet sales person.

344
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:45,542
And?

345
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,975
The voice is too nice to the ear.

346
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,793
Just because of this?

347
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:54,016
The voice is filled with energy.

348
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,975
I say, you didn't even see how
the other party looked liked?

349
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:01,718
By only listening to the voice,
and you can get so high?

350
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:05,662
It is like the voice just after shaving.

351
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:08,275
Just finished applying moisturizer.

352
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:15,032
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

353
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:16,780
What is to be done?

354
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:20,752
I was drawing too frantically,
the beard looks like a mountain goat's.

355
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:23,409
Gosh, what shall I do?

356
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:27,887
I dislike those guys who leave

357
00:27:28,974 --> 00:27:33,345
I want to show my power,
hence I should shave off all the beard.

358
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:34,185
Yes.

360
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:39,874
Okay, what do you want to eat?

Then, order something from Side Dish World*.
Dried pollack soup. (*name of the restaurant)

364
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:48,070
Okay.

365
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:50,601
What are the bottom veggies,
let me make a guess?

366
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,766
Fish paste, sesame leaf,

367
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,304
Egg roll, fried kelp,

368
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,930
Seasoned bellflower roots and half a fish.

369
00:27:59,163 --> 00:28:01,079

I swear.

373
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:23,920
Okay.

374
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:31,924
Why did you swear something like that?

375
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,637
I will definitely help her look for one.

376
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:37,168

Is it that person who you cohabitated with?

386

Give me $230.

Ma Bong Chun?

You are working with the fella?

390
00:29:44,808 --> 00:29:45,580
Oh.

391
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:49,593
Bong Chun sunbae's looks are not too bad.

Hey, don't try to rationalize it.

What did he look like?

394

Gosh, it's too much.

395
00:29:58,836 --> 00:30:00,264
He also has double eyelids.

396
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:02,521
I don't remember that he was
a double eyelid person.

397
00:30:03,775 --> 00:30:08,072
In addition when he stood up,
his pants were clinging on to his butt.

398
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,196
Too comical.

399
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:14,975
That person... so he is like that.

People who are now stuck in the past....

401
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:23,623
One can remember those in the past as how...

402
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:26,724
they would like to remember it
in their mind, don't you think so?

403
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,271

Would he have changed?

406
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:49,149
He should have.

407
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:54,270
I don't wish he changed.

408
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:59,707
Hope that he will not be hurt

that fella will be as you said.

Fast.

I am lying down.

419

Now you can lie down comfortably on that bed.

420
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:03,633
Can't I do that in the future too?

421
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:09,132

when I lay down every time.

Thank you for continuing to stay by my side.

If you became the past, how could I have survived.

426
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:33,454
Recently, I got to know Ms. Hong all over again.

427
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:34,798
Why?

428
00:33:36,477 --> 00:33:38,284

Without any hesitation.

431
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:45,140
Not at all wishy-washy.
Saying it out straight.

432
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:49,265
So... could that be the reason why I was
unsuccessful in love every time?

433
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:53,402

It is the first time I am organizing a concert.

451
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:22,974
Find it interesting and a little difficult.

I want to do it well for her.

453

This is Sung Ah's first step
to entering the Asian market.

454
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:35,915

00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,500
Have a look.

460
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:56,079
I didn't check the live recording.

461
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:57,763
It was checked yesterday.

462
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:00,574
But what are you looking so intently at?

463
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:02,567
Nothing.

464
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:06,660
Only feel that the stage is a little empty.

465
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:16,004
When Sung Ah gets on stage, it will be filled.

466

if you didn't have Jung Joo, you can't
think of how your youth would be like.

489

After I read this essay, I understand.

I will definitely get him.

You wish to become a writer too?

497

just wrote some books,
but still not a writer.

498
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:40,203
You want to have involvement in books,
so you went to the publishing line.

499
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:44,256
But, even this sort of story written
people can publish it too.

500

Why do you want to work with me again?

508
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:27,075
Because you put in effort.

509
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:30,644
That book is very meaningful to me.

510
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:34,315
Putting in effort?

511
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:38,058
I don't wish to get those type
of meaningless prize you got.

Feels that you are a doctor.

513
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:43,688
What do you mean?

514
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:49,030
You can accurately pin point where
I didn't write well enough.

515
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:53,853
Those places that I though were passable,

516
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:58,326
you mention it all out,
so I found you irritating.

517
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:02,363
But you gave me suggestions,

518
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:05,259
it was a great help to my book.

519
00:43:06,505 --> 00:43:08,540

At least you have good news,
it is very thankful for that.

During your work time,

529
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:11,385
did anyone say that they need you,
those sort of phrases.

530
00:45:11,566 --> 00:45:12,614
Of course.

531
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:14,106
The feeling is good.

532
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:17,359

00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:27,848
Your fates are really miraculous.

537
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:30,333
Both of you are happy.

538
00:45:32,518 --> 00:45:34,702
The one who needs me
can't give me a sense of pride.

539
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,221
Anyways, he needs me to look after him.

540
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,348
Children?

541
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:42,057
Children, Husband.

542
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:46,242
Sang Hoon... he looks like he can't
adapt to the work environment.

543
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,820
He was talking about his superiors.
Looks like it was not just a casual remark.

544
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,989
If he wants to keep the family alive,
he has take whatever job.

545
00:45:53,058 --> 00:45:55,451
Should I do my translation work?

546
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:57,721
Let Sang Hoon continue to study.

547
00:45:57,836 --> 00:46:01,135
No way, your stomach is going to expand soon.

548
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:30,527
Mr. Byun.

549
00:46:32,012 --> 00:46:33,980
Do you like your work?

550
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:38,067
Bring the case to the company.

551
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:41,617
On one hand we try to persuade them,
on the other we put on a high class attitude.

552
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:45,109
Then in between they were moved by me.

553
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,623
During that instance, it feels miraculous.

554
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:52,617
When you are shining off your strong responsibility.

555
00:46:53,485 --> 00:46:54,604
Of course.

556
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:59,098
You will only use the products
which you advertise for.

557
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,355
Car, alcohol.

558
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:04,577
Detergent. Drinks, everything.

559
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:08,281
I am envious of you.

560
00:47:08,802 --> 00:47:10,807
You are so into your work,

561
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:14,396
hence you can even eat that awful tasting
instant noodles as if it was so delicious.

562
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:17,251
Just because of that instant noodle, I get into a quarrel
with my family every time I go to the supermarket.

563
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:19,200
That instant noodle taste so awful.

564
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,165
It's so delicious.

565
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:26,026
Have you fulfilled your dream?

566
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:31,781
I am in the process of fulfilling it.

567
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:36,315
The problem is whether it
can maintain and not waiver.

568
00:47:37,994 --> 00:47:40,598
When you are young, it doesn't
matter if you hurt others...

569
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:42,954
it is only valuable with sincerity.

570
00:47:43,378 --> 00:47:45,751
I am very proud of my dad.

571
00:47:45,886 --> 00:47:47,931
Thinks that his child is the most precious.

572
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,057
Sweeping aside all other stimulating
sensory organs' temptations.

573
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,756
Using an eye catching idea and sincerity
to come out with a good advertisement.

574
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:57,319
Wow.

575
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,133
So handsome you are.

576
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,625
All the young advertising people
have that sort of ideas.

577
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:06,788
When you live in the media line, the advertisements
will cause a great effort on people.

578
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:12,171
But, why did you suddenly talk about work?

579
00:48:12,248 --> 00:48:15,451
Thinking of this
Thinking of that.

580
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:19,271
My thoughts are in a mess.

581
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,866
Looks like after you sent off the essay.

582
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:40,220
I am going.

583
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:42,574
Thanks for chatting with me.

584
00:49:06,217 --> 00:49:07,278
You are back?

585
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:08,757
Yes.

586
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,387
What are you doing?

587
00:49:19,062 --> 00:49:22,438
Do you still remember the letters
we wrote when we were 20?

588
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:24,001
Letter?

589
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,319
I wrote a lot.

590
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:30,776
I am not referring to the ones
that we wrote between us.

591
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,008
We agreed to read it when we are 30.

592
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,729
The letters we wrote to ourselves.

593
00:49:46,134 --> 00:49:48,812
I promise everyone, I will keep it first.

594
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:52,072
When we reach 30,
it will be mailed to everyone.

595
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,567
But life was a little tiring and I forgot about it.

596
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,678
Tomorrow I will send it to them.

597
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:10,656
Wonder if anyone has lived according to what
they wrote for themselves in the letter.

598
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:16,367
Yours... it will be sent to your office tomorrow.

599
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:27,850
Really.

600
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:32,967
What are we going to do
with Seung Won's letter?

601
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:44,019
<i>I don't know what to do with Seung Won's letter.</i>

602
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:49,482
<i>If I sent it to his house, I am afraid
I will make his parents sad.</i>

603
00:50:49,694 --> 00:50:53,263
<i>I photocopied Seung Won's letter
and mailed each of you a copy.</i>

604
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:56,022
<i>Are you living in the life
that you dreamt of that time?</i>

605
00:50:56,777 --> 00:50:58,880
<i>Looks like I didn't.</i>

606
00:50:59,131 --> 00:51:04,070
<i>But, for our 30th year, fighting!</i>

607
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:38,058
[Lee Seung Won]

608
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:40,946
<i>Sung Ah.</i>

609
00:51:41,428 --> 00:51:45,885
<i>When we were 20, we wrote a letter
for ourselves when we reach 30.</i>

610
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:50,129
<i>Then, we haven't got to know you,
so your letter wasn't inside.</i>

611
00:51:50,554 --> 00:51:53,241
<i>So I am sending you the letter
that Seung Won wrote.</i>

612
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:56,906
<i>After reading this, hoping it gives you encouragements.
The concert will be a success.</i>

613
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:03,087
<i>The day when I got the letter.</i>

614
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:06,309
<i>We didn't contact each other.</i>

615
00:52:06,772 --> 00:52:09,743
<i>Our phones haven't been this quiet for a long time.</i>

616
00:52:10,437 --> 00:52:14,377
<i>That day when we were 20 and
the random letter that we wrote.</i>

617
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:17,831
<i>Now, it is innocently asking us.</i>

618
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:21,975
<i>Is everything going smoothly?</i>

619
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,869
<i>Then we thought it was natural.</i>

620
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:29,592
<i>But Seung Won's future that was left on a letter.</i>

621
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:33,855
<i>It brings pain to our hearts.</i>

622
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:54,449
Hello.

623
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,099
Long time no see.

624
00:52:59,562 --> 00:53:01,252
Did you just get off work?

625
00:53:01,368 --> 00:53:02,448
Yes.

626
00:53:03,992 --> 00:53:06,345
Sitâ€¦ have a seat.

627
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:18,905
Today, Iâ€¦

628
00:53:19,715 --> 00:53:22,301
I resigned.

629
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:24,441
Why?

630
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,930
I want to go to Europe.

631
00:53:27,528 --> 00:53:30,711
I'll be doing laundry services
or cleaning services.

632
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:34,284
Being together with your family
is the most important.

633
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:40,785
At least I have to make an effort to salvage it.

634
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,886
Thank you.

635
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:51,548
I didn't do anything.

636
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:56,117
Although you have been chasing me for debts,

637
00:53:56,271 --> 00:54:00,033
but these days, my phone was really busy.

638
00:54:02,483 --> 00:54:05,562
Just when I lost the will to live.

639
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:09,710
It made me realized that I am still alive.

640
00:54:17,965 --> 00:54:19,431
This.

641
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:24,544
It was the letter then Chun Hee
who was aged 20 wrote to me.

642
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:29,475
Don't be dissuaded.
Don't be broken down.

643
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:33,565
Definitely don't blame it on life.

644
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:37,349
That is roughly the contents.

645
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:42,828
Nagged for about 3 pages.
I am having a little headache now.

646
00:54:47,172 --> 00:54:51,570
Here's a present for you.

647
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:56,936
As a goodbye gift.
Thank you for giving me comfort these days.

648
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,579
Please keep it.

649
00:55:20,105 --> 00:55:21,413
<i>Currently studying at Kyeoun Gil University,</i>

650
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,392
<i>after which he went to U.S. and caused a storm.</i>

651
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:26,937
<i>The youth representative player, Kim Jung Joo.</i>

652
00:55:27,051 --> 00:55:30,329
<i>He has been in the U.S. for three months
and has caught attentions.</i>

653
00:55:30,437 --> 00:55:31,603
<i>5 wins 0 losses.</i>

654
00:55:31,672 --> 00:55:34,626
<i>The average score is 2.08.</i>

655
00:55:34,685 --> 00:55:38,985
<i>In 45 matches, he has a record
of 48 outs. Power pitching.</i>

656
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:42,296
<i>Especially is that his fastest
throw record reaching 96 miles.</i>

657
00:55:42,336 --> 00:55:47,595
<i>This season's Pil An Ta only have
a 0.187, the record is shocking.</i>

658
00:55:51,733 --> 00:55:53,551
That fella is really not bad.

659
00:55:54,944 --> 00:55:56,840
<i>The blinds have arrived.</i>

660
00:55:57,294 --> 00:55:58,088
Okay.

661
00:55:59,688 --> 00:56:04,338
<i>The good news is that he has caught Coach Smiths
attention and is designated to replace older players.</i>

662
00:56:04,457 --> 00:56:05,751
<i>Now the news has not been finalized.</i>

663
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:12,206
<i>But the record of player Kim Jung Joo
in the team is of importance.</i>

664
00:56:55,655 --> 00:56:57,413
You are going to say sorry.

665
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:00,365
It's hard to say.

666
00:57:02,646 --> 00:57:04,783
I don't know how to say it.

667
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,391
I am fine already.

668
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:09,890
Sorry.

669
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:16,300
Have a seat for a while?

670
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:18,661
Okay.

671
00:57:33,752 --> 00:57:36,469
Did you read Seung Won's letter?

672
00:57:38,382 --> 00:57:39,439
Yes.

673
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:46,366
He says he wants to have a very
good relationship in his life.

674
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,302
After breaking up with Hyung Tae,
until a few days ago,

675
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:57,635
I am still complaining about my past.

676
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:02,029
I am living in extreme pain.

677
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:10,313
But, I wanted very much to erase
that segment of music from my life.

678
00:58:10,994 --> 00:58:13,227
The moment that I regret most.

679
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,158
That relationship that I didn't take to account of.

680
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:29,635
I didn't think that to Seung Won,
it will be the first and the last time.

681
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,088
I am regretting very much in my heart.

682
00:58:37,224 --> 00:58:38,670
Pitying.

683
00:58:40,587 --> 00:58:42,068
Hurting.

684
00:58:45,477 --> 00:58:50,580
Did I give Seung Won the love that he wanted?

685
00:58:52,052 --> 00:58:53,603
You too.

686
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:58,271
You have already given it
to him in your own style.

687
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:07,520
The tune that you put into the concert,
that was Seung Won's whistling.

688
00:59:09,081 --> 00:59:11,446
You are thinking of him so much...

689
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:15,674
The intention of comforting
the Seung Won that is gone.

690
00:59:17,923 --> 00:59:20,441
Seung Won will understand.

691
01:00:36,947 --> 01:00:40,040
In just another few more months,
this year would be gone.

692
01:00:40,376 --> 01:00:41,759
Yes.

693
01:00:43,012 --> 01:00:48,642
<i>Another day is passing by</i>

694
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:57,791
<i>Thought that youth was always forever</i>

695
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:03,515
<i>Inside my empty heart</i>

696
01:01:03,562 --> 01:01:07,866
<i>There is nothing left behind</i>

697
01:01:10,386 --> 01:01:16,525
<i>Even though the seasons will always return</i>

698
01:01:16,142 --> 01:01:22,802
<i>But where is the love that is so far from me</i>

699
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:30,026
<i>It was not me who let it go</i>

700
01:01:30,629 --> 01:01:36,729
<i>It was not me who left either</i>

701
01:01:36,795 --> 01:01:40,858
<i>Our wasted youth have come to an end.</i>

702
01:01:40,946 --> 01:01:43,928
<i>Around the time when
the wounds of our youth recovers,</i>

703
01:01:44,175 --> 01:01:49,459
<i>We would have already become
mature adults in this society.</i>

704
01:01:55,152 --> 01:01:57,689
<i>Even though living is hard</i>

705
01:01:57,815 --> 01:02:00,271
<i>Even if I fall in love</i>

706
01:02:00,365 --> 01:02:05,047
<i>{\a6}But someday a good day will come to me too</i>

707
01:02:03,828 --> 01:02:06,529
<i>Today's starting pitcher for the New York Yankees.</i>

708
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:07,557
<i>{\a6}This is the beginning</i>

709
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:08,248
<i>Is a rookie from Korea.</i>

710
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:11,685
<i>{\a6}The star of life is me</i>

711
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:10,814
<i>Kim Jung Joo.</i>

712
01:02:11,913 --> 01:02:17,552
<i>Don't forget, who you are</i>

713
01:02:28,598 --> 01:02:31,933
<i>It's okay, don't worry</i>

714
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:35,893
<i>It's suppose to be hard for everyone</i>

715
01:02:36,114 --> 01:02:39,586
<i>After one night's sleep</i>

716
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:43,183
<i>Everything will be fine again</i>

717
01:02:43,383 --> 01:02:46,933
<i>I don't know how to give up</i>

718
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,067
<i>I'm fine and strong</i>

719
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,794
<i>Always cheerful and happy</i>

720
01:02:55,078 --> 01:02:58,550
<i>{\a6}I will patiently endure it</i>

721
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:56,545
What're you doing?

722
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:59,439
I am admiring my guy.

723
01:02:58,613 --> 01:02:59,392
<i>{\a6}I believe</i>

724
01:02:59,497 --> 01:03:01,329
<i>Even though living is hard</i>

725
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,254
<i>Even if I fall in love</i>

726
01:03:03,296 --> 01:03:06,996
<i>I will never cry
or complain</i>

727
01:03:07,094 --> 01:03:08,893
<i>This is the beginning</i>

728
01:03:08,946 --> 01:03:12,112
<i>The star of life is me</i>

729
01:03:12,228 --> 01:03:14,153
<i>{\a6}I never don't cry</i>

730
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:16,671
That little fella made it to the major league stage.

731
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:16,376
<i>{\a6}Sad tears goodbye</i>

732
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,259
<i>{\a6}Hard worries goodbye</i>

733
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,101
Yes, he did it.

734
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:21,976
<i>{\a6}The beautiful day that I have
imagined last night, here I come</i>

735
01:03:19,506 --> 01:03:22,265
Really amazing.
Really proud of him.

736
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:24,217
<i>{\a6}Today is the beginning</i>

737
01:03:23,153 --> 01:03:25,700
Don't say it like you are praising your kid.

738
01:03:24,406 --> 01:03:27,541
<i>{\a6}I am going to do well</i>

739
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:28,015
Do you think my heart likes it?

740
01:03:28,407 --> 01:03:30,953
<i>{\a6}Smile again</i>

741
01:03:31,506 --> 01:03:34,285
If I didn't let him go, it will be terrible.

742
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:37,352
I will go crazy.

743
01:03:40,893 --> 01:03:42,127
I say, friend.

744
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:44,404
Yes, friend?

745
01:03:44,674 --> 01:03:47,028
Are you really going to discontinue writing?

746
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:52,975
Continue writing.
I will give you my full support.

747
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:56,756
With you encouragement and support,
I feel contented already.

748
01:03:58,493 --> 01:04:00,920
But it is too painful.

749
01:04:06,341 --> 01:04:07,653
Hyung Tae.

750
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,708
When everyone sings, usually there will be a melody.

751
01:04:12,634 --> 01:04:20,081
Mi... Ah... Ni... tears streaming.

752
01:04:20,892 --> 01:04:24,146
My Ms. Hong also has a lot of singing styles.

753
01:04:24,763 --> 01:04:29,991
My mom says when you have
experienced a lot, you'd be like this.

754
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,712
Soâ€¦

755
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:37,038
When my life has accumulated some definite items,

756
01:04:37,462 --> 01:04:39,951
then I will think of starting to write again.

757
01:04:40,337 --> 01:04:42,266
Although I don't have good style of writing,

758
01:04:42,614 --> 01:04:45,013
I want to use a tune to write something.

759
01:04:46,575 --> 01:04:48,755
Do you want me to change your life so that
it is surging forward with great momentum?

760
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:50,202
How?

761
01:04:56,486 --> 01:04:58,030
Let's get married.

762
01:04:59,014 --> 01:05:00,962
Let's date a little more.

763
01:05:01,155 --> 01:05:04,454
Someone is proposing to you,
how can you be so untouched?

764
01:05:04,724 --> 01:05:07,819
Being able to be with you is already something
so touching that I can't ask more.

765
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:12,083
The instant noodle commercial has been removed.

766
01:05:12,314 --> 01:05:14,475
Next time I will give you delicious instant noodles.

767
01:05:15,497 --> 01:05:17,023
Marry me.

768
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:18,605
Hey.

769
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:21,865
There is someone sending flowers to my office again.

770
01:05:26,727 --> 01:05:28,887
Proposal is really not easy.

771
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:32,051
I love you.

772
01:05:32,282 --> 01:05:33,401
Hey!

773
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:35,504
Let's date a little more.

774
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,798
Don't you think it's a waste?

775
01:05:38,011 --> 01:05:40,770
I am dating like this for the first time.

776
01:05:42,062 --> 01:05:43,528
That's right too.

777
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:48,427
I like to hold your hand.

778
01:05:48,832 --> 01:05:52,247
There is nothing in this world that
gives me greater comfort than this.

779
01:05:56,896 --> 01:05:58,363
Why?

780
01:05:59,018 --> 01:06:01,400
I want to look at you to my heart's content.

781
01:06:01,897 --> 01:06:04,521
Seeing you when I am asleep, secretly looking at you,
looking at you from the corner of my eye.

782
01:06:04,656 --> 01:06:06,624
Not to see you like that.

783
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:11,235
<i>We have each had grand and
spectacular love relationships.</i>

784
01:06:11,312 --> 01:06:15,402
<i>Keeping the bits of shadows of those, we continue on
and embark on a new love relationship.</i>

785
01:06:15,768 --> 01:06:19,617
<i>Even if the other party has others
in his heart other than me, I don't mind.</i>

786
01:06:19,945 --> 01:06:22,897
<i>I make a fuss over those.</i>

787
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:27,141
<i>Is it for the reason that he is Hyung Tae,
or is it due to me being more mature?</i>

788
01:06:27,276 --> 01:06:29,038
<i>I am not clear about it.</i>

789
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:32,221
<i>Even if the wound is a part of him,</i>

790
01:06:32,433 --> 01:06:36,870
<i>that included, I will love it all.</i>

791
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:39,475
Nan Hee,

792
01:06:39,822 --> 01:06:42,832
when you wish to write again,
you can do it anytime.

793
01:06:43,372 --> 01:06:45,128
Okay.

794
01:06:45,861 --> 01:06:46,864
Hyung Tae.

795
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,099
Yes?

796
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:52,175
When did we start to fall
in love with each other?

797
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:54,838
I don't know.
